1
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,988
One, two. Two, two.

2
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,375
<i># So please you, sir, we much regret</i>

3
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:06,920
<i># If we have failed in etiquette</i>

4
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,755
<i># Towards a man of rank so high</i>

5
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:10,924
<i># We shall know better by and by</i>

6
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,468
<i># But youth, of course, must have its fling</i>

7
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,803
<i># So pardon us, so pardon us</i>

8
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:17,639
<i># And don't in girlhood's happy spring</i>

9
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,058
<i># Be hard on us, be hard on us</i>

10
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,852
<i># If we're inclined to dance and sing</i>

11
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,437
<i># Tralalalala</i>

12
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:27,690
<i># But youth, of course, must have its fling</i>

13
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:28,942
<i># So pardon us</i>

14
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,903
<i># And don't in girlhood's happy spring</i>

15
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:33,279
<i># Be hard on us</i>

16
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:36,282
<i># But youth, of course, must have its fling</i>

17
00:01:36,532 --> 00:01:37,450
<i># So pardon us</i>

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,702
<i># Tralalala la la la</i>

19
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:42,038
<i># Tralalala la la</i>

20
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,374
<i># Tralalala la la</i>

21
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:46,751
<i># Tra lalalalalala</i>

22
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:52,173
<i># Tralalalalalala la!</i>

23
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:00,033
- Sir Arthur, what are you doing?
- Going to the theatre.

24
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,744
- No, it is not possible.
- I have no choice!

25
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:06,623
- You must get back...
- Louis!

26
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:13,630
<i>- Hot coffee, very strong, please.
- D'accord.</i>

27
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,188
- Louis! "Schnell", please!
- Don't move.

28
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,692
<i>Clothilde, encore du café. Vite.</i>

29
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:39,197
<i>Sir Arthur, la tasse, s'il vous plaît.</i>

30
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,700
<i>- Bonne chance, Sir Arthur.
- Merci.</i>

31
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,869
<i>Nicht so schnell.</i>

32
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,080
<i>Louis, ich muss das allein tun.</i>

33
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,084
I'll be fine. Now go and fetch the cab.

34
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:05,473
- Canton.
- Good evening, sir.

35
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:06,933
Arthur!

36
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,310
- Arthur, is this wise?
- No, it's foolish.

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,897
- Do you intend to go on?
- Yes, Helen. I've never missed one yet.

38
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:14,649
I'll let everybody know.

39
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:18,027
- Here, take a drink.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:20,029
Oh, that's better, Frank.

41
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,074
- Your gloves, sir.
- Very good, Louis.

42
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:26,995
This "is" a surprise, sir.

43
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:13,458
# As up we string the faithless king

44
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,501
# In the old familiar way

45
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:17,295
# We'll shout ha ha! Hip hip hurrah!

46
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:20,715
# Hip hip hip hip hurrah!

47
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,092
# As we make an end of her false papa!

48
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:26,638
# Hurrah! Hurrah!

49
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:29,766
- Permission, Mr Cook.
- Permission, Shrimp.

50
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:30,850
Come!

51
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,354
Five minutes, Mr Grossmith.

52
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,667
# If you give me your attention
I will tell you what I am

53
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,460
# I'm a genuine philanthropist

54
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,254
# All other kinds are sham

55
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,089
# Each little fault of temper

56
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,966
# And each social defect

57
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,634
# In my erring fellow creatures

58
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:06,427
# I endeavour to correct

59
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,263
# To all their little weaknesses

60
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:10,098
# I open people's eyes

61
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,309
# And little plans to snub
the self-sufficient I devise

62
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,311
# I love my fellow creatures

63
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,397
# I do all the good I can

64
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:20,566
# Yet everybody says
I'm such a disagreeable man

65
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:24,445
# And I can't think why

66
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:30,285
# I'm sure I'm no ascetic

67
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:32,203
# I'm as pleasant as can be

68
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:35,748
# You'll always find me ready
with a crushing repartee

69
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,460
# I've an irritating chuckle,
I've a celebrated sneer

70
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,878
# I've an entertaining snigger

71
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,006
# I've a fascinating leer

72
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:46,384
# To everybody's prejudice
I know a thing or two

73
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,846
# I can tell a woman's age
in half a minute - and I do

74
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:52,056
# But although I try to make myself

75
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,142
# As pleasant as I can

76
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,353
# Yet everybody says
I am a disagreeable man

77
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:59,439
# And I can't think why

78
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,483
# He can't think why

79
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:05,278
# I can't think

80
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,157
# Why

81
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:16,205
<i>- Monsieur.
- Bonsoir.</i>

82
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:20,168
<i>- Vous avez lá un succés certain.
- Merci.</i>

83
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:24,797
What do you expect me to do?
Kiss the carpenters?

84
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:31,679
Arthur!

85
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,641
Let's get him up.

86
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:37,143
Come on, sir.

87
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:39,312
Arthur, take some brandy.

88
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,481
What happened? What happened?!

89
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:45,360
Is Doctor Lynch in the house?

90
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,739
Listen to this! Today's "Times".

91
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:52,742
"'Princess Ida' will
probably run for a year...

92
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:56,746
...keeping the Savoy treasury
agreeably replete all the while."

93
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,706
"All London will flock to hear it."

94
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:02,460
"So will our provincial,
American and continental visitors."

95
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,339
"Copies of its words and music
will be sold by tens of thousands."

96
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:10,885
"Everybody connected with it will have
a good time for at least twelve months."

97
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:12,762
"So mote it be."

98
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,516
- How splendid, Willie!
- Sugared words, Lucy.

99
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,434
Listen.

100
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:23,356
"The opera is above the level of all
other entertainments before the public."

101
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:26,901
"Still, I cannot pronounce it
to be in any way...

102
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:29,404
...an improvement upon its predecessors."

103
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,407
"To me, words and music alike reveal...

104
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:37,203
...symptoms of fatigue in their
respective composer and author."

105
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:40,957
"Arthur Sullivan cannot write
other than in pleasing manner...

106
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:45,336
...but several numbers in 'Princess Ida'
lack the freshness and spontaneity...

107
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,298
...of 'The Pirates of Penzance',
'Patience, lolanthe'...

108
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:50,842
...or 'The Sorcerer', his best operatic work."

109
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:52,635
Oh! Is it?

110
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:55,555
"Or 'HMS Pinafore', the most popular."

111
00:08:55,805 --> 00:09:00,810
"WS Gilbert abundantly proves
he is still the legitimate monarch...

112
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,646
...of the realm of Topsy-Turvydom."

113
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:07,275
Thank you very much(!)

114
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:11,738
"But his incongruities are more
elaborately worked up than of yore...

115
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,616
...and therefore less funny."

116
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,828
"Moreover, the story is a dull one!"

117
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,997
- Burn it, Pidgeon!
- Sir.

118
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,166
Willie...!

119
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,462
Your kidneys are getting cold!

120
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:33,426
The show's doing splendidly.
Full houses and a healthy advance.

121
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,511
- Capital.
- Three tours on the road.

122
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:38,056
<i>Pirates, Patience and lolanthe.</i>

123
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,433
<i>- And four in rehearsal.
- Merveilleux.</i>

124
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:42,602
New York can't wait for "Ida".

125
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:45,188
Ah, New York. How splendid.

126
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,316
- Helen has us booked up to year's end.
- Tireless as ever.

127
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,235
All part of my day's work.

128
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,612
- Tea, Miss Lenoir?
- No, thank you, Louis.

129
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:55,240
Very well.

130
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,159
I hope your confinement
hasn't made you restless.

131
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,537
How have you been passing the time?

132
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,540
I've made some resolutions, Helen.

133
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:10,004
- A little late in the new year, perhaps.
- Better late than never.

134
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,425
May we know what they are, Arthur?

135
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,220
Why not?

136
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,389
One.

137
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,642
To travel to the Continent
as soon as my health permits.

138
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:24,769
- Very wise.
- I think so.

139
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,604
Two.

140
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:29,983
To look for a country house
where I may repair each summer...

141
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,277
...without having to cross the Channel.

142
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,030
- Three. To take more exercise.
- Excellent, Arthur. About time, too.

143
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,576
A leaf out of your book, D'Oyly.
I must walk more.

144
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,787
And is there a number four?

145
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:45,540
Yes.

146
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,044
To write no more operas for the Savoy.

147
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:56,801
- And what is number five?
- To fly to the moon in his bed socks!

148
00:10:57,051 --> 00:11:00,305
No, I'm serious.
I have to write a grand opera.

149
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:03,224
People expect it of me.
I must not disappoint them.

150
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:06,894
I cannot waste any more time
on these trivial soufflés.

151
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,773
Do you know I haven't written
a symphony for over 20 years?

152
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:14,694
Not an unprofitable 20 years,
if I may say so.

153
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,404
Arthur.

154
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:19,782
If you would learn to organise
your time more efficiently...

155
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,951
...you could do everything you wished.

156
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,289
My time is finite, Helen. I must fill it
with that which is important to me.

157
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,293
Is not the Savoy Theatre
important to you?

158
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:34,130
This work with Gilbert
is quite simply killing me.

159
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,842
Working with Gilbert would kill anybody.

160
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:42,013
Is your contract with D'Oyly
and Mr Gilbert not important to you?

161
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:44,682
But our present concern is your health.

162
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,226
You must go to the South of France
and recover.

163
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:50,855
We can discuss this on your return.

164
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:52,732
I shall recover, D'Oyly.

165
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:55,443
And I shall return.

166
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:59,656
But there will be nothing to discuss.

167
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,116
Did you dine at the Beefsteak Club?

168
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:05,495
Yes. Somewhat unsatisfactory.

169
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,664
Oh.

170
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:10,250
Well, you missed Mrs Judd's rabbit curry.

171
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,254
One gets the impression that everyone
is snickering behind one's back.

172
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:17,215
Perhaps you could have some
for tomorrow's lunch.

173
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:21,094
The king of Topsy-Turvydom.

174
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:24,973
Humiliating.

175
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:29,727
You look a little uncomfortable.

176
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm comfortable enough.

177
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,649
I watched a bit from the wings.

178
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,318
- Oh, did you?
- The first act.

179
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,696
Seemed to be going well, surprisingly.

180
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:43,575
There! You see?

181
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,707
Would you like me to read to you?

182
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:53,376
No, thank you. I'll leave you.

183
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,587
You must be tired.

184
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:57,714
No, I'm not in the slightest.

185
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,882
Wrong of me to unburden myself on you.

186
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:04,012
Don't be silly. That's why I'm here.

187
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:07,515
Come and talk to your Kitty.

188
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:12,270
Sometimes one wonders
why one bothers.

189
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:16,024
They say jump... you jump.

190
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:20,028
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

191
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:31,641
Lady Colin is endeavouring
to persuade us to take up smoking.

192
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,602
<i>She's writing an article for
The Saturday Review.</i>

193
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:37,605
She proposes that nicotine
is a gift from the gods...

194
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:40,817
...and if men may benefit
from its soothing qualities...

195
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,070
...why, then, may women not also?

196
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,406
My poor daughter now believes that...

197
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:50,577
...smoking is an extension
of the communion...

198
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,787
...between a woman and her husband.

199
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:56,457
- Will she smoke on her wedding day?

200
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,585
Heaven forfend!

201
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,504
Lady Colin is... irresistible.

202
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,507
She cannot conceive
why the Irish are starving...

203
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:08,386
...when there's
"lots of good fish in the sea".

204
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,555
She most probably has a point.

205
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,099
- Oh, there's good news from Dublin.
- Mmm?

206
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,144
The Churchills "are" to return to London.

207
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,313
Forgiven, but not forgotten.

208
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:22,191
I do hope so.

209
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,653
Jenny says Winston is 11,
covered in freckles...

210
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:30,074
...and has a total disdain for authority.

211
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,248
Mmm.

212
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,667
I shall miss this fragrance.

213
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:43,254
Sicilian lemons.

214
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:48,468
Have you chosen your Beethoven
for the Philharmonic Society?

215
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,345
As a matter of fact, I have.

216
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,930
Yes.

217
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,224
- No.2?
- The Seventh.

218
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:58,519
- Ah.
- More dramatic.

219
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,440
And that is to be your work
whilst you're away?

220
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,403
That... and only that.

221
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:11,074
Will there be room for Mr Gilbert
in your baggage?

222
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,160
Certainly not. He's far too large.

223
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,955
Food for thought.

224
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:20,166
<i>Ce n'est pas á moi de dire.</i>

225
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,127
Indeed not.

226
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:26,130
Which train will you catch?

227
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:30,009
The tidal train.

228
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,303
Up at seven.

229
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,682
<i>Arriver á Paris á 3:30?</i>

230
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:38,351
<i>Á peu prés.</i>

231
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,230
How will you spend
your first night of liberty?

232
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
I shall take some exercise.

233
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,569
Hmm!

234
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,171
<i>La poupée de Paris, alors!</i>

235
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,840
<i># Les oiseaux</i>

236
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:16,264
<i># Dans la charmille</i>

237
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,275
<i>C'est émouvant!</i>

238
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,402
Whoo!

239
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:38,912
<i>Allez, battez!</i>

240
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,631
<i>C'est mes cuisses!</i>

241
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,635
<i>Plus de cuisses!</i>

242
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:02,143
Whoo!

243
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:08,608
<i>Comment vous appelez-vous?</i>

244
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:12,654
<i>Voilá Mademoiselle Fromage, monsieur.</i>

245
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,656
<i>Oui, c'est vrai.</i>

246
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,451
<i>Quelle sorte de fromage?</i>

247
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,036
<i>Peut-ìtre un fromage suisse?</i>

248
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:21,287
<i>Oui, oui!</i>

249
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:24,249
<i>Avec des petits trous?</i>

250
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:27,961
<i>Si je peux vous embrasser...</i>

251
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:31,047
<i>Et vous aussi.</i>

252
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,763
# This helmet I suppose

253
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,432
# Was meant to ward off blows

254
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,727
# It's very hot and weighs a lot

255
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,771
# As many a guardsman knows

256
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,983
# As many a guardsman knows

257
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,986
# As many a guardsman knows

258
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,238
# As many a guardsman knows

259
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,408
# So off

260
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:01,578
# So off that helmet goes

261
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,997
# Yes, yes, yes!

262
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:07,292
# So off that helmet goes

263
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,877
# This tight-fitting cuirass

264
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,088
# Is but a useless mass

265
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:15,383
# It's made of steel and weighs a deal

266
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,594
# This tight-fitting cuirass

267
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,430
# Is but a useless mass

268
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,017
# A man is but an ass

269
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,644
# Who fights in a cuirass

270
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:29,689
# So off

271
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,108
# So off goes that cuirass

272
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,528
# Yes, yes, yes

273
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:38,489
# So off goes that cuirass

274
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,992
# Behold!

275
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:45,663
My voice.
My voice - I've strained my voice.

276
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:47,832
I've been trying too hard.

277
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:50,627
The smaller the house,
the greater the effort.

278
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:53,755
I'm very cross with myself.
I should know better.

279
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:57,759
One's knocking one's pipes out
in a vain attempt to elicit a response...

280
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,639
...from three colonial bishops, two elderly
ladies and an intoxicated costermonger!

281
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,017
They're roasting in their own lard,
like the Christmas goose.

282
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,436
And the costermonger left at the interval.

283
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,271
- Did he?
- Mm.

284
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,316
Ha! A man of infinite taste. Clearly!

285
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,735
Will you take a wee gargle
of my salt water?

286
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,863
No, thank you.
It would put me in mind of my boyhood.

287
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:20,823
Mm. Do forgive me.

288
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:24,702
Not at all.

289
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:27,956
I fear that dear Mr Gilbert
has run out of ideas.

290
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,667
- No.
- He doesn't know what to do with me!

291
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,210
Ponder this.

292
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,004
He thrusts me into
tight-fitting pots and pails...

293
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,257
...and poaches me
like a fucking haddock!

294
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:39,926
Forgive my Anglo-Saxon, Mr Butt.
Have a biscuit.

295
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:43,179
Thank you, sir.
I'll take one 'ome with me for me supper.

296
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,348
Dickie, it's just this heat.

297
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:48,685
It addles the noodles.
It happened to me in Milan frequently.

298
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,729
<i>Ah, Milano. Bellissimo.</i>

299
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,608
The heat less hellish.

300
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,238
I am humiliated.

301
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,407
One might as well be in the chorus.

302
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:05,285
Away wi' you, you wee monkey!

303
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:07,161
Alas, no!

304
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:11,791
The reign of the Emperor Gilbert
is all but at an end.

305
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,836
I consider this to be his best piece so far.

306
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:18,548
With all due respect, Durward,
your romantic opinion may be informed...

307
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,927
...by the fact that you take a rather good
role, in which you are "trés splendide".

308
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:26,139
<i>- Mm, grazie.
- Prego.</i>

309
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,975
But I consider "Princess Ida"
to be their worst.

310
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,977
- Do you?
- I do.

311
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,980
Where is the panache of "Pirates"?

312
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,190
The wit of the "Pinafore"?

313
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:39,402
From such a face and form as mine...

314
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:42,530
...the noblest sentiments...

315
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,908
...sound like the black utterances...

316
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:47,452
...of a depraved imagination.

317
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,329
It was very good, you know.

318
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,081
- Yes, Dickie.
- Do forgive me, dear boy.

319
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,667
I don't wish to be the prophet of doom.

320
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:56,836
But one has the distinct feeling...

321
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:03,217
...that the sword of Damocles hovers
ominously over the Savoy Theatre.

322
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,848
How was Temple?

323
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,976
Oh. Rather disgruntled, I fear.

324
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:14,938
As though he wasn't
quite enjoying himself.

325
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,148
His heart wasn't in it.

326
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,568
No. One can usually rely
on Mr Temple, can't one?

327
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:23,863
Mmm.

328
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:28,409
And the ladies' chorus look as though
they could all do with a hearty meal.

329
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,495
It's this infernal heat.

330
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:35,375
One still has to feed oneself, Willie,
whatever the weather.

331
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,794
And the audience
were fanning themselves...

332
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:40,004
...with their programmes and libretti.

333
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,217
Most distracting when one is striving
to concentrate on the performance...

334
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:48,137
...to have in the corner of one's eye
this confounded flapping!

335
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,556
Makes one want to stand up and shout!

336
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,977
- I trust you restrained yourself.
- Of course I did, Willie.

337
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:56,479
- More tea, ma'am?
- No, thank you, Pidgeon.

338
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:58,314
- Coffee, sir?
- Yes.

339
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:01,526
Pidgeon. Did my father say anything else?

340
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:05,196
Nothing I should care to repeat, sir.

341
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:08,408
There were more people
on the stage than in the audience.

342
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:11,244
Did you count them?

343
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:15,415
- No, of course I didn't.
- Then how do you know?

344
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,584
I was speaking metaphorically.

345
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,752
You were exaggerating.

346
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,922
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

347
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:26,384
Oh, horror!

348
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,136
Horror!

349
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:31,556
Horror!

350
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:35,435
Willie.

351
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,022
- Come in.

352
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:42,358
- Good morning, my dear.
- Good morning, Richard.

353
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,778
- Another scorcher.
- The everlasting bonfire.

354
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:50,325
- Good morning, guv'nor.
- Morning, Barker.

355
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,995
Thank you.

356
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:57,123
- Shocking.
- Most alarming.

357
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,834
A mediocre evening.

358
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,003
- Three fainters.
- In the audience?

359
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,172
I fear so. All women.

360
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:06,758
- Any absentees?
- Four chorus members.

361
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:11,220
- With doctors' notes?
- Yes.

362
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:14,933
And... how are the returns?

363
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:20,688
- Oh, good grief!
- It's an improvement on Monday.

364
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:25,902
Seven dead horses
in the Strand this morning...

365
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,279
Well, one down by Trafalgar Square.

366
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,199
How can you sit there
in your hat and coat, Barker?

367
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:34,077
I'm too hot to remove them, Mr Carte.

368
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:37,163
- This is developing into a crisis.
- Indeed it is.

369
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:41,376
- A man has a family to support.
- I fear we shall all have to "pray" for rain.

370
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:44,754
If it's any consolation,
every theatre in town is afflicted.

371
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:47,048
Even the Gaiety, graced as it is with...

372
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:51,052
...Madame Bernhardt's
execrable Lady Macbeth. 38 per cent.

373
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:53,805
- Who told you that, Barker?
- Hollingshead.

374
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:57,475
I played a game of cricket
with him this morning at Coram's Fields.

375
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:01,104
- In this heat?
- Er, yes, madam, but not in this attire.

376
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:02,313
Good.

377
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:05,233
- Mr Hollingshead told you a fib, Barker.
- Indeed?

378
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:08,278
He's only playing to 29 per cent.

379
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:11,948
Mr Hollingshead has no need
to lie to "me", Mr Carte.

380
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:15,785
Mr Hollingshead has much need
to lie to everybody, Mr Barker.

381
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:20,164
- Especially you.
- Gentlemen...!

382
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:29,173
Are you there?

383
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,384
Yes.

384
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:35,263
8505.

385
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,981
Hello!

386
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:47,900
- Is that you, Mr Gilbert?
- Hello!

387
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:51,070
- Hello?
- Good morning, Barker.

388
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,907
This is Barker speaking!

389
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:56,409
<i>- Gilbert here!
- Good morning, Mr Gilbert.</i>

390
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:59,245
How are we today, Barker?

391
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:03,416
Are we popular, or are we mad?

392
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,586
Er... We are popular!

393
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,254
<i>Very good. Carry on.</i>

394
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:12,759
Here is your message for today!

395
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,721
U, U, plus ten shillings and sixpence!

396
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,557
- Can you repeat that, please?!
- Yes.

397
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:21,726
U... U!

398
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,978
So that's U for udder...

399
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:27,398
...U for udder,
plus ten shillings and sixpence.

400
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,318
So you have two udders, Barker!

401
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:34,405
- Er... yes.
- I always suspected as much!

402
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,827
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you!</i>

403
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,081
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Mr Gilbert!

404
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,708
I'm going to hang up the telephone now!

405
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,587
In... Indeed you are, sir.

406
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:02,558
Well, I'm, er... going out to seek
a little Italian hokey-pokey...

407
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:06,562
...and I care not who knows it.
- Thank you, Barker.

408
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:10,358
I shall not return with any for you, sir,
because it would melt.

409
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:14,028
<i>Au revoir.</i>

410
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:19,242
I owe you an apology, Kitty.
I fear you weren't exaggerating after all.

411
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,995
Apology accepted. Thank you, Willie.

412
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:26,874
Schwenck speaks to the Savoy
every morning in code, Father- in-law...

413
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:30,753
...just in case the telephone operator
should be eavesdropping.

414
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:34,299
One might as well open the window
and shout down the street.

415
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,553
- That will be more comfortable for you.
- Sheer waste of time.

416
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:42,765
It will only result in the further erosion
of the written word.

417
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:44,934
Would you care to sit down now?

418
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:49,355
Er... er... thank you.

419
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:54,569
- Ah, there you are, Pidgeon.
- Ma'am.

420
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,532
I do apologise, sir,
that neither I nor Schwenck was here...

421
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:02,410
...to welcome you
on your arrival last night.

422
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,539
I do not appreciate being left
upon the doorstep like a hawker.

423
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,127
If you'll only press the electric bell,
Father, you'll be admitted at once.

424
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:13,880
- Is that not so, Pidgeon?
- Indeed it is, sir.

425
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:19,052
I have no intention
of placing my life in danger, sir!

426
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:22,138
How many doorstep deaths
have we had thus far, Pidgeon?

427
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,432
Er, none to my certain knowledge, sir.

428
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:27,644
There you are, Father.
The odds appear to be in your favour.

429
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:29,812
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

430
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:32,774
Would you tell Mrs Judd
Dr Gilbert will join us for lunch?

431
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:34,400
Certainly, ma'am.

432
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,780
You know, Father-in-law,
that you are most welcome in our home...

433
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,531
...at any time.

434
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:44,994
But, please, do try to inform us
of your intention to visit.

435
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:48,206
A father should not have
to seek permission...

436
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:50,333
...to visit his own son!

437
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,670
The son shouldn't be expected
to be clairvoyant!

438
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,590
Who does he think I am? Harlequin?

439
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,135
Would you excuse me?

440
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:06,432
I take it that you will be joining
us for lunch, Father-in-law?

441
00:29:06,683 --> 00:29:11,938
I-I have no idea where
I shall be taking luncheon...

442
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:14,816
...thank you.

443
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:19,237
Well, perhaps Schwenck
can persuade you.

444
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:23,324
Take lunch with us, Father.

445
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:27,203
We shall enjoy your company.

446
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,500
Am I to understand, sir...

447
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,712
...that you have been
in communication with your mother?

448
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:39,591
No, Father, not for some
considerable time, I'm glad to say.

449
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,343
You are a liar, sir.

450
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,053
No, sir!

451
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:46,598
I can assure you, Papa,
that the last person...

452
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,309
...with whom I wish
to have any communication...

453
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,477
...is your estranged wife!

454
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:54,689
The vicious woman who bore me
into this ridiculous world!

455
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:58,276
How dare you, sir! Have you no respect?

456
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,403
Don't misunderstand me, Father.

457
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:03,448
Nobody respects her more than I do,
and I can't stand her.

458
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:05,450
She is a veritable gorgon!

459
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,245
She is indeed!
And she has chosen her own path.

460
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:12,624
And in so doing, she has turned
her back on yourself and myself.

461
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:18,463
And for that small mercy,
we should both of us be eternally grateful.

462
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:28,514
Those terrors...

463
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:32,727
...that visit me in the night.

464
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,896
They can never be vanquished.

465
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:38,358
Ah! Insomnia. I suffer from it myself.

466
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,526
But it is she who sends them.

467
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:43,446
I know it is she!

468
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:46,699
I know not what heathen oracle
she consults...

469
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,329
...what filthy familiar she employs.

470
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:56,751
I know that... they will come.

471
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,546
Wh... Wh... What are these walls?

472
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,556
£5,000?

473
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:55,310
The last ten shares. Worth every penny.

474
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,395
Trust me, Arthur.

475
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,940
I do, D'Oyly.

476
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,861
- What's this?
- Pull it.

477
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,993
It's a reservoir pen. It contains its own ink.

478
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:15,413
Good gracious me!
Whatever will they think of next?

479
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:18,541
Try it.

480
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:28,801
Now, how long is all this going to take?

481
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:30,970
Two years.

482
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,848
I shall begin the foundations next month.

483
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:37,268
Thank you.

484
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:40,021
To the Savoy Hotel.

485
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:43,483
The Savoy Hotel.

486
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:46,778
With its 70 bathrooms.

487
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:49,113
The builder was much bemused.

488
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:52,450
"What's the point of 'aving a bathroom
to every bedroom?"

489
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,953
"Who's gonna be staying there?
Amphibians?"

490
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:58,915
D'Oyly, I can't tell you how delightful
it is to see you here in Paris.

491
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:02,710
- You're looking much better.
- A new man!

492
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:06,214
Monte Carlo was most profitable.

493
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:10,510
Florence was hideously hot.
I sampled the chartreuse at Certosa.

494
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,638
The monks were uncommonly charming.

495
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:18,768
The train journey through
the St Gotthard Pass is spectacular.

496
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,562
You must go. And Lucerne...

497
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,481
Tranquillity itself.

498
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,650
I walked until I dropped.

499
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,029
Did you receive my letter?

500
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,573
Yes, I did.

501
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,367
Good.

502
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,203
And?

503
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:40,957
It came to Brussels.

504
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,293
I "sent" it to Brussels, Arthur.

505
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:47,171
Yes, of course.

506
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,466
<i>Nous sommes prìts.</i>

507
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,313
<i>Vouz avez tué ce pigeon vous-mìme?</i>

508
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:07,358
<i>Non, monsieur.
Je laisse au bourreau le soin de le faire.</i>

509
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:10,653
<i>C'est mieux comme ça.</i>

510
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:18,328
So, what is your position?

511
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,124
Much the same, I'm afraid.

512
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:26,461
I fully realise, D'Oyly,
that you have me under contract.

513
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:32,508
But I cannot write
any more operas for the Savoy.

514
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:37,555
At least, not of that particular character.

515
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:41,684
I think you should tell Gilbert.

516
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:46,147
I shall. The moment I return.

517
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,148
<i>Messieurs...</i>

518
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:48,483
<i>... je vous souhaite bon appétit.</i>

519
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:52,362
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

520
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,493
# The reason is not far to find

521
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,578
# When we are near

522
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:05,875
# For though they say that love is blind

523
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,502
# Ah, never fear

524
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,462
# Ah, ah, ah

525
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:12,423
# We see our destinies entwined

526
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,801
# In noonday clear

527
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:20,515
# And love is over all

528
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,518
# When shadows fall

529
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,605
# And thou art

530
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:31,985
# Here

531
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:53,464
<i>- Il est bien, Clothilde.
- "Oui, madame." You are a tonic for him.</i>

532
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:55,633
"Merci." Cherish him.

533
00:35:55,883 --> 00:35:58,886
Of course, "madame".

534
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,639
Oh! Mrs Ronalds.
What an unexpected pleasure.

535
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:03,808
- Mr Gilbert, how are you?
- How are you?

536
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:05,727
- Quite well.
- I'm so pleased.

537
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:08,938
- He's in excellent spirits.
- I look forward to his tales.

538
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,940
- Good day.
- Good day to you.

539
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,109
<i>- Au revoir.
- Madame.</i>

540
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,445
<i>- Ça va, Clothilde?
- Ça va, monsieur?</i>

541
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,488
- It is hot, no?
- Yes.

542
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:19,532
- He awaits.
- Thank you.

543
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:21,701
How was your crossing, Sullivan?

544
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:23,870
Mercifully smooth, thank you.

545
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,749
As smooth as D'Oyly Carte?

546
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,793
No, not quite, Gilbert!

547
00:36:31,044 --> 00:36:32,962
- Lump sugar?
- Thank you, no.

548
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:36,466
Oh, please do. I found it in Lucerne.
It's delicious.

549
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:40,345
If you insist.

550
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:45,725
- Mmm! Very good.
- Good.

551
00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:51,022
- Is Lucy well?
- Oh, she's in fine fettle.

552
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:54,192
She sends you her love
and trusts you are in good health.

553
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:56,402
Thank you. Please reciprocate.

554
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:58,571
Oh, of course.

555
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:00,949
Now, what's this Carte's been telling me?

556
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,825
Oh, dear.

557
00:37:03,076 --> 00:37:05,495
- You can't be serious.
- I'm afraid I am.

558
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:10,124
So you've torn up our contract into tiny
pieces and cast it to the four winds?

559
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:14,003
- Don't be absurd!
- That would be the implication.

560
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:16,172
I hardly think so.

561
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,384
What else is one to deduce?

562
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:21,552
Oh, Gilbert.

563
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,222
There's so much that I have
yet to do for music...

564
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:26,349
...for my queen, for my country.

565
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,687
Even if God were to grant me two days
for every one I have left on this earth...

566
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:33,648
...I still should not be able
to achieve everything.

567
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:37,151
Come, come, Sullivan, you're a genius.

568
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,487
I merely bask in your reflected glory.

569
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:41,573
Oh, Gilbert, please.

570
00:37:41,823 --> 00:37:47,662
But I'm somewhat at a loss. What is
the precise nature of your dilemma?

571
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:51,291
How shall I put this?

572
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:57,213
My tunes, my orchestrations,
are becoming repetitious.

573
00:37:57,463 --> 00:38:01,217
I've rung all the changes possible
in the way of variety of rhythm.

574
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,469
I have such respect for your words...

575
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,266
...that I have continually kept down
my music in order that they can be heard.

576
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:10,435
It's no more than word-setting.

577
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:13,896
Sullivan, I have always
subordinated my words to your music.

578
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:15,982
Oh, I think not.

579
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:19,110
You've often expatiated
on the thorough good feeling...

580
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,322
...with which we've worked together.
- Unquestionably.

581
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:27,035
But I want a chance for my music
to act in its own proper sphere.

582
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:29,746
It does. It always has and it always will.

583
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:34,459
It must be allowed to intensify the
emotional depth not only of your words...

584
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:39,923
...but of the situation, which can
be humorous, dramatic... What you will.

585
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:42,133
Of course. It goes without saying.

586
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,469
You teach me the ABC of my profession.

587
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,723
Now. Would you care for me
to read this to you or not?

588
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:52,894
- Where is it set?
- In the Sicilian mountains.

589
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:57,398
Plenty of scope there for Gypsy music,
one might suggest.

590
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:01,653
Now, the local alchemist
is killed in an explosion...

591
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:06,032
...and there, amongst his effects,
a chorus of villagers discover a potion.

592
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:07,867
- Magic, no doubt.
- Indeed.

593
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,786
I thought as much.

594
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:14,165
The effect of this magic potion is
to transform the character who takes it...

595
00:39:14,415 --> 00:39:17,502
...into whatever he or she
is pretending to be.

596
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:20,922
- You and your world of Topsy-Turvydom!

597
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,091
In 1881, it was a magic coin.

598
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,718
And before that, it was a magic lozenge.

599
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:31,349
And in 1877, it was an elixir.

600
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,269
In this instance, it is a magic potion.

601
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,437
"Act One. Scene:

602
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:39,315
...a mountain inn
on a picturesque Sicilian pass."

603
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:43,903
"A range of mountains
with Etna in the distance."

604
00:39:56,874 --> 00:40:00,169
- I've made you some beef tea, Mr Gilbert.
- Take it away.

605
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,381
You've not had anything
since yesterday afternoon, sir.

606
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:06,759
- Take it away.
- You can't work on an empty stomach.

607
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,430
Can't work at all, Mrs Judd,
if I'm being constantly pestered...

608
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,934
...by interfering women with hot beef tea,
cold compresses, mustard poultices...

609
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:17,687
...and excessive attacks
of philanthropic zeal.

610
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:21,107
- How's my wounded soldier?
- He's not doing as he's told, madam.

611
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,276
Oh, isn't he now?

612
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:27,363
Willie, are you intending
to visit the dentist tomorrow?

613
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:31,117
- You really...
- Oh, for God's sake! You pair of harpies!

614
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:35,496
Get out! I'm working!

615
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:49,802
- Willie.
- Madam...

616
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:54,015
I had rather spend an afternoon
in a Turkish bath with my mother...

617
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:57,977
...than visit the dratted dentist.

618
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:02,482
Very well.

619
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:06,361
Good night!

620
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,001
- She's being just a little bit tricky.

621
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:26,256
She's coming.

622
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,509
Well done, Mr Gilbert!

623
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:31,511
Rinse.

624
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:35,056
She's a beauty.

625
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,935
- Open wide.
- Wh... What?

626
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:43,856
- Bite... really hard.

627
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:48,027
I must say, my wife and I
did find "Princess Ida"...

628
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:50,697
...rather too long, don't you know.

629
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:55,285
Try not to speak, old chap.

630
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:23,206
I do hope you've enjoyed your evening...

631
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:29,963
...but before we say farewell,
may I suggest an impromptu?

632
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:33,049
Mr Walter Simmonds
has generously offered...

633
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,928
...to accompany me on the harmonium!

634
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:45,270
Now, we have another very young
hopeful with us this evening...

635
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,277
...who has kindly agreed to accompany us
with a new composition of his own.

636
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:56,155
<i>The Lost Chord!</i>

637
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,373
Sir Arthur informed me
a few moments ago...

638
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:08,960
...that he cannot entirely
recall his new piece.

639
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,673
<i>- Merci, madame.</i>

640
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:51,294
# Seated one day at the organ

641
00:44:51,544 --> 00:44:56,716
# I was weary and ill at ease

642
00:44:56,966 --> 00:45:02,597
# And my fingers wandered idly

643
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,143
# Over the noisy keys

644
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:12,357
# I know not what I was playing

645
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:17,570
# Or what I was dreaming then

646
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,533
# But I struck one chord of music

647
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:28,539
# Like the sound of a great amen

648
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:32,043
# Like the sound

649
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:42,929
# Of a great amen

650
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,563
It's ridiculous.

651
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,275
It is. I sent him the thing
on Monday of last week.

652
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:58,987
He could have read it on the same day.
At the very least on Tuesday.

653
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:01,489
Now ten days have passed
and not a word.

654
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:04,492
- This concerns me greatly.
- It concerns "me" greatly.

655
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:08,371
- You'll have to go and see him.
- I'll be buggered if I do any such thing!

656
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:11,082
I present the man with my idea,
he rejects it...

657
00:46:11,332 --> 00:46:15,336
...I respond in detail to his misgivings
but answer came there none.

658
00:46:15,587 --> 00:46:19,007
Either he hasn't read it,
or he has read it and he doesn't like it.

659
00:46:19,257 --> 00:46:22,719
If he doesn't, he should say so.
At least we shall know where we stand.

660
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:25,888
- Go and see him.
- No, Carte! You go and see him.

661
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:29,767
I've no more shots in my locker.

662
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,061
Sullivan & Gilbert! Who are they?

663
00:46:32,312 --> 00:46:34,564
At least we're going to
revive "The Sorcerer".

664
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:36,524
Only as a stopgap.

665
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:39,736
- It's breathing space.
- It won't run more than three months.

666
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:42,447
Your unbounded optimism
is inspiring, Carte.

667
00:46:42,697 --> 00:46:46,993
I have great confidence in "The Sorcerer",
but I'm not in the business of revivals.

668
00:46:47,243 --> 00:46:51,122
You are now. Since you've decided
to withdraw the ailing "Princess Ida"...

669
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,666
...in spite of the cooler weather.

670
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:19,943
# Sprites of earth and air

671
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:23,529
# Fiends of flame and fire

672
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,950
# Demon souls come here in shoals

673
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,870
# This fearful deed inspire

674
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,249
# Appear! Appear!

675
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:37,752
# Appear!

676
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:48,429
# Good master, we are here!

677
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:54,769
# Noisome hags of night

678
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,106
# Imps of deadly shade

679
00:47:58,356 --> 00:48:00,024
# Pallid ghosts

680
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:01,776
# Arise in hosts

681
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:04,946
# And lend me all your aid

682
00:48:05,196 --> 00:48:06,823
# Appear!

683
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:08,866
# Appear!

684
00:48:09,117 --> 00:48:12,203
# Appear!

685
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:22,255
# Good master, we are here!

686
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:25,592
# Hark, hark, they assemble

687
00:48:25,842 --> 00:48:27,802
# These fiends of the night

688
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:30,054
# Oh, Alexis, I tremble

689
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:32,473
# Seek safety in flight!

690
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:34,892
# Let us fly to a far-off land

691
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:36,936
# Where peace and plenty dwell

692
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:39,188
# Where the sigh of the silver strand

693
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,441
# Is echoed in every shell

694
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,943
# To the joys that land will give

695
00:48:44,193 --> 00:48:45,904
# On the wings of Love we'll fly

696
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:49,657
# In innocence there to live

697
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:54,037
# In innocence there to die

698
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:57,957
# In innocence there to live

699
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:02,670
# There to die

700
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:05,465
# To live and die

701
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,926
# Too late, too late

702
00:49:08,176 --> 00:49:10,011
# Too late, too late

703
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:12,096
# That may not be!

704
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:15,391
# It may not be

705
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:17,018
# That happy fate

706
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:19,520
# Is not for thee

707
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:21,230
# That happy fate

708
00:49:21,481 --> 00:49:27,445
# Is not for thee

709
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:32,033
# Now, shrivelled hags with poison bags

710
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:35,745
# Discharge your loathsome loads

711
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:39,082
# Spit flame and fire, unholy choir

712
00:49:39,332 --> 00:49:42,502
# Belch forth your venom, toads

713
00:49:42,752 --> 00:49:46,381
# Ye demons fell with yelp and yell

714
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:49,467
# Shed curses far afield

715
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:53,763
# Ye fiends of night, your filthy blight

716
00:49:54,013 --> 00:49:58,768
# In noisome plenty yield

717
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:01,562
Number one!

718
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:04,524
# It is done!

719
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:07,694
Number two.

720
00:50:07,944 --> 00:50:09,988
# One too few!

721
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:14,242
Number three!

722
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,955
# Set us free! Set us free!
Our work is done

723
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:20,373
# Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

724
00:50:20,623 --> 00:50:25,503
# Ha ha ha haa!

725
00:50:26,379 --> 00:50:28,923
# Let us fly to a far-off land

726
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:30,758
# Where peace and plenty dwell

727
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,719
# Too late, too late

728
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:36,764
# Let us fly where the silver strand
is echoed in every shell

729
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:38,933
# Too late, too late

730
00:50:39,183 --> 00:50:40,560
# Let us fly! Let us fly!

731
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,478
# That happy fate

732
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:48,568
# Let us fly! Let us fly!

733
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:58,453
- How many today, Jessie?
- Only nine, alas!

734
00:50:58,703 --> 00:51:01,581
"Oh, alas!"

735
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:04,834
I have received none today.

736
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:07,086
I'm utterly neglected.

737
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:09,255
Have these, you poor soul!

738
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:13,843
I don't want your scraps, Jessie Bond.

739
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:17,221
Too vigorous, Emily. Apply the bandage.

740
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:21,142
Beg your pardon, Miss Bond.

741
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:25,813
- Shall I ever find anybody again?
- Don't be so gloomy, Leonora.

742
00:51:26,064 --> 00:51:31,110
Sadly, I seem to appeal
only to elderly gentlemen.

743
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:34,322
<i>Where are my young bucks and blades?
Quel dommage!</i>

744
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:36,699
I've told you what you must do.

745
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,662
The last thing a girl wants
after an evening's performance...

746
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:44,415
...is to have to go and sing
all night for London society.

747
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:47,752
Idle ladies and their odious husbands.

748
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,754
One has to sing for one's supper.

749
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:52,298
It's damned exhausting. I detest it.

750
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:54,467
Anyway, they're not all married.

751
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:57,095
And some of them
are rather cute and courteous.

752
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:59,555
You have them dangling
on a leash, Jessie.

753
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:04,352
One must keep oneself amused,
don't you know?

754
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:09,524
So terribly trying.

755
00:52:09,774 --> 00:52:12,652
When I meet a gentleman,
he invites me to supper.

756
00:52:12,902 --> 00:52:15,530
I mention my little... secret...

757
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,740
...and then he's off, quick smart.

758
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:19,909
<i>C'est impossible!</i>

759
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,953
You shouldn't reveal your secret...

760
00:52:22,203 --> 00:52:24,914
...until he's fallen in love
with you and has proposed!

761
00:52:25,164 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh, Jessie, for goodness' sake!

762
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,044
By the by, "monsieur",
you do realise I have a little boy?

763
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:34,257
I couldn't possibly pretend
that Stanton doesn't exist. No.

764
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:36,884
No, he's my precious little bundle.

765
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:39,679
- How's his toothache?
- Earache.

766
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,015
He suffers terribly, poor mite.

767
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:46,352
- Shall I lace you up now, Miss Bond?
- Of course, Emily.

768
00:52:46,603 --> 00:52:49,188
Surely your Mr Barnes would be willing?

769
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:52,317
Mr Baker. Jessie, please!

770
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:55,820
I do not intend
to become a widow again before I'm 50.

771
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,824
No. Neither do I.

772
00:52:59,866 --> 00:53:04,287
# No doubt, yet spite of all your pains

773
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:08,041
# The interesting fact remains

774
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,834
- Come in.

775
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:12,962
#... a little boy

776
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:18,176
# He was a little boy

777
00:53:18,426 --> 00:53:19,928
Five minutes, Miss Braham.

778
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:23,973
- Thank you, Shrimp.
- Pleasure, miss.

779
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:32,732
# But soft, they waken one by one

780
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:34,567
# The spell has worked

781
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:37,111
# The deed is done

782
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:41,324
# I would suggest that we retire

783
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:44,535
# While Love, the housemaid

784
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:49,249
# Lights her kitchen fire

785
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:52,585
# While Love, the housemaid

786
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:58,549
# Lights her kitchen fire

787
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:16,985
# Why

788
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:18,403
# Where be oi

789
00:54:18,653 --> 00:54:21,489
# And what be oi a-doin'

790
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:24,909
# A-sleepin' out just when

791
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:28,413
# The dew do rise?

792
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:34,127
# Why, that's the very way
your 'ealth to ruin

793
00:54:34,377 --> 00:54:40,508
# And don't seem
quite respectable likewise

794
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:43,219
# 'Ey, that's you

795
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:45,805
# Only think of that now

796
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:49,601
# What may you be at now?

797
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:53,479
# Tell me do

798
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:59,736
# 'Ey, what a nose

799
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,280
# And oh, what eyes, miss

800
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,199
# Lips like a rose

801
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,660
# And cheeks likewise, miss

802
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:10,163
# Oi'll tell you true

803
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:13,041
# Which I never done, sir

804
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:15,543
# Oi like you

805
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:20,173
# As oi never liked none, sir.

806
00:55:22,675 --> 00:55:25,303
# 'Ey, but I do

807
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:31,517
# Like you

808
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:03,216
- Morning, Carte.
- Good morning, Gilbert.

809
00:56:03,466 --> 00:56:04,759
- Cigar?
- Thank you.

810
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:06,970
- Gilbert.
- Sullivan. May I?

811
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,680
- Certainly.
- Morning, D'Oyly.

812
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,015
- Good morning, Miss Lenoir.
- Good morning.

813
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:14,894
Good day, Helen.

814
00:56:16,813 --> 00:56:19,190
Now, gentlemen.
We all know why we're here.

815
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,443
We seem to have come
to something of a standstill.

816
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:26,656
- Indeed we have.
- Which, Arthur, is because...

817
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:28,199
Oh.

818
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:29,951
Because, Helen...

819
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:34,038
...I am unable to set the piece
that Gilbert persists in presenting.

820
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,209
The piece I persist in presenting
is substantially altered each time.

821
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:41,588
Otherwise there'd be little point
in my presenting it to you.

822
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,133
With respect, old chap,
it is not substantially altered at all.

823
00:56:45,383 --> 00:56:48,469
You seem merely to have grafted
on to the first act...

824
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,181
...the tantalising suggestion
that we are to be in the realms of...

825
00:56:52,432 --> 00:56:54,392
...human emotion and probability...

826
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:59,564
...only to disappoint us by reverting to
your familiar world of Topsy- Turvydom.

827
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:03,943
That which I have grafted on to Act One,
Sullivan, has been at your request.

828
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:06,654
But if you take exception
to Topsy-Turvydom...

829
00:57:06,905 --> 00:57:10,325
...you take exception to a great deal
of my work of the past 25 years.

830
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:14,203
Not to mention much of what you and I
have written together since 1871.

831
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:16,372
- That is patent balderdash!
- Is it?

832
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:20,251
Gentlemen, if we might keep things
cordial, we may make some progress.

833
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:24,213
Arthur, can you really not see
your way to setting this new piece?

834
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:28,217
- Alas, Helen, I cannot.
- Cannot or will not?

835
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:32,555
I am truly unable to set any piece
that is so profoundly uncongenial to me.

836
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:34,974
Uncongenial though it may be to you...

837
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:38,311
...I must remind you that we here
are conducting a business.

838
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:40,980
May I remind you, Helen,
that I am not a machine.

839
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,775
I would not suggest for one moment
that you were.

840
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,444
You all seem to be treating me
as a barrel organ.

841
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:48,321
You have but to turn my handle...

842
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:51,074
...and out pops a tune!
- That's not strictly true.

843
00:57:51,324 --> 00:57:53,534
- Arthur.
- Come now, that's unfair.

844
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:57,497
You are both contractually obliged
to supply a new work on request.

845
00:57:57,747 --> 00:58:02,543
The very act of signing a joint contract
dictates that we must be businesslike.

846
00:58:02,794 --> 00:58:04,712
Yes, Mr Gilbert.

847
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:09,384
And I was wondering whether "you" might
be able to solve our wee difficulty.

848
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:14,264
- How, pray?
- By simply writing another libretto.

849
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:21,354
It's out of the question. I have worked
for many long months at this play...

850
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:26,025
...which I have every confidence will be
the best we have produced at the Savoy.

851
00:58:26,276 --> 00:58:28,820
To abandon it would be
both criminal and wasteful.

852
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,029
I see.

853
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,033
Had the complaint been lodged earlier,
that might have been different.

854
00:58:34,284 --> 00:58:36,327
I did so when you presented the libretto.

855
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:39,038
I was unable to present you
with the libretto...

856
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:41,499
...until you returned from your grand tour!

857
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:44,752
- That is neither here nor there.
- No, Sullivan. Indeed.

858
00:58:45,003 --> 00:58:48,131
I was here and you were there. Ha!

859
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:50,383
What I don't understand, Arthur...

860
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:52,552
...is why you cannot set this piece.

861
00:58:52,802 --> 00:58:55,680
You're our greatest composer.
Surely you can do anything?

862
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,849
How very kind you are, Helen.

863
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:01,102
But I say again to you all,
I am at the end of my tether.

864
00:59:01,352 --> 00:59:05,064
I have been repeating myself in this...
class of work for too long...

865
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:07,942
...and I will not continue so to do.

866
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:10,862
Neither of us runs any risk
of repeating himself.

867
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:14,073
This is an entirely new story,
quite unlike any other.

868
00:59:14,324 --> 00:59:16,534
It's markedly similar to "The Sorcerer".

869
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:18,953
People say we're repeating ourselves.

870
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:21,122
How is it similar to "The Sorcerer"?

871
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,374
Obviously both involve characters...

872
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,294
...who are transformed
by the taking of a magic potion.

873
00:59:26,544 --> 00:59:29,923
A device which I continue to find
utterly contrived.

874
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:33,468
Every theatrical performance is
a contrivance by its very nature.

875
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:39,682
Yes, but this piece consists entirely
of an artificial and implausible situation.

876
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:43,269
If you wish to write a grand opera
about a prostitute...

877
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:45,647
...dying of consumption in a garret...

878
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:48,149
...I suggest you contact Mr lbsen in Oslo.

879
00:59:48,399 --> 00:59:51,444
I'm sure he can furnish you
with something suitably dull.

880
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:54,447
- Gilbert, please.
- Hmm?

881
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:56,908
I do beg your pardon, Miss Lenoir.

882
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:58,534
Oh, no. Granted.

883
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:02,872
The opportunity to treat a situation
of tender, human and dramatic interest...

884
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:05,875
...is one I long for
more than anything else in the world.

885
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:10,546
If that is your sincere desire, I would
be willing, with Carte's permission...

886
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:13,925
...to withdraw my services
whilst you write a grand opera...

887
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:16,886
...with a collaborator
with whom you have more affinity.

888
01:00:17,136 --> 01:00:19,138
- No, Gilbert.
- I'm in earnest, Sullivan.

889
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:21,766
No doubt we shall be pursuing that
in the future.

890
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:25,186
Indeed.

891
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:27,647
Well, that is your prerogative, Carte.

892
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:31,859
However, we are concerned
with the present.

893
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:38,283
Arthur. Will you or will you not set
Mr Gilbert's new and original work?

894
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:41,327
<i>Ma belle Héléne: Ce n'est pas possible.</i>

895
01:00:41,578 --> 01:00:43,830
Truly?

896
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,457
I'm afraid so.

897
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:49,961
That being the case... Mr Gilbert...

898
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:53,631
Am I right to suppose that
you remain unable to accommodate us?

899
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:55,800
Indeed, Miss Lenoir.

900
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,094
I have had what I deem
to be a good idea...

901
01:00:58,344 --> 01:01:01,806
...and such ideas are not three a penny.

902
01:01:02,056 --> 01:01:03,933
What a pity.

903
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:09,230
This will be a very sad day
for many thousands of people.

904
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,191
Well, gentlemen, I don't know about you...

905
01:01:12,442 --> 01:01:17,196
...but speaking for myself,
I could murder a pork chop.

906
01:01:23,578 --> 01:01:27,624
If you'll excuse me, I shall retrieve my hat.

907
01:01:44,682 --> 01:01:46,976
- Gilbert.
- Sullivan.

908
01:01:47,226 --> 01:01:49,145
Good day to you both.

909
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:52,357
No doubt we shall be in communication
in the near future.

910
01:01:52,607 --> 01:01:56,486
- Good day, Mr Gilbert.
- Good day.

911
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:06,496
You know where to find me.

912
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:09,958
Arthur.

913
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,930
- Where have you been?
- Shopping.

914
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,473
Surprising(!)

915
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:28,142
I was in Knightsbridge...
and guess what I saw?

916
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:30,311
An elephant gilding two lilies.

917
01:02:30,561 --> 01:02:32,480
- No.
- I have no idea.

918
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:35,233
Three tiny Japanese ladies!

919
01:02:35,483 --> 01:02:39,445
- How do you know they were Japanese?
- They had on their funny dressing gowns.

920
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:40,738
Had they just got up?

921
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,241
No, there's a Japanese exhibition
at Humphreys' Hall.

922
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:45,785
Oh, yes. Japanese village of some sort.

923
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:48,871
Yes! Yes, sounds rather intriguing.
Might we visit?

924
01:02:49,122 --> 01:02:52,709
- No.
- But the whole of London will be going!

925
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:55,545
- Precisely!
- Don't be so stubborn!

926
01:02:55,795 --> 01:02:58,298
I have other things on my mind,
you know that!

927
01:02:58,548 --> 01:03:00,633
Yes, I do know that and I understand...

928
01:03:00,883 --> 01:03:03,177
...but a little distraction will do you good.

929
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:06,889
- Kitty, I don't want to be distracted.
- Yes, you do.

930
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,851
Oh, do I? You know my mind
better than I do, do you?

931
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,061
I know you better than you think I do.

932
01:03:12,312 --> 01:03:15,732
Lucy, if you wish to visit Humphreys' Hall,
by all means do so...

933
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:21,446
...but I shall not accompany you
for all the tea in China.

934
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:56,272
What are you writing, sir?

935
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:56,874
- Good afternoon, Lucy.
- Maude!

936
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,043
Good heavens! What are you doing here?

937
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:02,422
- How are you, Schwenck?
- How jolly! You must join us.

938
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:04,674
Unfortunately, we're about to leave.

939
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:07,093
- Oh, what a pity.
- What do you make of it all?

940
01:05:07,343 --> 01:05:09,429
- It's entrancing.
- It's frightful.

941
01:05:11,973 --> 01:05:13,891
- How's Mother?
- Quite well.

942
01:05:14,142 --> 01:05:15,393
She's in bed.

943
01:05:15,643 --> 01:05:16,894
Come along, Maude.

944
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:19,981
- We mustn't keep you. Good day to you.
- Give her my best.

945
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,190
Of course.

946
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:23,860
- Well... "au revoir".
- Good day, Maude.

947
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:28,156
<i>Au revoir.</i>

948
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:47,508
- My goodness!
- Mmm.

949
01:05:47,759 --> 01:05:50,470
Perfectly green.

950
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,807
- Spinach water.
- Oh, Willie!

951
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,477
Thank you very much.

952
01:05:57,727 --> 01:05:59,771
Shikuspen, prease.

953
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:03,524
- I beg your pardon?
- Shikuspen, prease.

954
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:05,568
- She speaks English!
- What did she say?

955
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:08,238
She said, "Sixpence, please"!

956
01:06:08,488 --> 01:06:12,784
- Shikuspence, prease.
- Oh, sixpence!

957
01:06:12,825 --> 01:06:17,163
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Arigato gozaimasu.</i>

958
01:06:17,413 --> 01:06:20,250
Shixpence, prease.

959
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:57,055
Here we are, sir.

960
01:07:57,305 --> 01:08:01,100
- There, Pidgeon.
- Very good, sir.

961
01:08:02,852 --> 01:08:04,771
<i>Comme ça.</i>

962
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:08,649
Yes, sir.

963
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:12,278
Show it to me.

964
01:08:18,243 --> 01:08:21,329
To your right.

965
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:25,291
More... Good. Down a bit.

966
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:28,044
Down a bit... There.

967
01:08:28,294 --> 01:08:32,173
- Mark it there.
- Yes, sir.

968
01:08:32,423 --> 01:08:34,550
- Give it to me.
- Thank you, sir.

969
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:37,178
That's a fine-looking instrument, sir.

970
01:08:37,428 --> 01:08:39,597
Now, would that be Spanish or Italian?

971
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:44,602
- Neither, Pidgeon.
- Er, of course, sir.

972
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:02,787
- Excellent! Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

973
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:13,524
Do we suppose that Lucy is... with child?

974
01:10:13,775 --> 01:10:17,362
- I beg your pardon, Mama?
- Lucy.

975
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:21,115
Is she "enceinte"? With child?

976
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:23,243
Why ever would you think that?

977
01:10:23,493 --> 01:10:25,954
One wouldn't have said she was sickly.

978
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:31,334
Although... she did ask after "you", Mama.

979
01:10:39,759 --> 01:10:41,302
What did he say?

980
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:44,722
- Who?
- Schwenck!

981
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:47,183
He said nothing, Mama! Nothing!

982
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:51,271
Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

983
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,028
Your dear son said very little.

984
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,617
And what he did say,
I have already told you.

985
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:06,202
Now...

986
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:10,081
Do you care for this or not?

987
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:13,793
It is merely a piece of wood.

988
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:18,840
Very well. I shall keep it for my collection.

989
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:23,678
- Maude!
- Yes, Mama?

990
01:11:23,803 --> 01:11:28,308
Never bear a humorous baby.

991
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:32,353
I shall endeavour not to, Mama.

992
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:32,515
# Behold the Lord High Executioner

993
01:13:32,765 --> 01:13:36,019

# Liberated then on bail

# On my own recognisances

# Surely never had a male

# Under suchlike circumstances

"The Mikado, or the town of Titipu."

1018

"Act One."

1019
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,576
"Scene: Courtyard of
Ko-Ko's palace in Titipu."

1020
01:15:14,826 --> 01:15:17,620
"Japanese nobles discovered
standing and sitting...

1021
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:20,331
...in attitudes suggested
by native drawings."

1022
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:24,419
"Chorus: 'If you want to know who we are
We're gentlemen of Japan.'"

"'In pity speak, oh, speak, I pray you.'"

1037
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:07,337
"'I hurried back at once
in the hope of finding Yum- Yum...

1038
01:16:07,587 --> 01:16:09,964
...at liberty to listen to my protestations.'"

1039
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:14,260
"Pish-Tush: 'It is true that Ko-Ko
was condemned to death for flirting...

1040
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:17,180
...but he was reprieved
at the last moment...

1041
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:21,059
...and raised to the exalted rank
of Lord High Executioner...

1042
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:24,479
...under the following
remarkable circumstances.'"

1043
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,648
"Song, Pish-Tush."

1044
01:16:26,898 --> 01:16:29,400
"'Our great Mikado, virtuous man,

1045
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,486
When he to rule our land began

1046
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:34,113
Resolved to try a plan whereby

1047
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:36,991
Young men might best be steadied.'"

1048
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:39,410
"'So he decreed in words succinct

1049
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,955
That all who flirted, leered or winked

1050
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:44,290
Unless connubially linked

1051
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,459
Should forthwith be beheaded.'"

1052
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:50,296
"'And I expect you'll all agree
That he was right to so decree.'"

1053
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:52,382
"'And I am right, and you are right,

1054
01:16:52,632 --> 01:16:55,343

1055
01:16:55,593 --> 01:16:57,804
"'This stern decree, you'll understand,

1056
01:16:58,054 --> 01:17:00,431
Caused great dismay
throughout the land,

1057
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:03,017
For young and old and shy and bold

1058
01:17:03,268 --> 01:17:05,228
Were equally affected.'"

"'The youth who winked a roving eye

1060
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:10,191
Or breathed a non-connubial sigh

1061
01:17:10,441 --> 01:17:14,070
Was thereupon condemned to die.'"

1062
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,239
"'He usually objected.'"

1063
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:19,951
"'And you'll allow, as I expect,
That he was right to so object,

1064

1065
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:24,330
And everything is quite correct.'"

1066
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:26,791
"'And so we straight let out on bail

1067
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,085
A convict from the county jail

1068

Whose head was next on some pretext,
Condemn-ed to be mown off,

1069
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,967
And made him Headsman, for we said:

1070
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:38,344
Who's next to be decapit-ed

1071
01:17:38,595 --> 01:17:42,724
Cannot cut off another's head
Until he's cut his own off.'"

1072
01:17:42,974 --> 01:17:46,519
"'And we are right, I think you'll say,
To argue in this kind of way,

1073
01:17:46,769 --> 01:17:48,688

1074
01:17:48,938 --> 01:17:50,857
And all is right - too-loorallay!'"

1075
01:17:51,107 --> 01:17:54,152
"Chorus. End of song."

1076
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:56,279
Highly amusing, Willie.

1077
01:17:56,529 --> 01:17:59,157
- Fatuous.
- Oh.

1078
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,492
Surely Arthur likes it?

1079
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:05,663
He hasn't said otherwise.

1080
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:09,959
It certainly is rich
in human emotion and probability.

1081
01:18:10,209 --> 01:18:13,171
Hardly.

1082
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:16,215
"Enter Pooh-Bah."

1083
01:18:41,074 --> 01:18:42,909
- It's a tragedy.
- It is.

1084
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,285
<i>Che bruto.</i>

1085
01:18:44,535 --> 01:18:48,122
Absolutely. He simply hasn't
played with a straight bat.

1086
01:18:48,373 --> 01:18:50,166
- Who's that?
- His Majesty the Mahdi.

1087
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:52,460
- Oh, yes.
- No, it just isn't cricket.

1088
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,923
Quite so. It's completely contrary
to the rules of engagement.

1089
01:18:57,173 --> 01:19:00,343
The man was surrounded on all sides
and massacred mercilessly.

1090
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:03,805
"What full fortune
doth the thick lips owe."

1091
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:07,308
- What does that mean?
- Philistine.

1092
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:10,103
It baffles me that you're baffled,
Barrington.

1093
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:13,690
The Hottentot in the desert
doesn't play cricket.

1094
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:17,235
His natural habitation
being the jungly-bungly tree...

1095
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:20,947
...he is as yet hardly able
to walk upright, don't you know?

1096
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:24,325
We strive to bring them civilisation...

1097
01:19:24,576 --> 01:19:28,288
...and this is their gratitude.

1098
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:33,793
Did you know that 56 families were
slaughtered on the Island of Skye?

1099
01:19:34,043 --> 01:19:37,714
- Really? When was that?
- In '82, I think.

1100
01:19:37,964 --> 01:19:40,341
And who perpetrated the outrage, pray?

1101
01:19:40,592 --> 01:19:44,220
- Oh, merely the, er... English militia.
- Extraordinary.

1102
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:48,099
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

1103
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,938
Shall we indulge in another dozen?

1104
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:57,442
- I rather think we ought, don't you?
- I think we might.

1105
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,153
- Would you care for a second fish, Lely?
- No.

1106
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:02,405
Or a veritable shoal, perhaps?

1107
01:20:02,655 --> 01:20:07,410
I've had an ample sufficiency,
thank you, my wee man.

1108
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,996
I have an appointment
with Carte this afternoon.

1109
01:20:10,246 --> 01:20:13,041
- At what hour?
- Five o'clock.

1110
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,085
Curious.
I shall be with him at half past four.

1111
01:20:16,336 --> 01:20:19,589
That's funny. I don't have
a meeting with him at four o'clock.

1112
01:20:19,839 --> 01:20:23,009
And it is my firm intention
to prise open his purse.

1113
01:20:23,259 --> 01:20:26,220
It will take a far stronger man
than you, Mr Barrington...

1114
01:20:26,471 --> 01:20:29,766
...to fulfil that Herculean labour.

1115
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:32,310
What's "your" mission, Captain Grossmith?

1116
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,606
Oh, there are certain little matters.

1117
01:20:36,648 --> 01:20:39,150
I should like to offer you
an increase in salary.

1118
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,695
- Oh? Indeed?
- Indeed.

1119
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:46,574
- That's most benevolent of you.
- It's no less than you deserve.

1120
01:20:46,824 --> 01:20:50,453
Thank you.
And by how much, might one enquire?

1121
01:20:50,703 --> 01:20:53,957
By 71/2 per cent.

1122
01:20:54,207 --> 01:20:56,167
Mm.

1123
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:58,336
71/2.

1124
01:20:58,586 --> 01:21:01,506
Now, that would work out at, er...

1125
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,217
- £30 per week.
- 30! Mm.

1126
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:08,680
I see. Well, £30 per week
wasn't quite the sum I had in mind...

1127
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,808
...as I wended my weary way here.

1128
01:21:12,058 --> 01:21:13,309
Indeed?

1129
01:21:13,559 --> 01:21:16,854
That would be three productions
with a negligible increase.

1130
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,816
I don't consider an increase
of two pounds per week...

1131
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:22,652
...over 12 months negligible, George.

1132
01:21:22,902 --> 01:21:26,072
One might have thought
the name of George Grossmith...

1133
01:21:26,322 --> 01:21:28,616
...my not inconsiderable contribution...

1134
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:31,995
...would have been
more favourably recognised.

1135
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:35,081
You do receive considerably more
than anyone else.

1136
01:21:35,331 --> 01:21:39,252
- Do I?
- Mm.

1137
01:21:40,837 --> 01:21:43,840
We should be terribly sorry to lose you.

1138
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:47,468
Gilbert has written you
a particularly fine part in the new piece.

1139
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:50,805
Precisely! As one would expect.

1140
01:21:51,055 --> 01:21:55,518
However, I should judge an increase
of a paltry two pound per week...

1141
01:21:55,768 --> 01:21:57,604
...to be wholly unacceptable.

1142
01:21:57,854 --> 01:22:01,524
Not to mention mildly insulting,
if one may say so.

1143
01:22:01,774 --> 01:22:08,072
And what figure had you in mind,
Mr Grossmith?

1144
01:22:09,657 --> 01:22:13,285
Er...

1145
01:22:13,286 --> 01:22:18,082
Forgive me, I seem to have
lost my train of thought.

1146
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:29,802
Are you unwell, George?

1147
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,765
I fear I may have come over a bit queer.

1148
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:38,186
- Most embarrassing.
- You must take a little brandy.

1149
01:22:45,985 --> 01:22:48,780
A little water clears us of this deed.

1150
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,949
I blame Grossmith for this.

1151
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,201
- Only Grossmith?
- Thank you, Helen.

1152
01:22:53,451 --> 01:22:57,080
Confounded glutton.

1153
01:22:57,956 --> 01:23:00,291
- Are you feeling better?
- I do beg your pardon.

1154
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,294
- This is awfully embarrassing.
- Not at all, Rutty.

1155
01:23:03,544 --> 01:23:06,631
Now why don't we return
to the subject of your salary?

1156
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,384
Oh, yes.

1157
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:15,306
Well, I must declare that I'm rather
at a loss for words, D'Oyly.

1158
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:19,060
- Excuse me.

1159
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:21,396
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

1160
01:23:21,646 --> 01:23:23,815
This is a bally nightmare, damn it!

1161
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,610
I shall be in my dressing room!

1162
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:32,907
The more I see of men,
the more I admire dogs.

1163
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,703
I'm soon to have a meeting...

1164
01:23:36,953 --> 01:23:40,623
...concerning the cast for the next opera.
- Yes, indeed.

1165
01:23:40,873 --> 01:23:44,210
I've heard a little rumour
that I might be playing the part...

1166
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,964
...of a 14-year-old schoolgirl.
- Somebody's been telling tales.

1167
01:23:48,214 --> 01:23:51,342
They have indeed, Mr Carte!

1168
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:55,221
Mr Gilbert will be very angry.

1169
01:23:55,763 --> 01:23:59,350
With reference to your engagement
for the opera...

1170
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:04,230
...I have a great concern
about your little weakness.

1171
01:24:09,736 --> 01:24:12,071
I'm a little shocked, Mr Carte.

1172
01:24:12,322 --> 01:24:16,784
I really do believe that my behaviour
this last year has been exemplary.

1173
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:19,704
I'm pleased to say
your tendency has improved...

1174
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,875
...but I am concerned about the future.

1175
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:28,796
Yes.
You're perhaps suggesting, Mr Carte...

1176
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:33,551
...that I shan't be performing
in the next production.

1177
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:37,597
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

1178
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,435
But the outcome of that, Leonora,
is in your own hands.

1179
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:52,862
Sometimes, Mr Carte,
I can be a very silly young woman.

1180
01:24:53,112 --> 01:24:55,990
You have an extraordinary talent.

1181
01:24:56,241 --> 01:25:01,537
It saddens me beyond measure
to see someone throw it away.

1182
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:06,042
I assure you, Mr Carte,
that I shall be in tiptop form.

1183
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:08,253
I'm very pleased to hear that.

1184
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:12,465
Much relieved.

1185
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:17,303
Do we have an understanding?

1186
01:25:17,553 --> 01:25:21,891
Yes, we do, Mr Carte.

1187
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:27,272
Good.

1188
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:30,191
# Charlie, Charlie

1189
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:33,111
# War would not follow thee

1190
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,363
# King of the Highland hearts

1191
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:39,367
# Bonnie Prince Charlie

1192
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:42,829
- Chop chop, Butt! How long do we have?

1193
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:45,456
- Eight minutes, Mr Temple.
- Oh, jolly good.

1194
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,875
- Shocking news from Khartoum.
- Indeed.

1195
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:50,503
<i>Something will have to be done,
tout de suite.</i>

1196
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:52,046
Absolutely.

1197
01:25:52,297 --> 01:25:54,757
Mrs Temple hit the nail on the head,
as per usual.

1198
01:25:55,008 --> 01:25:56,092
Oh? What did she say?

1199
01:25:56,342 --> 01:25:59,345
"The nation loses a hero,
but the family loses a loved one."

1200
01:25:59,596 --> 01:26:02,557
- Ooh, how apt.
- Perspicacious woman is Mrs Temple.

1201
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,726
Hat!

1202
01:26:04,976 --> 01:26:06,894
Consider this, my dear Butt.

1203
01:26:07,145 --> 01:26:10,231
Is it not the inevitable fate
of the professional soldier...

1204
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:13,026
...that he may perish in battle?
- Indeed, sir.

1205
01:26:13,276 --> 01:26:15,987
But Dickie, have you heard
the "real" news of the day?

1206
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,448
Yes, the Fenian bomb. Oh, dreadful.

1207
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:20,617
No, Grossmith and Barrington.

1208
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:22,785
- What?
- They're off tonight.

1209
01:26:23,036 --> 01:26:24,871
- Both of them?
- Yes.

1210
01:26:25,121 --> 01:26:26,915
- Why?
- Oysters.

1211
01:26:27,165 --> 01:26:29,417
- We shared luncheon.
- Did you swallow?

1212
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,544
- No. I had sole.
- Off the bone?

1213
01:26:31,794 --> 01:26:34,881
- Yes. It was rather succulent.
- Wise man. Oysters can kill.

1214
01:26:35,131 --> 01:26:36,591
Unquestionably!

1215
01:26:36,841 --> 01:26:38,760
My aunt choked on a scallop
at Herne Bay.

1216
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,220
- Really?
- Tragic.

1217
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:43,306
Yes, they were away to see Carte.

1218
01:26:43,556 --> 01:26:45,308
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

1219
01:26:45,558 --> 01:26:48,186
- Will you be lobbying?
- No, I'll wait for my summons.

1220
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:50,271
Quite right, dear boy.

1221
01:26:50,521 --> 01:26:52,815
One should not be rewarded
on one's ability...

1222
01:26:53,066 --> 01:26:55,360
...to ingratiate oneself
with the management.

1223
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,446
Particularly when
the management have difficulty...

1224
01:26:58,696 --> 01:27:02,533
...locating the whereabouts
of the arse and the elbow!

1225
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:06,412
Serves them both right.

1226
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:11,376
Enter!

1227
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,711
Five minutes, please, Mr Temple, Mr Lely.

1228
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,465
<i>- Thank you, Shrimp!
- Merci, Crevette!</i>

1229
01:27:17,715 --> 01:27:19,342
One, two, three, four.

1230
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:22,971
# And so, although I'm ready to go

1231
01:27:23,221 --> 01:27:25,306
<i>- # Yet recollect...
- Dolce!</i>

1232
01:27:25,556 --> 01:27:28,434
- # Did I neglect to thus effect...
- Expansive!

1233
01:27:28,685 --> 01:27:30,853
- # So I object
- Good!

1234
01:27:31,104 --> 01:27:34,774
- # And so, although
- Rutty, temper your volume, please.

1235
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:38,444
- # And greatly pine to brightly shine
- And now!

1236
01:27:38,695 --> 01:27:42,448
# With grief condign I must decline

1237
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:44,742
# And go and show both friend and foe

1238
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,828
# How much you dare, I'm quite aware

1239
01:27:47,078 --> 01:27:48,830
# It's your affair yet I declare

1240
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,999
# I'd take your share but I don't

1241
01:27:51,249 --> 01:27:53,167
Bovill, that's very good, but...

1242
01:27:53,418 --> 01:27:56,337
...I've gone to great pain
to provide you with triplets.

1243
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:58,923
- Triplets, Sir Arthur, yes.
- On his salary!

1244
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,967
- Rutty, please.
- Apology.

1245
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:04,470
Consequently,
if you would be so kind as to trip.

1246
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:07,473
- Of course, Sir Arthur.
- One, two, three, four!

1247
01:28:07,724 --> 01:28:09,309
# And go and show both friend and foe

1248
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:11,644
# How much you dare, I'm quite aware

1249
01:28:11,894 --> 01:28:13,688
# It's your affair yet I declare

1250
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:16,274
# I'd take your share
but I don't much care

1251
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:18,651
- Very much better.
- Thank you, Sir Arthur.

1252
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:21,571
- The new man's doing awfully well.
- Quite splendid.

1253
01:28:21,821 --> 01:28:23,448
Breathe, Bovill, breathe!

1254
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:26,451
- It's "piano", Barrington, "piano".
- I'll do my best.

1255
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:30,413
- As many P's as you can muster, Rutland.
- Without landing us in the soup!

1256
01:28:30,663 --> 01:28:32,332
One, two, three, four!

1257
01:28:32,582 --> 01:28:34,125
# And go and show both friend and foe

1258
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,252
# How much you dare, I'm quite aware

1259
01:28:36,502 --> 01:28:38,212
# It's your affair yet I declare

1260
01:28:38,463 --> 01:28:39,964
# I'd take your share but I don't

1261
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:41,174
And going on!

1262
01:28:41,424 --> 01:28:43,301
- # I must decline
- # So I object

1263
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,303
- # I must decline
- # So I object

1264
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,096
- # I'd take your share
- # So I object

1265
01:28:47,347 --> 01:28:49,515
- # I'd take your share
- # So I object

1266
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:55,313
# To sit in solemn silence in a...

1267
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:58,942
Gentlemen. "Un poco piú viva", hm?

1268
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:02,737
Now, before the double-bar line,
it's one, two, three, four.

1269
01:29:02,987 --> 01:29:05,615
And afterwards, one, two, three, four.

1270
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:07,450
- Clear?
- Very quiet.

1271
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,620
From here, please. One, two, three, four.

1272
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:13,873
# Care, I don't much care,
I don't much care

1273
01:29:14,123 --> 01:29:17,085
# To sit in solemn silence
in a dull, dark dock

1274
01:29:17,335 --> 01:29:20,088
# In a pestilential prison
with a lifelong lock

1275
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:22,966
# Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock

1276
01:29:23,216 --> 01:29:26,094
# From a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big, black block

1277
01:29:26,344 --> 01:29:28,930
# To sit in solemn silence
in a dull, dark dock

1278
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,308
# In a pestilential prison
with a lifelong lock

1279
01:29:32,558 --> 01:29:35,103
# Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock

1280
01:29:35,353 --> 01:29:38,189
# From a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big, black block

1281
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:39,732
# A dull, dark dock

1282
01:29:39,983 --> 01:29:41,192
# A lifelong lock

1283
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,610
# A short, sharp shock

1284
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,195
# A big, black block

1285
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:47,031
# To sit in solemn silence
in a pestilential prison

1286
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:50,076
# And awaiting the sensation
from a cheap and chippy chopper

1287
01:29:50,326 --> 01:29:51,619
# On a big

1288
01:29:51,869 --> 01:29:53,788
# Black

1289
01:29:54,038 --> 01:29:56,833
# Block

1290
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:59,669
- Bravo!
- Splendid!

1291
01:29:59,919 --> 01:30:02,297
Louis! "Wir brauchen etwas Kaffee!"

1292
01:30:02,547 --> 01:30:04,465
Your coffee is ready, Sir Arthur.

1293
01:30:04,716 --> 01:30:08,136
- My word!
- First rate.

1294
01:30:08,386 --> 01:30:12,640
- Rutty, do go through.
- Thanks, old chap.

1295
01:30:19,564 --> 01:30:21,899
Do one's hands remain within,
Madame Leon?

1296
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,819
Oh, no, my dear. No, no, no. Look! Here!

1297
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:27,030
<i>- Comme ça.
- Oh, I see!</i>

1298
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,324
<i>Voilá!</i>

1299
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:32,869
Are you still troubled by
your understandings, Miss Bond?

1300
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,456
- I'm in much pain this afternoon.
- I'm so sorry to hear it.

1301
01:30:36,706 --> 01:30:40,168
<i>Ah, trés jolie, trés jolie. Superbe!</i>

1302
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:42,337
Such exquisite embroidery.

1303
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:44,839
What are you wearing
underneath your gown?

1304
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:46,549
Only my frillies.

1305
01:30:46,799 --> 01:30:49,385
Alas, no corsets, I'm afraid to say.

1306
01:30:49,636 --> 01:30:53,264
Shall we be revealing a little,
Madame Leon?

1307
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:56,809
- I certainly hope not, Miss Braham.
- Oh, what a pity.

1308
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,228
Do take care, Miss Morton!

1309
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:01,773
Makes one rather drowsy.

1310
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:05,401
- It does look comfortable, Sibyl.
- Indeed it is.

1311
01:31:05,652 --> 01:31:09,572
<i>La kimono! Doucement, doucement!
Gently, gently.</i>

1312
01:31:09,822 --> 01:31:12,408
Ooh, the silk is sublime, Madame Leon.

1313
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:15,245
Indeed.
From Mr Liberty's store, don't you know?

1314
01:31:15,495 --> 01:31:19,707
Bona fide Japanese,
and just a "soupçon" from gay Paris.

1315
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:22,961
<i>- C'est magnifique!
- Oui.</i>

1316
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,922
Is one to be prevented
from wearing one's corset?

1317
01:31:26,172 --> 01:31:29,926
None of the ladies shall be
wearing corsets during the performance.

1318
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:34,013
- That's simply preposterous.
- Our aim is to emulate Japanese ladies.

1319
01:31:34,264 --> 01:31:36,140
And they are as thin as threadpaper!

1320
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:38,726
As a Roman column
is opposed to a Grecian urn.

1321
01:31:38,977 --> 01:31:39,811
Quite so.

1322
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:43,690
I fear for my reputation, don't you know?

1323
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:46,025
I am following Mr Gilbert's instructions.

1324
01:31:46,276 --> 01:31:48,528
Mr Gilbert desires
the Japanese appearance.

1325
01:31:48,778 --> 01:31:52,282
That which Mr Gilbert desires,
Mr Gilbert must have. "Fait accompli!"

1326
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:55,618
One can hardly cut a dash
in this... dressing gown!

1327
01:31:55,868 --> 01:31:57,829
Do stop fussing, Jessie, please!

1328
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,707
- It's delightful, Madame Leon!
- Thank you.

1329
01:32:00,957 --> 01:32:03,668
- It's shapeless.
- Yes, Miss Bond, it is shapeless.

1330
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,588
Japanese ladies are most shapeless...

1331
01:32:06,838 --> 01:32:09,173
...but there is no need
for "you" to be shapeless.

1332
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:12,427
I have devised a solution -
if I may crave your indulgence.

1333
01:32:12,677 --> 01:32:16,347
Miss Morton... Miss Grey,
would you kindly raise your arms?

1334
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:19,851
<i>Merci, merci!
Now, the bow goes at the back.</i>

1335
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,520
The sash at the front, lined with calico.

1336
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:25,898
Now... "tournez. Tournez, s'il vous plaît."

1337
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:29,193
Now, this may be laced
as tightly as you require.

1338
01:32:29,444 --> 01:32:31,154
<i>Tournez... á gauche, á gauche.</i>

1339
01:32:31,404 --> 01:32:32,780
<i>Oui.</i>

1340
01:32:33,031 --> 01:32:36,826
So you see, in effect, it is a corset!

1341
01:32:37,076 --> 01:32:40,038
- Where's the whalebone?
- There are no bones, Miss Bond.

1342
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:43,833
Well, Madame Leon, I do fear
that if there are no bones...

1343
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:46,002
...then it is plainly not a corset.

1344
01:32:46,252 --> 01:32:49,839
No, Miss Bond, it is not a corset,
but it may serve for a corset.

1345
01:32:50,089 --> 01:32:51,966
It may give you the shape you desire.

1346
01:32:52,216 --> 01:32:54,218
Tighter, please, Miss Morton, tighter!

1347
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:56,888
I cannot appear on stage without a corset.

1348
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:59,599
It certainly feels like a corset, Jessie.

1349
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:02,560
You do resemble a birthday gift.
I could eat you.

1350
01:33:05,271 --> 01:33:09,567
Do forgive me, Miss Bond. One is
working to the best of one's abilities.

1351
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:13,363
I fear sometimes it is not appreciated.

1352
01:33:15,573 --> 01:33:19,244
- That is the "hori". Am I correct, Wilhelm?
- Quite so, Mr Gilbert.

1353
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:22,914
As opposed to the "zori",
which is the stocking, is it not?

1354
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:26,000
- The stockings are the "tarbi", sir.
- Ah! "Tarbi".

1355
01:33:26,251 --> 01:33:29,337
- The sandals are the "zori".
- Exactly, sir.

1356
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:31,714
I'm beginning to get it, Grossmith.

1357
01:33:31,965 --> 01:33:33,967
- Mr Gilbert.
- Lely?

1358
01:33:34,217 --> 01:33:37,428
Is this to be the length of my gown
for Nanki-Poo?

1359
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,265
- I believe so. Wilhelm?
- Indeed it is.

1360
01:33:40,515 --> 01:33:41,349
Yes.

1361
01:33:41,599 --> 01:33:44,227
Do you not consider it to be perhaps...
too short?

1362
01:33:44,477 --> 01:33:46,229
Too short for what?

1363
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:50,942
For propriety.
Might it not be rather unseemly?

1364
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:55,280
- I'm sorry, unseemly to whom?
- To the audience of the Savoy Theatre.

1365
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,908
Hmm. I shouldn't have thought so.

1366
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:00,827
In any case, I shall be the judge.

1367
01:34:01,077 --> 01:34:05,081
Rest assured, Mr Lely, my designs
are properly researched and authentic.

1368
01:34:05,331 --> 01:34:09,002
No offence to you, Mr Wilhelm,
but your properly authentic costume...

1369
01:34:09,252 --> 01:34:11,754
...seems to have left me
in the buff somewhat!

1370
01:34:12,005 --> 01:34:13,923
- Quite.
- No more in the buff...

1371
01:34:14,173 --> 01:34:17,385
...than Japanese peasants
have been for the last 800 years.

1372
01:34:17,635 --> 01:34:22,181
May I draw your attention to the fact that
I am not, actually, a Japanese peasant.

1373
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:26,227
No. You're a Scotch actor, who is
taking the part of a Japanese prince...

1374
01:34:26,477 --> 01:34:28,605
...who is posing as an itinerant minstrel.

1375
01:34:28,855 --> 01:34:32,150
Lely, I would be only too happy
for the tailor here...

1376
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,529
...to chop off some of my surplus
and stitch it to your kilt.

1377
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:39,908
Thank you, Grossmith.
I'm sure we shall reap the benefits...

1378
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:41,910
...of your remonstrations in time.

1379
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,247
Yes, GG. Do you not agree with me
that this garment is rather vulgar?

1380
01:34:46,497 --> 01:34:48,374
I do, as it happens.

1381
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,293
Mr Grossmith...

1382
01:34:50,543 --> 01:34:52,629
...kindly oblige me by removing your hat.

1383
01:34:52,879 --> 01:34:54,797
Why, sir? Are you ready for me?

1384
01:34:55,048 --> 01:34:56,925
Would that I were, sir!

1385
01:34:57,175 --> 01:35:01,012
I'll thank you not to refer
to my designs as vulgar, Mr Lely.

1386
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:06,142
Mr Wilhelm, to my eyes, your designs
are not only vulgar but obscene!

1387
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:10,229
- How dare you, sir?
- Strong words, Lely. What do you mean?

1388
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:15,360
Mr Gilbert, I'm a respectably married man
and I love my wife dearly.

1389
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,904
One of the few pleasures
she has enjoyed...

1390
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:21,282
...since the untimely demise
of my beloved mother-in-law...

1391
01:35:21,532 --> 01:35:23,952
...has been to watch me
perform upon the stage.

1392
01:35:24,202 --> 01:35:28,873
But I am not prepared to allow her to
suffer the embarrassment of seeing me...

1393
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:35,546
...flaunted before the public like a...
half-dressed performing dog!

1394
01:35:35,672 --> 01:35:37,590
You have my sympathies, Lely.

1395
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,385
But, unfortunately,
your avocation as an actor...

1396
01:35:40,635 --> 01:35:45,306
...compels you on occasion to endure
the most ignominious indignities...

1397
01:35:45,556 --> 01:35:47,767
...as Grossmith will doubtless testify.

1398
01:35:48,017 --> 01:35:51,062
- Without question, sir.
- Mr Lely, let me be clear.

1399
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:53,690
I will not alter
one stitch of your costume...

1400
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:56,484
...to protect the sensibilities of your wife...

1401
01:35:56,734 --> 01:36:00,071
...your children or any other member
of your unfortunate family.

1402
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:04,033
Mr Wilhelm, I would strongly advise
you not to speak of my family...

1403
01:36:04,284 --> 01:36:06,202
...in such a despicable manner!

1404
01:36:06,452 --> 01:36:08,246
Sir.

1405
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:10,373
Will you remove your corset?

1406
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:13,543
I beg your pardon?!

1407
01:36:13,793 --> 01:36:15,712
Kindly remove your corset, Mr Lely.

1408
01:36:15,962 --> 01:36:19,882
It'll spoil the hang of the cloth.

1409
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:23,803
Mr Gilbert.

1410
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:26,014
I never perform without my corset.

1411
01:36:26,264 --> 01:36:29,767
- What, never?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

1412
01:36:30,018 --> 01:36:31,936
Why not?

1413
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,939
One cannot produce
the required vocal vigour...

1414
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:37,984
...without the necessary
diaphragmatical support...

1415
01:36:38,234 --> 01:36:40,069
...that the corset affords.

1416
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,031
Come, come, Lely.
This is not grand opera in Milan.

1417
01:36:43,281 --> 01:36:46,868
It is merely low burlesque in a small
theatre on the banks of the Thames.

1418
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:48,870
You have a fine, strong voice...

1419
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:52,749
...which is more than adequate
for our purposes, corset or no corset.

1420
01:36:52,999 --> 01:36:55,084
Kindly remove it this instant.

1421
01:36:55,335 --> 01:36:57,629
You may retire behind the screen,
if you wish.

1422
01:36:57,879 --> 01:36:59,589
Very well, sir.

1423
01:36:59,839 --> 01:37:01,758
But, may I just say...

1424
01:37:02,008 --> 01:37:04,928
...that in five years
of loyal service to this company...

1425
01:37:05,178 --> 01:37:07,597
...I have never, until now,
lodged a complaint.

1426
01:37:07,847 --> 01:37:12,018
Your noble restraint
has been much appreciated.

1427
01:37:12,268 --> 01:37:14,896
Thank you, sir.

1428
01:37:18,733 --> 01:37:21,194
# A wandering minstrel I

1429
01:37:21,444 --> 01:37:25,698
# A thing of shreds and patches

1430
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:28,993
# Of ballads, songs and snatches

1431
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:32,956
# And dreamy lullaby

1432
01:37:33,206 --> 01:37:35,625
# My catalogue is long

1433
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:39,879
# Though every passion ranging

1434
01:37:40,129 --> 01:37:43,591
# And to your humours changing

1435
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:48,429
# I tune my supple song

1436
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:58,231
# I tune my supple song

1437
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:03,319
# Are you in sentimental mood?

1438
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:05,905
# I'll sigh with you

1439
01:38:07,824 --> 01:38:11,035
# Oh

1440
01:38:11,286 --> 01:38:14,914
# Sorrow

1441
01:38:15,164 --> 01:38:19,669
# On maiden's coldness do you brood?

1442
01:38:19,919 --> 01:38:23,840
# I'll do so, too

1443
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:29,137
# Oh, sorrow

1444
01:38:29,387 --> 01:38:33,224
# Sorrow

1445
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:35,977
# I'll charm your willing ears

1446
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:41,566
# With songs of lovers' fears

1447
01:38:41,816 --> 01:38:45,695
# While sympathetic tears

1448
01:38:45,945 --> 01:38:50,199
# My cheeks bedew

1449
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:55,872
# Oh, sorrow

1450
01:38:56,122 --> 01:39:01,544
# Sorrow

1451
01:39:01,794 --> 01:39:03,087
Thank you, Seymour!

1452
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:07,175
Miss Sixpence Please,
would you kindly come along with me?

1453
01:39:07,425 --> 01:39:08,885
Make haste, make haste!

1454
01:39:09,135 --> 01:39:11,054
- Johnny.
- Thank you very much.

1455
01:39:11,304 --> 01:39:15,433
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
you all to Miss Sixpence Please?

1456
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:19,604
You may have heard me speak of her
with reverence and respect. Thank you.

1457
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:21,940
Very good.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1458
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,108
Please be seated. Thank you.

1459
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:27,195
Ah! Sir! My apologies.
I've been neglecting you.

1460
01:39:27,445 --> 01:39:29,364
Would you like to come this way?

1461
01:39:29,614 --> 01:39:32,450
No, it's all right, Seymour.
He can use your chair.

1462
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,619
Here you are, sir. Be seated here.

1463
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:38,331
Very good indeed. Pride of place, sir!
Make yourself comfortable.

1464
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,291
Cellier!

1465
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:42,252
Yes. Now.

1466
01:39:42,502 --> 01:39:46,881
D'Auban! Will you kindly withdraw
to the side of the stage immediately?

1467
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:49,217
- Johnny!
- Thank you, "Monsieur" D'Auban!

1468
01:39:49,467 --> 01:39:51,636
Ladies, will you take up
your fans, please?

1469
01:39:51,886 --> 01:39:55,056
What I'd like you to do, sir,
is to observe the proceedings.

1470
01:39:55,306 --> 01:39:58,685
Would you give all your attention
to the performance? Thank you.

1471
01:39:58,935 --> 01:40:00,979
Barker, what are you doing? Joining in?

1472
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:05,233
My dancing days are long over,
Mr Gilbert.

1473
01:40:05,483 --> 01:40:07,402
Over, Barker, but not forgotten.

1474
01:40:07,652 --> 01:40:09,862
Ladies, opening attitudes, "s'il vous plaît".

1475
01:40:10,113 --> 01:40:12,824
From the beginning,
counting two bars, Mrs Russell.

1476
01:40:13,074 --> 01:40:18,079
- Thank you.
- One, two. Two, two.

1477
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:28,506
# Three little maids from school are we

1478
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:30,842
# Pert as a schoolgirl well can be

1479
01:40:31,092 --> 01:40:34,012
# Filled to the brim with girlish glee

1480
01:40:34,262 --> 01:40:35,972
- # Three little maids from school
- Fans!

1481
01:40:36,222 --> 01:40:39,142
# Everything is a source of fun

1482
01:40:39,392 --> 01:40:43,730
# Nobody's safe, for we care for none

1483
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:48,401
# Life is a joke that's just begun

1484
01:40:49,193 --> 01:40:51,195
# Three little maids from school

1485
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,740
All fans rising slowly...

1486
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:56,826
- And!
- # Three little maids who all unwary

1487
01:40:57,076 --> 01:40:59,537
Stop! Thank you very much!
Now, Miss Sixpence...

1488
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:02,206
Carte! I beg your pardon.

1489
01:41:02,457 --> 01:41:04,626
Let me introduce our Japanese guests.

1490
01:41:04,876 --> 01:41:08,004
Ladies. Mr D'Oyly Carte. Our proprietor.

1491
01:41:08,254 --> 01:41:10,381
- Please continue.
- Thank you very much.

1492
01:41:10,632 --> 01:41:12,759
Now. Miss Sixpence Please.

1493
01:41:13,009 --> 01:41:15,261
That performance
that you have witnessed...

1494
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:19,515
...was not even remotely Japanese.
Am I right?

1495
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:22,185
Japanese.

1496
01:41:24,604 --> 01:41:27,565
- Sir. Japanese?
- Japanese.

1497
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,943
- No.
- No.

1498
01:41:30,193 --> 01:41:32,654
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me, Mr Gilbert, sir.

1499
01:41:32,904 --> 01:41:35,782
- Japanese.
- Japanese.

1500
01:41:36,032 --> 01:41:38,201
- Yes.
- Yes.

1501
01:41:38,451 --> 01:41:42,413
- He hasn't got any idea what you mean.
- That's blatantly obvious, D'Auban!

1502
01:41:42,664 --> 01:41:45,500
<i>- Parlate italiano?
- If he doesn't speak English...</i>

1503
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:47,835
...he's hardly likely to speak Italian!

1504
01:41:48,086 --> 01:41:49,587
I beg your pardon, Mr Gilbert.

1505
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:51,839
<i>Porca miseria!
Non posso lavorare cosí!</i>

1506
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:53,633
It's a waste of time!

1507
01:41:53,883 --> 01:41:57,303
If you three ladies come with me,
please.

1508
01:41:57,553 --> 01:42:00,807
Please go to the back of the stage.
Thank you.

1509
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:04,227
Yes, yes. Come upstage.
As quickly as you can. Come along.

1510
01:42:04,477 --> 01:42:07,313
Thank you.

1511
01:42:07,563 --> 01:42:10,066
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much indeed.

1512
01:42:10,316 --> 01:42:12,777
One, two, three.

1513
01:42:13,027 --> 01:42:14,862
Very good. Thank you.

1514
01:42:15,113 --> 01:42:18,157
Now, what I would like you to do
when the music commences...

1515
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:20,493
...I would like you to advance downstage.

1516
01:42:20,743 --> 01:42:22,412
Thank you very much.

1517
01:42:22,662 --> 01:42:25,665
- Cellier.
- One, two. Two, two.

1518
01:42:25,915 --> 01:42:30,128
- Off you go. Come along.

1519
01:42:30,378 --> 01:42:31,546
Stop, stop!

1520
01:42:31,796 --> 01:42:34,799
Will this take long?
I'm to arrange a mazurka at four o'clock.

1521
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:36,968
I have not made myself clear.

1522
01:42:37,218 --> 01:42:41,306
When Mrs Russell commences playing
the pianoforte, diddle-dum, diddle-dee...

1523
01:42:41,556 --> 01:42:45,351
...what I would like you to do
is to advance downstage.

1524
01:42:45,602 --> 01:42:48,396
"Comme ça", diddle-dum, diddle-dee.

1525
01:42:48,646 --> 01:42:52,191
Do you understand?
I think you do. Let's try once more.

1526
01:42:52,442 --> 01:42:53,776
Cellier!

1527
01:42:54,027 --> 01:42:56,863
- One, two. Two, two.

1528
01:42:57,113 --> 01:43:00,575
Come along. That's it. Very good!

1529
01:43:00,825 --> 01:43:04,203
Excellent! That is exactly it!
Thank you very much indeed!

1530
01:43:04,454 --> 01:43:05,955
Excellent! First rate.

1531
01:43:06,205 --> 01:43:08,333
Thank you very much indeed.

1532
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:10,376
D'Auban, that is exactly what I want.

1533
01:43:10,627 --> 01:43:13,546
I do beg your pardon,
but I appear to have missed the point.

1534
01:43:13,796 --> 01:43:17,133
- That is the very effect I need.
- And what effect exactly is that?

1535
01:43:17,383 --> 01:43:19,594
- What did they do?
- They walked downstage.

1536
01:43:19,844 --> 01:43:22,472
They appeared to me to be
ambling along the Strand.

1537
01:43:22,722 --> 01:43:25,850
They walked downstage
in the Japanese manner!

1538
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:29,312
They walked in the Japanese manner
because they are Japanese.

1539
01:43:29,562 --> 01:43:33,149
Exactly! And that is precisely
why they are here.

1540
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:36,486
Our maids are not Japanese.
However, they are very funny.

1541
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:40,990
No funnier, however, than they would be
if they all sat down on pork pies.

1542
01:43:41,241 --> 01:43:44,035
- Young fella-me-lad, Mr Gilbert, sir.

1543
01:43:44,285 --> 01:43:46,871
I've arranged
Terpsichore, Chinese, Japanese...

1544
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:49,499
...for pantomime, burlesque
and the ballet...

1545
01:43:49,749 --> 01:43:52,001
...for many a season,
always to great acclaim.

1546
01:43:52,252 --> 01:43:54,796
D'Auban... this is not low burlesque.

1547
01:43:55,046 --> 01:43:58,883
This is an entirely original
Japanese opera.

1548
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:03,221
Miss Bond, Miss Braham and Miss Grey,
kindly resume your opening positions!

1549
01:44:03,471 --> 01:44:06,683
Please be seated once more.
Please be seated. Thank you.

1550
01:44:06,933 --> 01:44:09,769
Thank you!

1551
01:44:10,019 --> 01:44:13,481
Come along!
Come along, tortoise! Quickly, quickly!

1552
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:17,026
What I would like you to do now
is to perform it...

1553
01:44:17,277 --> 01:44:20,697
...just as you have seen our guests
perform it. Thank you very much.

1554
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:22,865
- Mr Gilbert!
- Yes, Jessie.

1555
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:26,828
- Is that "exactly" as we have just seen?
- Exactly!

1556
01:44:27,078 --> 01:44:29,956
Without using "Monsieur" D'Auban's steps,
Mr Gilbert?

1557
01:44:30,206 --> 01:44:32,875
I want you to perform it
precisely as you have seen...

1558
01:44:33,126 --> 01:44:36,045
...our Japanese friends perform it.
Thank you very much!

1559
01:44:36,296 --> 01:44:39,799
<i>- Exactement. C'est pas difficile.
- Very slowly and very boringly.</i>

1560
01:44:40,049 --> 01:44:41,593
One, two. Two, two.

1561
01:44:46,055 --> 01:44:47,890
Very good!

1562
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:50,101
First rate.

1563
01:44:50,351 --> 01:44:53,021
That is exactly right.
Thank you very much indeed!

1564
01:44:53,271 --> 01:44:57,609
That's as funny as when me tights caught
fire in Harlequin Meets ltchity-Switch.

1565
01:44:57,859 --> 01:44:59,652
Decorum in rehearsal, D'Auban.

1566
01:44:59,903 --> 01:45:01,821
That's the way, yes!

1567
01:45:02,071 --> 01:45:05,199
Very good indeed.

1568
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:07,535
Try them together, try them together.

1569
01:45:07,785 --> 01:45:10,371
Three of them, do it all together.
The same noise.

1570
01:45:10,622 --> 01:45:12,206
One, two, three!

1571
01:45:12,457 --> 01:45:14,375
Ah! Excellent!

1572
01:45:24,135 --> 01:45:25,845
# Three little maids from school are we

1573
01:45:26,095 --> 01:45:28,014
# Pert as a schoolgirl well can be

1574
01:45:28,264 --> 01:45:30,975
# Filled to the brim with girlish glee

1575
01:45:31,225 --> 01:45:32,101
# Three little maids from school

1576
01:45:32,352 --> 01:45:35,980
# Everything is a source of fun

1577
01:45:36,856 --> 01:45:40,151
# Nobody's safe for we care for none

1578
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:44,113
# Life is a joke that's just begun

1579
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:49,202
# Three little maids from school

1580
01:45:50,036 --> 01:45:51,955
# Three little maids who all unwary

1581
01:45:52,205 --> 01:45:54,249
# Come from a ladies' seminary

1582
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:57,043
# Freed from its genius tutelary

1583
01:45:57,293 --> 01:45:59,212
# Three little maids from school

1584
01:45:59,462 --> 01:46:03,841
# Three little maids from school

1585
01:46:07,804 --> 01:46:09,681
# One little maid is a bride, Yum-Yum

1586
01:46:09,931 --> 01:46:11,808
# Two little maids in attendance come

1587
01:46:12,058 --> 01:46:13,935
# Three little maids is the total sum

1588
01:46:14,185 --> 01:46:17,814
# Three little maids from school

1589
01:46:18,022 --> 01:46:20,233
# From three little maids take one away

1590
01:46:20,483 --> 01:46:22,235
# Two little maids remain and they

1591
01:46:22,485 --> 01:46:24,404
# Won't have to wait very long, they say

1592
01:46:24,654 --> 01:46:26,573
# Three little maids from school

1593
01:46:26,823 --> 01:46:28,825
# Three little maids from school

1594
01:46:29,075 --> 01:46:30,785
# Three little maids who all unwary

1595
01:46:31,035 --> 01:46:32,870
# Come from a ladies' seminary

1596
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:35,456
# Freed from its genius tutelary

1597
01:46:35,707 --> 01:46:37,750
# Three little maids from school

1598
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:43,423
# Three little maids from school

1599
01:46:47,468 --> 01:46:49,721
Laughing, ha ha, chaffing, ha ha

1600
01:46:49,971 --> 01:46:51,681
Nectar quaffing, ha ha ha haa,

1601
01:46:51,931 --> 01:46:54,517
But condemned to die is he,

1602
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:57,895
Wretched meritorious B.

1603
01:46:58,146 --> 01:47:00,732
Mikado leads Katisha off.

1604
01:47:00,982 --> 01:47:05,320
Off, up the stairs...

1605
01:47:07,322 --> 01:47:09,824
Thus... the traditional Japanese posture...

1606
01:47:10,074 --> 01:47:13,828
...as adopted by well-meaning
but misguided underlings...

1607
01:47:14,078 --> 01:47:16,748
...upon the departure
of their august superiors.

1608
01:47:16,998 --> 01:47:20,877
- Thank you.
- Is that a recognised Japanese attitude?

1609
01:47:21,127 --> 01:47:25,131
Not as yet, Grossmith. But I have every
confidence that it will become one.

1610
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:27,008
Much obliged.

1611
01:47:27,258 --> 01:47:31,387
I'm sure I've seen this
on a vase somewhere.

1612
01:47:32,847 --> 01:47:35,016
Jessie.

1613
01:47:35,266 --> 01:47:38,686
Thank you, Mr Gilbert.

1614
01:47:39,228 --> 01:47:42,023
Ha! A pretty picture! Eh, Seymour?

1615
01:47:42,273 --> 01:47:45,109
Charming, sir.

1616
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,864
The Mikado has left. Grossmith.

1617
01:47:50,448 --> 01:47:54,327
Well...
another fine mess you've got us into.

1618
01:47:54,577 --> 01:47:57,830
No! My line is,
'A nice mess you've got us into.'

1619
01:47:58,081 --> 01:48:01,417
And I should be much obliged
if you would play it "comme ça".

1620
01:48:01,668 --> 01:48:05,380
Well... a nice mess you've got us into.

1621
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:09,259
Righto, sir.

1622
01:48:11,052 --> 01:48:14,305
- Well...
- No! Well...

1623
01:48:14,555 --> 01:48:15,932
Well...

1624
01:48:16,182 --> 01:48:19,227
...a nice mess you've got us into...

1625
01:48:19,477 --> 01:48:23,815
...with your nodding head and
the deference due to a man of pedigree.

1626
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:27,819
Mr Grossmith,
you are under sentence of death...

1627
01:48:28,069 --> 01:48:30,238
...by something lingering.

1628
01:48:30,488 --> 01:48:33,032
Either boiling oil or melted lead.

1629
01:48:33,283 --> 01:48:37,704
Kindly bear that in mind. Thank you.

1630
01:48:37,954 --> 01:48:40,498
Well, a nice mess you've got us into...

1631
01:48:40,748 --> 01:48:45,545
...with your nodding head and
the deference due to a man of pedigree.

1632
01:48:45,795 --> 01:48:47,880
Merely corroborative detail...

1633
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:51,718
...intended to give artistic verisimilitude...

1634
01:48:51,968 --> 01:48:54,596
...to a bald and unconvincing narrative.

1635
01:48:54,846 --> 01:48:59,017
No, Barrington. An "otherwise" bald
and unconvincing narrative.

1636
01:48:59,267 --> 01:49:01,936
Was that incorrect? I do beg your pardon.

1637
01:49:02,186 --> 01:49:04,188
No, sir. It has only just occurred to me.

1638
01:49:04,439 --> 01:49:08,776
Oh! To an otherwise bald
and unconvincing narrative.

1639
01:49:09,027 --> 01:49:12,322
- Much better.
- Corrobatative detail indeed!

1640
01:49:12,572 --> 01:49:16,659
- Corroborative detail.
- Corrobatative.

1641
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:19,746
- Corroborative.
- Corroborative.

1642
01:49:19,996 --> 01:49:22,165
- Corroborative.
- Corroborative.

1643
01:49:22,415 --> 01:49:23,875
Thank you.

1644
01:49:24,125 --> 01:49:26,085
Splendid!

1645
01:49:26,336 --> 01:49:28,254
Corroborative detail indeed!

1646
01:49:28,504 --> 01:49:30,798
Corroborative fiddlestick!

1647
01:49:31,049 --> 01:49:33,509
And "you're" just as bad as he is...

1648
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,429
...with your cock-and-bull stories.
- Cock and "a" bull.

1649
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:41,225
Cock and a bull about catching his eye.

1650
01:49:41,476 --> 01:49:44,228
- Line?
- And his whistling an air.

1651
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:47,440
- And his whistling hair!

1652
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:51,569
- Boiling oil, Grossmith. Melted lead.
- Beg pardon, sir.

1653
01:49:51,819 --> 01:49:54,864
About catching his eye,
and his whistling an air.

1654
01:49:55,114 --> 01:49:58,493
But that's so like you!
You must stick your oar in.

1655
01:49:58,743 --> 01:50:03,289
- You must put in your oar.
- Over again.

1656
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:05,833
And "you're" just as bad as he is...

1657
01:50:06,084 --> 01:50:09,879
...with your cock-and-a-bull stories
about catching his eye...

1658
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:12,006
...and his whistling an air.

1659
01:50:12,257 --> 01:50:15,218
But that's so like you.
You must put your oar in.

1660
01:50:15,468 --> 01:50:18,846
- You must put in your oar.
- Over again.

1661
01:50:19,097 --> 01:50:21,599
You're just as bad as he is,
with your cock-and-a-bull stories...

1662
01:50:21,849 --> 01:50:23,935
...about catching his eye
and his whistling an air!

1663
01:50:24,185 --> 01:50:26,229
But that's so like you.
You must put in your oar!

1664
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:31,150
- But how about your big right arm?
- Yes, and your snickersnee.

1665
01:50:31,401 --> 01:50:34,070
Well, well, never mind that now.

1666
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,907
There's only one thing to be done.
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.

1667
01:50:38,157 --> 01:50:42,412
He must come to life again at once!

1668
01:50:42,662 --> 01:50:44,581
Appear! Appear!

1669
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:46,374
- # Appear!

1670
01:50:46,624 --> 01:50:49,377
Yes, now. Since Nanki-Poo
and Yum-Yum have decided...

1671
01:50:49,627 --> 01:50:51,754
...not to grace us with their presence...

1672
01:50:52,005 --> 01:50:58,845
...it would transpire, Mr Seymour, that
your moment of glory has finally arrived.

1673
01:50:59,137 --> 01:51:02,348
On your feet, slopkins!

1674
01:51:09,272 --> 01:51:11,608
Whence would you like us
both to enter, sir?

1675
01:51:11,858 --> 01:51:15,486
The honeymoon couple appear
at the upstage right entrance...

1676
01:51:15,737 --> 01:51:19,532
...travelling in a westerly direction
towards Knightsbridge.

1677
01:51:19,782 --> 01:51:22,535
But your journey is interrupted
by Mr Grossmith.

1678
01:51:22,785 --> 01:51:24,120
- Mr Gilbert.
- Jessie.

1679
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:27,165
- Might I use my stick?
- By all means. Are you troubled?

1680
01:51:27,415 --> 01:51:29,334
I'm quite all right, thank you.

1681
01:51:29,584 --> 01:51:31,836
- Well, well.
- Well, well.

1682
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:34,297
Well, well, never mind that now!

1683
01:51:34,547 --> 01:51:36,382
There's only one thing to be done.

1684
01:51:36,633 --> 01:51:38,801
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.

1685
01:51:39,052 --> 01:51:42,013
He must come to life again... at once!

1686
01:51:42,263 --> 01:51:45,475
- Here he comes.

1687
01:51:45,725 --> 01:51:49,938
'Ere... Nanki-Poo!

1688
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:54,025
I've good news for you. You're reprieved.

1689
01:51:54,275 --> 01:51:58,029
I beg your pardon, Mr Gilbert.
I have failed to provide a valise.

1690
01:51:58,279 --> 01:52:01,950
Indeed, Seymour. And you have also
failed to provide two actors.

1691
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:05,453
Pray continue.

1692
01:52:05,828 --> 01:52:08,498
Oh! But it's too late!

1693
01:52:08,748 --> 01:52:10,917
- I'm a dead man and I'm off...

1694
01:52:11,167 --> 01:52:12,585
...for my honeymoon.

1695
01:52:12,835 --> 01:52:14,170
Uncanny, is it not?

1696
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:19,384
Mr Seymour, please inform Mr Lely that
his services will no longer be required.

1697
01:52:19,634 --> 01:52:21,469
Thank you very much, sir.

1698
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:23,763
Nonsense!

1699
01:52:24,013 --> 01:52:27,016
A terrible thing has 'appened.
You're the son of the Mikado!

1700
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:30,311
A terrible thing "has" happened!
You've become a cockney!

1701
01:52:30,561 --> 01:52:34,023
I thought one would suggest
something of his lowly station...

1702
01:52:34,274 --> 01:52:36,150
...being a cheap tailor and all.

1703
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:40,238
Rubbish! We're in Japan,
not Stepney or Bow. Do it properly.

1704
01:52:40,488 --> 01:52:42,407
Oh. Very well.

1705
01:52:42,657 --> 01:52:48,454
Nonsense. A terrible thing has happened.
It seems you're the son of the Mikado.

1706
01:52:48,705 --> 01:52:51,791
Yes! But that happened some time ago.

1707
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:54,919
Is this a time for airy persiflidge?

1708
01:52:55,169 --> 01:52:56,629
Persiflage, Grossmith.

1709
01:52:56,879 --> 01:52:58,715
- Is it?
- It is.

1710
01:52:58,965 --> 01:53:01,593
Is this a time for airy persiflage?

1711
01:53:01,843 --> 01:53:03,553
Doesn't sound right to me.

1712
01:53:03,803 --> 01:53:06,347
Persiflage, mirage, fromage.

1713
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:09,017
- Decoupage.
- Exactly.

1714
01:53:09,267 --> 01:53:11,436
Your father is here...

1715
01:53:11,686 --> 01:53:13,605
...and with Ka-tisha.

1716
01:53:13,855 --> 01:53:17,567
- Katisha.
- It amuses me to say Ka- tisha.

1717
01:53:17,817 --> 01:53:21,070
It doesn't amuse me, Grossmith.
Nor does it scan.

1718
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:24,782
My father? And with Katisha?!

1719
01:53:25,033 --> 01:53:26,868
Yes, he wants you particularly.

1720
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:31,205
So does she.

1721
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,125
- Ooh, but he's married now!

1722
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:37,045
But bless my heart,
what has that to do with it?

1723
01:53:37,295 --> 01:53:43,718
Katisha claims me in marriage, but I can't
marry her because I'm married already.

1724
01:53:43,968 --> 01:53:47,680
Consequently,
she will insist on my execution...

1725
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:54,354
...and if I'm executed,
my wife will have to be buried alive.

1726
01:53:54,771 --> 01:53:57,315
You see our difficulty.

1727
01:53:57,565 --> 01:54:02,987
- Yes, I don't know what's to be done.
- Make as to leave. Stop him.

1728
01:54:03,029 --> 01:54:04,948
There's one chance for you.

1729
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:08,034
If you could persuade
Katisha to marry you...

1730
01:54:08,284 --> 01:54:11,079
...she would have no further claim on me.

1731
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:16,209
And in that case, I could come to life
without any fear of being put to death.

1732
01:54:16,459 --> 01:54:18,711
I? Marry Katisha?

1733
01:54:18,962 --> 01:54:22,340
I really think it's the only course.

1734
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:25,718
My good girl, have you seen her?
She's something awful.

1735
01:54:25,969 --> 01:54:27,887
- Appalling.
- Something appalling.

1736
01:54:28,137 --> 01:54:30,765
Ah... that's only her "face".

1737
01:54:31,015 --> 01:54:32,934
Ah, that's "only" her face.

1738
01:54:33,184 --> 01:54:35,687
She has a left elbow
which people come miles to see.

1739
01:54:35,937 --> 01:54:39,274
I'm told her right heeeeel
is much admired by connoisseuuuurs.

1740
01:54:39,524 --> 01:54:43,444
Could we do that line again, Barrington?
This time, try it in English.

1741
01:54:43,695 --> 01:54:47,448
I'm told her right heel
is much admired by connoisseurs.

1742
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:48,992
That better, sir?

1743
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:50,702
Marginally.

1744
01:54:50,952 --> 01:54:56,040
My good sir, I decline to pin my heart
upon any lady's right heel.

1745
01:54:56,291 --> 01:54:58,293
Make as to leave.

1746
01:54:58,543 --> 01:55:00,003
Stop him.

1747
01:55:00,253 --> 01:55:06,718
It comes to this. While Katisha is single,
I prefer to be a disembodied spirit.

1748
01:55:06,968 --> 01:55:09,095
When Katisha is married...

1749
01:55:09,345 --> 01:55:12,724
...existence will be as welcome
as the flowers in spring.

1750
01:55:12,974 --> 01:55:14,142
Tra la.

1751
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:17,437
Very good. Over again, if you please.

1752
01:55:27,322 --> 01:55:31,618
- And!

1753
01:56:06,527 --> 01:56:08,321
Thank you, gentlemen.

1754
01:56:08,571 --> 01:56:11,241
Not surprisingly...

1755
01:56:11,491 --> 01:56:16,621
...we were somewhat foxed
by the abbreviated, er... restatement.

1756
01:56:16,871 --> 01:56:19,540
Er... letter A.

1757
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:22,877
Discord bordering on cacophony.
Second fiddles?

1758
01:56:23,127 --> 01:56:26,714
- Indeed, Sir Arthur.
- My mistake. I do beg your pardon.

1759
01:56:26,965 --> 01:56:29,509
- My error, sir.
- I suspect we were a trifle early.

1760
01:56:29,759 --> 01:56:32,512
Indeed you were, Mr Harris.
And more than a trifle.

1761
01:56:32,762 --> 01:56:34,722
I really don't mind whose mistake...

1762
01:56:34,973 --> 01:56:40,770
...it was, Mr Plank,
as long as it doesn't happen again.

1763
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:45,692
The entry is on the third beat of the bar,
not the first. I think that's quite clear.

1764
01:56:45,942 --> 01:56:47,443
- Yes, sir.
- It is, sir, yes.

1765
01:56:47,694 --> 01:56:48,778
Very good.

1766
01:56:49,028 --> 01:56:52,574
And now, we return to Mr Hurley.

1767
01:56:52,824 --> 01:56:57,745
- Good morning, Mr Hurley!
- Good morning, Doctor Sullivan.

1768
01:56:58,246 --> 01:57:00,748
You was late, Mr 'Urley.

1769
01:57:03,251 --> 01:57:05,670
My profuse apologies to you, sir.

1770
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,297
Thank you.

1771
01:57:07,547 --> 01:57:10,425
I assumed it to be an error
on the part of the copyist.

1772
01:57:10,675 --> 01:57:13,219
The second beat
of the previous bar appeared...

1773
01:57:13,469 --> 01:57:16,598
...to me to be masquerading
as the first beat of the next.

1774
01:57:16,848 --> 01:57:19,183
Most alarming! But it was not.

1775
01:57:19,434 --> 01:57:22,729
Oh, indeed not, for which I do apologise,
Doctor Sullivan.

1776
01:57:22,979 --> 01:57:26,482
Mr Hurley, once again -
saving your blushes, maestro -

1777
01:57:26,733 --> 01:57:29,777
...Dr Sullivan is dead. Long live Sir Arthur.

1778
01:57:30,028 --> 01:57:32,822
Thank you, Mr Cellier.

1779
01:57:33,072 --> 01:57:35,366
- Mr Tripp.
- Sir?

1780
01:57:35,617 --> 01:57:38,661
Owing to the somewhat
tardy entry of Mr Hurley...

1781
01:57:38,912 --> 01:57:41,247
...you, quite understandably,
followed suit.

1782
01:57:41,497 --> 01:57:42,415
Absolutely, sir.

1783
01:57:42,665 --> 01:57:47,337
So assuming that Mr Hurley "does" enter
at the correct place, you will too.

1784
01:57:47,587 --> 01:57:51,049
- Assuming he does, sir, I will, sir.
- Very good.

1785
01:57:51,299 --> 01:57:53,134
- Thank you, Mr Tripp!
- Thank you, sir.

1786
01:57:53,384 --> 01:57:56,387
- Capital! Er, gentlemen...

1787
01:57:56,638 --> 01:58:01,684
...once more from the beginning, please.
I shall give you one bar.

1788
01:58:06,064 --> 01:58:08,650
# A more humane Mikado never

1789
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,818
# Did in Japan exist

1790
01:58:11,069 --> 01:58:16,324
# To nobody second I'm certainly
reckoned a true philanthropist

1791
01:58:16,574 --> 01:58:19,369
# It is my very humane endeavour

1792
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:22,622
# To make, to some extent

1793
01:58:22,872 --> 01:58:24,791
# Each evil liver

1794
01:58:25,041 --> 01:58:27,293
# A running river

1795
01:58:27,543 --> 01:58:32,298
# Of harmless merriment

1796
01:58:32,548 --> 01:58:34,550
# My object all sublime

1797
01:58:34,801 --> 01:58:37,095
# I shall achieve in time

1798
01:58:37,345 --> 01:58:39,389
# To let the punishment fit the crime

1799
01:58:39,639 --> 01:58:41,683
# The punishment fit the crime

1800
01:58:41,933 --> 01:58:44,394
# And make each prisoner pent

1801
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:46,646
# Unwillingly represent

1802
01:58:46,896 --> 01:58:49,440
# A source of innocent merriment

1803
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:53,319
# Of innocent merriment

1804
01:58:56,489 --> 01:58:58,324
# The advertising quack

1805
01:58:58,575 --> 01:59:00,994
# Who wearies with tales
of countless cures

1806
01:59:01,244 --> 01:59:02,954
# His teeth, I've enacted

1807
01:59:03,204 --> 01:59:05,665
# Shall all be extracted
by terrified amateurs

1808
01:59:05,915 --> 01:59:08,126
# The music-hall singer attends a series

1809
01:59:08,376 --> 01:59:10,211
# Of masses and fugues and ops

1810
01:59:10,461 --> 01:59:12,797
# By Bach interwoven
with Spohr and Beethoven

1811
01:59:13,047 --> 01:59:15,091
# At classical Monday pops

1812
01:59:15,341 --> 01:59:17,343
# The billiard sharp
whom anyone catches

1813
01:59:17,594 --> 01:59:19,846
# His doom's extremely hard

1814
01:59:20,096 --> 01:59:23,891
# He's made to dwell in a dungeon cell

1815
01:59:24,142 --> 01:59:26,853
# On a spot that's always barred

1816
01:59:27,103 --> 01:59:29,188
# And there he plays extravagant matches

1817
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:31,691
# In fitless fingerstalls

1818
01:59:31,941 --> 01:59:34,110
# On a cloth untrue

1819
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:36,321
# With a twisted cue

1820
01:59:36,571 --> 01:59:43,661
# And elliptical billiard balls

1821
01:59:43,912 --> 01:59:46,122
# My object all sublime

1822
01:59:46,372 --> 01:59:48,625
# I shall achieve in time

1823
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:50,877
# To let the punishment fit the crime

1824
01:59:51,127 --> 01:59:53,171
# The punishment fit the crime

1825
01:59:53,421 --> 01:59:55,465
# And make each prisoner pent

1826
01:59:55,715 --> 01:59:57,967
# Unwillingly represent

1827
01:59:58,217 --> 01:59:59,761
# A source of innocent merriment

1828
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:02,388
# Of innocent merriment

1829
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,682
# His object all sublime

1830
02:00:04,933 --> 02:00:06,851
# He will achieve in time

1831
02:00:07,101 --> 02:00:09,145
# To let the punishment fit the crime

1832
02:00:09,395 --> 02:00:11,481
# The punishment fit the crime

1833
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:13,733
# And make each prisoner pent

1834
02:00:13,983 --> 02:00:16,027
# Unwillingly represent

1835
02:00:16,277 --> 02:00:18,196
# A source of innocent merriment

1836
02:00:18,446 --> 02:00:22,325
# Of innocent merriment

1837
02:00:26,496 --> 02:00:28,414
Did I say come in?

1838
02:00:28,665 --> 02:00:31,376
You are required in the auditorium,
Mr Grossmith.

1839
02:00:31,626 --> 02:00:34,504
I requested five minutes' grace.

1840
02:00:34,754 --> 02:00:36,256
You've had eight, sir.

1841
02:00:36,506 --> 02:00:41,261
- Mayn't it wait until tomorrow?
- No, sir.

1842
02:00:49,602 --> 02:00:53,231
Thank you, Miss Braham.

1843
02:00:54,565 --> 02:00:56,693
Is that everyone, Seymour?

1844
02:00:56,943 --> 02:00:59,195
- All present and correct, Mr Gilbert.
- Good.

1845
02:00:59,445 --> 02:01:02,448
I won't keep you, ladies and gentlemen.

1846
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:07,662
We're all extremely tired
and looking forward to our beds.

1847
02:01:08,288 --> 02:01:11,499
Observations. The use of fans,
particularly in Act One...

1848
02:01:11,749 --> 02:01:13,418
...was flabby and erratic.

1849
02:01:13,668 --> 02:01:15,670
- Very scrappy.
- Indeed, D'Auban.

1850
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:20,133
We shall address this tomorrow afternoon
at two o'clock, Seymour.

1851
02:01:20,383 --> 02:01:21,884
Two of the clock.

1852
02:01:22,135 --> 02:01:24,470
Ko-Ko's entrance.
Mr Kent and Mr Cunningham.

1853
02:01:24,721 --> 02:01:28,558
Please ensure that you do not flinch
at Mr Grossmith's sword.

1854
02:01:28,808 --> 02:01:32,353
You must have confidence that
he is not about to chop off your heads.

1855
02:01:32,604 --> 02:01:35,982
Even if it may appear
that that is your inevitable fate.

1856
02:01:36,232 --> 02:01:37,692
I take it, Mr Grossmith...

1857
02:01:37,942 --> 02:01:42,155
...that today's performance
was an aberration.

1858
02:01:42,947 --> 02:01:45,116
Grossmith!

1859
02:01:45,366 --> 02:01:48,411
I beg your pardon, sir.
Were you addressing me?

1860
02:01:48,661 --> 02:01:51,080
I was indeed, sir. How are you?

1861
02:01:51,331 --> 02:01:53,082
Quite well, thank you.

1862
02:01:53,333 --> 02:01:55,752
I believe a good night's sleep
will cure all ills.

1863
02:01:56,002 --> 02:01:57,921
That I took to be the case.

1864
02:01:58,171 --> 02:02:01,049
Your performances were,
on the whole, promising.

1865
02:02:01,299 --> 02:02:05,011
Which is more than can be said,
alas, for that of the sliding doors.

1866
02:02:06,971 --> 02:02:09,599
One of which might have
thought it was in Japan.

1867
02:02:09,849 --> 02:02:14,145
The other was labouring under the
delusion it was on holiday in Yorkshire.

1868
02:02:17,523 --> 02:02:19,943
- Where was the man?
- Rest assured, Mr Barker...

1869
02:02:20,193 --> 02:02:22,612
...that tomorrow night
he will be with us in Japan.

1870
02:02:22,862 --> 02:02:24,530
Capital.

1871
02:02:24,781 --> 02:02:27,992
Now. Cuts. There is only one.

1872
02:02:28,243 --> 02:02:33,081
In Act Two, the Mikado's song.

1873
02:02:35,792 --> 02:02:38,544
- I beg your pardon, Mr Gilbert?
- Yes, Miss Brandram.

1874
02:02:38,795 --> 02:02:41,756
Surely you can't mean Mr Temple's solo?

1875
02:02:42,006 --> 02:02:45,467
That is exactly what I mean.

1876
02:02:45,468 --> 02:02:48,513
- I do think that's a shame, sir.
- It's a dreadful shame.

1877
02:02:48,763 --> 02:02:52,392
Hear, hear.

1878
02:02:55,895 --> 02:02:57,480
- My dear Mr Gilbert.
- Temple.

1879
02:02:57,730 --> 02:03:02,402
I am fully aware that the standard of
my singing was not quite up to the mark.

1880
02:03:02,652 --> 02:03:04,737
Your singing was exemplary, Temple.

1881
02:03:04,988 --> 02:03:09,867
But I can assure you that once
I have mastered the leg business...

1882
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:13,496
...I shall most certainly
be at liberty to serve the lyric.

1883
02:03:13,746 --> 02:03:16,291
I do apologise.
I have not made myself clear.

1884
02:03:16,541 --> 02:03:20,336
My decision to cut the song in no way
reflects upon your performance...

1885
02:03:20,587 --> 02:03:23,131
...which was fine in every respect.

1886
02:03:23,381 --> 02:03:26,467
Fault, if there is one,
lies in my obtuse decision...

1887
02:03:26,718 --> 02:03:29,012
...to write the thing in the first place.

1888
02:03:29,262 --> 02:03:32,432
I have nothing more to say.
Thank you very much. Sullivan?

1889
02:03:32,682 --> 02:03:35,977
Excuse me.

1890
02:03:43,526 --> 02:03:45,153
Ladies and gentlemen.

1891
02:03:45,403 --> 02:03:49,490
If I might presume to take
a few more moments of your time.

1892
02:03:49,741 --> 02:03:52,535
I should like to thank
you all most passionately...

1893
02:03:52,785 --> 02:03:56,956
...for your tremendous hard work and
application during these last few weeks.

1894
02:03:57,206 --> 02:03:59,042
And if I may say so...

1895
02:03:59,292 --> 02:04:02,170
...the contribution of the chorus
was particularly fine.

1896
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:06,049
I'm immensely proud of you all.

1897
02:04:06,299 --> 02:04:08,551
I do not wish to tempt the fates...

1898
02:04:08,801 --> 02:04:13,306
...but I feel that we will have
a great success.

1899
02:04:13,556 --> 02:04:15,475
I have nothing further to add.

1900
02:04:15,725 --> 02:04:18,061
Only remember...

1901
02:04:18,311 --> 02:04:23,358
<i>... voce, voce, voce. Buonanotte a tutti.</i>

1902
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:25,818
Now then, young fella-me-lads.

1903
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:28,488
The Terpsichore was
executed magnifiquely...

1904
02:04:28,738 --> 02:04:32,575
...notwithstanding the Topsy-Turvydom
befuddling Mr Ko-Ko's entrance.

1905
02:04:32,825 --> 02:04:36,204
Otherwise,
# In the sea, in the sea, in the sea...

1906
02:04:36,454 --> 02:04:41,376
...fans out on sea, not in. "Bonsoir."

1907
02:04:41,626 --> 02:04:43,670
Should any gent require a libation...

1908
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,423
...I shall be shortly located
at The Coal Hole with Mr Johnny Ward.

1909
02:04:47,674 --> 02:04:50,093
Thank you, Johnny.

1910
02:04:50,343 --> 02:04:52,220
Excellent. "Bravissimi."

1911
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:54,222
A splendid achievement.

1912
02:04:54,472 --> 02:04:56,391
Be confident...

1913
02:04:56,641 --> 02:04:58,559
...and may you have a good night's rest.

1914
02:04:58,810 --> 02:05:00,103
Miss Lenoir.

1915
02:05:00,353 --> 02:05:02,689
My thanks and congratulations to you all.

1916
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:05,900
To hasten you to your slumbers,
cabs have been ordered...

1917
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:09,404
...and will meet you at the stage door
as soon as you are ready.

1918
02:05:09,654 --> 02:05:13,366
Please share a cab with a neighbour.
Remember, we're not made of money.

1919
02:05:13,616 --> 02:05:17,453
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1920
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:24,877
- I felt so terrible.
- Oh, so did I!

1921
02:05:25,128 --> 02:05:28,047
My heart broke for him.
I can't bear to see a man cry.

1922
02:05:28,298 --> 02:05:30,174
- Was he crying?
- He was crushed.

1923
02:05:30,425 --> 02:05:32,468
- Really sad.
- And he's so awfully funny!

1924
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:35,096
Some people only come
to see Mr Temple perform.

1925
02:05:35,346 --> 02:05:39,309
My cousins are always asking about him.
They already have their tickets.

1926
02:05:39,559 --> 02:05:43,479
- They'll want their money back now!
- There are other people in this piece!

1927
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:45,648
He's hardly in it now, though, is he?

1928
02:05:45,898 --> 02:05:48,776
- He's playing the Mikado.
- Thank you, Violet!

1929
02:05:49,027 --> 02:05:51,321
- Will you be long, Catherine?
- No, I shan't.

1930
02:05:51,571 --> 02:05:53,281
I wish we could do something.

1931
02:05:53,531 --> 02:05:56,159
There ain't.
Mr Gilbert's decided and that's that.

1932
02:05:56,409 --> 02:05:59,913
With Mr Gilbert, one never knows.
Particularly before a first night.

1933
02:06:00,163 --> 02:06:02,248
I suggest we get a good night's sleep.

1934
02:06:02,498 --> 02:06:04,417
Absolutely. I'm certainly off.

1935
02:06:04,667 --> 02:06:07,003
I think you should all
mind your own business.

1936
02:06:07,253 --> 02:06:10,590
- Good night!
- That was a little uncalled- for!

1937
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:15,094
Good night, girls!
I don't want to be late for supper.

1938
02:06:15,345 --> 02:06:17,221
Oh, Bunny, you look charming!

1939
02:06:17,472 --> 02:06:19,974
It's a fine comic song.
He sings it splendidly.

1940
02:06:20,224 --> 02:06:22,727
Does the paying audience
not deserve to hear it?

1941
02:06:22,977 --> 02:06:24,771
I agree, Walter. They do.

1942
02:06:25,021 --> 02:06:26,940
Rotten luck for poor old Temple.

1943
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:30,944
- I'm not convinced it's an immortal song.
- Nobody said it was, Mr Lewis!

1944
02:06:31,194 --> 02:06:33,029
It's not the Holy Grail!

1945
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:35,782
Despite your reservations
about the song...

1946
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:38,660
...you must concede
it is an original performance.

1947
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:41,079
He should have cut
one of Grossmith's songs.

1948
02:06:41,329 --> 02:06:44,374
- Mr Grossmith is poorly.
- Then he should have stayed at home.

1949
02:06:44,624 --> 02:06:47,710
I think it's a misjudgement.
Someone should tell him.

1950
02:06:47,961 --> 02:06:49,712
- Tell who?
- Gilbert.

1951
02:06:49,963 --> 02:06:52,966
- He's only a man, like the rest of us.

1952
02:06:53,216 --> 02:06:55,134
He's not the devil incarnate.

1953
02:06:55,385 --> 02:06:57,553
He scares the living daylights out of me.

1954
02:06:57,804 --> 02:07:00,807
- What about us?
- Beg pardon, Price?

1955
02:07:01,057 --> 02:07:04,143
- Why can't "we" speak to Mr Gilbert?

1956
02:07:04,394 --> 02:07:07,605
Well, we could all go together.

1957
02:07:07,855 --> 02:07:10,650
There's no reason why we shouldn't.

1958
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:12,193
Is there?

1959
02:07:12,443 --> 02:07:15,863
Tell a man you admire his lyrics,
he can only be gratified.

1960
02:07:16,114 --> 02:07:18,324
It's a splendid notion, Mr Price.

1961
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:20,702
Well, here's food for thought.

1962
02:07:20,952 --> 02:07:25,748
Gentlemen, I have been a chorister
in this company for 28 seasons.

1963
02:07:25,999 --> 02:07:29,043
It is my intention to remain one
for at least another 28.

1964
02:07:29,294 --> 02:07:32,088
- I'm sure you shall.
- Be very careful, Mr Price.

1965
02:07:32,338 --> 02:07:34,257
You must consider yourself...

1966
02:07:34,507 --> 02:07:36,259
...and your position.

1967
02:07:36,509 --> 02:07:38,845
This is tantamount
to professional suicide.

1968
02:07:39,095 --> 02:07:41,014
Oh, WJ, that is a little excessive...

1969
02:07:41,264 --> 02:07:44,809
Gentlemen, let us repair
to The Coal Hole in the Strand.

1970
02:07:45,059 --> 02:07:47,937
Don't be long, chaps.

1971
02:07:48,187 --> 02:07:50,398
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

1972
02:07:50,648 --> 02:07:52,442
- Take heart.
- You'll be wonderful.

1973
02:07:52,692 --> 02:07:53,568
Quite so.

1974
02:07:53,818 --> 02:07:56,195
Is that not right, wee Durward?

1975
02:07:56,446 --> 02:07:58,281
Ach, he'll be grand, Helen.

1976
02:07:58,531 --> 02:08:00,575
This has taken us all quite by surprise.

1977
02:08:00,825 --> 02:08:03,578
And we all know Mr Gilbert.

1978
02:08:03,828 --> 02:08:06,039
- I'd have thought it was a fine song.
- It is.

1979
02:08:06,289 --> 02:08:07,165
Thank you.

1980
02:08:07,415 --> 02:08:11,794
Is there anything
we can arrange for you, Mr Temple?

1981
02:08:12,045 --> 02:08:14,172
No, thank you, Miss Lenoir.

1982
02:08:14,422 --> 02:08:17,300
I'll be fine.

1983
02:08:17,550 --> 02:08:19,677
It's very late. Congratulations, Lely.

1984
02:08:19,928 --> 02:08:23,681
- First class.
- Ach, no. Did you think so?

1985
02:08:23,932 --> 02:08:25,433
- Oh, yes.
- Better and better.

1986
02:08:25,683 --> 02:08:27,602
Thank you. "Grazie. Grazie."

1987
02:08:27,852 --> 02:08:29,854
- The Beefsteak?
- I'm ravenous.

1988
02:08:30,104 --> 02:08:32,273
- Gentlemen, good night.
- Good night.

1989
02:08:32,523 --> 02:08:34,567
- Good night, Butt!
- Good night.

1990
02:08:34,817 --> 02:08:38,488
Dickie! "Courage."

1991
02:08:42,867 --> 02:08:46,663
Well, there you have it, Dickie.

1992
02:08:46,913 --> 02:08:50,959
He's an absolute bastard.

1993
02:08:51,209 --> 02:08:53,586
I knew something of this order
would happen.

1994
02:08:53,836 --> 02:08:56,965
I sensed it, I told you so!

1995
02:08:57,215 --> 02:09:01,427
This really is unconscionably cruel.

1996
02:09:01,678 --> 02:09:05,765
You've missed your last train, Dickie.

1997
02:09:05,848 --> 02:09:08,393
It's too late to telegraph
the Mrs Temple now.

1998
02:09:08,643 --> 02:09:10,561
What'll you do?

1999
02:09:10,812 --> 02:09:17,193
I suppose I shall toddle across the river
to my mother's. She never sleeps.

2000
02:09:18,695 --> 02:09:21,281
There's g'aye few like us...

2001
02:09:21,531 --> 02:09:24,742
...and they're all dead.

2002
02:09:24,993 --> 02:09:26,911
My father used to say that.

2003
02:09:27,161 --> 02:09:29,080
Laughter.

2004
02:09:29,330 --> 02:09:31,249
Tears.

2005
02:09:31,499 --> 02:09:35,128
Curtain.

2006
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:46,598
- Good afternoon, Bovill.
- Good afternoon, Mr Gilbert.

2007
02:09:46,848 --> 02:09:49,809
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Miss Russell.

2008
02:09:50,059 --> 02:09:52,604
Good afternoon, Rhys... Good heavens!

2009
02:09:52,854 --> 02:09:55,023
- Afternoon, Mr Gilbert.
- Good afternoon.

2010
02:09:55,273 --> 02:09:59,068
- Might you, er... spare us a moment?
- Of course, we're here to rehearse!

2011
02:09:59,319 --> 02:10:02,238
- Please, Mr Gilbert, sir.
- Yes, Price, what is it?

2012
02:10:02,488 --> 02:10:06,117
- We, er...
- Hmm?!

2013
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:10,872
The... ladies and gentlemen
of the chorus...

2014
02:10:11,122 --> 02:10:13,041
Yes?

2015
02:10:13,291 --> 02:10:17,754
Concerning Mr Temple's song, sir.

2016
02:10:18,004 --> 02:10:20,506
Ah, the Mikado's song.

2017
02:10:20,757 --> 02:10:22,008
Yes, sir.

2018
02:10:22,258 --> 02:10:24,510
What of that mercifully
released aberration?

2019
02:10:24,761 --> 02:10:29,557
- We all consider it... a very fine song, sir.
- Indeed we do.

2020
02:10:29,807 --> 02:10:31,517
Gratifying, I'm sure.

2021
02:10:31,768 --> 02:10:34,354
That must be a matter of opinion,
mustn't it, Price?

2022
02:10:34,604 --> 02:10:39,108
Well, yes, Mr Gilbert,
but we believe it a great loss.

2023
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:41,611
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.

2024
02:10:41,861 --> 02:10:45,198
Especially after all our
extremely hard work.

2025
02:10:45,448 --> 02:10:47,450
And, of course, Mr Temple.

2026
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:51,621
I'm really very sorry for you,
but as we all know, it's an unjust world.

2027
02:10:51,871 --> 02:10:54,958
We all feel it would have been
of great benefit to the opera.

2028
02:10:55,208 --> 02:10:57,627
And that perhaps
the audience should decide.

2029
02:10:57,877 --> 02:11:00,213
Is this the considered opinion of you all?

2030
02:11:00,463 --> 02:11:02,173
It is, sir.

2031
02:11:02,423 --> 02:11:05,468
- I am not party to this, Mr Gilbert.
- Ah, Mr Kent.

2032
02:11:05,718 --> 02:11:09,764
As ever, the sole voice of reason.

2033
02:11:10,014 --> 02:11:13,142
Temple, what do you make
of this occurrence?

2034
02:11:13,393 --> 02:11:15,311
I do beg your pardon, Mr Gilbert.

2035
02:11:15,561 --> 02:11:19,482
But I have absolutely no idea
what is taking place.

2036
02:11:19,732 --> 02:11:24,070
There has been a request
that your song be reinstated.

2037
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,239
Ah.

2038
02:11:26,489 --> 02:11:28,658
Ah.

2039
02:11:28,908 --> 02:11:31,286
A most forceful request, I have to say.

2040
02:11:31,536 --> 02:11:33,162
Afternoon!

2041
02:11:33,413 --> 02:11:34,956
Do clear the way.

2042
02:11:35,206 --> 02:11:36,791
Oh. I beg your pardon, sir.

2043
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:42,130
This is surprising indeed,
ladies and gentlemen.

2044
02:11:43,464 --> 02:11:47,093
And somewhat overwhelming.

2045
02:11:50,096 --> 02:11:54,934
Temple. Would you be prepared to sing
the song at this evening's performance?

2046
02:11:55,184 --> 02:11:58,521
Yes, sir. I would.

2047
02:12:09,991 --> 02:12:12,869
Then please be so good as to do so.

2048
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:16,289
- Hip-hip...

2049
02:12:16,539 --> 02:12:18,833
- Hooray!
- Rehearsals in five minutes.

2050
02:12:19,083 --> 02:12:20,919
Seymour, where's D'Auban?

2051
02:12:21,169 --> 02:12:26,215
- Congratulations, Temple.
- Thank you, good chappie.

2052
02:12:26,883 --> 02:12:29,552
Right you are, Pidgeon!
Come along! Make haste!

2053
02:12:29,802 --> 02:12:33,556
- Sir, it's seven o'clock, sir.
- Ah, there you are, Willie.

2054
02:12:33,806 --> 02:12:36,726
Willie! Willie!!

2055
02:12:36,976 --> 02:12:39,771
The carriage is waiting, sir.

2056
02:12:40,021 --> 02:12:42,774
Sir!

2057
02:12:43,024 --> 02:12:45,693
- Out of my way, Pidgeon!
- I do apologise, sir.

2058
02:12:45,944 --> 02:12:50,698
Willie! We must be leaving!

2059
02:12:50,990 --> 02:12:53,409
We don't want to be late.

2060
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:56,913
- You look beautiful, madam.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs Judd.

2061
02:12:57,163 --> 02:12:59,707
Oh, it's most pleasant to be appreciated.

2062
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:03,211
Don't worry, madam.

2063
02:13:15,473 --> 02:13:19,435
- Good evening, Cook.
- Evening, sir.

2064
02:13:21,145 --> 02:13:23,481
- Come in!

2065
02:13:23,731 --> 02:13:27,151
- GG!
- Arthur!

2066
02:13:27,402 --> 02:13:29,737
- Your very good health.
- Yours too, Arthur.

2067
02:13:29,988 --> 02:13:32,240
- Splendid piece.
- Thank you.

2068
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:34,701
We shall both be splendid tonight.

2069
02:13:34,951 --> 02:13:36,869
Too many words.

2070
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:41,708
- I thought I'd just pop in.
- Much appreciated.

2071
02:13:41,709 --> 02:13:43,835
So very frightened of losing...

2072
02:13:44,085 --> 02:13:46,629
One had to stay by the door,
don't you know?

2073
02:13:46,879 --> 02:13:50,592
- I beg your pardon?
- £50 per week isn't too much to ask.

2074
02:13:50,842 --> 02:13:53,011
Behaves more like a man than a woman.

2075
02:13:53,261 --> 02:13:54,637
GG.

2076
02:13:54,887 --> 02:13:58,182
- Try to remember to breathe properly.
- Yes, yes, yes.

2077
02:13:58,433 --> 02:14:00,768
This year... next year.

2078
02:14:01,019 --> 02:14:02,937
Too much noise.

2079
02:14:03,187 --> 02:14:06,232
George. Shall we fetch you a doctor?

2080
02:14:06,482 --> 02:14:08,318
I know doctors!

2081
02:14:08,568 --> 02:14:10,987
Coming in here,
picking and fussing over one!

2082
02:14:11,237 --> 02:14:14,115
Magnetising the children.

2083
02:14:14,365 --> 02:14:17,619
We shall have a great triumph, you know.

2084
02:14:17,869 --> 02:14:21,497
What is the time, by the way?

2085
02:14:22,874 --> 02:14:25,710
A quarter past.
The dreaded hour approaches.

2086
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:27,712
Now...

2087
02:14:27,962 --> 02:14:31,591
Take a deep breath.

2088
02:14:36,429 --> 02:14:38,473
Very good.

2089
02:14:38,723 --> 02:14:40,391
- Who is it?
- Gilbert.

2090
02:14:40,642 --> 02:14:43,311
Do come in, Mr Gilbert.

2091
02:14:43,561 --> 02:14:46,439
- A brief intrusion.
- How are you, Mr Gilbert?

2092
02:14:46,689 --> 02:14:49,025
As well as any condemned man
can expect.

2093
02:14:49,275 --> 02:14:53,363
- How are you, ladies?
- Oh, a little anxious, Mr Gilbert.

2094
02:14:53,613 --> 02:14:56,741
You have every right to be anxious
under the circumstances.

2095
02:14:56,991 --> 02:14:59,410
I don't suppose
you'll be with us this evening.

2096
02:14:59,661 --> 02:15:02,580
Indeed not. Why on earth
should I consort with the foe?

2097
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:06,209
Oh, but I'm quite sure
we shall have a great success, Mr Gilbert.

2098
02:15:06,459 --> 02:15:08,711
I wish I possessed your confidence.

2099
02:15:08,962 --> 02:15:10,672
Well, Jessie!

2100
02:15:10,922 --> 02:15:12,173
<i>Bonne chance!</i>

2101
02:15:12,423 --> 02:15:14,676
- Thank you.
- And you, tortoise.

2102
02:15:14,926 --> 02:15:17,720
Thank you, Mr Gilbert.

2103
02:15:17,971 --> 02:15:21,391
Very good.

2104
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:25,353
I shall put on my kimono now,
please, Emily.

2105
02:15:25,603 --> 02:15:29,232
Oh! Very well, Miss Braham.

2106
02:15:36,489 --> 02:15:38,074
- Good evening, Cook.
- Sir.

2107
02:15:38,324 --> 02:15:41,035
- Is Mr Grossmith respectable?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

2108
02:15:41,286 --> 02:15:46,624
- We'll return later, George.
- Oh, thank you.

2109
02:15:48,126 --> 02:15:50,253
- Good evening.
- Sir.

2110
02:15:50,503 --> 02:15:51,796
No, Cookie!

2111
02:15:52,046 --> 02:15:53,881
- Gilbert!
- I beg your pardon, sir.

2112
02:15:54,132 --> 02:15:55,466
May I come in?

2113
02:15:55,717 --> 02:15:57,594
I'm in my birthday suit.

2114
02:15:57,844 --> 02:16:00,930
- Ah. Are we not receiving?
- No, sir.

2115
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:04,058
Good luck, Grossmith!
And be careful with the sword.

2116
02:16:04,309 --> 02:16:05,101
Righto!

2117
02:16:05,351 --> 02:16:07,645
- Walk, boy!
- Yes, sir.

2118
02:16:07,895 --> 02:16:09,439
Permission, Mr Cook.

2119
02:16:09,689 --> 02:16:11,608
Permission withheld, sir. On your way.

2120
02:16:11,858 --> 02:16:14,944
Thank you, sir. Good luck, sir.

2121
02:16:15,194 --> 02:16:18,615
Five minutes, sir.

2122
02:16:58,821 --> 02:17:01,658
# Miya sama, miya sama

2123
02:17:01,908 --> 02:17:04,911

# From every kind of man

# Obedience I expect

2134
02:18:08,766 --> 02:18:10,935
# I'm the Emperor of Japan

2135
02:18:11,185 --> 02:18:14,772
# And I'm his daughter-in-law elect

2136
02:18:15,023 --> 02:18:16,316
# He'll marry his son

2137
02:18:16,566 --> 02:18:18,568
# He's only got one

2138
02:18:18,818 --> 02:18:21,154
# To his daughter-in-law elect

2139
02:18:21,404 --> 02:18:23,364
# My morals have been declared

2140
02:18:23,615 --> 02:18:27,452
# Particularly correct

2141
02:18:27,702 --> 02:18:28,995
# But they're nothing at all

2142
02:18:29,245 --> 02:18:33,875
# Compared with those
of his daughter-in-law elect

2143
02:18:34,125 --> 02:18:35,835
# Bow!

2144
02:18:36,085 --> 02:18:36,961
# Bow

02:18:59,150 --> 02:19:02,195
# I govern each tribe and sect

2150
02:19:02,445 --> 02:19:04,739
# All cheerfully own my sway

2151
02:19:04,989 --> 02:19:08,785
# Except his daughter-in-law elect

2152
02:19:09,035 --> 02:19:10,536
# As tough as a bone

2153
02:19:10,787 --> 02:19:12,163
# With a will of her own

2154
02:19:12,413 --> 02:19:15,166
# Is his daughter-in-law elect

# My freedom from all defect

2157
02:19:21,756 --> 02:19:23,925
# Is insignificant quite

2158
02:19:24,175 --> 02:19:28,096
# Compared with his daughter-in-law elect

2159
02:19:28,346 --> 02:19:31,266

# A more humane Mikado never

2164
02:19:58,751 --> 02:20:02,422
# Did in Japan exist

2165
02:20:14,225 --> 02:20:16,144
- Get off!
- Be good, be good.

2166
02:20:16,394 --> 02:20:18,396
- What are you do...?
- I'm good, I'm good.

2167
02:20:18,646 --> 02:20:22,317
- Get your hands off me!
- Oh, don't rub your smell off on me!

2168
02:20:22,567 --> 02:20:26,613
You stinking bitch!
Just let me go, you cow!

2169
02:20:26,863 --> 02:20:30,491
- Oh, you're a lovely big boy!
- Don't touch me!

2170
02:20:30,742 --> 02:20:36,414
Who made the world, arsehole?!

2171
02:20:46,758 --> 02:20:50,386
# The criminal cried
as he dropped him down

2172
02:20:50,637 --> 02:20:53,765
# In a state of wild alarm

2173
02:20:54,015 --> 02:20:57,769
# With a frightful frantic fearful frown

2174
02:20:58,019 --> 02:21:01,230
# I bared my big right arm

2175
02:21:01,481 --> 02:21:05,068
# I seized him by his little pigtail

2176
02:21:05,318 --> 02:21:07,237
# And on his knees

2177
02:21:07,487 --> 02:21:08,988
# Fell he

2178
02:21:09,239 --> 02:21:12,533
# As he squirmed and struggled
and gurgled and guggled

2179
02:21:12,784 --> 02:21:17,288
# I drew my snickersnee

2180
02:21:17,538 --> 02:21:22,085
# My snickersnee

2181
02:21:22,335 --> 02:21:25,296
# Never shall I forget the cry

2182
02:21:25,546 --> 02:21:29,717
# Or the shriek that shriek-ed he

2183
02:21:29,968 --> 02:21:32,804
# As I gnashed my teeth
when from its sheath

2184
02:21:33,054 --> 02:21:36,266
# I drew my snickersnee

2185
02:21:36,516 --> 02:21:37,892
# We know him well

2186
02:21:38,142 --> 02:21:40,019
# He cannot tell

2187
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:43,731
# Untrue or groundless tales

2188
02:21:43,982 --> 02:21:47,569
# He always tries to utter lies

2189
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:51,072
# And every time he fails

2190
02:21:51,322 --> 02:21:54,909
# He shivered and shook
as he gave the sign

2191
02:21:55,159 --> 02:21:58,663
# For the stroke he didn't deserve

2192
02:21:58,913 --> 02:22:00,373
# When all of a sudden

2193
02:22:00,623 --> 02:22:02,166
# His eye met mine

2194
02:22:02,417 --> 02:22:05,837
# And it seemed to brace his nerve

2195
02:22:06,087 --> 02:22:07,589
# For he nodded his head

2196
02:22:07,839 --> 02:22:09,757
# And kissed his hand

2197
02:22:10,008 --> 02:22:13,052
# And he whistled an air, did he

2198
02:22:13,303 --> 02:22:15,388
# As the sabre true

2199
02:22:15,638 --> 02:22:17,265
# Cut cleanly through

2200
02:22:17,515 --> 02:22:21,936
# His cervical vertebrae

2201
02:22:22,186 --> 02:22:26,774
# His vertebrae

2202
02:22:27,025 --> 02:22:28,651
# When a man's afraid

2203
02:22:28,902 --> 02:22:30,320
# A beautiful maid

2204
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:34,032
# Is a cheering sight to see

2205
02:22:34,282 --> 02:22:35,950
# And it's oh, I'm glad

2206
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,702
# That moment sad

2207
02:22:37,952 --> 02:22:41,331
# Was soothed by sight of me

2208
02:22:41,581 --> 02:22:43,249
# Her terrible tale

2209
02:22:43,499 --> 02:22:45,335
# You can't assail

2210
02:22:45,585 --> 02:22:48,755
# With truth it quite agrees

2211
02:22:49,005 --> 02:22:50,715
# Her taste exact

2212
02:22:50,965 --> 02:22:52,467
# For faultless fact

2213
02:22:52,717 --> 02:22:56,179
# Amounts to a disease

2214
02:22:56,429 --> 02:22:58,014
# Now though you'd have said

2215
02:22:58,264 --> 02:22:59,682
# That head was dead

2216
02:22:59,933 --> 02:23:03,478
# For its owner dead was he

2217
02:23:03,728 --> 02:23:05,104
# It stood on its neck

2218
02:23:05,355 --> 02:23:07,106
# With a smile well-bred

2219
02:23:07,357 --> 02:23:10,068
# And bowed three times to me!

2220
02:23:10,318 --> 02:23:13,905
# It was none of
your impudent offhand nods

2221
02:23:14,155 --> 02:23:17,784
# But as humble as could be

2222
02:23:18,034 --> 02:23:19,869
# For it clearly knew

2223
02:23:20,119 --> 02:23:21,663
# The deference due

2224
02:23:21,913 --> 02:23:26,334
# To a man of pedigree

2225
02:23:26,584 --> 02:23:31,047
# Of pedigree

2226
02:23:31,297 --> 02:23:33,049
# And it's oh, I vow

2227
02:23:33,299 --> 02:23:35,134
# This deathly bow

2228
02:23:35,385 --> 02:23:38,012
# Was a touching sight to see

2229
02:23:38,263 --> 02:23:40,098
# Though trunkless yet

2230
02:23:40,348 --> 02:23:41,724
# It couldn't forget

2231
02:23:41,975 --> 02:23:45,478
# The deference due to me

2232
02:23:45,728 --> 02:23:47,313
# This haughty youth

2233
02:23:47,563 --> 02:23:49,315
# He speaks the truth

2234
02:23:49,565 --> 02:23:52,902
# Whenever he finds it pays

2235
02:23:53,152 --> 02:23:54,571
# And in this case

2236
02:23:54,821 --> 02:23:56,447
# It all took place

2237
02:23:56,698 --> 02:23:59,075
# Exactly as he says

2238
02:23:59,325 --> 02:24:02,078
# Exactly, exactly, exactly

2239
02:24:02,328 --> 02:24:12,046
# Exactly as he says

2240
02:24:24,350 --> 02:24:27,270
- # For he's gone and married Yum-Yum
- # Yum-Yum

2241
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,355
# Your anger pray bury
for all will be merry

2242
02:24:29,606 --> 02:24:31,941
- # I think you had better succumb
- # Cumb-cumb

2243
02:24:32,191 --> 02:24:34,110
# And join our expressions of glee

2244
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:36,613
- # On this subject I pray you be dumb
- # Dumb-dumb

2245
02:24:36,863 --> 02:24:39,032
# Your notions, though many
are not worth a penny

2246
02:24:39,282 --> 02:24:41,618
- # The word for your guidance is mum
- # Mum-mum

2247
02:24:41,868 --> 02:24:43,786
# You've a very good bargain in me

2248
02:24:44,037 --> 02:24:46,372
# On this subject we pray
you be dumb, dumb-dumb

2249
02:24:46,623 --> 02:24:48,708
# We think you had better
succumb, cumb-cumb

2250
02:24:48,958 --> 02:24:50,585
# You'll find there are many

2251
02:24:50,835 --> 02:24:53,212
# Who'll wed for a penny,
who'll wed for a penny

2252
02:24:53,463 --> 02:24:55,423
# There are lots of good fish in the sea

2253
02:24:55,673 --> 02:24:57,842
# There are lots of good fish in the sea

2254
02:24:58,092 --> 02:25:00,094
# There's lots of good fish,
good fish in the sea

2255
02:25:00,345 --> 02:25:02,889
# There's lots of good fish,
good fish in the sea

2256
02:25:03,139 --> 02:25:06,434
# In the sea, in the sea, in the sea

2257
02:25:06,517 --> 02:25:08,645
# The threatened cloud has passed away

2258
02:25:08,895 --> 02:25:10,063
# And fairly shines the dawning day

2259
02:25:10,313 --> 02:25:11,564
# What though the night
may come too soon

2260
02:25:11,814 --> 02:25:13,733
# We've years and years of afternoon

2261
02:25:13,983 --> 02:25:17,528
# Then let the throng our joy advance

2262
02:25:17,779 --> 02:25:21,241
# With laughing song and merry dance

2263
02:25:21,491 --> 02:25:23,326
# Then let the throng our joy advance

2264
02:25:23,576 --> 02:25:24,953
# With laughing song and merry dance

2265
02:25:25,203 --> 02:25:27,080
# With laughing song and merry dance

2266
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:30,500
# With laughing song

2267
02:25:30,750 --> 02:25:32,252
# With joyous shout

2268
02:25:32,502 --> 02:25:34,379
# With joyous shout and ringing cheer

2269
02:25:34,629 --> 02:25:37,966
# Inaugurate, inaugurate their new career

2270
02:25:38,216 --> 02:25:39,842
# With joyous shout and ringing cheer

2271
02:25:40,093 --> 02:25:41,511
# Inaugurate their new career

2272
02:25:41,761 --> 02:25:43,471
# With joyous shout and ringing cheer

2273
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:45,306
# Inaugurate their new career

2274
02:25:45,556 --> 02:25:47,141
# With laughing song and merry dance

2275
02:25:47,392 --> 02:25:49,727
# With laughing song and merry dance

2276
02:25:49,978 --> 02:25:51,980
# With song

2277
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:57,402
# And dance

2278
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:48,119
Pish, Peep!

2279
02:26:51,873 --> 02:26:53,958
Mikado!

2280
02:26:59,964 --> 02:27:01,883
Ah!

2281
02:27:02,133 --> 02:27:05,595
- How bad was it?
- Utterly dreadful. A joke! I jest!

2282
02:27:05,845 --> 02:27:09,057
- And Grossmith?
- A lamentable spectacle.

2283
02:27:09,307 --> 02:27:11,726
- Are you ready, Gilbert?
- Ready for what?

2284
02:27:11,976 --> 02:27:15,313
The gibbet?

2285
02:27:25,448 --> 02:27:28,576
And... full company!

2286
02:27:28,826 --> 02:27:32,872
Ladies and gentlemen, bow!

2287
02:27:33,456 --> 02:27:37,502
Thank you very much.

2288
02:27:55,144 --> 02:27:59,023
There's something inherently
disappointing about success.

2289
02:27:59,274 --> 02:28:01,693
Climax and anticlimax, Willie.

2290
02:28:01,943 --> 02:28:04,195
I don't quite know how to take praise.

2291
02:28:04,445 --> 02:28:06,364
It makes my eyes red.

2292
02:28:06,614 --> 02:28:09,701
It must be rather pleasant
to receive it, nonetheless.

2293
02:28:09,951 --> 02:28:12,912
I suppose so...
if one feels one deserves it.

2294
02:28:13,162 --> 02:28:17,792
I don't think anyone would deny
that you deserve it, Willie.

2295
02:28:18,042 --> 02:28:19,961
I know my limitations.

2296
02:28:20,211 --> 02:28:23,965
I should rather like to be an actor,
upon the stage.

2297
02:28:24,215 --> 02:28:26,217
- An actor?
- Yes.

2298
02:28:26,467 --> 02:28:29,846
Wouldn't it be wondrous
if perfectly commonplace people...

2299
02:28:30,096 --> 02:28:33,558
...gave each other a round of applause
at the end of the day?

2300
02:28:33,808 --> 02:28:35,810
Well done, Kitty! Well done!

2301
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:39,272
Well done, Kitty! Bravo! Encore!

2302
02:28:39,522 --> 02:28:41,524
Thank you, Willie.

2303
02:28:41,774 --> 02:28:44,360
- Well, you must be tired.
- Must I?

2304
02:28:44,611 --> 02:28:46,696
I shall leave you to your beauty sleep.

2305
02:28:46,946 --> 02:28:50,575
No, don't go.

2306
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:53,703
Any thoughts racing round
in that old brain of yours?

2307
02:28:53,953 --> 02:28:57,540
Thoughts of what nature?

2308
02:29:04,047 --> 02:29:05,924
Concerning your next piece.

2309
02:29:06,174 --> 02:29:08,176
Ah! That monster.

2310
02:29:08,426 --> 02:29:12,055
No, not as yet.

2311
02:29:13,306 --> 02:29:17,268
Perhaps you should do something
completely different and unusual.

2312
02:29:17,518 --> 02:29:20,313
- Such as what?
- Oh, well, I don't know!

2313
02:29:20,563 --> 02:29:22,398
Come along, suggest something!

2314
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:26,277
Oh...

2315
02:29:30,323 --> 02:29:35,703
Well, you should have
a young and beautiful heroine...

2316
02:29:36,204 --> 02:29:40,208
...who grows old and plain.

2317
02:29:40,416 --> 02:29:43,086
As she gradually becomes
older and older...

2318
02:29:43,336 --> 02:29:46,547
...the ladies' chorus
becomes younger and younger.

2319
02:29:46,798 --> 02:29:48,967
Ah. Topsy-Turvy.

2320
02:29:49,217 --> 02:29:52,845
Yes.

2321
02:29:52,971 --> 02:29:56,766
How would it commence,
this comic opera of yours?

2322
02:29:57,016 --> 02:30:01,187
With the gentlemen's chorus, of course.

2323
02:30:01,271 --> 02:30:03,231
A chorus of fat leeches.

2324
02:30:03,481 --> 02:30:05,400
- Leeches?
- Yes!

2325
02:30:05,650 --> 02:30:07,527
No, they'd be gentlemen.

2326
02:30:07,777 --> 02:30:11,364
They'd be in their carriages
and they'd be rushing across the stage.

2327
02:30:11,614 --> 02:30:14,284
The horses would be
galloping across the stage...

2328
02:30:14,534 --> 02:30:17,579
...with the ladies chasing after them
to talk to them...

2329
02:30:17,829 --> 02:30:23,251
...but they wouldn't be listening,
they'd be far too busy.

2330
02:30:23,501 --> 02:30:24,752
Hmm.

2331
02:30:25,003 --> 02:30:27,005
Expensive to stage.

2332
02:30:27,255 --> 02:30:29,173
And there'd be dozens of doors...

2333
02:30:29,424 --> 02:30:31,593
...and ticking clocks on the stage.

2334
02:30:31,843 --> 02:30:34,262
He's made a vow to give her the key...

2335
02:30:34,512 --> 02:30:36,431
...but he never does.

2336
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:40,310
Who might "he" be?

2337
02:30:40,893 --> 02:30:43,146
Well, he's her husband, I suppose.

2338
02:30:43,396 --> 02:30:45,815
The hero.

2339
02:30:46,065 --> 02:30:47,984
No, not the hero.

2340
02:30:48,234 --> 02:30:49,777
Anyway.

2341
02:30:50,028 --> 02:30:51,863
One day...

2342
02:30:52,113 --> 02:30:53,781
No.

2343
02:30:54,032 --> 02:30:55,909
Late one night...

2344
02:30:56,159 --> 02:30:58,453
...she suddenly decides to try the door...

2345
02:30:58,703 --> 02:31:00,622
...and it opens!

2346
02:31:00,872 --> 02:31:04,042
Ah. So it wasn't locked after all.

2347
02:31:04,292 --> 02:31:06,628
And she climbs up the stairs...

2348
02:31:06,878 --> 02:31:08,963
...and there, on the sands...

2349
02:31:09,213 --> 02:31:15,303
...are hundreds of nannies
all pushing empty perambulators about!

2350
02:31:26,689 --> 02:31:30,652
And every time she tries to be born...

2351
02:31:31,653 --> 02:31:35,865
...he strangles her with her umbilical cord.

2352
02:31:54,509 --> 02:31:58,972
I shouldn't imagine
Sullivan'd much care for "that".

2353
02:32:08,022 --> 02:32:09,983
I'm proud of myself...

2354
02:32:10,233 --> 02:32:14,529
...triumphant, exhilarated,
exhausted, revived...

2355
02:32:14,779 --> 02:32:19,909
...and fed up to the back teeth
with these wretched kidneys.

2356
02:32:20,159 --> 02:32:23,788
Poor old thing.

2357
02:32:25,665 --> 02:32:30,837
Arthur, an old demon has come back
to haunt us at a most unwelcome time.

2358
02:32:31,087 --> 02:32:34,716
What on earth do you mean?

2359
02:32:40,388 --> 02:32:43,308
Oh.

2360
02:32:43,558 --> 02:32:46,519
I didn't want to tell you.

2361
02:32:46,769 --> 02:32:50,398
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2362
02:32:50,815 --> 02:32:53,401
How long have you known?

2363
02:32:53,651 --> 02:32:57,280
Ten days.

2364
02:32:58,114 --> 02:33:01,743
Oh, Fanny.

2365
02:33:03,328 --> 02:33:06,164
I shall make the arrangements.

2366
02:33:06,414 --> 02:33:08,333
That won't be necessary.

2367
02:33:08,583 --> 02:33:11,628
I couldn't go through that again.

2368
02:33:11,878 --> 02:33:15,173
I'm sorry that you have to.

2369
02:33:15,174 --> 02:33:18,468
I've made my own arrangements.

2370
02:33:18,718 --> 02:33:20,178
Have you?

2371
02:33:20,428 --> 02:33:23,473
Someone has been recommended to me.

2372
02:33:23,723 --> 02:33:26,267
After all...

2373
02:33:26,517 --> 02:33:30,146
...it is 1885, Arthur.

2374
02:33:30,813 --> 02:33:34,441
I love "The Mikado".

2375
02:33:34,442 --> 02:33:38,488
You've put everything you are into it.

2376
02:33:39,113 --> 02:33:42,408
You light up the world.

2377
02:33:42,659 --> 02:33:46,287
You can't help it.

2378
02:33:54,796 --> 02:33:58,424
I must fly.

2379
02:34:13,773 --> 02:34:18,903
Yes, I am indeed beautiful.

2380
02:34:19,404 --> 02:34:21,739
Sometimes I sit and wonder...

2381
02:34:21,990 --> 02:34:25,702
...in my artless Japanese way...

2382
02:34:25,952 --> 02:34:28,955
...why it is that I am
so much more attractive...

2383
02:34:29,205 --> 02:34:33,042
...than anybody else in the whole world.

2384
02:34:34,043 --> 02:34:37,088
Can this be vanity?

2385
02:34:37,338 --> 02:34:39,674
No.

2386
02:34:39,924 --> 02:34:41,843
Nature is lovely...

2387
02:34:42,093 --> 02:34:45,013
...and rejoices in her loveliness.

2388
02:34:45,263 --> 02:34:47,640
I am a child of nature...

2389
02:34:47,890 --> 02:34:51,644
...and take after my mother.

2390
02:35:04,782 --> 02:35:07,744
# The sun whose rays are all ablaze

2391
02:35:07,994 --> 02:35:12,373
# With ever-living glory

2392
02:35:12,624 --> 02:35:15,209
# Does not deny his majesty

2393
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:19,672
# He scorns to tell a story

2394
02:35:19,923 --> 02:35:22,508
# He don't exclaim, "I blush for shame

2395
02:35:22,759 --> 02:35:27,180
# So kindly be indulgent"

2396
02:35:27,430 --> 02:35:30,433
# But fierce and bold in fiery gold

2397
02:35:30,683 --> 02:35:36,940
# He glories all effulgent

2398
02:35:38,149 --> 02:35:42,487
# I mean to rule the earth

2399
02:35:42,737 --> 02:35:45,448
# As he the sky

2400
02:35:45,698 --> 02:35:50,119
# We really know our worth

2401
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:54,082
# The sun and I

2402
02:35:54,332 --> 02:35:58,503
# I mean to rule the earth as he the sky

2403
02:35:58,753 --> 02:36:01,839
# We really know our worth

2404
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:08,680
# The sun and I

2405
02:36:12,809 --> 02:36:15,478
# Observe his flame, that placid dame

2406
02:36:15,728 --> 02:36:20,191
# The moon's Celestial Highness

2407
02:36:20,441 --> 02:36:22,902
# There's not a trace upon her face

2408
02:36:23,152 --> 02:36:27,448
# Of diffidence or shyness

2409
02:36:27,699 --> 02:36:30,451
# She borrows light that through the night

2410
02:36:30,702 --> 02:36:35,123
# Mankind may all acclaim her

2411
02:36:35,373 --> 02:36:36,457
# And truth to tell

2412
02:36:36,708 --> 02:36:37,834
# She lights up well

2413
02:36:38,084 --> 02:36:44,132
# So I for one don't blame her

2414
02:36:45,633 --> 02:36:49,887
# Ah, pray make no mistake

2415
02:36:50,138 --> 02:36:52,432
# We are not shy

2416
02:36:52,682 --> 02:36:57,020
# We're very wide awake

2417
02:36:57,270 --> 02:37:00,815
# The moon and I

2418
02:37:01,065 --> 02:37:06,279
# Ah, pray make no mistake
We are not shy

2419
02:37:06,529 --> 02:37:09,449
# We're very wide awake

2420
02:37:09,699 --> 02:37:17,248
# The moon and I
