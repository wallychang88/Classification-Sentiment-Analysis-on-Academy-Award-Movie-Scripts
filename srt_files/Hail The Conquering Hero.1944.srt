1
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,933
Two boilermakers.

2
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:15,754
<i>Far away
though I may roam, dear</i>

3
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:17,922
Fill her up?
Yeah.

4
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:25,697
Why don't you grab yourself off a
skirt and have yourself a time?

5
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,866
Why don't you...
Your beer's running over.

6
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,910
<i>Home to the arms I hold dear</i>

7
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,515
<i>Home to the arms</i>

8
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:48,653
<i>of Mother</i>

9
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:56,596
<i>Safe from this world's alarms</i>

10
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:02,668
<i>That's where I spend
each night in my dreams</i>

11
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,937
Why don't they sing
something gay?

12
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,706
Why don't you acquire
a gay viewpoint?

13
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,842
It's all mental,
every bit of it.

14
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:14,012
Smile, and the world smiles with you.
Frown, and you frown alone.

15
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:16,181
I'd just as soon be alone,
if it's just the same to you.

16
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:17,616
Gratitude.

17
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:24,256
<i>By that vine-colored door</i>

18
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:30,262
<i>As you stood in the gloaming</i>

19
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:37,203
<i>to welcome me home</i>

20
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:42,207
<i>Home to the arms</i>

21
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,881
<i>of Mother</i>

22
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:53,987
<i>Never again</i>

23
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,624
<i>to roam</i>

24
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:04,230
If you could shoot craps like
you can shoot your mouth off,

25
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,766
you'd be the biggest breeze
shooter this side of Hong Kong.

26
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,735
He's the two biggest!
I was fading the guy.

27
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,936
How am I supposed to know the
guy's gonna pass eight times?

28
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,739
You was fading
the guy with our money!

29
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:14,974
Well, it was my money, too.
We're partners, ain't we?

30
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,543
Especially now.
Partners in the soup.

31
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:17,944
Yeah, no dough.
Nothing to do.

32
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:22,016
If you wasn't so big,
I'd take a poke at that dumb kisser of yours.

33
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:24,118
Why don't you try it, Mac?
Save it for the Japs.

34
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,318
You shouldn't have faded
so many times.

35
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,753
You gonna start now?

36
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,321
Give me one last 10 spot.
I'll go back...

37
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:31,691
You had it, fancy fingers!
"Give me one last 10 spot"!

38
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,294
Who do you think you're talking to?
Morgenthau?

39
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:39,133
<i>Never again</i>

40
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:44,270
<i>to roam</i>

41
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:48,575
<i>To roam</i>

42
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:51,244
Where you going?

43
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:54,081
I got 15 cents.
I held out on you.

44
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,633
Will you close the door,
please?

45
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,381
Yes, gentlemen?

46
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:29,183
One beer.
One beer?

47
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,718
One beer and no cracks.

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,056
Gonna share it or swill
it all down by yourself?

50
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:36,657
Give me
your elk's tooth.

51
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,659
Wait a moment.
My old man gave me... Come on!

52
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,134
Come here.

53
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,939
You the manager?
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,007
We're just a little bit
short of cash, see,

55
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,342
or I'd never make you
this proposition.

56
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:57,678
I was gonna save it
for the museum, see,

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,749
but when you're out on a limb,
you gotta make sacrifices, that's all.

58
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,851
You follow me?
I'm ahead of you.

59
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:07,755
I'm gonna let you in on the ground
floor of something very, very rare.

60
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:10,791
You remember when General
Yamatoho committed hari-kari?

61
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:14,262
Possibly.
I happened to be very close by, see?

62
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:19,834
Big man, wasn't he?
Immense.

63
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,836
This is one of
the rarest mementos...

64
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:24,839
You wouldn't like to buy the flag
they buried him in, would you?

65
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:28,076
I could let you have it very reasonable.
I have it in several sizes.

66
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,145
MacArthur's suspenders!

67
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:33,948
The first bullet that landed in Pearl Harbor.
You can take your pick.

68
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,351
A piece of
a Japanese submarine.

69
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:39,788
If you look at it this way,
it becomes a German submarine,

70
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,291
and this way it is a piece of a
shell that just missed Montgomery.

71
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:46,361
Here we have
the seat of Rommel's pants,

72
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:50,030
and last but not least we have
a button from Hitler's coat,

73
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,334
although that one
I don't personally believe.

74
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,969
Wise guy.

75
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,440
It's all paid for.

76
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,041
Oh, boy!
You said it!

77
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,077
By you?
Not by me, it wasn't.

78
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,844
You don't have to
give me no credit.

79
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,913
The guy at
the end of the bar.

80
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:18,326
Was this from you?

81
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:22,897
I just happened to hear the waiter say
something about six Marines and one beer

82
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,199
and to serve it with
six straws or something.

83
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,401
He did, did he?
Where is he?

84
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,337
Anyway, that was a very nice gesture,
civilian.

85
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,839
Don't mention it.

86
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,174
You want
General Yamatoho's tooth?

87
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:33,075
No, thanks.
You could send it to your mother,

88
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,143
if you got one.
No, thanks.

89
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,377
I already sent her
some souvenirs.

90
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,946
Well, then here's to you.

91
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,380
<i>Semper fidelis.
Semper fidelis.</i>

92
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:40,950
You know our motto, eh?
Yeah, I know the motto.

93
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,352
Was you in
the Marine Corps, maybe?

94
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:46,088
That's too bad, Mac.
That's all right. Set them up again.

95
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,090
Don't you want
anything else beside beer?

96
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,426
Well, personally, I never touch
anything stronger than rye whiskey.

97
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,361
Seven ryes.
You can use the beer for chasers.

98
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:57,366
You sure you ain't spending too fast
like fancy Felix, the Craps King here?

99
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:03,139
Besides, I can't think of any way I'd
rather spend my money than for Marines.

100
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,775
Guadalcanal.
It's a great place to be from.

101
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,043
Well, sukiyaki.
How long you out?

102
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,813
From the Marines?
Yeah.

103
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,282
I was only in a month.
That's too bad.

104
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,416
You hardly had time
to get corns on your feet.

105
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:17,154
Were you wounded?
How could he get wounded in boot camp?

106
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,522
He could've
fell off a roof.

107
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:19,856
What would he be doing
on a roof?

108
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,159
It was hay fever,
chronic hay fever.

109
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,493
Gee, that's
the worst kind, too.

110
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,829
It's terrible.
I had a girl once who had it.

111
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:26,963
Every time you'd
get close to her,

112
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,298
she'd sneeze
right in your kisser.

113
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,036
It was the excitement.
Well, better luck next time.

114
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,506
Did you try any of the other branches of
the Service, like the Army or the Navy?

115
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,975
They'll take anything.
They wouldn't take me.

116
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,378
I went into a shipyard.
My grandmother is a WAC.

117
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,846
What good is that
gonna do him?

118
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,513
I don't know why
hay fever is so terrible.

119
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:46,515
It's because you never know
when it's gonna hit you.

120
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:49,120
I remember one night, this dame had a
bowl of noodle soup in front of her,

121
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:50,321
and all of a sudden...

122
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:55,126
Anyway, I was kind of
born to be a Marine.

123
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:57,494
My father was killed in Belleau
Wood the day I was born.

124
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,030
Belleau Wood?
Almost the same hour.

125
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:02,299
All I ever thought about
was being a Marine.

126
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:06,437
I took exercises. I never drank or smoked.
I studied all about them.

127
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,875
I can tell you every battle the
Marines were in from 1775 down to now.

128
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,910
New Providence, Fort Nassau,
the second Battle of Trenton,

129
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,246
<i>the Bonhomme Richard
and the Serapis...</i>

130
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,081
"I have not yet begun
to fight."

131
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,952
Tripoli in 1805,
Nuku Hiva in 1812,

132
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:25,189
the Battle of
Hatchee-Lustee River in 1837,

133
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:29,227
Veracruz in '46, Chapultepec,
the halls of Montezuma,

134
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:33,164
Panama in '85,
Guantanamo Bay in '98,

135
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,967
then the Philippines,
the Boxer Rebellion in China,

136
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:39,337
Nicaragua, Coyotepe Hill,
Fort Riviere and Haiti.

137
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,475
Then Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood,
the charge at Soissons, Saint-Mihiel,

138
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:48,112
and now Wake Island,
Guam, Bataan,

139
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,615
Corregidor, Guadalcanal.

140
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:54,518
They bled and died.

141
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:58,923
They gave me a big send-off
when I left home.

142
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:04,662
Band was playing, everybody hollering,
the dogs barking, my mother crying.

143
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:08,901
Everybody wondering if I'd come home a
general or just a sergeant like my father.

144
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:13,271
Well, it's one thing to come home
with things like that on your chest,

145
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:16,375
and another thing to go home with
hay fever and a medical discharge.

146
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:18,110
You mean you ain't
been home yet?

147
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,678
I wrote I was leaving
for overseas.

148
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,313
You shouldn't do that
to your mother.

149
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:23,115
I wrote a couple of letters
to say I was all right,

150
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:25,316
and I asked a kid to mail them
from overseas for me.

151
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,451
Suppose that he didn't
get a chance to mail them?

152
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:29,654
Well...
That's a terrible thing to do to your mother.

153
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:32,224
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

154
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:34,359
You say your father was a
sergeant at Belleau Wood?

155
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,261
That's right.

156
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:38,329
What was his name?
I was at Belleau Wood.

157
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:39,597
Truesmith.

158
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,033
Truesmith?

159
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,701
You mean
Hinky Dinky Truesmith?

160
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:45,169
That's right.

161
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:48,274
Why, he was my sergeant.
I saw him fall!

162
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:52,344
Right then I was being born,
in Oak Ridge, California.

163
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,113
Did you know your father got the
Congressional Medal of Honor?

164
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,182
I grew up with it.
They hung it on me.

165
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,284
Is that where she lives,
Oak Ridge?

166
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:00,619
Who?
Your mother.

167
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,655
Sure.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

168
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:06,525
It's an honor to meet you,
kid. What's your name?

169
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:09,528
Woodrow Lafayette
Pershing Truesmith.

170
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,364
Go ahead and laugh.

171
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,133
That ain't anything to laugh at
to anyone who knows anything.

172
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:20,038
Boys, I want you to shake hands with
Hinky Dinky Truesmith's boy, Woodrow.

173
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,506
Corporal Candida.
How do you do?

174
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:22,741
Privates
First Class Swenson...

175
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,009
Swenson, glad to know you.

176
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,210
Jones...
Jones.

177
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:30,984
My name is Heppelfinger. Julius.
And you can just call me Sarge.

178
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:33,720
Set them up. Excuse me.
Certainly, Sarge.

179
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,154
I guess you never got to know
your father very well, huh?

180
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:39,258
Well, not exactly,
as he fell the day I was born.

181
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,660
That's right.

182
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:44,497
It's hard to realize.
He was a fine-looking fellow.

183
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,366
He didn't look anything
like you at all.

184
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:48,434
I know. We've got a picture
of him at home and...

185
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,036
This is Bugsy Walewski.
Pleased to meet you.

186
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:54,239
Listen, after a guy's bought you...
Sure, go ahead.

187
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,142
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

188
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:59,212
He ought to be ashamed of himself
for treating his mother that way.

189
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,114
He never had any mother.
He's from a home.

190
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:05,784
He's all right. He just got a little shot up,
that's all. Nothing serious.

191
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,321
So, you're Hinky Dinky's boy.

192
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:12,393
I travel 100,000 miles and
run into Hinky Dinky's boy.

193
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,194
He was a brave kid.

194
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,263
Not quite as old as you are.
I know. I...

195
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,598
There was 16 of us,
see, in this wood.

196
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,566
There'd be a German right there,
and you'd be right here,

197
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,735
and he couldn't see you,
and you couldn't see him.

198
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:25,438
Then, all of a sudden, almost right
under your feet, you'd hear the...

199
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,574
Oak Ridge.

200
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:35,615
but isn't it kind of late to be calling
somebody up in the middle of the night?

201
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:37,683
Are you sure it's important?

202
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,556
He did? Well, why didn't you say so in
the first place, for heaven's sake?

203
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,627
Then Louie is lying there holding his belly.
One of the kids is crying.

204
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,063
Then somebody says,
"Let's draw lots,"

205
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:52,266
but Hinky says, "I'm the Sergeant, see.
I already won.

206
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:53,667
"You'll hear them when I get there,
then come in,"

207
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:55,602
and he starts
through the bushes.

208
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,338
So, there we are.
On your mark, get set... All of a sudden...

209
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,474
Your mother's on the telephone.
She wants to talk to you.

210
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:02,108
Just a minute. What?

211
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,444
You mean my mother?
That's right.

212
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,179
But how can I talk to her
if I'm overseas?

213
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,114
You dumb cluck!
Because you ain't overseas.

214
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,550
You just came back with us
from Guadalcanal.

215
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,819
You're going home tomorrow.

216
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,620
Going home?
That's right.

217
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,092
Go on.

218
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,440
Are you nuts or something?

219
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:34,675
The guy is trying to
keep his mother

220
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,176
from knowing
he ain't a Marine.

221
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:37,278
You want to make something of it?
Yeah!

222
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,413
Pipe down!

223
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:44,852
Hello?

224
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,288
Is that you, Mama?

225
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,624
Hello, Mama.

226
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,595
Sure, I'm all right.
Of course I am.

227
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:56,364
I never felt better
in my life.

228
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,233
How have you been, Mama?
Did you get my letters?

229
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:02,503
You did, huh? I was afraid
you might have been worried.

230
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:07,208
It's very hard to get leave these days,
what with the war and all.

231
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,213
I just got up to
Frisco for this evening, see.

232
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,582
That I was wounded and honorably
discharged from the service?

233
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:17,819
Who told you I was wounded and
discharged from the service?

234
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,687
Then she won't have to
worry no more.

235
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,856
Now, wait a minute, Mama,
you'd hardly call it a wound.

236
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:23,691
It was more like a scratch.

237
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:26,761
It was more like a fever.
Just a little fever, that's all.

238
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,430
Maybe it's called jungle fever,
Mama, I don't know.

239
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:34,269
but I just don't see how I'll be able
to get home for quite some time, Mama.

240
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:37,672
No, I'm not seriously wounded.
I wish I was.

241
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:40,508
I said I wish I could come home,
but I just can't make...

242
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,844
No, you can't do that, Mama.
They don't allow visitors where I am.

243
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:47,550
Well, she must've known the Colonel or
something. I'm in the wrong with him.

244
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,519
I can't tell you that, Mama.
That's military information.

245
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,822
No, I'm not in jail.
What would I be doing in jail?

246
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,924
I don't know why he said
I was coming home, Mama,

247
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,259
but he was probably
talking about somebody else.

248
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:00,963
He had several calls to make.
You know how it is.

249
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,966
Well, of course, I want to come home, Mama.
Why wouldn't I?

250
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,303
I'm just crazy to see you
and Libby and everybody,

251
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,672
but this is war, Mama.

252
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:12,340
Wait a minute.
Give me that phone.

253
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:15,476
I figured it all out.
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:17,746
Like rolling off a log! Quiet!

255
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,884
Hello, Mrs. Truesmith?
This is Sergeant Heppelfinger.

256
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,416
You got nothing to worry about.
That's it. Right.

257
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:58,420
Look, it's bad enough to wear the
uniform without having to wear this...

258
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,556
Now, wait a minute.
Without having to wear this medal on it.

259
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,760
What are you talking about?
I don't even remember what I got it for.

260
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,628
You know what
he got that for?

261
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,264
Some Japs was roasting a pig
across the stream, understand.

262
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,033
The breeze was blowing it all
right over in his kisser,

263
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,434
so he went over and got it.

264
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,336
Boy, that was some dish.
Just a hog.

265
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,272
I know, but...
You gotta wear something.

266
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,906
You can't come back from the
Solomons without nothing.

267
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:17,974
Not the son of
Sergeant Truesmith.

268
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,276
I can't help it, fellows.

269
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,410
I just don't like
the whole idea.

270
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,510
You gotta think
of your mother.

271
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,380
The regulations
distinctly say,

272
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:28,051
"You can wear your uniform home,
but not longer than 30 days."

273
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,619
Suppose they paid you off
in South Africa.

274
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,754
And you went home on foot?

275
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,888
They can't tell you
how to go home.

276
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,523
You could go home
on a pogo stick.

277
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,758
You gotta think
of your mother.

278
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,692
The regulations
clearly state...

279
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:41,764
You ain't really a Marine anymore, and,
besides, the regulations is very elastic.

280
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,801
I was even a Colonel once
for a couple of days.

281
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,637
And a brighound for a couple of months.
Cheese it!

282
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:53,543
How are you, boys?
Fine, sir. Thank you, sir.

283
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,378
I think we'd better go back to
my room and talk this over...

284
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,680
Keep your hand down,
and nobody will be the wiser.

285
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,650
All aboard!

286
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,819
Come on, chuck his gear on.
No, no.

287
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,454
Will you get on that train?
No, I won't!

288
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,988
Come on, hoist him on!
No, no!

289
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,357
Come on, get him on!
Don't make me...

290
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,028
No. No.

291
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,646
Look, I don't want to sound ungrateful.
I know you meant it for the best.

292
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,015
I don't mind
the seven tickets or anything.

293
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,983
I'm honored to have you
go home with me.

294
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,852
It's just the uniform.
It makes me nervous.

295
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,122
Well, I shouldn't
go home with it, and this...

296
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,757
You shouldn't have
lied to your mother.

297
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,359
I think it was
for pulling a Frenchman

298
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,760
out of a creek or something.
I don't remember.

299
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,028
He ought to have
the Battle Blaze.

300
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,598
Well, I shouldn't ought to have the
Battle Blaze. It's bad enough like this.

301
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,935
Who's gonna notice anything?
"Who's gonna notice anything"?

302
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,837
You slip off the train.
We'll kind of surround you.

303
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,806
We slip up a side street.
Your mother's waiting on the front porch.

304
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,842
You put your arms around her.
That's right.

305
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,111
You slip out of your uniform.
You salt it away in mothballs,

306
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,846
and there you are, home.

307
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,514
She's happy. You're happy.
Everybody's happy.

308
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,915
And nobody's hep to nothing.

309
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,862
Please. Will you please wait
until I give you the signal?

310
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:22,166
Well, all right, then.
Go ahead and practice.

311
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,904
Listen. Will you please stand not here?
Go some other place. Please!

312
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:30,741
He's been away for so long,
and only hearing from him twice.

313
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,744
And then being his father's son,
you can imagine the chances he would take,

314
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,546
the risks he would run.

315
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,181
Do you suppose
he knows about Libby?

316
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,616
I don't know, Martha.

317
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,850
I certainly didn't tell him.

318
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,755
You're engaged to me,
and that's all there is to it.

319
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,590
I know,
but it's his homecoming.

320
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:47,092
And homecoming means to find
everything the way you left it,

321
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:48,927
at least for a little while.

322
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,529
Do you suppose
he'll be heartbroken?

323
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,030
I don't know.

324
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,698
I don't see that that has
anything to do with it.

325
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,535
there might've been
three of us to welcome him.

326
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,571
If he'd waited two years,
it might have been... Shut up.

327
00:18:58,573 --> 00:19:00,972
That's what marriage is for, isn't it?
I suppose so,

328
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,676
if you look at it from a purely unromantic
standpoint like a breeding farm.

329
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,546
I mean, if you don't find anything
soul-stirring in the return of a...

330
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,748
A hero.
All right. A hero.

331
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,017
I mean, if you don't find
anything heartwarming in it...

332
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,454
My dear girl, I tried to get into
the Army by every possible means.

333
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:17,689
I even lied about my condition.
I know you did.

334
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,057
It isn't my fault
that I have...

335
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,893
Chronic hay fever.
I know that, Forrest.

336
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,862
I've heard it
a thousand times,

337
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:27,567
I'm forced to remind you that
Woodrow also had hay fever.

338
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,139
Your father wants you.

339
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:40,480
He broke off with her.
Her skirts are certainly clean.

340
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:42,714
I don't know anything
about it, Martha.

341
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,184
I'm very happy for you,
Mrs. Truesmith.

342
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,089
Will you tell him I'm going to
be married to Forrest, please?

343
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,124
No, I won't, Libby.
I think that's up to you.

344
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:55,161
Will you, Aunt Martha?
Who, me? I should say not.

345
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:58,797
Well, you know it wasn't my fault.
I would have waited for him forever.

346
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,867
He asked me not to.
He told me to forget him.

347
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,935
He even wrote
he didn't love me anymore.

348
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,837
Maybe you should've read
between the lines a little.

349
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,842
I mean to say, if you think I'm gonna
stand around like a doorpost...

350
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:14,580
Very well, Mr. Mayor. I'm merely the
Chairman of the Reception Committee,

351
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,549
but as I visualize...
Did you bring the keys to the city?

352
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:17,850
Yes, Father, right here.

353
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:18,951
Because I don't want to
pull out my fountain pen

354
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:21,587
Why don't you let
Mr. Pash arrange things?

355
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,290
If it's all the same to you,
my pearl...

356
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,992
This boy Woodrow is gonna be
very popular in this town, Doc.

357
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:30,897
I wonder if the same thought has
occurred to you that flashed in my mind?

358
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,231
Probably.

359
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,667
As I visualize it,
the ceremony began

360
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,702
with a little girl in white
with a bunch of posies...

361
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,938
In her grimy little mitts.
I know, I've listened to her before.

362
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,643
Why, she forgets her lines
till rigor mortis sets in.

363
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,278
Very well, then,
you arrange the reception.

364
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,146
I tell you,
it's better for you to talk after Bissell.

365
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,648
Then you can give him
the needle.

366
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,752
After all, I'm only the Mayor.
Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor.

367
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:54,987
Not in front of the Mayor.
Out on the fringe somewhere.

368
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,257
Why, you'd think it was a
political campaign instead of a...

369
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,759
Did you bring
the keys to the city?

370
00:20:58,761 --> 00:20:59,960
Yes, Father,
I have them right here.

371
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,595
Mrs. Noble.
Call me Myrtle, dear.

372
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:04,831
if I didn't tell Woodrow I'm
engaged to Forrest right away?

373
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,099
What?
What?

374
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,635
Of all the confounded...
What are you talking about?

375
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:12,839
Well, I mean, not to spoil his homecoming
by striking a single sour note.

376
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:16,743
Of course it would be all right.
I understand perfectly.

377
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:18,111
I'm not sure that I do,
Mother.

378
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:19,347
That's because
you're not a woman, dear.

379
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,848
It would be
perfectly all right.

380
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,050
Why,
under similar circumstances,

381
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:25,852
I wasn't married to your
father for several weeks even.

382
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:27,754
You could make it for several months,
as far as I'm concerned.

383
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,857
He talks that way in public,
but we understand perfectly.

384
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,127
Now, you go right down and take him in
your arms and kiss him all you like.

385
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:35,363
Thank you.
I may have something to say about that.

386
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,964
I suppose she could kiss him
on the cheek.

387
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,699
Kiss him wherever you like.
Of all the nonsense.

388
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:43,236
Not in the middle, please.
Out in the suburbs, if you don't mind.

389
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:46,640
Yeah, please.
Out in the suburbs, yes.

390
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:48,076
Now, listen.

391
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,911
<i>I begin with
Mademoiselle From Armenties</i>

392
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:52,045
<i>and then I go into
Hail the Conquering Hero.</i>

393
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,246
<i>You begin with
Mademoiselle From Armentiere?</i>

394
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,650
<i>There'll Be a Hot Time
in the Old Town Tonigh.</i>

395
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,753
<i>Then, who plays
Home to the Arms of Mother?</i>

396
00:21:58,755 --> 00:21:59,988
I do.
What's your name?

397
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,389
Eddie.
I thought I started with that.

398
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:06,761
<i>Who is talking about
Hail the Conquering Hero?</i>

399
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:08,930
I am.
No, no, no. You play...

400
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:11,833
O death, where is thy sting?
We don't know that.

401
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:15,269
<i>All we know is Hail the Conquering
Herand half of Marching Through Georgia.</i>

402
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:18,006
We were only formed last week.
Now, wait a minute, Teddy.

403
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:19,773
You're going to have her
the rest of your life.

404
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:24,746
This is war, you know.
And you know what Sherman said about it.

405
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,280
<i>Ed follows with
Mademoiselle From Armenties</i>

406
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>and modulates into Hail
the Conquering Hero Come.</i>

407
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:31,719
<i>Eddie takes Home to the Arms of Mother
and you play anything you know!</i>

408
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,955
<i>Can anybody play
Let Me Call You Sweetheart?</i>

409
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:36,823
<i>Sure, I can modulate into that from
A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight.</i>

410
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:39,828
<i>and let Teddy play
Hail the Conquering Hero.</i>

411
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,697
Certainly, if you want to
upset all of my plans!

412
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:42,931
After all,
I've only had one morning

413
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,333
to whip this thing
all together, you know.

414
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:47,302
I'm sorry. All right, play it!
Play anything you like!

415
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:50,405
I'm here to help.
I do it for nothing, with joy,

416
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:52,874
but I got to have cooperation.
Cooperation, yes.

417
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,044
I sing the hymn in seven flats.
In seven flats.

418
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,345
And he won't play
in seven flats.

419
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:58,047
We don't know how to
play in seven flats.

420
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,082
We're not musicians.
You don't have to tell me.

421
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,051
Then, each work in your
own key and do your best.

422
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:04,285
Why don't we take it...
They're really very nice people.

423
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:06,220
I'm just going to take
Woodrow in my arms

424
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,456
and hug him as if he'd never
written me that letter at all.

425
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,725
That's a very sweet
thought, dear.

426
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:12,928
Do you want me
to hold your engagement ring?

427
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:18,767
It's not only my mother.
I've got a girl! I mean, I did have.

428
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,170
What did you tell her?
You was going in the Navy?

429
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:24,339
No, I told her I fell for somebody
else so she wouldn't wait for me.

430
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,441
What are you gonna
tell her now?

431
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:28,378
What good does that do?
Tell her you're divorced.

432
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,013
I'm no good at lying!

433
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:32,948
Besides,
maybe she doesn't care anymore anyway.

434
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,049
Is your mother a good cook?

435
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,451
Wonderful.
Gee, you're lucky.

436
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,785
Well, I don't feel lucky!

437
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:38,053
Look, I tell you
the whole thing is...

438
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:39,488
Supposing I should
meet someone I know

439
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,726
We'll surround you.
You got nothing to worry about.

440
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:45,961
I hope not!
Oak Ridge.

441
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:47,863
Don't do that!
Keep cool, will you?

442
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:49,965
What can happen?
Does your mother put up preserves?

443
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:53,302
Yes! What can happen?
Anything can happen!

444
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:56,506
Will you stop balling things up!
Everything was clear and simple, and now...

445
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,341
Where is Mamie?

446
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:00,375
She's always disappearing.
Well, she'll be here in a minute.

447
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,410
It's the excitement.
Yes.

448
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:03,213
Here comes the train!

449
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:07,183
Not yet!

450
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:10,453
Not yet!

451
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:13,389
I didn't tell you...

452
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:17,359
What's that music?
Brush you off, gents?

453
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:18,962
What's that music?

454
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,830
Fix you up for the reception?
The reception?

455
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:22,232
I reckon it's for you all.

456
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:24,067
They got a half-a-dozen bands
and all the officials.

457
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,837
Now, wait a minute.
It's probably for somebody else.

458
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,139
It ain't for anybody else.
It says "Welcome Woodrow."

459
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:33,041
Let me out of here!
You're just gonna make things worse.

460
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,910
You give me that bag!

461
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:37,448
Here, open that up and let me out.
I'll hide in there.

462
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,049
You can make my apologies.

463
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:40,551
I can't while
the train's in the station.

464
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:42,353
Then I'll get off
in my underwear!

465
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,254
Cut that out!
We're just pulling in the station.

466
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:45,922
No, not yet!

467
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,226
No!

468
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:52,830
They got four bands.
That don't look good with only one medal.

469
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:55,199
Four bands? Take that blouse off!
Give me yours!

470
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:58,334
Madame, please... I didn't...

471
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,904
Not yet!

472
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:05,008
Cut it out!
You're making a big mistake, I tell you!

473
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,342
You gotta think
of your mother!

474
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,878
Come on,
and take those hash marks off!

475
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,248
I'm telling you,
give me my other suit!

476
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:49,954
All right, she's going to get in front.
All right, please, that's fine.

477
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:53,858
Welcome, Woodrow.

478
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,294
Quiet! Please, please.

479
00:25:57,296 --> 00:26:00,498
Please! Quiet! Right.
We're all ready for the reception.

480
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
All right, Mamie.

481
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:03,969
Welcome, young warrior.

482
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:07,639
Your natal city rejoices
at your safe homecoming

483
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:10,207
and takes great pleasure
in presenting you

484
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:13,410
this beautiful bunch
of del-fuminimums.

485
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:17,983
Now, you just come with me.

486
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:20,285
Mr. Noble has
a speech all ready for you.

487
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:34,031
Welcome home, Woodrow.

488
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:37,670
Silence!
His honor, the Mayor!

489
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,274
Friends, voters,

490
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,442
returning hero

491
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:48,647
and ex-employee of the Noble Chair Company,
Seats of all Descriptions,

492
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,217
home to
the arms of your mother...

493
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,290
No, no, no, no!

494
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,496
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

495
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:09,434
It is with a sense
of deep humility

496
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:12,070
that I hail
this conquering hero!

497
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:17,610
No, no!

498
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,647
No, no, no.

499
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,683
Not until I tell you, please!

500
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,085
I say...

501
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:28,454
I say...

502
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:30,957
Quiet!

503
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:34,293
It is with a sense
of deep humility

504
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:36,294
that I welcome
this young Marine.

505
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:38,563
Hooray!

506
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,599
Actions speak louder
than words.

507
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,537
Here are his words!

508
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,038
Hooray!

509
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,542
From the halls of Montezuma

510
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,245
to the shores of Tripoli...

511
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,050
No! No! No!

512
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:04,557
No, no, no, no!

513
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,062
<i>Hot Time in the Old Ton
Tonight.One, two...</i>

514
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:15,034
Do anything you like!

515
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,571
<i>All right, boys,
Mademoiselle From Armentiere.</i>

516
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,083
I say it is with a sense
of deep humility...

517
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,384
Go away!

518
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,433
I present you
with the keys to the city!

519
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,566
But Mr. Mayor...

520
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,402
Quiet!

521
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,638
I do wish he'd told us
he was bringing six friends.

522
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,409
I don't know what we'd have done
if everybody hadn't been so kind.

523
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,178
I'll get it.

524
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,281
Oh, dear!

525
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:08,422
Just in case you were short,
I brought over a few little knick-knacks.

526
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:11,625
That's terribly kind of you, Mr. Schultz,
but I haven't a single point left.

527
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,528
Who asked you?
It's all complimentary.

528
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,297
Including the points with the
compliments of Schultz's market.

529
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,600
Why, just put it right here.
Everybody's been so kind.

530
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:22,803
Boy, I wished I was a Marine.
You will be.

531
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:25,373
It'll probably be over
by the time I'm big enough.

532
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,175
From your mouth
to heaven's ear.

533
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:29,444
How many Nips did Woodrow get,
Mrs. Truesmith?

534
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,578
I'm sure I don't know, Teddy.
I hope he wasn't too bloodthirsty.

535
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:36,249
And if there is anything else,
the slightest thing,

536
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:38,151
when we're open
or when we're closed,

537
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,553
Teddy will be happy
to run over.

538
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:41,222
I'm bowlegged now from...

539
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,391
Goodbye, Mrs. Truesmith,

540
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,859
and I'm very happy for you.

541
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,097
One in the family
is enough to lose.

542
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:01,342
Here they are!

543
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:03,878
I'll just have time
to wash for church.

544
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,447
Do I look all right, Martha?
Yes, of course you look all right.

545
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:07,782
Well, that's that.

546
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:10,251
That was certainly
a great idea you had.

547
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:12,553
What are you talking about?
Everything was lovely.

548
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:15,389
I thought your speech at General
Zabriski's monument was very moving.

549
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:17,892
Thank you very much.
Well, if you'll excuse me now.

550
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:19,527
I have something
to tell you, Woodrow.

551
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:21,562
Well, you'll just
have to wait...

552
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:22,630
Woodrow.

553
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:25,600
Hello, Mama.

554
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:27,467
Where are you going, dear?
To put on my blue suit.

555
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,769
We'll be late for church.
Then, we'll be late for church.

556
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:31,440
Why can't you wear your
uniform for a little while?

557
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:33,308
You look so nice in it.

558
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,878
I just got through explaining.
It's against regulations. He should...

559
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,679
I think that's perfectly ridiculous.
So do I.

560
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:40,449
Your grandfather wore his Civil
War uniform the rest of his life.

561
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,849
He kept having new ones made.
Well, you...

562
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:43,284
He said it helped
to remind people

563
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:47,622
Well, his case was different.
Then, hurry up, dear.

564
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:49,191
Go ahead.
Now, better hurry up.

565
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:53,662
I suppose that's only natural,
dear, after what he's been through.

566
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:54,897
He has jungle fever, you know.

567
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:59,667
They run through the woods without any
clothes on with knives in their teeth.

568
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:01,369
Oh, no, they don't
at all, lady.

569
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,603
You're thinking of Boksok.

570
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,505
The Marines
always dress very nice.

571
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:07,442
Of course they do.
You must be Sergeant Heppelfinger.

572
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:08,710
Pleased to meet you.

573
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:10,579
I want you to shake hands
with Corporal Candida.

574
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:16,518
I didn't have a chance to tell him yet.
There was so much noise.

575
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,221
You knew my sergeant.
I want you to see him.

576
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:21,658
I want you all to see him.

577
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,901
There he is.
Attention!

578
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,609
Thank you.

579
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,878
He looks so young
compared to me.

580
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:47,849
Now I have two heroes.

581
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:53,455
I have eight heroes.

582
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:57,927
You can sure put me on your flag.
I sure ain't got anybody else.

583
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:00,296
I'll be very proud to.

584
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,666
Oh, we're going to be late.

585
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,769
Woodrow! Woodrow!

586
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,378
Now, Martha.
Yes?

587
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,682
Sally Truesmith, you don't have
to tell me how to cook a turkey.

588
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:24,987
Sure, except that I'm a haunted
man for the rest of my life.

589
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:27,623
Boy, I wish that's all
I ever had to worry about.

590
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:45,708
<i>Saved from
earthly taint and sin</i>

591
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,579
<i>Home, sweet home</i>

592
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:53,883
<i>Our home forever</i>

593
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:59,322
<i>All the pilgrim journey past</i>

594
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:05,561
<i>Welcomed home to wander never</i>

595
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:08,665
<i>Saved through Jesus</i>

596
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:15,506
<i>Home at last</i>

597
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:20,077
And now I have a very
pleasant task to perform.

598
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,314
Usually on Sundays
I have to scold you a little,

599
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:25,649
because that is what
I am paid to do,

600
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:28,619
and I try to earn my keep,

601
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:31,955
but today is
a day of rejoicing.

602
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:35,558
Home from the hills
cometh the hunter.

603
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,796
Home from the wars, the hero.

604
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:40,864
Homecoming.

605
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,367
What a beautiful word.

606
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:47,804
Home to
the arms of his mother,

607
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,908
the widow of yet another hero

608
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,813
cut down in
the bloom of young manhood.

609
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:59,784
The arms of a mother who struggled
through poverty and privation

610
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:03,821
to raise her son
rightly and courageously,

611
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:09,093
that he might follow in the
honorable footsteps of his father.

612
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:13,365
The years were hard.
Not always was there work,

613
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:17,835
and the winds of reality blew
coldly against this frail woman

614
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,837
protecting her infant son.

615
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:25,075
She had one possession,
her home.

616
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:28,514
The little white house
at the end of Oak Street.

617
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,882
The home of heroes.

618
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,552
She clung to it tenaciously,

619
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:38,423
but one day she came to
the end of her rope,

620
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:41,893
and a mortgage
was her only solution.

621
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:46,798
I have here
the document in question,

622
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,735
purchased by the grateful
citizens of our township.

623
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:55,673
Purchased with deep respect by the
grateful citizens of our township,

624
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:58,610
who have asked me to perform
the following ceremony.

625
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:03,047
You will notice
I have nothing up my sleeve.

626
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,112
Everybody's been so kind.

627
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:40,219
Very nice, Reverend.

628
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,993
Everything went perfect, huh?

629
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:49,695
It was
a very beautiful ceremony.

630
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,831
Well, how do I pay it back?

631
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,501
Well, they should've done it a long
time ago on account of your old man.

632
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,802
Wait till they find out.
Who's gonna find out?

633
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:58,737
Woodrow, we want your opinion.
On what?

634
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,506
On the location of the monument.
The monument?

635
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,575
Yes. Naturally,
General Zabriski has the choice spot,

636
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,711
What monument is that?
Oh, didn't you know?

637
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:09,216
We're raising you a little
monument by public subscription.

638
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:11,217
I always say it's better to do
these things while they're hot.

639
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,819
Just something modest
in granite probably.

640
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:16,055
Bronze is simply
impossible to get.

641
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:18,057
It's just to our first hero
of this present war.

642
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,059
Look, if anybody
deserves a monument,

643
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:22,061
it's my father, not me!
That's right.

644
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,797
He's on it, too.
You're both on it, shaking hands.

645
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:27,634
It's called,
"Like Father, Like Son."

646
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:30,036
Now,
just in front of the station there's a plot,

647
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,172
and I thought
if it wasn't too...

648
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,573
Did I say something wrong?

649
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:34,875
You mean you haven't
told him yet?

650
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:38,245
Every time I started to,
a band started to play

651
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,979
or they burned
the mortgage on his house...

652
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,248
Or they raised him a statue.
Well, I can't help it.

653
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,050
I suppose you're
very proud of him now?

654
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:46,152
Well, why shouldn't I be?
I grew up with him.

655
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,854
So did I, but I don't
walk around starry-eyed...

656
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,523
You're just jealous.

657
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:51,224
Well, make it snappy, will you?
Of course I will.

658
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:54,159
Wonderful sentimental nonsense
and seven hungry men to feed.

659
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:55,528
Oh, boy!

660
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,563
Hey.
What?

661
00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:58,797
What do I do now?

662
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,000
Well, you just
let it blow over.

663
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:02,035
Did you ever see
a statue blow over?

664
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:03,904
Well, maybe you could
be sort of hard to please.

665
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,040
They want it standing up,
you want it sitting down.

666
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,942
They want it shaking hands,
you want it with the hands behind the back.

667
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,243
Now...
They want it in front of the station,

668
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,978
you want it where
General Zablitzki is,

669
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,247
till one day they say,
"Do you want it, or don't you?"

670
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:15,882
And you say,
"In that case, no."

671
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:16,951
And there you are.

672
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,553
Well, what do I do
about the mortgage?

673
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:20,588
Well, you could sort of...

674
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,989
Look, I didn't get you into this...
Oh, yes, you did!

675
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,292
I was gonna hide in the...
A Marine never hides!

676
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:27,894
<i>That's what semper fidelis means.
It means "face the music."</i>

677
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,996
Well, it does not!
It happens to mean "always faithful"!

678
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:34,068
It doesn't mean faithful to your mother
at all. It means faithful to the...

679
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,338
You're home. Your mother's happy.
Did you see that look in her eyes?

680
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,274
Your girl still loves you, and the
town gave you a nice little reception.

681
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:43,176
I'll say they did!
Boy, I wished I was in your shoes.

682
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,344
Boy, I wish you were, too!

683
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,848
I know you did it for the best,
and I thank you for your good intentions...

684
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,283
I tell you
it'll all blow over.

685
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:51,586
Everything is perfect,
except for a couple of details.

686
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:53,854
They hang people
for a couple of details.

687
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,690
What are you talking about?

688
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,960
I been a hero,
you could call it that, for 25 years,

689
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:00,995
and does anybody
ever ask me what I done?

690
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:02,630
If they did,
I could hardly tell them,

691
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,332
I've told it
so different so many times.

692
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:07,334
It ain't as if you done it on purpose.
By Tuesday you'll be forgotten.

693
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:09,203
Well, I hope you're right.
I know I'm right.

694
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,238
You take General Zablitzki, for instance...
Zabriski.

695
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,940
All right,
where did he tend bar?

696
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,375
That's a
different case entirely.

697
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,776
They bought him
at an ironworks

698
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:16,811
that was
going out of business.

699
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,179
He was just a bargain,
that's all.

700
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:19,946
Well, you're the only guy
who knows it.

701
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:22,248
All everybody else
knows is he's a hero.

702
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,153
He's got a statue in the park,
and the birds sit on it.

703
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:27,689
Except that I ain't got no birds on me,
I'm in the same boat.

704
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:29,057
Now, look.
Woodrow.

705
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,660
Yes?
Could I see you for a few moments, please?

706
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:32,928
Why, certainly.

707
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:38,366
Woodrow! Now, hurry, darling.
Dinner's on the table.

708
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,801
And you, too, Sergeant.
You come along too, Libby.

709
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,305
We'd be delighted to have you.
Thank you. I...

710
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:44,673
Come on, Libby.

711
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,310
Boy, this is something.
Pass some of that cheese, will you?

712
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:51,312
Now,
just a little pie to fill in the chinks.

713
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,881
Yes, ma'am, I'll have to
eat it in little pieces.

714
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:55,016
There you are.

715
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:59,221
Well, I guess the excitement kind
of twisted my stomach a little.

716
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,356
It's the fever.
No, it isn't the fever.

717
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,226
That never bothers me
at all except...

718
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:07,829
You see?
Not at all.

719
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:09,431
It's not...

720
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,869
Well, don't blow the house
down now that we own it.

721
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:18,940
Wasn't that a lovely gesture?
This is the happiest day of my life.

722
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:22,110
Woodrow, if you're all finished,
would you come outside with me a moment?

723
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,412
There's something I have to tell you.
Sure.

724
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,349
Here it comes.
Here what comes?

725
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,384
I'll see what it is.

726
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:30,952
What's the matter, Woodrow?

727
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,988
Does he feel hot?
Feel his head.

728
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,024
I don't feel hot.
If anything, I...

729
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:41,430
Woodrow, Judge Dennis,
the Sheriff, Doc Bissell

730
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:43,366
and a lot of other men
want to see you right away.

731
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:45,401
They're in the parlor.
What about?

732
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:47,069
They didn't tell me, dear.
They just said...

733
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:48,971
They probably want to
baptize a baby after you.

734
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:50,740
What's the matter, dear?

735
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:20,402
Good afternoon,
Judge Dennis.

736
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:21,970
There you are, Woodrow.

737
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,742
Where are the medals?

738
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,010
The medals.

739
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,947
Well, I just wore those
to get off the train.

740
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:33,015
I suppose I shouldn't have.

741
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,951
What do you mean,
you shouldn't have?

742
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:36,452
If all good men wore medals,

743
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:39,122
it wouldn't be so hard
to tell the good from the bad.

744
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:42,526
I guess that's right,
all right. Well, I'm ready.

745
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,060
I guess I deserve what I get.

746
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,129
You certainly do.
Beyond question.

747
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:48,965
Goodbye, Mama.

748
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,399
Who told you about it?

749
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,201
Well, I can put
two and two together.

750
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:53,870
What are you talking about?

751
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:55,104
Aren't you gonna
take me somewhere?

752
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:57,307
Not at all. We're going
to do it right here.

753
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:59,041
Oh, yeah?

754
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:01,978
Woodrow, there's something
rotten in this town.

755
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,214
I know it.
That's why we're here.

756
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:06,817
I know it, but I don't see why you
have to do it in front of my mother.

757
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,852
Then let's get down
to business.

758
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,988
The trouble with our party is
everybody talks too long all the time.

759
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,091
That's the trouble
with all parties.

760
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,860
Woodrow, there's something
rotten in this town.

761
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,929
You don't have to keep
rubbing it in. I'm ready.

762
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:22,900
Nothing you can put your finger on exactly,
but a kind of something you can feel.

763
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:26,036
It's like
the town was selfish.

764
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:30,139
Everybody thinking about little
profits and how not to pay the taxes

765
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,944
and reasons for not buying
bonds and not working too hard

766
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:37,047
and not working at night because
it's nicer in the daytime.

767
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,983
All things that are
all right in peacetime.

768
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:43,353
Things you used to call
thrift and relaxation

769
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:47,559
that made many a fortune, but things
that are plain dishonest in wartime.

770
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:49,027
That's right.

771
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:52,263
The motto of this town is
"Business as usual,"

772
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:55,165
but a lot of us feel
wartime ain't a usual time

773
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,935
and that business as usual
is dishonest.

774
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:00,270
That's why we need
an honest man for mayor.

775
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:02,973
An honest man who will wake
us up and tell us the truth

776
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,976
about something
he knows all about.

777
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:07,612
An honest man who will tell
us the truth and who can win.

778
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,913
We got an honest man
who'll tell us the truth,

779
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:13,016
but nobody votes for him except
his brother and his wife.

780
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,586
And I'm not even
sure about her.

781
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:18,589
I have everything
but popularity.

782
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:22,161
In other words, Woodrow,
we want you to take Doc Bissell's place.

783
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:24,863
The right shall prevail.
Right.

784
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:29,234
But I'm not a veterinary. I hardly
know one end of a horse from another.

785
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:34,939
We want you to run for mayor,
Woodrow, in the coming election.

786
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:38,176
You want me to run for mayor?

787
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:40,511
Three cheers for the new mayor.
Hip, hip, hip...

788
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:41,579
Hooray!

789
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:42,947
Hip, hip, hip...
Hooray!

790
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,415
You're making a...
Hip, hip, hip...

791
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,184
Hooray!
Bring him out!

792
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:54,324
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you our new Mayor!

793
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:17,016
First we will have
a few words from Doc Bissell.

794
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,620
I'm going to be
even briefer than usual.

795
00:43:22,622 --> 00:43:25,690
You know what I stand for in this town.
You know what I'm against.

796
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:30,095
Our party is fortunate in having
found a worthier standard-bearer

797
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:36,200
A man who fought for you overseas.
A man who will fight for you here and win!

798
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:43,208
For the good of our party,

799
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,479
for the good of our town
and its war effort,

800
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:49,115
for the good of
the United States of America,

801
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:54,453
to vote for Corporal Woodrow
Lafayette Pershing Truesmith!

802
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:03,330
Before introducing
the principal speaker,

803
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:07,433
I wish to point out that he
appears before you not as a hero,

804
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,234
not with decorations

805
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:13,172
he so heroically won
and so richly deserves,

806
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:16,742
but as a simple citizen,
a hometown boy back home!

807
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:25,218
I need say no more of the
character of this young man

808
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,154
than that he refused
to wear his medals!

809
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:37,397
Ladles and gentlemen,
I give you Mr. Truesmith!

810
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,068
No, no!

811
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:50,743
Ladies and gentlemen,

812
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:55,048
I wish I were dead.

813
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:01,055
You're making a big mistake!

814
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:02,455
Oh, no!

815
00:45:04,525 --> 00:45:09,095
I love my mother very much.

816
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,067
He has a natural flair
for politics.

817
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:15,802
But she shouldn't have
told you I was coming home

818
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:17,537
and made all that fuss
at the station.

819
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:22,442
I really don't deserve it.

820
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,311
Go on! You betcha!

821
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:30,083
There are many, many men,

822
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:32,685
any one of
these young men, for instance,

823
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,488
far, far more deserving
than myself.

824
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,293
The medals that
you saw pinned on me

825
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:42,463
you could practically say
were pinned on by mistake.

826
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,800
I want you to believe me.

827
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:50,471
I've known all of you
all my life.

828
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:52,540
I've mowed your lawns.

829
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,409
I've delivered milk
for your babies.

830
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,611
I even know the dogs and cats.

831
00:45:57,613 --> 00:45:59,512
The milk-and-baby part
is remarkable.

832
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:01,615
After that
he could be president.

833
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:05,853
Nothing would be dearer to my heart than
to be worthy of the honor you offer me.

834
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:07,521
I wish I could accept it.

835
00:46:07,523 --> 00:46:09,123
You bet!

836
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,159
I'm no hero!

837
00:46:15,831 --> 00:46:21,703
I haven't had Dr. Bissell's
long experience with animals.

838
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:25,807
There is the man for you!

839
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:27,875
No, no, no.
I thank you.

840
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:35,817
I never saw so many things
happen in one day in my life.

841
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,290
That was wonderful, wonderful!
Oh, my son. Wonderful!

842
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,326
That's as fine
a political speech

843
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:47,595
as I've heard since Bryan
and the crown of thorns.

844
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,396
You don't need any lessons
from me, Woodrow.

845
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:51,532
If I might make
one suggestion, Woodrow.

846
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:54,302
I wouldn't play down the hero
part quite so much hereafter.

847
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:56,437
But I'm not a hero.
Modesty notwithstanding.

848
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,173
They like it, you know.

849
00:46:58,175 --> 00:46:59,875
Anyway, the Sergeant's taking
care of that part of it.

850
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:01,476
The Sergeant's
taking care of...

851
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:03,445
Hereafter?
What are you talking about?

852
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:04,913
...a couple of
things about Woodrow.

853
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:08,416
I don't know just how
he's gonna take this.

854
00:47:08,418 --> 00:47:11,419
In fact, he's so modest, I'm pretty
sure he ain't gonna like it at all.

855
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,324
In fact, I may get quite a sock
on the jaw before I'm through.

856
00:47:16,326 --> 00:47:18,226
What's he saying?

857
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:20,729
Anyway, I'm just going to give
you one sample of his courage

858
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:22,230
and his resourcefulness.

859
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:23,932
Good!

860
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:26,601
I'm gonna tell you
how he saved my life.

861
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:28,870
What's the matter with him?
He can't do that.

862
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:30,739
No, no, no, Woodrow. Relax.

863
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:33,408
We're on the beach,
see, at Tanaru Bay.

864
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,611
All of a sudden we hear,
"Here they come! Take cover!"

865
00:47:36,613 --> 00:47:40,782
And out of the jungle come 200,
maybe 300 Japs preceded by a hail of bullets.

866
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:42,685
I turn,
and my foot catches in a...

867
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:46,856
I didn't see exactly what it was.
I was kind of in a hurry, see?

868
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:49,792
But I'm stuck. I'm lost.

869
00:47:49,794 --> 00:47:53,562
Now a voice says,
"Keep cool, pal."

870
00:47:53,564 --> 00:47:56,865
And beside me I see Woodrow!

871
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:04,240
Not yet! Not yet!

872
00:48:04,242 --> 00:48:05,641
Everything is all right.

873
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:09,811
I tell you I'm not running for mayor.
You're not running for mayor?

874
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:12,380
Why, you couldn't stop from being
mayor of this town if you...

875
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:14,649
Don't drink that, Woodrow.
Don't drink that. It's cooking wine.

876
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:16,486
Well, I'm cooked.

877
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:28,231
Zing, he got another one!
Zang, another one hits the deck!

878
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:30,633
Zowie! He clubs two of them
with the butt end of his gun!

879
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:33,337
We duck, and we run another little piece,
then drop!

880
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:35,606
Zing, zing, and two more
brown brothers bite the dust!

881
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:37,440
Now he picks up a machine gun.

882
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:43,980
But the Japs kept coming,
and he kept firing.

883
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:46,682
The machine gun got hot.
His hands were burning,

884
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:48,551
but Woodrow stuck to his post.

885
00:48:48,553 --> 00:48:50,354
I managed to get near him,

886
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:51,954
then I got hit.

887
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:54,957
As I'm laying there,
somebody pulls me to safety.

888
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:58,962
I open my eyes,
and who do I see but Woodrow!

889
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:09,373
Once again, fellow citizens,

890
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,942
you have chosen me
to be your Major. Applause.

891
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:15,579
And once again,
I accept the charge.

892
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,681
Make that responsibility.

893
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:19,915
I accept the responsibility...

894
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:21,851
Make that deep responsibility.

895
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:25,422
I accept
the deep responsibility...

896
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:26,990
No, just make that
plain responsibility.

897
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:28,558
I wish you'd make up your mind.
What?

898
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,627
And don't go so fast.
I don't know how to do this.

899
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:31,962
Then, why isn't Libby here?
She'll be back.

900
00:49:31,964 --> 00:49:33,596
She's still getting paid
as my secretary,

901
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:34,997
you know,
no matter who she marries.

902
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:38,602
I mean, even if
she is engaged to you.

903
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:39,836
Now, where was I?

904
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,440
"Once again, fellow citizens,

905
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:44,375
"you have chosen me
to be your Major, applause.

906
00:49:44,377 --> 00:49:46,044
"And once again,
I accept the charge.

907
00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:48,745
"Make that responsibility.
I accept the responsibility.

908
00:49:48,747 --> 00:49:51,748
"Make that deep responsibility.
I accept the deep responsibility.

909
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,483
"No, just make that
plain responsibility."

910
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:55,619
Are you simple-minded
or something?

911
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:59,724
I accept the responsibility with a sense of
both humility, satisfaction and gratitude.

912
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:01,659
You dictated plain responsibility.
That's right!

913
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,061
That means responsibility
without adjectives.

914
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:05,729
Jumping Jehoshaphat!

915
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:08,699
Now, where was I?
Don't tell me!

916
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:13,904
I accept the responsibility with a
sense of both humility, satisfaction

917
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:16,908
and gratitude.

918
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,877
You can't say both humility,
satisfaction and gratitude.

919
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:24,382
And you have humility,
satisfaction and gratitude. That's three.

920
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:26,884
I can't say it?
You cannot.

921
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:29,354
I've been saying it for years.
Well, it isn't correct grammar.

922
00:50:29,356 --> 00:50:31,489
I'm not running on a platform
of correct grammar.

923
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,691
I even let my grammar
slop over a little, sometimes.

924
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:37,428
It gives that homey feeling,
horny hands and honest hearts!

925
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,963
Now, where was I?

926
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:41,366
"With a sense of both humility,
satisfaction and gratitude."

927
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:42,633
All right, take out humility.
Leave it in.

928
00:50:42,635 --> 00:50:47,704
Will you do as I tell you instead of
sitting there a like a stuffed nincompoop

929
00:50:47,706 --> 00:50:50,675
trying to annoy me just because your
girlfriend is out with somebody else?

930
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:52,143
What?
Now, where was I?

931
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:54,513
"With a sense of both
satisfaction and gratitude."

932
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:55,981
And humility.

933
00:50:57,951 --> 00:50:59,684
Well, what are you gaping at?
Nothing.

934
00:50:59,686 --> 00:51:01,486
Well, cut it out. Now...

935
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:05,022
Well, it's about time.
I'm sorry.

936
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:09,862
I'll take it, Forrest.

937
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:12,498
I trust the conquering hero
is home, and that's that.

938
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,401
Now, let's get this speech out of the
way without further interruptions.

939
00:51:16,403 --> 00:51:18,803
Dictating to my son is
like dictating to a sponge.

940
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:20,171
Mr. Noble,
before you go any...

941
00:51:20,173 --> 00:51:22,608
I said without further
interruptions, if you please.

942
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,510
If it's all the same to you.
Yes, sir.

943
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:26,044
What were you crying about?
You can fight that out later.

944
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:29,814
"With a sense of both humility,
satisfaction and gratitude."

945
00:51:29,816 --> 00:51:31,516
You can't say that.
I can't say it?

946
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:35,554
Will you be so kind as to permit
me to dictate my own speech?

947
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:37,923
I'm sorry.
Well.

948
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:40,126
As President and owner
of the Noble Chair Company,

949
00:51:40,128 --> 00:51:41,928
Seats of all Descriptions,

950
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,763
I am to most of you...
Make that many of you.

951
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:47,566
Or make it some of you.
Your employer,

952
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:52,137
but as Mayor of our fair city,
I am to all of you your servant.

953
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:54,940
That's a nice twist.

954
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,744
Mine not to reason why.

955
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:00,546
Mine but to...
Do or die.

956
00:52:00,548 --> 00:52:02,848
When I want your assistance,
I'll ask for it.

957
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:06,885
Mine but to...
Well, what are you looking at?

958
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,454
Nothing.
Well, cut it out.

959
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:11,122
Mine but to...

960
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:12,757
What's all that hollering
down the street?

961
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:15,028
It's for Woodrow.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

962
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,896
You see,
Doc Bissell and the rest of them came up...

963
00:52:16,898 --> 00:52:20,567
Well, I suppose that's natural,
so long as they don't overdo it.

964
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:23,169
Now... "Mine not to reason why.
Mine but to..."

965
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,071
Hearken and obey.

966
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:29,608
Heaven knows I did not
seek this distinction,

967
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,079
but since you force it upon me,
what alternative have I?

968
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:35,815
Save your voice, Evvy.
What? What's the matter?

969
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,984
Bissell's just retired in favor of Woodrow,
the local hero.

970
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:42,020
We got a fight on our hands.
You mean that I welcomed at the station?

971
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:43,822
That's right.
Now you have some real opposition.

972
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:47,160
Wasn't it thrilling, Libby?
Will you kindly shut up for a minute?

973
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:51,164
He was so shy and embarrassed,
but at the same time so manly...

974
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,167
Will you kindly...
You mean running for Mayor against me?

975
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,168
That's what I was trying to tell you.
Will you...

976
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,070
But he can't do that with the
election only two days off.

977
00:52:57,072 --> 00:53:00,106
You'll have a chance
to use all your oratory, dear.

978
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,876
He most certainly cannot.
Why, that's entirely illegal.

979
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:05,980
Why, if such were the case, I mean to say,
why, any loose character whatsoever

980
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,648
fresh from the penitentiary
could come along...

981
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,249
Loose character, Mr. Noble?

982
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:11,184
Woodrow doesn't happen to be
a loose character,

983
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:13,286
and he's fresh from the battlefield,
not from the penitentiary.

984
00:53:13,288 --> 00:53:15,255
That was a figure of speech.
Well, I don't care for it.

985
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:16,823
Father didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

986
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,925
Well, maybe Father did.
Which side are you on, anyway?

987
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:22,229
Because I don't want any spies in my office.
Father, please.

988
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:25,031
He doesn't mean that, Libby.
Oh, yes, I do.

989
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,566
Well, if you don't want me
around your office,

990
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:27,700
you certainly don't
have to have me.

991
00:53:27,702 --> 00:53:30,670
This is your son's fiancee.
She isn't my fiancee.

992
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:31,906
When I lose confidence
in people...

993
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:36,110
She's isn't gonna live in my house with me.
I'll move into the doghouse first.

994
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:39,179
Then, goodbye, Mr. Noble.
Goodbye, Miss Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

995
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:42,783
That's right, abandon the shinking sip...
Sinking ship.

996
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,919
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Evvy?
You're not sunk yet.

997
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,287
You're very popular
in some quarters.

998
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,122
Anyway, the whole thing
is entirely illegal.

999
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,190
Why, his name isn't even on the ballot.
It don't have to be.

1000
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:52,959
He's a write-in candidate. That's what
that blank space at the bottom is for.

1001
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:56,697
It's to count them with...
It's to put the date on.

1002
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:57,998
You call my lawyer.

1003
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,833
I'm calling him now,
but you can take it from me,

1004
00:53:59,835 --> 00:54:01,969
this is a free country.
They can vote for anybody they like.

1005
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:05,972
I know, but that's how it is,
and the way it is, it don't look so good.

1006
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:10,143
A chance?
Did you ever see a snowslide?

1007
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:11,813
Hello. Max?

1008
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,081
I guess we all
are a little bit.

1009
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,116
Talking that way about a boy
who risked his life

1010
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,352
so the Noble Chair Company
can make its 12%.

1011
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,653
"Business as usual."

1012
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,220
The Noble Chair Company
makes 24%,

1013
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,690
just enough to cover its taxes,
but he doesn't mean it, Libby.

1014
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,725
Politicians always talk
that way about each other.

1015
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,061
Woodrow is probably calling Father
an old windbag right this minute.

1016
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,164
Well, if he is, he's right.
Thank you.

1017
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,934
I'm sorry. We all are
a little upset, I guess.

1018
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,002
You weren't going to stay on
as Father's secretary, anyway,

1019
00:54:35,004 --> 00:54:36,737
after our marriage,
so what does it matter?

1020
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,205
What was I going to do?
Stay home and weave?

1021
00:54:38,207 --> 00:54:39,940
Well, you might stay home
and take care of your children

1022
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,609
with the servant problem
as it is.

1023
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,744
Well, thank you for warning me.
Do you mean that?

1024
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,981
Oh, of course I don't mean it.
I don't mean anything,

1025
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:50,184
going around talking about people
he doesn't know anything about.

1026
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,053
You're still talking about
your children's grandfather.

1027
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,788
What are you trying to do,
depress me?

1028
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,156
If I thought they'd look
anything like him...

1029
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,992
Well, I don't look
anything like him.

1030
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,394
I've noticed that.
I pin my hopes on it.

1031
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,296
We're getting a little disagreeable again,
aren't we?

1032
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,231
We seem to be.

1033
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,734
Maybe now that the hero is home,
you feel a little differently about me.

1034
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:09,237
I feel exactly the same about
you that I've always felt.

1035
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,173
That you're upright and honorable
and tall and handsome and wealthy

1036
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,776
and exactly what any girl in
her right mind would hope for.

1037
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,645
Thank you.

1038
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,980
I just wish Woodrow hadn't come home
exactly when he did, that's all.

1039
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,915
What's he got to do with us?
Oh, nothing.

1040
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,785
It just spoils things a little, that's all.
Why should it?

1041
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,053
Or do you think
I ought to offer you to him,

1042
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,855
like the keys to the city,
on a silver platter?

1043
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:31,193
And say, "Here, O noble hero,
it happens to be my fiancee,

1044
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:34,663
"but I'm only a civilian after all, so if
you'd rather have her, just help yourself.

1045
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:35,898
"Don't bother to
stand on ceremony."

1046
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,900
In the first place,
he doesn't want me.

1047
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,335
Oh, you asked him, did you?
I did not.

1048
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,804
In the second place,
I'm engaged to you.

1049
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:45,808
I had plenty of time to think it over before
I accepted you, and that's all there is to it.

1050
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,676
A girl who went around
changing her mind all the time

1051
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,044
wouldn't be much good,
I don't think.

1052
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,345
She wouldn't be
much good to me.

1053
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,147
Well, she wouldn't be
much good to anybody.

1054
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,349
Thank you.

1055
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,419
Where's your ring?
My aunt has it.

1056
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:58,888
I was afraid of losing it
in all the excitement.

1057
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,955
Oh. How did he take
the news anyway?

1058
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,290
Oh, you mean Woodrow?

1059
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,193
How many people
did you have to break it to?

1060
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,362
Well, I didn't quite get
the chance to tell him yet.

1061
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,133
You haven't told him yet?
I didn't get the chance.

1062
00:56:10,135 --> 00:56:12,102
Then, what have you been doing all day,
basking in his glory?

1063
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:14,037
I just didn't
get an opening.

1064
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,805
Do you want me to tell him?
I'll create an opening.

1065
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:17,907
No, I don't.
Holy mackerel.

1066
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:20,743
Don't sound like your father.
Well, when are you gonna tell him?

1067
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:22,745
Well, I'll go over
in a little while.

1068
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,480
Be sure and put on something pretty.
I will.

1069
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,750
And try not to break his heart.
I won't.

1070
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:29,185
Holy mackerel.
Will I see you anymore tonight?

1071
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:31,787
No.
Well, then, good night.

1072
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,956
Good night, dear.

1073
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,128
Say, you haven't got
any more boyfriends

1074
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,363
in the Army, the Navy
or the Marine Corps, have you?

1075
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,999
No, dear.
He was the only one.

1076
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:55,038
Well, that's the war for you.
It's always hard on women.

1077
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:01,144
Either they take your men away
and never send them back at all,

1078
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,949
or they send them back unexpectedly
just to embarrass you.

1079
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,320
No consideration at all.

1080
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:12,590
There, there, there.

1081
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:20,398
...and when I say surrounded,
I mean surrounded!

1082
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,532
One for the little girl.

1083
00:58:21,534 --> 00:58:23,934
We want Woodrow
for our mayor.

1084
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:26,304
M-A-R-E? M-A-Y-O-R.
What's the matter with you?

1085
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,039
What have horses
got to do with it?

1086
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,241
It's a good thing this food
came in when it did.

1087
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:32,610
It's a good thing
Woodrow came in when he did.

1088
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:35,980
Win with Woodrow!
One Woodrow Special.

1089
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:38,248
Coming up.
That means the best of everything.

1090
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,051
Win with Woodrow. Now be careful.
The ink is still a little fresh.

1091
00:58:41,053 --> 00:58:43,020
Wait a minute.
He's on his feet.

1092
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,323
He's running toward us carrying
the machine gun with him.

1093
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:47,024
He's fooled them, see?

1094
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:50,028
Their guns began to chatter,
but he reached the trees.

1095
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,264
We're saved,
and as he comes staggering...

1096
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:54,565
Your mother told you not to
drink any more of that stuff.

1097
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:57,301
Say, am I four years old or something?
You give me that...

1098
00:58:57,303 --> 00:58:59,271
You behave yourself and do
like your mother tells you.

1099
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:00,572
You made her
enough trouble.

1100
00:59:00,574 --> 00:59:02,274
I made her trouble?
That's right.

1101
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:05,410
You made me trouble.
You and your mother complex...

1102
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,012
Listen, knucklehead,
you take one more crack at your mother...

1103
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:10,514
Who's taking cracks at my mother?
All I said was...

1104
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:13,150
Well, don't say it.
Are you nuts or something?

1105
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:14,652
Maybe.

1106
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:17,890
Oh, Woodrow, isn't it wonderful?
I'm so proud of you.

1107
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,058
We're short of sugar.
Oh, my boy.

1108
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:23,494
There's only one...

1109
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:25,930
You see that look in her eyes?
Yes, I saw it.

1110
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:27,399
Well, that's what
we're working for, see?

1111
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,168
Can't you get it through
that thick skull of yours...

1112
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,337
All right, you're on next.
Just shoot them some bull about how you was

1113
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,240
in a hot spot with your foot
caught in a gizmo

1114
00:59:34,242 --> 00:59:38,110
and just when you ain't got a chance,
who should come along but...

1115
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:42,447
and getting me in deeper and deeper
so there'll never be a way out?

1116
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:44,116
They're eating it up.
Let them enjoy it.

1117
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:46,118
Can I tell them about me
and Smitty at Tulagi?

1118
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,186
Sure, only you gotta be Smitty,
and he's got to be you,

1119
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:50,022
and you both gotta come out alive.
Ding how.

1120
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:53,125
You're gonna win the walk,
and once you're in, you're in.

1121
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,661
Don't you understand
an election based on fraud...

1122
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,930
Where's the fraud?
You was in the Marines.

1123
00:59:57,932 --> 01:00:00,299
Look, I didn't expect this
any more than you did,

1124
01:00:00,301 --> 01:00:02,134
but now that it happened,
let it happen.

1125
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:04,135
They want heroes,
we got six of them.

1126
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:06,973
All right, we throw in a seventh
for good luck. Who's counting?

1127
01:00:06,975 --> 01:00:08,441
We're doing it
for your ma, kid.

1128
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:10,610
They say opportunity's only
got one hair on its head,

1129
01:00:10,612 --> 01:00:14,013
and dog it down or you
mightn't get another chance.

1130
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:16,249
I don't want another chance.
I don't want any part of it.

1131
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:20,585
Don't you understand that
this is all based on lies?

1132
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:23,589
What lies? You put on the wrong blouse
when the train come into the station.

1133
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:26,526
That could happen to anybody.
The lies they're telling out front.

1134
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:31,264
Every one of those boys is telling the truth,
except they change the names a little

1135
01:00:31,266 --> 01:00:33,365
so as not to
give out military information.

1136
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,500
"Lies"!

1137
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:38,537
Anyway, those ain't lies. Those are
campaign promises. They expect them.

1138
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,285
Hello, Woodrow.
Hello, Libby.

1139
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,489
Gee, you look lovely.
Thank you.

1140
01:00:56,491 --> 01:00:58,025
You shouldn't drink
too much of that stuff, dear,

1141
01:00:58,027 --> 01:00:59,593
no matter how much
you feel like celebrating.

1142
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,594
Are you gonna start now?

1143
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:04,097
Why, Woodrow,
I'm only thinking of your own good.

1144
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:05,665
Well, there are
too many people doing it.

1145
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,533
They're thinking
about my own good so much,

1146
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:10,403
they're gonna land me in the hoosegow,
if they haven't already.

1147
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:13,740
Why, Woodrow, you've been nipping.
I have not been nipping.

1148
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:17,276
I have something to tell you, Woodrow.
All right, all right,

1149
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:19,379
but the less you hang around
here and are seen with me,

1150
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:21,114
the better it's gonna be
for you, you understand?

1151
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:22,615
Now, I'm telling you
that for your good.

1152
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:25,386
Oh, you needn't think I want
to cash in on your glory.

1153
01:01:25,388 --> 01:01:28,055
All I came here to tell you...
Who said anything about that?

1154
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:30,690
All I came here to tell you is that
I'm going to marry Forrest Noble

1155
01:01:30,692 --> 01:01:33,160
next Sunday morning at 10:00,

1156
01:01:33,162 --> 01:01:34,461
and the only reason
I didn't tell you all day...

1157
01:01:34,463 --> 01:01:38,298
...was because I didn't want
to spoil your homecoming.

1158
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,035
But that's marvelous.
That's the best news I heard all day.

1159
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:42,569
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way about it.

1160
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:44,537
At least I don't have
to worry about you.

1161
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:47,306
Because I think
it's marvelous, too,

1162
01:01:47,308 --> 01:01:50,277
and I hope I never see you
again as long as I live.

1163
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:53,647
Here's your frat pin.
Wait a minute, will you?

1164
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:56,116
Woodrow, you've just got to come
out and address the crowd again.

1165
01:01:56,118 --> 01:01:58,352
They will no longer accept
substitutes any longer.

1166
01:01:58,354 --> 01:02:00,653
I am not going out
to address the crowd again.

1167
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,255
I already told them
how I felt.

1168
01:02:02,257 --> 01:02:06,061
I'm not running for mayor.
But you are running for mayor.

1169
01:02:06,063 --> 01:02:07,629
But I'm not.
Whether you like it or not.

1170
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:09,397
You've been drafted.
Can they do that?

1171
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:11,232
Sure.
They done it.

1172
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:14,334
Listen to them.
You listen to them.

1173
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:17,104
Feel it.

1174
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:22,644
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1175
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:27,282
<i>Let's give Everett the air</i>

1176
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:31,718
<i>Up with Woodrow
Down with Noble</i>

1177
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,590
<i>Let's kick Evvy off the chair</i>

1178
01:02:36,592 --> 01:02:41,496
<i>Up our hero goes and down this zero goes
'cause we want</i>

1179
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:46,868
"You can fool all of the people part
of the time and part of the..."

1180
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,137
Where'd he go?
What's happened to him?

1181
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:53,708
Look, I'm in enough trouble
without you turning against me.

1182
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:56,344
When did I turn against you?
I've been loyal to you all my life.

1183
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:58,580
I... You know how I felt about you.
You broke off with me.

1184
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:01,816
I would have waited for always.
Even so I asked my fiance's permission

1185
01:03:01,818 --> 01:03:04,285
to welcome you the way I thought
you'd like to be welcomed.

1186
01:03:04,287 --> 01:03:06,721
Although I may have been wrong,
I defended you all afternoon

1187
01:03:06,723 --> 01:03:08,590
and got fired for it by Mr. Noble...
No.

1188
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:10,524
...and almost broke off
my engagement with Forrest.

1189
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:12,794
And you say I'm turning against you.
I'm sorry.

1190
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:14,429
Well...
Will you cut that out?

1191
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,564
No, I won't.
You've caused me enough trouble as it is

1192
01:03:16,566 --> 01:03:18,299
with everybody saying
I threw you over

1193
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:20,301
while you were fighting
overseas to marry Forrest,

1194
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:24,440
but I couldn't very well go around
wearing your letter in my hat

1195
01:03:24,442 --> 01:03:27,876
telling me you'd fallen in love with
somebody else, which is your perfect right.

1196
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:29,778
And I'm deeply in love
with Forrest,

1197
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,413
and you have to come back...
A heel.

1198
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:32,715
A hero.

1199
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:34,483
So, now they can say,
"You see?

1200
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:37,219
"It served her right.
She got just what she deserved."

1201
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:39,621
Will you cut it out?
I've got enough trouble! You have trouble?

1202
01:03:39,623 --> 01:03:41,723
And how I have.
I should say so.

1203
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:44,626
You can have any girl in town you want,
and you get a monument,

1204
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:46,495
and they burned
your mother's mortgage,

1205
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:50,799
and you're going to be mayor,
and I'm going to marry Forrest.

1206
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:52,568
But you said
you loved him deeply.

1207
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,903
Well, of course I do,
but what's that got to do with it?

1208
01:03:54,905 --> 01:04:02,777
<i>...and down this zero goes
'cause we want Woodrow for our mayor</i>

1209
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,615
Libby.
What?

1210
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:07,650
You don't know
how well-off you are.

1211
01:04:07,652 --> 01:04:10,586
Oh, don't talk that way.
You're only going to make me feel worse.

1212
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:13,322
If you knew what I heel I was,
you'd be very happy.

1213
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:16,225
And I am very happy, and I know
exactly how much of a heel you are.

1214
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,228
Anybody who could write
a letter like you wrote

1215
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,498
six weeks after we parted,
like we parted,

1216
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,932
you wouldn't have to tell me
any more about it.

1217
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:25,968
Well, I don't want to know
anything about her.

1218
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,838
Whether she's tall or short
or thin or fat or blonde,

1219
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,774
I just hope she's awful!

1220
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:35,211
No, I don't.

1221
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:38,647
I hope she's beautiful and that
you have 10 children by her.

1222
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:40,749
Is she?
If you only knew.

1223
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,819
Well, I don't want to know.

1224
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:49,693
Well, I guess you have to
start being grown-up sometime.

1225
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:52,728
Might as well be now.

1226
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,332
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
Great.

1227
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,435
Are you worried
about something, Woodrow?

1228
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:00,804
Who, me? How could I be?

1229
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:03,240
Don't you want to be mayor?
Of course I want to be mayor.

1230
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:04,908
I'd like to
have a million dollars, too.

1231
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:08,711
Well, then, of course,
I don't know what it's like to be famous.

1232
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:11,381
I suppose it even
has its drawbacks,

1233
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:14,584
but I think you'd be so proud,
Woodrow, so satisfied.

1234
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:17,887
I know I certainly am for you,
no matter how I talked out there.

1235
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:19,521
I'm gonna be famous,
all right.

1236
01:05:19,523 --> 01:05:23,526
I was so proud even sitting
beside you this afternoon.

1237
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:25,895
Do you remember when we used to come
here in the cool of the evening?

1238
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:29,033
Naturally.
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

1239
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:30,968
So much can happen
in a year.

1240
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,838
So much can happen in a day.
I suppose so.

1241
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
Were you surprised when they
nominated you for mayor?

1242
01:05:36,842 --> 01:05:39,476
Surprised is not
the word for it.

1243
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:44,014
Oh, excuse me.
That's all right.

1244
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:46,917
Did you ever think of me in Guadalcanal?
No.

1245
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:50,654
Oh, I guess that's a pretty busy place.
I guess so.

1246
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,589
I thought of you
in other places, though.

1247
01:05:52,591 --> 01:05:54,791
Where?
Just other places.

1248
01:05:54,793 --> 01:05:59,429
I'm so glad.
Even though it can only be a memory now.

1249
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:01,566
Do you remember when we cut
our initials in the tree?

1250
01:06:01,568 --> 01:06:03,668
Naturally.
They're still there.

1251
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,438
Why wouldn't they be?
They'll always be there.

1252
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,608
Unless something happens to the tree.
I'd never allow that.

1253
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:13,844
You'd be better off to chop the
tree down and forget me for good.

1254
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,780
That's why I'm so glad
you're gonna marry Forrest.

1255
01:06:15,782 --> 01:06:17,847
Why, it's such a load
off my mind.

1256
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,418
There's no hope for Mom.
She'll just have to leave town,

1257
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,553
but at least you can say
you suspected all along,

1258
01:06:22,555 --> 01:06:25,056
and that's why you broke off
with me and married Forrest,

1259
01:06:25,058 --> 01:06:27,525
who's all right
if you like people like that.

1260
01:06:27,527 --> 01:06:29,627
Then you won't
get hurt, see?

1261
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:32,595
Because outside of Mom, you're the
only thing in the world I care for,

1262
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:34,564
the only thing that matters.

1263
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:36,967
Now that it's over,
I want you to know that that letter I wrote

1264
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:39,904
was the hardest thing
I ever did in all my life.

1265
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:44,042
I thought about you every night and
every morning and every afternoon.

1266
01:06:44,044 --> 01:06:46,477
Every girl I saw
reminded me of you,

1267
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:51,882
and every flower,
I wanted to send to you.

1268
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:55,887
That's why I'm so happy, see?
Because you've had such a narrow escape.

1269
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:57,622
I think you're a little bit
feverish, dear...

1270
01:06:57,624 --> 01:07:00,091
Who, me? I'm just a little bit phony,
that's all. A little.

1271
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:04,595
That's right. You don't have to tell anybody.
They'll find out soon enough.

1272
01:07:04,597 --> 01:07:07,431
But I'm never gonna be mayor or
anything else, you understand?

1273
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:10,669
I've never been in Guadalcanal.
I've never won any medals.

1274
01:07:10,671 --> 01:07:13,772
I've never even been in the Marine
Corps really, you understand?

1275
01:07:13,774 --> 01:07:15,773
Oh, you've had
a very hard day, dear.

1276
01:07:15,775 --> 01:07:18,509
Yes, but wait till
tomorrow comes.

1277
01:07:18,511 --> 01:07:19,910
I don't think
you're feeling very well.

1278
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:22,414
Who, me? I never felt
better in my life,

1279
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,050
except I never felt worse.
You'll be all right, dear.

1280
01:07:25,052 --> 01:07:28,987
I suppose you despise me now.
Despise you?

1281
01:07:30,022 --> 01:07:32,624
How can you despise
anybody you love,

1282
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:35,694
even though you are engaged
to another man?

1283
01:07:35,696 --> 01:07:39,030
I'll love you as long as I live, Woodrow,
and you might as well know so now

1284
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:41,500
while we still have a few moments,
a last few moments...

1285
01:07:41,502 --> 01:07:46,638
I don't think you understood what I said.
I'm a phony. I'm a faker. I'm...

1286
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,607
You're just telling me that
to make me feel better.

1287
01:07:48,609 --> 01:07:51,777
I am not.
I'm never going to feel any better.

1288
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:55,447
I'm just broken-hearted,
Woodrow. I...

1289
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:58,015
Wait a minute, will you?
Libby, will you wait a minute?

1290
01:07:58,017 --> 01:08:01,487
Hey, here he is.

1291
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:03,823
I almost thought you took
it on the lam for a minute.

1292
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:05,758
Oh, excuse me.
Sergeant, will you tell Libby

1293
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,828
I've never been in Guadalcanal or
anyplace else? That I'm just a phony?

1294
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,797
Sure, he's never been
in Guadalcanal.

1295
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,564
He's never been no place.
See?

1296
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:14,733
None of us have.
We're all phonies, see?

1297
01:08:14,735 --> 01:08:16,501
Especially after a hard day,

1298
01:08:16,503 --> 01:08:19,071
only sometimes we're more phony than others,
you get me?

1299
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:21,741
I understand.
He ain't running for mayor or nothing.

1300
01:08:21,743 --> 01:08:25,478
He just needs a good night's sleep.
What're you trying to pull?

1301
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,613
A good night's rest instead of trying to
make a sucker out of the Marine Corps.

1302
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:30,182
Get your arms away from me!

1303
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:32,083
We all get it.
You ought to see me in a thunderstorm.

1304
01:08:32,085 --> 01:08:33,652
Good night, Woodrow.
Good night... No.

1305
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,154
Come on, take him away.
No, Libby, wait a minute.

1306
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:36,522
No, you're making a mistake.

1307
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:38,624
We want Woodrow.

1308
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:42,562
<i>ALL
We want Woodrow for our mar</i>

1309
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:47,233
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1310
01:08:47,235 --> 01:08:52,806
Of all the cheesy songs I ever heard,
that one certainly takes the cracker.

1311
01:08:52,808 --> 01:08:57,643
<i>Down with Noble
Let's kick Evvy off his chr</i>

1312
01:08:57,645 --> 01:08:59,779
Feel better?
No.

1313
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:02,582
How can you think of food
at a moment like this?

1314
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:04,484
You gotta live.

1315
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:07,220
Oh, it would turn to Russian dressing
in my stomach. What did they say?

1316
01:09:07,222 --> 01:09:09,589
They say everything looks great.
They did?

1317
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:11,657
For Woodrow.
Oh.

1318
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:15,828
<i>We want Woodrow for our Mayor</i>

1319
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,834
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1320
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:22,269
Don't chew with your mouth
open, do you mind?

1321
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:25,105
I'm just a little bit irritable.
I don't blame you.

1322
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,777
Well, are you going to
eat it, or aren't you?

1323
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:34,047
I mean to say, why did he have to
come back at a moment like this?

1324
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:35,883
I mean to say,
if he had to come back,

1325
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:37,984
why couldn't he have come back
after the election?

1326
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:40,286
I mean to say, I don't want to
sound unpatriotic or anything,

1327
01:09:40,288 --> 01:09:43,891
but a man like that
belongs in Guadeloupe.

1328
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:45,058
Guadalcanal.
Guadalcanal.

1329
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,727
I mean to say,
in a war like this,

1330
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,896
every man must do
what he does best,

1331
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:52,698
and what he does best,
he does in Guadalcanal.

1332
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,734
Save your voice, Evvy.
Huh?

1333
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:57,103
I mean to say,
a boy like that needs exercise

1334
01:09:57,105 --> 01:10:00,608
and violent physical conflict
to keep him fit.

1335
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,111
Why, he'll be lost in a town like this.
The quiet will kill him.

1336
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:05,313
Save your throat, Evvy.
You don't have to persuade me.

1337
01:10:05,315 --> 01:10:07,748
What I'm trying to say is...
I know what you're trying to say.

1338
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,982
I've been listening to you
long enough.

1339
01:10:08,984 --> 01:10:10,817
Do you always eat backwards?
Huh?

1340
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:13,587
I mean to say,
I don't even think he wants to be mayor.

1341
01:10:13,589 --> 01:10:14,955
Well, what does that mean?

1342
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,125
Everybody wants to be mayor.
That's human nature.

1343
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:21,228
Everybody but me.
With me it's just civic pride.

1344
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,564
Why don't you look
what you're doing?

1345
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,899
I mean to say,
soldiers coming back at moments like this

1346
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:28,969
can upset a political balance
that has taken years to adjust.

1347
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:33,841
They take on an importance that
completely overshadows the...

1348
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:36,343
I mean to say,
if you took

1349
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:39,213
the seats I'm building for the Army
and the Navy and the Marine Corps

1350
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:41,583
and sat them side by side,

1351
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:46,154
they'd probably stretch from
here to the shores of Tripoli,

1352
01:10:46,156 --> 01:10:50,325
but I can't wear one around my neck or
pin it on my bosom with a purple ribbon.

1353
01:10:50,327 --> 01:10:55,730
You notice they don't bring MacArthur
back on the eve of a national election.

1354
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:57,198
I wonder if he really
is a hero?

1355
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,833
Who, MacArthur?

1356
01:10:58,835 --> 01:11:01,169
Why, certainly he's a hero.
They're all heroes.

1357
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:04,871
And if I didn't happen to have got stuck in
the Quartermaster Corps during the last war,

1358
01:11:04,873 --> 01:11:07,308
I'd probably have more stuff on me than
you could hang on a Christmas tree.

1359
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,944
I was talking about Woodrow.
How do you know he's a hero?

1360
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,280
Because I saw the things...
That don't make it official.

1361
01:11:12,282 --> 01:11:15,016
What are you talking about?
Don't go chasing moonbeams!

1362
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:18,353
There's some things you have to accept
on faith... Value... Face value.

1363
01:11:18,355 --> 01:11:21,689
And one of them is a hero.
You can't ask him for his union card.

1364
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:23,659
Then why do you suppose
he took off his uniform?

1365
01:11:23,661 --> 01:11:25,761
That ain't natural.

1366
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:27,296
Because he's home. Because he's been
dismissed, or whatever you call it.

1367
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:28,998
What for?
How do I know what for?

1368
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,966
Maybe he has corns or bunions.
How do I know?

1369
01:11:30,968 --> 01:11:33,201
It ain't natural to take off
a uniform in wartime.

1370
01:11:33,203 --> 01:11:34,869
It's just
the other way around.

1371
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:37,038
What are you doing there, anyway?
Get me Western Union.

1372
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,643
I'm gonna wire the Marine base in San
Diego and check up on our local hero.

1373
01:11:40,645 --> 01:11:43,045
What's the matter with you? Are you
trying to kill me politically forever?

1374
01:11:43,047 --> 01:11:45,147
Save your voice, Evvy.
You leave me out of this, you understand?

1375
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:46,714
I don't want to be mixed
up in this in any shape,

1376
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:48,016
form, connection
or even by innuendo.

1377
01:11:48,018 --> 01:11:51,919
If you do this,
it's completely at your own risk and peril.

1378
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:53,855
I challenge
his fitness as mayor,

1379
01:11:53,857 --> 01:11:56,224
but the one thing that I do not challenge,
question or doubt

1380
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:58,128
is the fact
that he is a hero.

1381
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,829
I want that definitely...
Shut up, will you?

1382
01:11:59,831 --> 01:12:01,263
I will not shut up.
Hello, Western Union?

1383
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:03,399
Give me that. I won't...
I want to send a night letter.

1384
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:05,934
They're coming through
the palm trees.

1385
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:10,072
Here they come.
Save each other.

1386
01:12:10,074 --> 01:12:12,374
There's hundreds of them.
Can't you see them?

1387
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:13,943
There's thousands of them!

1388
01:12:15,345 --> 01:12:19,248
Fix bayonets. Man the guns.

1389
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,919
Here they come, boys.
Commence firing! Follow me. Charge!

1390
01:12:31,461 --> 01:12:34,730
What's the matter? Oh, I don't know.
I guess I had a nightmare.

1391
01:12:34,732 --> 01:12:36,733
You're lucky.
Huh?

1392
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:40,103
You're lucky you don't have them
all the time like some guys.

1393
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:21,111
You want some more hot milk
or something?

1394
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:25,349
I'll be all right.

1395
01:13:28,185 --> 01:13:30,220
You gonna stay there
all night?

1396
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:33,123
I don't care much about
sleeping at night.

1397
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:48,938
What's the matter now?
I'm all right.

1398
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,993
Was you looking for something?

1399
01:15:00,545 --> 01:15:03,615
I got it! Oh, boy!

1400
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:11,088
I've got it! Everything's all right.
It came to me with the sunrise.

1401
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,423
Oh, boy.

1402
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,872
Get set, get ready, on your marks.
Oh, boy.

1403
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:28,640
Hot diggity.
Thank you, ma'am.

1404
01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:31,376
They go down a little easier with
some butter on them, Mrs. Truesmith.

1405
01:15:31,378 --> 01:15:34,880
Maybe you haven't heard
there's a war on, Sergeant.

1406
01:15:34,882 --> 01:15:37,315
Boy, I guess she told you.

1407
01:15:41,187 --> 01:15:43,889
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1408
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:46,157
Good morning, all.
Good morning, Mama.

1409
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,426
Good morning, darling.
I hope you all had a good night.

1410
01:15:48,428 --> 01:15:51,228
Well, well, how about a stack of
your famous flannel cakes, Mama?

1411
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:53,933
Light as a feather and put
together by fairy hands.

1412
01:15:53,935 --> 01:15:58,371
Taste their crunchy, brunchy, munchiness.
Ask your grocer.

1413
01:15:58,373 --> 01:16:01,340
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Sergeant Heppelfinger.

1414
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:03,142
Is everybody happy?

1415
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:05,310
I trust your conscience didn't
keep you awake during the night.

1416
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:08,113
You know, there's nothing like
a well-trained conscience.

1417
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:11,250
Now, you take the conscience in its wild
or native form when first trapped...

1418
01:16:11,252 --> 01:16:14,120
What is it?
What's the matter, am I unpleasant?

1419
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:17,590
Is the reason for my unpopularity
at last revealed as in a vision?

1420
01:16:17,592 --> 01:16:20,191
I was wondering if you'd been guzzling
some more of that cooking wine.

1421
01:16:20,193 --> 01:16:23,228
Guzzling at this hour of the morning.
Sergeant, you offend me.

1422
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,196
What happened? Did somebody leave
you some dough or something?

1423
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:30,236
Now, wouldn't you be happy if you were about
to become the mayor of this fair city?

1424
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:33,039
Not large, mind you,
but fascinating.

1425
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:36,442
Lives there a man with a soul so dead
who never to himself hath said...

1426
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:38,010
Good morning, Libby.

1427
01:16:38,012 --> 01:16:39,946
Won't you join us
in a stack of collision mats,

1428
01:16:39,948 --> 01:16:42,081
as they say in the good old Marine Corps,
and a cup of jamoke?

1429
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:44,318
Thank you.

1430
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,186
Good morning, Mrs. Truesmith.
Good morning, dear.

1431
01:16:46,188 --> 01:16:47,520
Good morning.
Good morning.

1432
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:49,355
Good morning, Woodrow.
Good morning.

1433
01:16:49,357 --> 01:16:51,624
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Never felt better in my life.

1434
01:16:51,626 --> 01:16:53,559
Just call me Mr. Mayor.

1435
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:56,462
Oh, you got over all that nonsense, then?
What nonsense was that?

1436
01:16:56,464 --> 01:17:01,234
I mean about never having been in
Guadalcanal and all that stuff.

1437
01:17:01,236 --> 01:17:04,270
I said such a thing?
Well, I certainly understood you to.

1438
01:17:04,272 --> 01:17:05,972
But how could I?

1439
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:09,241
I'm a great hero.
People run when they see me coming.

1440
01:17:09,243 --> 01:17:13,180
I kill Nips with a wave of the hand.
I blow them down.

1441
01:17:13,182 --> 01:17:17,149
I shoot them from all angles, backwards,
forwards, while looking in mirrors.

1442
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:19,987
I swim into the water
and drown them like rats.

1443
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:21,421
I pick up a machine gun and...

1444
01:17:21,423 --> 01:17:23,323
I got it.

1445
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:26,526
You got what?
He's playing Daffy Dill from Dopeyville.

1446
01:17:26,528 --> 01:17:29,096
Oh, no, I'm not.
I invite an investigation.

1447
01:17:29,098 --> 01:17:31,630
I'm as sane as a Dane,
and I'm going to be mayor.

1448
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:34,567
Are you sure you feel all right, Woodrow?
There you are, Libby.

1449
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:37,170
What are you talking about, dear?
I'll tell you one thing.

1450
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:39,139
I certainly feel a lot better
than I did yesterday.

1451
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:40,574
Aha.

1452
01:17:40,576 --> 01:17:42,242
I'll get it, dear.

1453
01:17:42,244 --> 01:17:46,278
What are you trying to pull?
You'll find out.

1454
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,753
Yes? Hello.
This is the Marine base in San Diego.

1455
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:56,257
Is Corporal Truesmith there?
Yes.

1456
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:59,292
Woodrow, Marine base in San
Diego wants to talk to you.

1457
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:01,261
To me?

1458
01:18:01,263 --> 01:18:05,532
Now, whatever could the Marine base in
San Diego want to talk to me about?

1459
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:07,367
I'd better find out.

1460
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:13,206
All ready, Woodrow?
In just one moment.

1461
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:14,641
Good morning, all.
Good morning, Judge.

1462
01:18:14,643 --> 01:18:16,309
Good morning, Dr. Bissell.

1463
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:20,480
Hello? Yes, yes, this is
Corporal Truesmith speaking.

1464
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:24,384
What's that?
Oh, yes, sir, Colonel.

1465
01:18:25,354 --> 01:18:30,057
Oh, excuse me, Colonel,
I'm naturally so excited to hear that

1466
01:18:30,059 --> 01:18:33,127
that I just naturally forgot
who I was talking to.

1467
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:35,696
Yeah. Well, don't forget to save
me some breakfast, will you?

1468
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:38,433
I probably shouldn't be doing this at all,
and if the gang ever finds out...

1469
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:41,736
Yes, sir, Colonel,
I certainly will.

1470
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:46,841
And I'm awfully grateful to you for
calling me and for taking me back.

1471
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:51,646
Thank you, Colonel, sir.
Goodbye.

1472
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:54,182
Woodrow.
Well, what do you know about that?

1473
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:57,317
Know about what?
What a small world.

1474
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:00,121
They're taking me back into the
Marine Corps for limited service

1475
01:19:00,123 --> 01:19:03,591
and I have to leave
for San Diego at once.

1476
01:19:03,593 --> 01:19:05,293
But the parade.
The rally.

1477
01:19:05,295 --> 01:19:07,462
The mayoralty.
Aren't you going to be our new mayor?

1478
01:19:07,464 --> 01:19:11,466
I'm sorry, Judge.
The United States comes first.

1479
01:19:11,468 --> 01:19:14,168
They won't be sending you anywhere
dangerous anymore, will they?

1480
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:16,638
Well, I should hope not,
after all he's been through.

1481
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
It'll probably be just some
sort of clerical work,

1482
01:19:18,642 --> 01:19:20,776
you know,
like working in a shipyard

1483
01:19:20,778 --> 01:19:23,378
or an aeroplane factory,
you know, guarding things.

1484
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,580
Then, why don't they leave
you here where we need you?

1485
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:27,281
That's right.

1486
01:19:27,283 --> 01:19:29,584
That's one of the weaknesses
of the military viewpoint.

1487
01:19:29,586 --> 01:19:32,887
Doesn't always recognize the
importance of civilians in wartime.

1488
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:38,427
Well, I'm sorry, Judge,
but when duty calls, duty calls.

1489
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:41,129
Do you have to leave today, dear?
I'm afraid so.

1490
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:43,464
You'll ride in
the parade anyway, won't you?

1491
01:19:43,466 --> 01:19:45,766
Now that it's all dolled up
and everything?

1492
01:19:45,768 --> 01:19:49,470
Well, sure, but I don't see what good
it'll do. When duty calls, you gotta go.

1493
01:19:49,472 --> 01:19:51,307
Well, it might do some good.

1494
01:19:51,309 --> 01:19:53,675
Well, I certainly can't
refuse that.

1495
01:19:53,677 --> 01:19:56,145
Well, I'll see if
everything's ready then.

1496
01:19:56,147 --> 01:19:58,847
It's going to be more
like a funeral march.

1497
01:20:00,683 --> 01:20:03,919
Can I ride in the parade with you, Woodrow?
Just this last time?

1498
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:06,889
Sure, if you think it'd be all right.
Of course it'll be all right.

1499
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,858
I have the right
to say goodbye to you.

1500
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:13,495
I'm sorry, Mama,
but I just can't do anything about it.

1501
01:20:13,497 --> 01:20:15,364
It'll be so lonely
without you.

1502
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,599
Lay off.

1503
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,304
Good morning.
Where you been?

1504
01:20:23,306 --> 01:20:25,574
Who, me? I was just
taking a little walk.

1505
01:20:25,576 --> 01:20:27,943
Since when do you
forget to have breakfast?

1506
01:20:27,945 --> 01:20:33,283
Oh, you were just making a little
phone call to that dame in San Diego.

1507
01:20:33,285 --> 01:20:34,817
I got you, Colonel.

1508
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:37,286
Well, you know...

1509
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:41,824
Hey!
Why you can't...

1510
01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:44,360
We're very sorry, it's nothing.
There's just a little feeling there.

1511
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:46,196
Lay off, will you?
You can settle it later.

1512
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:47,830
Hey, what's the big idea?

1513
01:20:47,832 --> 01:20:49,632
You meant that for me, didn't you?
What about it?

1514
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:51,400
You think I'm afraid, huh?

1515
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:53,602
Well, I'm sure glad I wasn't
ever in a foxhole with you.

1516
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:55,470
Let him go.
You yellow...

1517
01:20:55,472 --> 01:20:56,738
Let him go!

1518
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:07,382
Go find a woman to fight with.
That's all you know how to hurt.

1519
01:21:07,384 --> 01:21:08,817
Come on, kid.

1520
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:25,902
Parades, statues, burning mortgages...
I subscribed to that.

1521
01:21:25,904 --> 01:21:28,338
So did I, for that matter,
but I mean to say...

1522
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,906
Save your voice, Evvy.
For what? I mean to say,

1523
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:32,343
I have nothing
against the boy personally.

1524
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:35,245
A hero is a fine thing in its place.
You mean in a park.

1525
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:39,249
I don't wish this young man
anything but success

1526
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:41,851
in what he can do best,
but what can he do best?

1527
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:43,720
If you ask me, I think...
That is our problem.

1528
01:21:43,722 --> 01:21:47,657
I speak not as your candidate for mayor,
but as the most humble voter.

1529
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:51,395
Why don't you save your voice?
Why don't you shut up?

1530
01:21:51,397 --> 01:21:54,498
I mean to say, this problem is not local.
It's national.

1531
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,301
In a few years,
if the war goes on, heaven forbid,

1532
01:21:57,303 --> 01:21:59,870
you won't be able to swing a cat without
knocking down a couple of heroes.

1533
01:21:59,872 --> 01:22:03,006
Now, are we going to be
governed by young men,

1534
01:22:03,008 --> 01:22:06,744
very young men, however well-meaning
or patriotic they may be,

1535
01:22:06,746 --> 01:22:09,647
whose principal talent consists of
hopping in and out of wolf holes...

1536
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:10,748
Foxholes.
Huh?

1537
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,316
They're called foxholes.

1538
01:22:12,318 --> 01:22:13,951
Talent consists of hopping
in and out of foxholes

1539
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:17,353
and killing hundreds of enemies
with one swoop of the sword?

1540
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:21,457
Or are we going to be governed by
respectable civic leaders of mature age

1541
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:26,397
who do not seek the appointment,
but accept it as a civic duty?

1542
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,001
I refer to men like,
well, myself.

1543
01:22:31,703 --> 01:22:36,040
<i>Up our hero goes
and down this zero goes</i>

1544
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:40,979
<i>'Cause we want Woodrow
for our mayor</i>

1545
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:45,649
<i>We want Woodrow
We want Woodrow</i>

1546
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:50,087
<i>We want Woodrow for our mayor</i>

1547
01:22:50,089 --> 01:22:54,758
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1548
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:59,763
<i>Let's give Everett the air</i>

1549
01:22:59,765 --> 01:23:04,435
<i>Up with Woodrow
Down with Noble</i>

1550
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:08,039
<i>Let's get Everett
off the chair</i>

1551
01:23:08,941 --> 01:23:11,676
<i>Up our hero goes and down</i>

1552
01:23:11,678 --> 01:23:15,347
Isn't it exciting, Evvy? They'll find
out whether it's exciting or not.

1553
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:17,682
Hold your horses.
What's the matter now?

1554
01:23:19,051 --> 01:23:20,952
Have you got a wire for me?
Yeah.

1555
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,520
Howdy, Mr. Mayor.
How are you?

1556
01:23:22,522 --> 01:23:24,756
If I can just remember
where I put it.

1557
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:26,624
What kind of wire?
Can you remember where it came from?

1558
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,926
Well, let me see.
It's San Diego. Oh, boy.

1559
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:33,732
You're a big help.
I'm sorry, Evvy.

1560
01:23:33,734 --> 01:23:35,834
Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

1561
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:48,948
But, then,
how could he have been in the Guadalcanal?

1562
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,683
That's just it. He wasn't.
He wasn't?

1563
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:53,853
No. Well, then.
Then, he's a fraud, a faker.

1564
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:56,689
He ought to be tarred
and feathered, oh, boy!

1565
01:23:56,691 --> 01:23:58,723
Who's a fraud and a faker?
Save your voice, Evvy.

1566
01:23:58,725 --> 01:24:00,558
Who's a fraud and a faker?

1567
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,994
Your hero!
I don't believe it.

1568
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,765
You don't believe it? Come on!
Now, be careful.

1569
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:09,568
<i>We want Woodrow</i>

1570
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:13,938
<i>We want Woodrow for our mayor</i>

1571
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:18,610
<i>Win with Woodrow
Win with Woodrow</i>

1572
01:24:18,612 --> 01:24:21,147
<i>Let's give Everett the air</i>

1573
01:24:21,149 --> 01:24:23,916
I wonder if this would be
rubbing it in a little, eh?

1574
01:24:23,918 --> 01:24:26,184
It says, "Help yourself."
Well, there's still plenty of time.

1575
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,587
Everett, I just have a feeling you're
going to make an ass of yourself,

1576
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:30,556
and I'm just going to pretend
I don't know you.

1577
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:33,826
I wish you didn't have to pretend.
Save your voice, Evvy.

1578
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:35,461
Quiet, please.

1579
01:24:37,064 --> 01:24:38,999
Quiet, please!

1580
01:25:01,688 --> 01:25:05,892
And if the band will
kindly cease for one moment,

1581
01:25:07,462 --> 01:25:10,463
we will be able
to hear the address

1582
01:25:10,465 --> 01:25:12,999
we are all so anxious to hear.

1583
01:25:14,169 --> 01:25:16,503
Quiet.

1584
01:25:16,505 --> 01:25:21,074
The first speaker will be
our beloved Judge Dennis.

1585
01:25:28,483 --> 01:25:33,520
Yesterday morning,
seven Marines got off the northbound.

1586
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:39,859
Six of them were
strangers to us.

1587
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:42,862
One, a local boy
who had made good.

1588
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:50,204
Yesterday afternoon,

1589
01:25:50,206 --> 01:25:53,807
we asked this local boy
to cast his lot with ours.

1590
01:25:55,776 --> 01:26:00,280
You might call us the unvested or
shirtsleeve interests of the town.

1591
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:03,284
Shall we do it now, or let him linger?
Let him have his moment.

1592
01:26:03,286 --> 01:26:08,955
To cast his lot with ours
and lead us to victory.

1593
01:26:14,862 --> 01:26:19,267
I'm going to ask Woodrow himself
to tell you the rest of the story.

1594
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:26,007
Oh, come now.

1595
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:32,980
I came here this morning
to say goodbye to you,

1596
01:26:32,982 --> 01:26:38,219
to tell you that I have been called back
into the Marine Corps for limited service,

1597
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:42,590
and that for that reason I would
be unable to run for mayor.

1598
01:26:45,027 --> 01:26:47,261
Well, I'm not going to do it.

1599
01:26:47,263 --> 01:26:48,829
Hooray!

1600
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:57,004
You'd better save your hoorays
for somebody else.

1601
01:26:57,006 --> 01:26:58,906
For somebody
who deserves them.

1602
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:06,314
Like Doc Bissell here,
who's tried for so long to serve you,

1603
01:27:06,316 --> 01:27:09,885
only you didn't know a
good man when you saw one.

1604
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:12,187
So, you always elected
a phony instead.

1605
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:15,757
Oh, I am, am I?
Well, let me tell you something, young man.

1606
01:27:15,759 --> 01:27:17,359
Save your voice, Evvy.
You'll find out.

1607
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:18,826
Everett, you're making
a spectacle of yourself.

1608
01:27:18,828 --> 01:27:21,028
Will you kindly...

1609
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:24,832
Until a still-bigger phony
came along,

1610
01:27:24,834 --> 01:27:26,601
then you naturally wanted him.

1611
01:27:28,204 --> 01:27:32,273
This should have been
the happiest day of my life.

1612
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,810
It could have been.

1613
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:38,179
Instead, it's the bitterest.

1614
01:27:40,015 --> 01:27:44,120
It says in the Bible,
"My cup runneth over."

1615
01:27:45,723 --> 01:27:48,690
Well, my cup runneth over
with gall.

1616
01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:53,629
This is the last act.
The farce is over.

1617
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:57,065
The lying is finished,

1618
01:27:57,067 --> 01:28:00,702
and the coward is
at least cured of his fear.

1619
01:28:00,704 --> 01:28:03,705
Ladies and gentlemen, I think this
whole thing had better be called off.

1620
01:28:03,707 --> 01:28:05,340
He don't feel so good
in the head sometimes.

1621
01:28:05,342 --> 01:28:06,842
Sit down!
Quiet!

1622
01:28:06,844 --> 01:28:08,410
Wait a minute, Sergeant.

1623
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:12,147
I was born in this town.

1624
01:28:13,149 --> 01:28:16,317
My father was born here.

1625
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:20,722
Most of this town is on
my grandfather's homestead.

1626
01:28:20,724 --> 01:28:25,762
My grandfather was an honorable man.
So was my father.

1627
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,364
I've sold papers on the street to most
of you who are here this morning.

1628
01:28:30,299 --> 01:28:32,968
I've known you all my life.

1629
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:36,339
Your affection means
a great deal to me,

1630
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:40,109
and now that
I've lost the chance forever,

1631
01:28:40,111 --> 01:28:45,180
I want you all to know how much it
would have meant to me to be the mayor,

1632
01:28:45,182 --> 01:28:50,686
or the city clerk, or the assistant city
clerk or the dogcatcher of this town,

1633
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,689
which was
my grandfather's farm.

1634
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:58,460
By the same token,
I would have gladly given my life

1635
01:28:58,462 --> 01:29:02,999
to have earned just one of the many ribbons
you've seen on these brave men's chests.

1636
01:29:04,702 --> 01:29:09,440
If I could reach as high as
my father's shoestrings,

1637
01:29:09,442 --> 01:29:13,342
my whole life would be justified,
and I would stand here before you proudly,

1638
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:17,914
instead of as the thief
and the coward that I am.

1639
01:29:19,049 --> 01:29:22,418
I say a coward
because I postponed until now

1640
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:25,456
what I should have told you
a year ago

1641
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:29,826
when I was discharged from the
Marine Corps for medical unfitness.

1642
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:34,197
A coward because I didn't want
my mother to know.

1643
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:41,236
Well, it wasn't to save her.
It was to save me.

1644
01:29:43,808 --> 01:29:46,810
A thief because
I stole your admiration.

1645
01:29:47,746 --> 01:29:49,880
I stole the ribbons I wore.

1646
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,916
I stole this nomination.

1647
01:29:55,086 --> 01:29:57,987
I have never been in Guadal...

1648
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:07,431
I have never been in
Guadalcanal or anyplace else.

1649
01:30:07,433 --> 01:30:11,167
I've been working in
a shipyard for the last year.

1650
01:30:11,169 --> 01:30:13,770
I've never received medals
of any description,

1651
01:30:13,772 --> 01:30:16,006
naturally,
since I've never fought.

1652
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:20,410
Two days ago
I decided to come home,

1653
01:30:20,412 --> 01:30:23,114
and since I'd written to
my mother that I was overseas,

1654
01:30:23,116 --> 01:30:25,349
I had to come home
as a soldier.

1655
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:29,920
I had to have some ribbons,
so I bought some in a hockshop.

1656
01:30:29,922 --> 01:30:32,389
When I was all dressed up,
I met some real Marines,

1657
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:35,560
and I fooled them just as much
as I did the rest of you.

1658
01:30:35,562 --> 01:30:39,096
Not that I really wanted
to fool any of you. I...

1659
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:41,899
I just wanted to come home.

1660
01:30:41,901 --> 01:30:43,400
That's as dirty a lie
as I ever...

1661
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:44,802
Sit down!
Quiet!

1662
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:45,969
Sit down!

1663
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:50,375
I've told you all this because

1664
01:30:50,377 --> 01:30:55,078
too many men have bled
and died for you and for me

1665
01:30:56,347 --> 01:31:00,017
to live this lie any longer.

1666
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:04,255
I guess that's why I told you.
I certainly didn't mean to when I came in.

1667
01:31:04,257 --> 01:31:07,926
I'm going home now
and pack my things,

1668
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:12,163
so this will probably be my last
chance to say goodbye to you.

1669
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:16,434
I know my mother will
give you back the mortgage,

1670
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:21,972
and I hope you won't hold it against her
that the son didn't quite come through.

1671
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:27,045
There's no use telling you
I'm sorry, because

1672
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:30,949
I wish I was dead.

1673
01:31:33,018 --> 01:31:34,319
I...

1674
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:47,600
That's all.

1675
01:31:55,608 --> 01:31:58,577
I need some air.

1676
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:06,084
If everybody will
please keep your seats.

1677
01:32:06,086 --> 01:32:08,319
Please, please, sit down.

1678
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:25,437
I just wanna
tell you one thing, see.

1679
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,275
I seen a lot of brave men in my life.
That's my business,

1680
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:33,545
but what that kid just done
took real courage, you get me?

1681
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,547
And now that
he's shot his mouth off,

1682
01:32:35,549 --> 01:32:38,651
you might as well hear the rest of it.
In fact, you'd better hear it.

1683
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,988
There's six of us, see,
and we got 15 cents between us,

1684
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:46,158
and we're from Guadalcanal,
and no fooling, what I mean!

1685
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:00,573
I'll be over in a few minutes.
You'd better not, dear.

1686
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,476
You've got yourself in enough trouble.
I'll be over in a few minutes.

1687
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:14,087
There you see
one of the fallacies...

1688
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,121
I wouldn't want this to go any further,
you understand?

1689
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:17,957
...of the
democratic principle.

1690
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,959
They can vote for
anybody they like.

1691
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:21,727
I was never deceived
for an instant,

1692
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:24,030
but the poor,
misguided voters,

1693
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:26,433
without a brain
to bless themselves with,

1694
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,568
without a cerebellum
to the carload...

1695
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,502
Make a note of that, Jake, I'll use it.
I wouldn't.

1696
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:34,073
Open up their arms to...
Oh, there you are.

1697
01:33:34,741 --> 01:33:36,308
Hello.

1698
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,113
I'm so sorry, dear.
My heart bled for you.

1699
01:33:39,115 --> 01:33:40,648
You have the effrontery
to return?

1700
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,216
What?
Oh, shut up, Evvy.

1701
01:33:42,218 --> 01:33:43,317
Don't pay
any attention to him, Libby.

1702
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:45,218
And what do you think
of your hero now?

1703
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,053
Don't rub it in.
She probably feels badly enough.

1704
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:49,089
Well, she should feel badly,
and if you ask my advice...

1705
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:53,059
He's a sucker to even consider
going through with the marriage.

1706
01:33:53,061 --> 01:33:55,362
I've got to see somebody outside.
I don't blame you.

1707
01:33:55,364 --> 01:33:57,131
But I don't feel badly at all.
You don't?

1708
01:33:57,133 --> 01:34:01,735
This is a matter entirely
between Libby and myself.

1709
01:34:01,737 --> 01:34:03,336
And Woodrow.
And Woodrow?

1710
01:34:03,338 --> 01:34:04,504
And Woodrow?
Naturally.

1711
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:07,707
You mean to tell me after
that disgraceful exhibition

1712
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:10,543
you still have
any interest in the hero?

1713
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:14,381
I guess women feel a little differently
than men do about these things, Forrest.

1714
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:16,216
Of course they do.

1715
01:34:16,218 --> 01:34:19,020
So, if you'll please forgive me
and not think too harshly of me.

1716
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,127
You see what I told you?
You walked right into it.

1717
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:30,264
Why couldn't
you stay here, dear?

1718
01:34:31,366 --> 01:34:33,434
Now that
you've told everything,

1719
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:36,437
nothing much more can happen.

1720
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:38,372
Who'd give me a job?

1721
01:34:38,374 --> 01:34:42,175
If I can find a nice place
someplace where we're not known,

1722
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,743
I'll send for you and...

1723
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:48,816
I know you meant it
for the best.

1724
01:34:48,818 --> 01:34:52,620
I know you meant it for me,
no matter what anyone else might think.

1725
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,582
Hello.

1726
01:35:25,787 --> 01:35:28,656
Can I help you?
I can manage all right.

1727
01:35:31,126 --> 01:35:33,794
Well, save a little room
for me, will you?

1728
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:39,234
Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid!

1729
01:35:39,236 --> 01:35:41,203
Of course I'm going with you.

1730
01:35:41,205 --> 01:35:42,637
I've never loved anybody
but you,

1731
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,673
and you never loved anybody
but me.

1732
01:35:44,675 --> 01:35:48,543
You can't say it's because you're a hero
that I'm running after you, can you?

1733
01:35:48,545 --> 01:35:51,780
Oh, Woodrow,
when I think I almost lost you.

1734
01:35:51,782 --> 01:35:53,848
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1735
01:35:57,186 --> 01:36:00,222
You're crazy, honey.
Then I'm crazy.

1736
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:12,601
Is she on time, Mrs. Kennedy?
How's that?

1737
01:36:12,603 --> 01:36:15,203
Is the southbound on time?
Yep.

1738
01:36:15,205 --> 01:36:17,406
Be here in four and a quarter minutes.
Thank you.

1739
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,475
Where you going?
Thought you was running for mayor.

1740
01:36:19,477 --> 01:36:21,911
I changed my mind.
That's very unusual.

1741
01:36:21,913 --> 01:36:24,779
Well, this is an unusual case.
How about the sarge?

1742
01:36:24,781 --> 01:36:27,482
I told him where you were.
Go find him.

1743
01:36:27,484 --> 01:36:29,886
He'll be here.
He don't ever miss nothing.

1744
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,682
Hey, jiggers, the whole town is coming!
What is it, a lynching?

1745
01:36:59,684 --> 01:37:01,818
With us here, we'll kind of
surround you, see?

1746
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,521
Yeah, you were gonna
do that before, you remember?

1747
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,403
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Just a minute, Come here.

1748
01:37:20,304 --> 01:37:21,904
Come here.
Quiet.

1749
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,876
Quiet, quiet!
Take it easy! Take it easy!

1750
01:37:26,878 --> 01:37:28,477
Come on, back it up, will you?
Quiet!

1751
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:30,780
Quiet!
Give the guy a little room, will you?

1752
01:37:30,782 --> 01:37:33,949
Thank you very much.
Quiet!

1753
01:37:33,951 --> 01:37:36,486
You wanted to see me,
Judge Dennis?

1754
01:37:36,488 --> 01:37:38,889
We had quite a talk
after you left, Woodrow.

1755
01:37:38,891 --> 01:37:41,925
The Sergeant told us a few things.
Quite a few things.

1756
01:37:41,927 --> 01:37:43,427
That you had forgotten
to mention.

1757
01:37:43,429 --> 01:37:45,696
Naturally the nomination
went back to Doc Bissell.

1758
01:37:45,698 --> 01:37:46,997
But he got up and said...

1759
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:48,931
"Ladies and gents..."
Don't misquote me.

1760
01:37:48,933 --> 01:37:51,000
What?
I said, "Ladies and gentlemen."

1761
01:37:51,002 --> 01:37:53,804
Of course you did.
I said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

1762
01:37:53,806 --> 01:37:58,008
"in all the years that I have been
unsuccessfully mixed into politics,

1763
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:02,812
"this is the first and only time that I
have ever seen a candidate for office

1764
01:38:02,814 --> 01:38:05,481
"given an opportunity
to prove publicly,

1765
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:08,251
"permanently and
beyond peradventure of doubt

1766
01:38:08,253 --> 01:38:11,521
"that he was honest,
courageous and veracious."

1767
01:38:11,523 --> 01:38:14,458
That means truthful.
He likes those big words.

1768
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:20,897
that if to act out a little lie to save
one's mother humiliation was a fault,

1769
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:23,600
in other words,
if tenderness toward

1770
01:38:23,602 --> 01:38:27,672
and consideration
of one's mother was a fault,

1771
01:38:27,674 --> 01:38:30,408
it was a fault
any man might be proud of.

1772
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:31,708
Hear! Hear!
Hooray!

1773
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:33,010
Thank you.

1774
01:38:33,012 --> 01:38:35,846
I made a very good speech
on your behalf, Woodrow.

1775
01:38:35,848 --> 01:38:38,315
Much better than
I ever made for myself.

1776
01:38:38,317 --> 01:38:40,517
It was a wonderful
speech, Woodrow.

1777
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:42,452
The guy had us
all blubbering.

1778
01:38:42,454 --> 01:38:45,689
I meant every word of it
straight from the heart.

1779
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:47,824
I concluded by pointing out

1780
01:38:47,826 --> 01:38:52,996
that if this town really wanted an honest,
courageous and veracious mayor,

1781
01:38:52,998 --> 01:38:56,567
they had better catch you before you
caught the southbound and got away.

1782
01:38:56,569 --> 01:39:00,038
So we came right over.
That's why we're here.

1783
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,775
I'm a little dizzy.
I don't quite get what you mean.

1784
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:07,445
I think they mean they want you as mayor,
Woodrow.

1785
01:39:08,714 --> 01:39:10,648
You mean you still want me?

1786
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:12,817
We still want you
very much.

1787
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:16,019
What do we want
a soldier for anyway?

1788
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:18,890
Politics is a very peculiar
thing, Woodrow.

1789
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:20,892
If they want you,
they want you.

1790
01:39:20,894 --> 01:39:24,862
They don't need reasons anymore.
They find their own reasons.

1791
01:39:24,864 --> 01:39:28,399
It's just like
when a girl wants a man.

1792
01:39:28,401 --> 01:39:31,802
That's right.
You don't need reasons,

1793
01:39:31,804 --> 01:39:33,570
although
they're probably there.

1794
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:36,942
Pardon me for intruding,

1795
01:39:36,944 --> 01:39:39,378
but is anybody interested
in getting on this train,

1796
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,513
or is this the Democratic
National Convention?

1797
01:39:41,515 --> 01:39:43,047
Well, I...
Of course you're not going now.

1798
01:39:43,049 --> 01:39:44,749
Nobody's leaving, please.

1799
01:39:44,751 --> 01:39:46,684
Okay, all...
Just a minute, Mac.

1800
01:39:46,686 --> 01:39:48,086
Give me six of them tickets,
will you?

1801
01:39:48,088 --> 01:39:50,655
We still got a little work
to do in our own line.

1802
01:39:50,657 --> 01:39:52,458
So long, kid.
Goodbye, dear.

1803
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:53,592
Will you come back?

1804
01:39:53,594 --> 01:39:54,960
Well, we always
come back before.

1805
01:39:54,962 --> 01:39:57,129
So long, everybody.
See youse in church.

1806
01:39:57,131 --> 01:39:58,930
Come on there, rookies.

1807
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:04,702
Save your voice, Evvy.
They've just renominated Woodrow.

1808
01:40:04,704 --> 01:40:05,803
Isn't it exciting, Evvy?

1809
01:40:05,805 --> 01:40:06,971
Now the battle is on again.
Shut up!

1810
01:40:06,973 --> 01:40:08,741
Renominated Woodrow?
What on?

1811
01:40:08,743 --> 01:40:10,476
I don't know, but I think
it's a vindication campaign.

1812
01:40:10,478 --> 01:40:13,077
A vindication campaign?
Look out.

1813
01:40:19,586 --> 01:40:22,755
So long, gang.
All aboard!

1814
01:40:22,757 --> 01:40:25,958
I don't know how to... Don't say it.
It was a pleasure.

1815
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,494
Anything for
the son of an old pal.

1816
01:40:28,496 --> 01:40:30,763
I knew the Marines could do
almost anything,

1817
01:40:30,765 --> 01:40:32,998
but I never knew they could
do anything like this.

1818
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,133
You got no idea.
