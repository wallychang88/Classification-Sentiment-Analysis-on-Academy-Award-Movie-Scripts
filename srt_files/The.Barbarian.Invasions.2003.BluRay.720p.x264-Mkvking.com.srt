1
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,670
For my daughter MingXia

2
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:44,013
London, 2:30 PM

3
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:55,987
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,485
Hi, dear. I have bad news.
Your dad's prognosis isn't good.

5
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:04,366
You have to come.
-Did he ask you to call?

6
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,039
Not in so many words.

7
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:11,625
We saw each other for
15 minutes last summer.

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,213
With his flat, bank account,
insurance, the university...

9
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:19,508
Your sister's in Australia.
It's too much for me.

10
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:23,337
I'll see if Gaelle can come.

11
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,064
Hi, love.

12
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,824
He's worse?
-I have to be there.

13
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:50,411
I'll come.

14
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:14,724
THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS

15
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:29,376
The body of Christ.

16
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,065
The body of Christ.

17
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,445
The communion's over here.

18
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:04,326
The body of Christ.

19
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:14,087
How's Mr. Desmarais?
-I don't know. I'm not Mr. Desmarais.

20
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,835
Sorry,
the computer system is a mess.

21
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,544
Constance Lazure.
- My wife Louise.

22
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,591
Must be hard having him here.

23
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,560
I threw him out 15 years ago.

24
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,096
So whether he's here
or humping co-eds in his condo...

25
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:33,477
Gimme a break. You know it's been
years since I humped a co-ed

26
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:38,854
And Raphaelle Metellus?
-She was Dominique's student.

27
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:43,699
You were her personal tutor?
"Kneel down, open wide."

28
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:50,455
I'd best continue my rounds. Have a good day!
-You too, Sister.

29
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:54,461
I called Sebastien to let him know.

30
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,129
You did?
-Aren't you glad?

31
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,834
Lovely, we can play his video games.
-He's still young.

32
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:07,344
Ok, but couldn't he have read
one book in his life?

33
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,475
Any book? Is that asking too much?

34
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:14,348
He may not read, but he earns
more in a month than you in a year.

35
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,284
Thanks a lot.
-That's ok, we had room.

36
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,908
It's flying to Belfast Monday...
-I'll probably have to stay longer.

37
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,994
My darling!

38
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:39,501
You must be exhausted.
What time is it for you? 2 a.m.?

39
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,333
Gaelle, how are you, dear?
-Fine, thank you.

40
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,428
Hello, sir.
-Young man.

41
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:57,560
Do you remember Gaelle?
-Gaelle is unforgettable.

42
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,562
How are you?

43
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:15,738
No private rooms?
-I'm lucky I'm not in the hall.

44
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,531
I tried, all I got was voice mail.

45
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,909
Dad's very sick.
Please get in touch.

46
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,511
What I see isn't encouraging.

47
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,267
But to be sure I need a PET scan.

48
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:48,439
See if they can do it.
They can send it by satellite.

49
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,947
It stands for
Positron Emission Tomography.

50
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:58,118
Sherbrooke has one, but
there's a 6-12 month waiting list.

51
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:01,907
Isn't he going to Burlington today?
They have one, -

52
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:06,040
but it's expensive.
$2000 U.S.

53
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:09,047
Money's no problem.
-You're lucky.

54
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,839
You never listened to my body.

55
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:17,962
But I'm not laying a guilt.
-Look, I have to get dressed.

56
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:23,687
An ambulance is taking me to Burlington in 10 minutes.
-No more excuses!

57
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,351
For my radiation therapy.
-No!

58
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:31,768
The machines here are too old.
-Stop avoiding me.

59
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:35,820
This is my son, Sebastien,
he's going with me.

60
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:50,247
She's a woman I used to know, long ago.

61
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,758
I couldn't face coming alone.

62
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:01,426
You've never been here?
-Never.

63
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:05,017
But you see each other regularly.

64
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,764
Always on neutral ground.
Usually in restaurants.

65
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:14,192
Did he come to your place?
-Occasionally.

66
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,811
But you never came here.

67
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,527
No. This was where he
brought his mistresses.

68
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,279
With luck, we'll find some panties.

69
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,542
I'm glad Sebastien's going with him today.

70
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,829
It's important they talk.

71
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:35,262
"Christmas in the scanner,
Easter 6 feet under."

72
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,607
I have the scan.

73
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,826
It doesn’t look good.
Not good at all.

74
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:03,747
We can't be certain,
but the margin of error is almost nil.

75
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,708
Is he in a lot of pain?

76
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:17,925
Why don't you bring him here?
At least he wouldn't suffer.

77
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,769
We'll make sure of it.

78
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:25,681
I'm sorry, buddy.

79
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:41,867
Baltimore's not far.
7 hours by car, an hour by plane.

80
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,580
I won't go into EXiLE.
-Wouldn't you like your own room-

81
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,292
with a bathroom, CDs?
-What CDs?

82
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:56,011
So you can listen to music.
They have that in civilized countries.

83
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,093
Know what that costs?
-Nothing. I'll look after it.

84
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,262
I won't know a soul.
-We'll all go tomorrow.

85
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:08,438
No we won't.
I'm not going to the States,

86
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:14,524
I voted for Medicare, I'll accept the consequences.
-Only idiots refuse to change.

87
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,321
I want to be with my friends.
-Your friends? Where are they?

88
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,158
Dominique's away, but Pierre...

89
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:24,112
You've no one.
Apart from that lunatic this morning.

90
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,331
Which lunatic?
-It's irrelevant.

91
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:29,164
The tears, rolling eyes: My Remy!

92
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,165
Who's he talking about?
-Marlene Dupire.

93
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:37,251
You didn't sleep with Marlene Dupire?
She's a certified nut, everyone knows!

94
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:41,680
You wrecked your family for her kind?
-I wrecked nothing!

95
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,175
You ruined Mom's life,
my adolescence, Sylvaine's...

96
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:47,350
Blaming me for her failure?

97
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:54,726
She loves the sea, she sails the world,
delivering yachts. Beats a 3rd-rate university.

98
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:58,235
You may be a millionaire,
but you know nothing!

99
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:02,653
I know I won't end up like you!
She's the reason I'm here.

100
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:06,077
She raised me, not you!

101
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:09,822
Don't you have a plane
to catch to Hong Kong?

102
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,701
I don't need you, not for one second!
Go to hell!

103
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:16,916
Fuck you!
-Go to hell!

104
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:33,199
We're returning to London.
-You can't.

105
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,156
We offer him the finest hospital,
he refuses.

106
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:38,828
You heard him. He'll never change.

107
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:43,451
You plan to have kids?
-Definitely.

108
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,256
Until you're a parent
you'll never understand.

109
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:50,712
He changed your diapers.

110
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:54,053
He called your teachers every month
all through school.

111
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,384
He so wanted you to do well.

112
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:01,389
When you had meningitis at age 3,

113
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:06,392
he rocked you in his arms
for 48 hours non-stop,

114
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,898
without sleep,
to keep death at bay.

115
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,439
You can't remember that.

116
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,363
What should I do?

117
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:25,000
Find his friends.
Find him a comfortable room.

118
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,536
That shouldn't be hard.

119
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:36,755
The Ministry forbids changing hospitals.
Anyway, they'd park him in the hall in Emergency.

120
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,218
The floor below is empty?
-2 years, now.

121
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,553
Could he move there?
-Ice cream with your pie?

122
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,221
You can always ask at Administration.
Good luck!

123
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,106
I'll leave you now.

124
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:57,987
You're lucky to have such a caring son.
-You think so?

125
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:01,991
How many children come here?

126
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:06,322
Look around! See many children
at their parent's bedside?

127
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,997
I'm here every day, so I know.

128
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:13,412
Was your dad hospitalized?
Did he die there?

129
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:16,424
In the end.
-Did you visit him?

130
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:19,630
He lived in Chicoutimi,
I was in Montreal.

131
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,176
You came from England?

132
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,553
London, Chicoutimi, for you...
same thing? Are you becoming confused?

133
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,519
When it's over, press End.
That stops it.

134
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,901
It's hard, but if you concentrate,
you'll manage.

135
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,774
Hi, Dad!
See, the Pacific Ocean.

136
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,780
We sail from Sydney
to New Caledonia,

137
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,703
on to Easter Island
and finally Valparaiso.

138
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:58,461
I'm sending you lots of sea air.
They say it's good for your health.

139
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:04,468
I have to go. Satellite connections
cost a fortune.

140
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:10,136
I'm sending you lots and lots of kisses.
Bye for now!

141
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:03,066
Security badge?
-Ms Pelletier? Lloyd's of London.

142
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,153
Didn't they give you one?
-No.

143
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:17,488
Last door on the right.
But next time you need a badge.

144
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:26,295
Hello.
Pauline Joncas-Pelletier.

145
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:28,458
Please have a seat.

146
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:35,174
So you're with Lloyd's of London?

147
00:17:35,683 --> 00:17:38,256
Not at all, I said that to get in.

148
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:42,723
My father's here.
I'd like to move him to the empty floor.

149
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:46,060
Set up something more comfortable.

150
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,067
That's wonderful!

151
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:55,991
It complies with our awareness
programs involving family members.

152
00:17:56,202 --> 00:18:01,113
But unfortunately our allocation
of infrastructure is determined

153
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,698
by the Ministry's ambulatory thrust.

154
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,953
It's absolutely impossible to target our
responses in terms of individual beneficiaries.

155
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,624
I'm sure our staff...
-I prepared this file.

156
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:20,800
You must understand, our resource allocation
aims at prioritizing responses

157
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:26,095
according to diagnostic parameters
defined by the Region 02 consultations.

158
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,696
This is silly.
We're not in the Third World.

159
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,653
Think it over.

160
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:46,953
Even if we close our eyes,
we'd require union integration.

161
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,121
And that is problematic!
-I'll handle them.

162
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:55,081
This file will be updated weekly.
I'll come back tomorrow. Thank you!

163
00:18:55,842 --> 00:19:02,342
There's a room on the empty floor.
It'll take 5 minutes. I just want to show you.

164
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,221
I'll be back in 5.

165
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,938
Sorry, take the next one.

166
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:22,064
I want to set up a room on this floor.
We could...

167
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:25,991
Look, nothing happens
without the union.

168
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:32,910
It starts and ends with the union. Understand?
-I came to you, right?

169
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:40,504
You'd have to paint it,
scrub the floor...

170
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:47,679
Just a sec, man.

171
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,101
You're talking overtime, you realize.
And my guys don't. -Paid in cash.

172
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,762
Cash?
-Cash. One painter.

173
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:56,772
Two.

174
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,148
Six hours.

175
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,103
Eight.

176
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,396
What's the rate?

177
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:06,526
$40.
-$35.

178
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:11,866
I want a bed, curtains, chairs...
-Look, man, we don't do that.

179
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,750
You hire a crew, supervise the work.
And charge me a reasonable fee.

180
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:21,164
Reasonable?
-Let's say 25%.

181
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,383
Here's $2500 for starters.
We'll settle up every 2 days.

182
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:37,603
Where's my laptop?

183
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,521
What?
-My computer.

184
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:42,015
On the floor.
-It's not there.

185
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:45,193
It must be.
-Nothing there.

186
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:49,985
The floor, not the locker.
I'm not crazy. -It's not there.

187
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,193
Someone must have taken it.

188
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,035
Who?
-I don't know.

189
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,660
I've had 50 emails.
How'll I recover them?

190
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:01,788
My entire deal with Norway.
There's no backup.

191
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:05,378
Do you know what I do?
-No. You never told me.

192
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,211
Why bother? You never listen!

193
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:20,141
There were, what, 3000 dead.
Historically, that's insignificant.

194
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,346
As a U.S. example,

195
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:25,019
50,000 died
at the Battle of Gettysburg.

196
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:33,939
What is significant,
as my old prof said,

197
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,697
is they struck at
the heart of the Empire.

198
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:40,699
In previous conflicts- Korea,
Vietnam, the Gulf War

199
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:46,833
the Empire managed to keep the barbarians
outside its gates, its borders

200
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:54,626
In that sense, people may look back on 9/11,
and I stress may,

201
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:59,175
as the beginning
of the great barbarian invasions.

202
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:02,013
Alain Lussier, thank you.
-My pleasure.

203
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:12,266
Excuse me, my computer was just stolen.
-Oh yeah? Fill out this form.

204
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,363
What for?
-It's for the police.

205
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:20,368
Look, I've had all these
since Monday.

206
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:26,246
The police ever investigate?
-No, only when there's physical violence.

207
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:31,499
Last week a woman was raped in the
old laundry room, so they came.

208
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:34,506
Otherwise they'd be here 24/7.

209
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,882
It's easy to rob patients.
They're asleep half the time.

210
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:42,423
And the union protects the employees.

211
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:44,758
There's not much we can do.

212
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,057
Ronald?

213
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:59,437
What can I do for you, pal?
-I lost or misplaced my computer.

214
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:05,907
Maybe in my dad's room. So, on the off-chance
someone should find a laptop somewhere...

215
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,534
We'll ask around,
but I can't guarantee anything.

216
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:15,125
In case.
-Right, in case. We'll check.

217
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,996
Thanks, I appreciate it.

218
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:28,423
Hello? Speaking.

219
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,800
Of course I remember you, Sebastien.

220
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,310
How are you?

221
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:39,233
Yes, it's been a long time.

222
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,739
He's very sick.

223
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,118
And he's all alone,
except for my mother.

224
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:55,446
I knew he was in hospital,
but I didn't realize...

225
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:00,498
I almost never come to Montreal, so...

226
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,964
Is he still in hospital?

227
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:09,926
Pierre, I need you, now.

228
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:14,931
School's starting, we haven't found
a daycare, the kids are sick...

229
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:17,266
That's life. Always the same.

230
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,775
I'll try to get a flight.

231
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:28,904
You say that because times
are so terrible.

232
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:32,158
Not especially terrible. Not at all.

233
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,455
Contrary to belief,
the 20th century wasn't that bloody.

234
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:40,207
It's agreed that wars
caused 100 million deaths.

235
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,536
Add 10 million
for the Russian gulags.

236
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:47,757
The Chinese camps, we'll never know,
but say 20 million.

237
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:50,884
So 130, 135 million dead.
Not all that impressive.

238
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:55,216
In the 16th century,
the Spanish and the Portuguese managed,

239
00:24:55,516 --> 00:25:01,470
without gas chambers or bombs, to slaughter
150 million Indians in Latin America.

240
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:05,769
With axes!
That's a lot of work, Sister.

241
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:10,024
Even if they had Church support,
it was an achievement

242
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:14,069
So much so that the Dutch, English,
French and later Americans

243
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:18,743
followed their lead
and butchered another 50 million.

244
00:25:18,996 --> 00:25:21,403
200 million dead in all!

245
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:24,790
The greatest massacre in history
took place right here.

246
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:28,335
And not the tiniest
Holocaust museum.

247
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:32,832
The history of mankind
is a history of horrors!

248
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,205
They had a trial program with heroin.

249
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,913
See if it still exists.

250
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,373
Heroin's 800% more effective
than morphine.

251
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,376
It makes a huge difference.
-Ok, thanks.

252
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,045
Get some rest.
-I will, good night.

253
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:09,424
Are you pals with the Premier,
or a hockey star?

254
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:14,763
His son takes care of him.
-I know. And dumbo won't thank him.

255
00:27:15,064 --> 00:27:18,812
My son is an ambitious
and puritanical capitalist.

256
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:24,530
Whereas I was always a sensual socialist.
-Sensual isn't half of it, Sister.

257
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,192
Lewd! Debauched! -Bestial!
-Lascivious! -Perverse!

258
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:31,700
How are you, you lusty sinner?
-Better!

259
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:34,830
Give me a kiss, you randy snake!

260
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,790
You're back?
-Yesterday?

261
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,168
And Alaska?
-Lovely and cold, like me!

262
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,832
You see, Sister? My exquisite daughter-in-law, my
heroic wife, and two most charming mistresses.

263
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:51,679
I can die in peace.
-You'll burn in the flames of hell.

264
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:59,013
And I won't be alone. They're safe, but given the
depravity of these two, they'll roast alongside me.

265
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:06,569
Whereas you'll play the harp on a cloud

266
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,479
for eternity, seated between John Paul II,
a surly Pole, and Mother Theresa, a slimy Albanian

267
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,570
His illness has affected his brain.

268
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:16,070
No, it's an ethnological truth,
Louise.

269
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:20,286
Albanians are often slimy
and Poles are always surly.

270
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:25,410
"for the misfortunes of Poland
are proof of God's existence!"

271
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:37,469
Hello. I'd like to meet someone, a police
officer or detective in the narcotics squad.

272
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,885
Have a seat.

273
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:54,650
Come stai, you big pig?
-What are you doing here, old queer?

274
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,197
This is Alessandro.

275
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,830
We've heard all about you.

276
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:22,181
Gilles Levac.
My partner, Kim Delgado.

277
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,439
Have a seat.
-Thanks.

278
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:35,361
My father's hospitalized here
in Montreal.

279
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:39,481
He gets rotten care, of course,
and he's in pain.

280
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:43,319
A doctor friend suggested
I get him some heroin.

281
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:49,374
I know little about drugs.
As a student I smoked pot.

282
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:53,160
Drugs are sold in every city,
and the police know where.

283
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:59,668
I hoped, perhaps naively, you could recommend some
spots where I can find high-quality heroin.

284
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:06,051
That's fascinating, except that...

285
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:13,933
our job is to arrest dealers,
not help prospective buyers.

286
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:17,192
think of me as a smart guy
trying to save time.

287
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:22,147
Think of me as someone not too dumb
who doesn’t want to read a headline:

288
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:27,567
"Police Help Our Journalist
to Buy Narcotics."

289
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:35,204
I'm no... -She and I don't want to end
our days directing traffic in Chibougamau.

290
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:39,204
I swear I'm not a reporter.
-Why should I believe you?

291
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,253
I'm a market operator with MacDougall Deutsch.
It's easy to check.

292
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:48,509
It's easy to print phony cards.

293
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:51,091
Sorry to disturb you.

294
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:54,140
I'll have to try the discos.

295
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,478
Look, the Citrouillard family!

296
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:08,034
Claude, I don't believe it!
How are you?

297
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:31,304
Heroin used to be for the rich.
Now prices have dropped and that's changed.

298
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:37,061
But traditionally it's the
drug of musicians and poets...

299
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:41,606
You mean, ask my friends?
-I don't mean anything.

300
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:46,773
I'm repeating rumors circulated in the media.
-Ok.

301
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:52,938
What exactly do you do?

302
00:31:53,202 --> 00:32:01,242
My dear, I'm the director of the
Canadian University Institute of Rome.

303
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:08,755
What exactly does it do,
the Canadian University Institute of Rome?

304
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:17,639
In fact we're a leading cultural agency that
assists Canadian university students in Rome.

305
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:22,262
And how many Canadian university
students are there in Rome?

306
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:25,642
In fact, a few.

307
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:30,401
Why do you ask?

308
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:33,988
We like to know how our taxes
are being squandered.

309
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,117
We're a very modest operation. Naturally
the director requires paid housing...

310
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:44,581
...where you're always welcome,
of course.

311
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:48,837
You haven't been hit by cutbacks?
-Quite impossible.

312
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:54,508
The Institute is buried in the budgetary
quagmire of Foreign Affairs.

313
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:57,387
The Minister himself
has no inkling we exist.

314
00:32:57,595 --> 00:33:00,715
Who should I have slept with
to get that job?

315
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:05,927
I'm afraid that people I slept with
would've been blind to your charms,

316
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:08,559
however abundant they are.

317
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:13,979
Abundance has it fans, dearie.
-Not in Foreign Affairs.

318
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:37,089
This it?

319
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:41,635
Someone found it somewhere?
-That's it.

320
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:52,397
I have to get heroin for him.
I need someone with contacts.

321
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,682
I've been away too long.

322
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:58,399
The only powder I sniff now
is Baby's Own.

323
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,356
I could try to ask my daughter.
Remember Nathalie? -Yes, a little.

324
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:06,326
I can't promise anything.
I rarely hear from her.

325
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:22,210
Hi, sweetheart.
It's mom. It's Diane.

326
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:25,252
I miss you, sweetheart.

327
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:31,508
Look,
remember Sebastien, Remy's son?

328
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:34,348
You often played together as kids.

329
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:38,398
He wants to meet.
He needs some information.

330
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:43,523
So call whenever you like,
at any time.

331
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:48,029
If you prefer not to talk to me,
I'll leave you his number.

332
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:53,406
We have to hit Costco before 6.
We need a shitload of diapers.

333
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,531
Children cost so much.

334
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:58,322
Why do people in the Third World
have so many?

335
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:03,335
What a dumb thing to say.
-Your poor students, if you teach such crap!

336
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:07,251
Did you get that book I mentioned?
-Which one?

337
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:10,006
Inner Healing by Swami Rapudanthra.

338
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:15,263
No, unfortunately not.
-I'll bring it. Your body's in your head.

339
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:20,019
Illness starts and ends in the head.
I keep telling Pierre that.

340
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:24,014
Well, we'll be going.
-See you soon.

341
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:36,364
How old is she? It's not about age.
Her breasts outweigh her brain.

342
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:41,413
Cut it out.
-It's true! The quantity of blood they require

343
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:46,868
drains the brain. It's physiological.
-No wisecracks.

344
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,835
She's given me two girls
who've transformed my life.

345
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,837
And a mere brush of her hand
makes me as hard as a bull.

346
00:35:53,138 --> 00:35:57,764
Which you'll agree
is a godsend at our age.

347
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,093
Nathalie?

348
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:50,689
I didn't recognize you. Come.

349
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:08,120
Do you work full-time?

350
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,659
What do you do?
-Proofreader.

351
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:16,705
For a publishing company?

352
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:21,386
Boreal Press.
-So your hours are flexible.

353
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:26,927
My proposal is that
I pay for your supplies,

354
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:30,304
as well as my father's.

355
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:36,265
Want brown or white?
-I've no idea.

356
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:41,693
To smoke or shoot up?
-I trust you.

357
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:46,568
You shouldn't.
-Why not?

358
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:50,200
You should never trust a junkie.

359
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,624
They make a habit of lying.

360
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,299
It's right there.

361
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,548
How much?
-$500.

362
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,647
It's pretty chilly, huh?

363
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:09,397
That girl's innocent.
She's doing me a favor.

364
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:13,940
Arrest me, but forget her.
-Arrest you?

365
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,615
Think I'm a fool?
-Not at all.

366
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,746
You located Olivier in two days.
Nice going.

367
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,407
Olivier?
-The dealer.

368
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:26,578
Why not arrest him?
-Want me to arrest everyone?

369
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:35,054
Recognize him?
-He's Michel Richer, the biologist.

370
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:37,304
You never bust suppliers?

371
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:42,640
All the time. We work 2,3 years,
bust an Iranian gang.

372
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,647
And then Iraqis took their place.

373
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:50,353
Or the Lebanese, Turks, Italians.

374
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:56,109
There's too much demand.
It's an invasion.

375
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,698
What are you doing here?
I mean, now?

376
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:04,699
My job.
-I see.

377
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,992
Keeping the peace.

378
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:13,880
The fish are biting
in Zampino's pond.

379
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,261
Time to go fishing.

380
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:23,422
What did you study?

381
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,639
Why do you ask?
-Curious.

382
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:31,732
criminology, minor in psych.
You?

383
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,021
Mathematics, minor in economics.

384
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:40,567
Take care.
-You too.

385
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,860
You don't remember me?
-No.

386
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,488
I was close to your mom.

387
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,450
You mean you slept with her?
-Not just that.

388
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,123
Were you married?
-Yes.

389
00:40:56,799 --> 00:41:00,002
The married ones
never stayed till morning.

390
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,173
I'd see them if I woke up at night.

391
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:08,555
From a child's perspective,
it must seem sordid.

392
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:13,850
We called it
sexual liberation.

393
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,017
What's that?
-Heroin.

394
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,524
It comes from opium, right?

395
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:23,739
It's morphine mixed with chemicals.

396
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:30,738
Will you inject it?
-We'll start inhaling and then see.

397
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,581
It's incredible to...

398
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:40,131
Be quiet now. Try to concentrate.

399
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:45,380
The first time is the best.
It's the one you long for.

400
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:03,104
It's called riding the dragon.

401
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:26,505
Morning.
-Good morning.

402
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:33,463
It smells. Have you been smoking?
-Not on your life. I light a candle and meditate.

403
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:38,432
Where's your IV?
-Dr Levesque had it removed.

404
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:41,890
Good morning, my doctresses.

405
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:48,437
Take a deep breath.

406
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:51,897
Does it hurt here?
-Oh, yes.

407
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:54,775
And here too?
-There too, yes.

408
00:42:55,036 --> 00:42:57,953
Is it unbearable?
-Goodness, no!

409
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:03,080
You're in high spirits.
-Couldn't be higher!

410
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:06,123
How do you sleep?
-Like a baby.

411
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,957
Then I won't prescribe painkillers.

412
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:13,418
Forget it!
-That's wonderful.

413
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:18,003
I always say, the longer
they stay lucid, the better.

414
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:21,011
I plan to remain lucid till I die.

415
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:25,479
Wonderful, Mr. Paranteau.
-Thanks so much, Dr. Dube.

416
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,316
I'm not Dr. Dube.
-How fitting, because I'm not Mr. Parenteau.

417
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:38,865
Who's he?

418
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:42,415
So it all started
with Maria Goretti.

419
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:46,868
Exactly. The girl who said, No!
-Which one was Maria Goretti?

420
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:50,287
A Portuguese peasant.
-Portuguese? Santa Maria Goretti!

421
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,831
She was Italian?
-From Nettuno.

422
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,462
Portugal, that's Fatima, the apparitions,
the Virgin, the shepherds.

423
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:01,633
The secret of Fatima.
-Which only the Pobe could hear.

424
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:06,178
Poor Canada, in 1960.
-Look, we believed it.

425
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:09,805
So they filmed the edifying life
of Maria Goretti.

426
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,805
Starring?
-I've racked my brains.

427
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,899
Ines Orsini.

428
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:20,154
Of course! The Immortal Ines Orisini!
How could I forget?

429
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:25,408
I saw it at school in Padua with the Jesuits.
-Me, the Jesuits at Brebeuf.

430
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,613
Me, at the Chicoutimi seminary.

431
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,497
For the whole film the
immortal Ines Orsini

432
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,746
is covered from head to toe.

433
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:41,712
But at some point they had to at least suggest
the abject nature of the bestial desire

434
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,296
of the vile rapist.

435
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,598
So the exquisite Maria dips
her adorable toes into the ocean.

436
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:52,055
With a regal but modest gesture,
she lifts her skirt...

437
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:59,396
The thighs of Ines Orsini!
-Even I remember!

438
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:07,323
Oh, the rivers of sperm I spilled
dreaming of her thighs.

439
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,954
So that explains the rise in the level
of the St. Lawrence River.

440
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:20,830
For years I'd fall asleep with
a hard-on, dreaming of Ines Orsini,

441
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,881
until the day I saw Francoise Hardy
on TV singing All the Boys and Girls.

442
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:31,342
I was suddenly indifferent to Ines's holy airs.
-Maria Goretti, alone,

443
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,930
abandoned - the fate of womanhood

444
00:45:34,103 --> 00:45:38,563
For a long time I slept with
Francoise Hardy. We were very happy.

445
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:45,102
Alas, I discovered Julie Christie in a film.
Our mad affair lasted six months,

446
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:48,358
till I met Chris Evert,
the tennis champ,

447
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,990
whom I left for the sublime Karen Kain

448
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:54,954
dancing carmen in Marseille.

449
00:46:06,383 --> 00:46:11,425
All my life I went to bed
with the world's most gorgeous women.

450
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:17,426
Then one morning I awoke realizing
I'd fallen asleep dreaming of the Caribbean.

451
00:46:18,603 --> 00:46:22,186
I'd grown old.
Women had deserted my dreams.

452
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:28,519
It's been so long
since I dreamed of a man.

453
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:44,794
Just what is it you do?

454
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:49,579
You're president of a Norwegian oil firm.

455
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:54,419
You've bought a North Sea oil field
from a failing U.S. company.

456
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,547
You can produce oil for $7 per barrel,
and you sell for $25.

457
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:03,803
But you want to limit your exposure
to fluctuating oil prices. How?

458
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:08,807
No idea.
-You see me, we do a swap.

459
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:13,568
What's that?
-A deal where my bank pays you

460
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:15,939
a set price
and you pay the floating price.

461
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:19,657
You contract to sell your oil at a set
price for a set period. In short,

462
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,322
I manage financial risk.

463
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,620
Are you good at what you do?

464
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:29,660
Pretty good.

465
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:39,298
Could you get the driver
to stop at the lake?

466
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,639
Probably.

467
00:47:46,185 --> 00:47:48,558
I'd like to see it again.

468
00:48:29,352 --> 00:48:35,471
At Berkley I did my PhD alongside Locken and
Donaldson, two future Pulitzers.

469
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:40,395
They were no better than me,
but they were American.

470
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:46,158
Me, I came back here, I started
to teach, got married,

471
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,367
And then... then nothing.

472
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:52,700
Your women kept you too busy.
-That was small time, like you said.

473
00:48:52,874 --> 00:48:55,874
No, what I lacked was extravagance.

474
00:48:56,419 --> 00:49:02,707
I went in for pathetic trysts
in poorly heated East End flats.

475
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:08,965
I was replaced by a TA within 48 hours.
The dean neglected to say goodbye.

476
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:13,476
The lowliest secretary
gets a cake for maternity leave.

477
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:27,020
Ladies and gentlemen, for health reasons
I'll be unable to complete this term.

478
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,199
Ms Raphaelle Metellus
will replace me.

479
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,781
Does this affect our deadlines?

480
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:38,785
No, deadlines and exam dates
remain unchanged.

481
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:41,703
Any other questions?

482
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:51,294
Good luck.
-Thanks.

483
00:49:56,226 --> 00:50:02,513
So, as you saw last week, the 1840
election was particularly stormy.

484
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:05,312
The Whig party,

485
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:12,364
then newly formed, united four
distinct constituencies

486
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:17,035
First, the National Republicans, followers of
Adams and Clay, the party founders.

487
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:26,722
Irina's home, I have to go out.

488
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,401
Is Nathalie buying for you?

489
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:48,738
She's a friend.

490
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:53,336
If you're a regular,
maybe we should deal directly.

491
00:51:53,754 --> 00:51:55,912
It's only temporary.

492
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:59,007
Everything in life is temporary.

493
00:51:59,342 --> 00:52:04,133
"you can never swim
in the same river twice," said...

494
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,472
what's his face? You know...

495
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:16,480
You can't count on Nathalie.
She'll pull a fast one on you.

496
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:18,817
We'll see.

497
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:21,981
You know where I live.
-Sure.

498
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,540
What are you doing?
-I was waiting for you.

499
00:52:40,214 --> 00:52:43,963
You're always on my mind.
-I know, you've told me.

500
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:51,347
At night I picture you bleeding
in an alley, in shooting galleries.

501
00:52:51,558 --> 00:52:54,808
I'm always so scared.
It's unbearable.

502
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,346
You imagine too much.

503
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:02,685
You know this can't go on.

504
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:08,532
Of course I know.
I know it better than you.

505
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:14,494
I know it's my fault,
that's what's killing me.

506
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:21,790
That doesn't change anything.
I don't need this.

507
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:35,849
You don't care much
about living, do you?

508
00:53:36,643 --> 00:53:38,600
Not really.

509
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:43,519
I was like you at your age. Ready to
die at any time. I didn't care.

510
00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:46,940
That's why the young people
make the best martyrs.

511
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:49,980
It's paradoxical,
but living grows on you,

512
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:52,866
when you begin to subtract:
I've got 20 years left, 15, 10.

513
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:57,025
When you realize it's for the last time.

514
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,404
I'm buying my last car.

515
00:53:59,622 --> 00:54:02,955
This is my last trip
to Genoa, Barcelona...

516
00:54:03,209 --> 00:54:06,162
I won't live that long.
-How do you know?

517
00:54:08,674 --> 00:54:11,425
Overdoses are pretty frequent.

518
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,179
But you can never tell. Maybe you'll
kick it and reach a ripe old age.

519
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:21,763
We can't decipher the past,
how can we know the future?

520
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:24,847
No one ever knows what'll happen to them.

521
00:54:25,064 --> 00:54:27,815
Except me, now. I know.

522
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:34,443
Are you scared? -Sure am. I don't want to
stop living. I loved life so much.

523
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:38,155
What was it you loved?
-Everything.

524
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:44,248
Wine, books, music, women,
above all women.

525
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:49,410
Their smell, their mouths,
the feel of their skin.

526
00:54:49,962 --> 00:54:52,287
Were there many of them?
-Yes.

527
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:56,633
Don't they begin to seem the same?
-A bit, yes.

528
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:59,507
But I never get tired of them.

529
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,013
Still the great seducer? -No, not anymore.
With age, it's not the same thing.

530
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:09,886
Do you still enjoy wine?

531
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:13,646
Unfortunately not.
Not with my liver.

532
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,694
The trips you dreamed of,
did you make them?

533
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,573
Nowadays there are tourists everywhere.

534
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:27,530
It's not the present you cling on,
It's your past life.

535
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,703
That life is already dead.
-Perhaps.

536
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:34,095
I expected a musty antique dealer,
not a ravishing young lady.

537
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:41,563
I warn you, I'm no specialist.

538
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:46,194
At one time
everyone here was Catholic.

539
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:49,323
Like in Spain or Ireland.

540
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:59,581
At a very precise moment in 1966, in fact the
churches suddenly emptied out, in a few months.

541
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:06,002
A very strange phenomenon
that has yet to be explained.

542
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:09,799
So now we don't know
what to do with this.

543
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:16,931
The authorities would like to find
out if it has any value.

544
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,343
Commercial value?
-Yes.

545
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,248
Do you have any 18th-centuary
French chalices?

546
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:53,463
The Americans snapped them up.
There are a few examples in the museums.

547
00:57:57,764 --> 00:58:03,637
I'm sure this has great value
for people here, the collective memory.

548
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:12,066
But is there anything that we could sell?
-On the world market?

549
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:19,028
Honestly, I can't imagine it.

550
00:58:19,326 --> 00:58:23,868
In other words,
this is all absolutely worthless.

551
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,124
I'll show you out.

552
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:41,087
Pius XII sitting on his ass
in his gilded Vatican

553
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:45,385
while Primo Levi was taken
to Auschwitz... That's not sad!

554
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:48,768
It's despicable! Hideous!

555
00:58:56,695 --> 00:59:02,697
If what you say true, and history
is a series of abominable crimes,

556
00:59:03,618 --> 00:59:07,449
then someone has to exist
who can forgive us.

557
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:11,288
That's my belief.

558
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:14,375
I envy you.

559
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:20,134
If at least I'd written.

560
00:59:20,343 --> 00:59:25,466
You wrote nothing?
-A few papers here and there, nothing serious.

561
00:59:25,722 --> 00:59:27,381
What are you doing?

562
00:59:28,141 --> 00:59:30,597
What are you doing?
-It bugs me.

563
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:34,184
What would you have written?

564
00:59:34,356 --> 00:59:38,305
The Gulag Archipelago,
The Periodic Table.

565
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:44,439
Really, in that class?
-Never. -So?

566
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:50,986
At least I'd have left a mark. We need to
succeed, even on our own terms.

567
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:55,997
To be able to say we did our best.
It allows us to die at peace.

568
00:59:57,002 --> 01:00:02,458
I'm a total failure.
-At least you realize it.

569
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:06,167
So many professors are smug,
unbearable.

570
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:11,803
I don't know your daughter,
but Sebastien's not exactly a failure.

571
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:17,144
Not thanks to me.
-You don't know that.

572
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:24,230
We thought we'd pay a visit.
-Everyone wonders how you are.

573
01:00:24,528 --> 01:00:28,192
Not everyone, surely.
-You'd be surprised.

574
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:32,191
That last day in class
no one seemed very moved.

575
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:37,956
We had no idea at the time.
-Exactly. Now that you're gone...

576
01:00:38,124 --> 01:00:40,199
We see what we're missing.

577
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:43,159
I'm touched to hear that. Sincerely.

578
01:00:48,884 --> 01:00:50,841
We should be going.

579
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:55,429
We have a lecture by Mr. Roby at 4.
-Off you go.

580
01:00:56,809 --> 01:00:59,180
Good luck.
-Thanks.

581
01:01:08,153 --> 01:01:10,359
-Don't give up.
-I won't.

582
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:15,863
Well I never.
-Surprising.

583
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:18,406
For illiterates, they're sweet.

584
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:22,872
It's not their fault.
No one taught them.

585
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:37,211
At this price we'll come anytime.
-We'll see.

586
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,798
I don't want it.

587
01:01:39,974 --> 01:01:42,215
We agreed.
-No, thanks.

588
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:49,478
Do you want to split hers?

589
01:01:58,492 --> 01:02:03,118
We're getting married next summer,
at my parents' in France.

590
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:05,951
You'll see, the chapel's lovely.

591
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,783
Louise and I married on

592
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:12,044
a grey February day in a dismal suburb.

593
01:02:12,297 --> 01:02:16,044
So we could sleep together
without our families hassling us.

594
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:18,962
I want a wedding on the Loire.

595
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:22,049
6 months later I cheated on her.

596
01:02:22,265 --> 01:02:24,304
That was fast.
-Indeed.

597
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:36,526
When I met Sebastien, I said: With him
it's forever, there'll be no one else.

598
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:39,650
I hope it lasts, for your sake.

599
01:02:39,865 --> 01:02:44,076
Because, you know, love...
-No, no, no! Not "love."

600
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,663
Mom and Dad
talked like that. "Love."

601
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:53,918
I love you. I love you too much.
I don't love you.

602
01:02:54,712 --> 01:02:58,211
You can't build a life
on pop-song philosophy.

603
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:02,421
Love Me Tender. Love, Love Me Not.
It's ridiculous.

604
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:05,679
My parents divorced when I was 3.

605
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:10,965
For several years Dad continued
to come over for Sunday lunch.

606
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:15,309
Half an hour before he left,
I'd vanish.

607
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:20,564
I'd be lying on the ground in front
of his car so he couldn't leave.

608
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:24,321
My kids won't go through that.

609
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:36,674
So now my nocturnal pleasures are provided by
my giant-screen Toshiba at the foot of my bed.

610
01:03:37,016 --> 01:03:39,090
No more curled-up toes?

611
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:43,223
That's over. I've seen enough ceilings.
-For ever?

612
01:03:43,438 --> 01:03:48,349
I've closed the store, laid down my arms,
hung up my skates.

613
01:03:49,027 --> 01:03:52,478
Things are much quieter between us too.
-Well, well.

614
01:03:53,948 --> 01:03:57,446
He's in Bologna all week
and I'm in Rome.

615
01:03:57,784 --> 01:03:59,823
There's the weekend, but...

616
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:03,032
My wife falls asleep in bed
with the kids.

617
01:04:03,332 --> 01:04:06,249
Great, you can reread Tocqueville.

618
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,460
That's what I did.
2000 pages on bible paper.

619
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,006
He's increasingly cultivated,
and his prostate increasingly swollen.

620
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,795
Sorry, I still enjoy it a lot.

621
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:21,134
In the country
there's an old cowboy I...

622
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,685
Cowboy? You're with a cowboy now?

623
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:34,896
Yes. There's an old cowboy
I invite over to shake my bush.

624
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:39,857
To shake your bush!
-Yes, but we had a fight.

625
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:45,111
I'll never understand men.
All my life I date cads

626
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:49,242
who thought only of escaping
after satisfying their base needs.

627
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:53,408
The other day, as a compliment,
I said to my cowboy:

628
01:04:53,755 --> 01:05:00,373
To think we can still have sexual flings at our age.
He was incensed. He doesn't want to be a sex object,

629
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:04,425
talks about his masculinity.
-We love that!

630
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,309
Invokes father hunger goes on about exploring
his feminine side, his inner me.

631
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,969
It was unbearable.

632
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:16,932
The last thing I want is
a limp-dicked sentimentalist.

633
01:05:17,194 --> 01:05:20,230
I want to be screwed forcefully.
That's all.

634
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:24,271
I'm sensitive
and smart enough for two.

635
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:26,199
A rub-down?

636
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:30,740
Would he like a rub-down? Does the
Muslim need to bow towards Mecca?

637
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:33,951
Does the Carmelite
long for the Holy Species?

638
01:05:35,252 --> 01:05:39,331
Is this your first time here?
-Yes...

639
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:43,415
I don't know if you believe
in random acts of kindness,

640
01:05:43,718 --> 01:05:47,715
but if you do,
render this sick man happy.

641
01:05:47,931 --> 01:05:50,172
Give him the mother
of all rub-downs.

642
01:05:50,433 --> 01:05:55,475
You will be repaid a hundredfold
in this life or another.

643
01:06:18,793 --> 01:06:21,081
Am I in heaven already?

644
01:06:21,546 --> 01:06:24,914
Are you my Valkyrie, my houri?

645
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:31,880
Oh joy!

646
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:00,870
Nathalie didn't show.

647
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:05,911
It's bad.
Your father's in withdrawal.

648
01:07:17,474 --> 01:07:20,345
Know where Nathalie is?
-No idea.

649
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:23,720
She's disappeared.
-I warned you.

650
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,765
I may come back.
-Before 11.

651
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:40,071
I'm not supposed to do this.

652
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:06,806
You were right.
You said not to trust you.

653
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,684
Your dealer said that too.

654
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,270
Wake up. We've a contract.

655
01:08:13,651 --> 01:08:17,102
What contract?
-I buy the dope, you look after Dad.

656
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,114
What's with him?
-He's waiting.

657
01:08:21,285 --> 01:08:23,407
We're coming.

658
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:26,118
You honor a contract!

659
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:32,119
That's heavy, man.
-We had a deal. I'm counting on you.

660
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:36,708
At the market... my dad...
Y'know, my dad...

661
01:08:37,424 --> 01:08:42,844
Want to trade dads?
Me, I made my life.

662
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:49,018
Perfect young man.

663
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,925
Perfect career.

664
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:55,439
Perfect fiancee.

665
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:02,897
I'm imperfect. It's sad.
It's very sad.

666
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:07,106
Where have you been?
I didn't know what to do.

667
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,368
Get a spoon.
-What?

668
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,703
A spoon.

669
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,167
Fill it to thirty.

670
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:23,834
I can't manage.

671
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,516
What is this?
-Don't ask, we don't have time.

672
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:39,935
You have to help. I beg you. Give him this.
He needs it. Please, I'll explain later.

673
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,230
What's in it?
-Heroin.

674
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:45,603
I beg you.

675
01:09:50,202 --> 01:09:53,202
Shut the door, at least.
-I'm going.

676
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,414
Just this once.
-It'll soon be over.

677
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,671
Better?

678
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:21,892
We sat on your pier. He was never
happier than at the lake.

679
01:10:22,106 --> 01:10:27,183
So could we borrow the cottage?
-Of course, I'll get the key.

680
01:10:30,281 --> 01:10:32,818
What is it?
-The keys to the cottage.

681
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:38,527
What for? -I'm letting Sebastien use it.
He wants to take Remy.

682
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:43,327
Without asking me?
-I'm truly sorry.

683
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:46,329
I'm the one who decorated it.
-That's true.

684
01:10:46,587 --> 01:10:49,715
The hours at Ikea,
don't they count.

685
01:10:49,716 --> 01:10:55,054
Or the curtains I sewed? You lend our
house to strangers without asking!

686
01:10:55,263 --> 01:10:57,504
Remy's not a stranger.

687
01:10:58,057 --> 01:11:00,727
That's why Nicole
divorced Tom Cruise!

688
01:11:00,894 --> 01:11:03,846
He'd lend their Colorado home
to anybody.

689
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:09,305
I'm lending my house
to my friend Remy, and you shut up.

690
01:11:09,943 --> 01:11:15,613
If that's how it is, I won't stay another
second. I'm taking the girls and moving out.

691
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:19,859
I'm sorry. Forget it, we'll manage.

692
01:11:20,037 --> 01:11:23,321
No way. Use it whenever you like.

693
01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:30,666
Don't worry. It's always this way.
That's life. -Thanks.

694
01:11:37,636 --> 01:11:39,545
No news from Sylvaine?

695
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:43,173
No, I even called
the boat's owned in Chile.

696
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:47,638
I hope she's ok.
-She is, it's just the Net uplink.

697
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:49,935
The Pacific's big.

698
01:11:57,363 --> 01:11:59,438
Goodbye.

699
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:09,995
Embrace the mystery
and you'll be saved.

700
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,881
Say you love him.

701
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:33,599
Tell him, and touch him.

702
01:12:35,774 --> 01:12:39,274
Drink this one.
-Right now?

703
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:42,654
Here. Methadone's serious.

704
01:12:54,251 --> 01:12:59,245
Now I trust you.
Drink one a day.

705
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:02,624
Only one. No more, no less.
Come back on Monday.

706
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:06,003
If you screw up,
you're out of the program.

707
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:25,818
I still can't come to terms with it.
-You know you have to.

708
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,816
I can't accept it.

709
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:35,202
That's how it is. It's a law.

710
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:37,823
The very instant you shut your eyes,

711
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:40,876
millions more will also die.

712
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:46,081
But I won't be here anymore. Me.
I'll be gone for good.

713
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:57,142
If at least I'd learned something.

714
01:14:03,274 --> 01:14:06,359
I feel as helpless
as the day I was born.

715
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,190
I haven't found a meaning. It's

716
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,986
I have to search.

717
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,953
I have to keep searching.

718
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:34,466
We've been everything.

719
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,630
Separatists, independantists,
sovereignists, sovereignty-associationists.

720
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,602
At first we were existentialists.

721
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,100
We read Sartre and Camus.

722
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,065
Then Fanon,
we became anti-colonialists.

723
01:14:48,316 --> 01:14:51,980
We read Marcuse and became Marxists.
-Marxist-Leninists.

724
01:14:52,195 --> 01:14:54,068
Trotskyists.
-Maoists.

725
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,945
After Solzhenitsyn we changed.
We were structuralists.

726
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,567
Situationists.
-Feminists.

727
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:04,617
Demonstructionists.
-Is there an "ism" we haven't worshipped.

728
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:08,740
Cretinism.
-God no. Think of Guo Jing.

729
01:15:08,961 --> 01:15:13,289
Who was he? -An archeologist
with a skirt slit to the crotch.

730
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:18,666
Even you remember. -In the 70s,
China opens up to the West.

731
01:15:19,055 --> 01:15:26,183
She comes on a cultural exchange. The
university sends its trusty radical, me...

732
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:32,476
I enter the dining room of her hotel.
I spot her, and die.

733
01:15:36,987 --> 01:15:41,447
Beauty that could melt Emperor Qin's
7000 terra cotta warriors.

734
01:15:41,658 --> 01:15:43,781
I order tea, we make small talk.

735
01:15:44,454 --> 01:15:48,996
I can see us doing Pekinese lotus.
-The Szechuan dragon.

736
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:52,958
To make myself appear interesting,

737
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:56,545
I dive in: "Your country has achieved so much.

738
01:15:56,882 --> 01:16:01,424
We're so envious. Your
Cultural Revolution is wonderful!"

739
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:08,265
Her lovely black eyes glaze over.

740
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:12,812
I'm mortified to realize
that she's thinking,

741
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,606
"He's either a CIA agent
or the worst cretin in the West."

742
01:16:17,818 --> 01:16:20,355
So much for the lotus and dragon.

743
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:24,813
For two years she'd cleaned pigsties
on a re-education farm.

744
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,856
Father murdered,
mother committed suicide.

745
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:34,199
And some dumb French-Canadian who's
seen the films of Jean-Luc Godard

746
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:36,872
and read Philippe Sollers

747
01:16:37,212 --> 01:16:42,716
says that the Chinese
Cultural Revolution, is wonderful!

748
01:16:43,759 --> 01:16:48,254
Cretinism doesn’t sink any lower.

749
01:16:58,107 --> 01:17:00,597
Voluntary simplicity.

750
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:05,353
Scrambled eggs with ossetra caviar
and fresh truffles. -From Tuscany.

751
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:14,869
And to stay in Italy, Castello Banfi Excelsus,
a modest vintage.

752
01:17:15,123 --> 01:17:19,949
Why were we so dumb?
-Are we to infer congenital stupidity?

753
01:17:20,209 --> 01:17:24,752
Not at all.
-Intelligence isn't an individual trait.

754
01:17:24,965 --> 01:17:28,796
It's collective,
national, intermittent.

755
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:31,417
Oh, a new theory!

756
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,549
Athens, 416BC
Euripides premieres his Electra

757
01:17:34,767 --> 01:17:37,932
Two rivals attend,
Sophocles and Aristophanes.

758
01:17:38,144 --> 01:17:42,639
And two friends, Socrates and Plato.
Intelligence was there.

759
01:17:42,856 --> 01:17:46,984
Firenze, 1504, Palazzo Vecchio,

760
01:17:47,236 --> 01:17:52,360
on facing walls, two painters:
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

761
01:17:52,742 --> 01:17:57,485
An apprentice: Rafaello.
A manager: Niccolo Machiavelli.

762
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:03,573
Philadelphia, USA, 1776 - 1787.

763
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:07,168
Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution.

764
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:17,137
Adams, Franklin, Jefferson,
Washington, Hamilton and Madison.

765
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:20,765
No other country
has been so blessed.

766
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:24,553
I was born in Chicoutimi,
Canada, in 1950.

767
01:18:24,772 --> 01:18:27,261
It's a miracle you're not dumber.

768
01:18:27,565 --> 01:18:30,814
in 1950, everyone was dumb,
in Athens and Chicoutimi.

769
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:34,360
In Italy you'd have supported
the Red Brigades.

770
01:18:34,572 --> 01:18:38,700
Now it's Berlusconi.
-Philadelphia voted George Bush.

771
01:18:38,952 --> 01:18:41,359
You see, you're not that dumb.

772
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:45,913
Intelligence has disappeared,
and it can take eons to come back.

773
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:49,826
From Tacitus to Dante was what,
11 centuries?

774
01:18:50,212 --> 01:18:52,963
The Arabs kept intelligence alive.
-True.

775
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:55,710
You're not hungry?

776
01:18:56,093 --> 01:18:59,461
It won't go down.
-And you? -No thanks.

777
01:19:02,724 --> 01:19:07,765
I never thought I'd see the day
you'd turn down fresh truffles.

778
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:12,310
Alas, that day is here.

779
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:16,979
A sip of wine?

780
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:21,483
Drink to my health
and tell me how good it is.

781
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:58,149
I'd like to bow out
just like Felix Faure.

782
01:19:58,777 --> 01:20:01,184
Why am I not surprised?

783
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:04,948
I can dream.
-Who was he? Why?

784
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:10,363
Oh blessed Felix Faure, the
President of the French Republic.

785
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:12,987
His heart stopped beating,

786
01:20:13,206 --> 01:20:17,156
while his mistress the admirable
Madame Steinheil, kneeling before him,

787
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:22,798
bestowed on him the most
glorious blowjob of all time.

788
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:27,719
My god!
-His enemies gloated:

789
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:31,973
"She seized him, the would-be
Caesar and he had a seizure!"

790
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:40,350
Henceforth Madame Steinheil
was known as the kiss of death.

791
01:20:42,652 --> 01:20:44,976
I should be so lucky!

792
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:49,151
It's not our fault
if your heart is unstoppable.

793
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:55,570
I'd like to remind you that at a certain time,
I and several others here

794
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:58,950
blew you most heartily,
with enough force to capsize a schooner.

795
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:03,543
What do you know
about blowing buoys?

796
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:07,456
Well, sir, our efforts
earned gushing praise.

797
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:11,670
Heavens, that's hard to swallow.

798
01:21:26,985 --> 01:21:29,655
I'm beat.
-Go to bed.

799
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:34,067
Aren't you coming?
-Not tonight.

800
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,907
The Middle Ages, the manuscripts...

801
01:22:28,918 --> 01:22:32,168
The barbarians,
everywhere, tomorrow...

802
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:38,582
Their prince approaches.

803
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:13,131
I'm scared.

804
01:24:16,062 --> 01:24:19,062
We'll do what you want.
It's your decision.

805
01:24:29,366 --> 01:24:31,691
Know what I want for you?

806
01:24:33,745 --> 01:24:36,699
To have as fine a son as you.

807
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,840
Heard from Sylvaine?
-No.

808
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,556
Tell her I thought of her.

809
01:25:02,147 --> 01:25:04,139
I love you.

810
01:25:40,725 --> 01:25:45,101
Not so long ago
I'd have jumped you without asking.

811
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:49,856
I might have let you.
-I suspected as much.

812
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:08,614
I wasn't here today. You didn't see me.
-Of course.

813
01:26:20,846 --> 01:26:22,803
This just came in.

814
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:34,269
On a ship,
you call it the evil eye...

815
01:26:36,402 --> 01:26:43,115
Striking a growler - an iceberg -

816
01:26:44,618 --> 01:26:48,318
at night,
or a fire from an oil leak...

817
01:26:52,502 --> 01:26:55,751
It's been too long
since I've seen you.

818
01:26:57,131 --> 01:27:00,047
My Daddy, my Papuschka,

819
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:05,963
I've have missed you all my life.

820
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:12,802
Tell yourself I'm a happy woman,
I've found my place.

821
01:27:13,688 --> 01:27:20,021
I don't know how you did it, but
you managed to pass on your lust for life

822
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:28,367
You and Mom raised incredibly strong
children. It's a miracle really

823
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:39,702
You know, the first man in a
woman's life is her father.

824
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,167
You'll always be with me.

825
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:15,869
Friends, sharing this modest life
with you has been a delight.

826
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:19,407
I take your smiles with me.

827
01:29:18,765 --> 01:29:20,757
Remy, Remy...

828
01:29:38,408 --> 01:29:40,281
The man of my life.

829
01:30:11,398 --> 01:30:13,271
My guardian angel.

830
01:30:15,735 --> 01:30:17,893
It's a privilege to know you.

831
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:21,938
The privilege was all mine, Miss.

832
01:32:21,145 --> 01:32:23,352
Mom doesn't want to live here.

833
01:32:23,565 --> 01:32:28,558
I don't need to sell it.
You can move in for now.

834
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:47,408
IF THIS BE A MAN

835
01:32:54,093 --> 01:32:56,215
HISTORIA AND UTOPIA

836
01:34:32,061 --> 01:34:34,018
I love you.
