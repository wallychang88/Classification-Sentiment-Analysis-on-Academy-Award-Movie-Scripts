1
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,717
What I love about Nicole...

2
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,808
she makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

3
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,654
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

4
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:57,513
Yes, I do.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,852
She really listens
when someone is talking.

6
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,978
- Do you want to sign up here?
- You know what? I...

7
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:05,236
It's funny, I actually signed up for this
but I never heard from you guys.

8
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,859
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

9
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,235
Okay, if you email me here...

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,572
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

11
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,157
She's a good citizen.

12
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,803
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

13
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:19,460
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

14
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,539
Call him.

15
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,800
I get stuck in my ways,

16
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,921
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone.

17
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,345
She cuts all our hair.

18
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,187
Yeah!

19
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,855
She's always inexplicably

20
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,444
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesn't drink.

21
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,115
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock, or close a cabinet,

22
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,625
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

23
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:06,452
Nicole grew up in LA around actors,
and directors, and movies, and TV,

24
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,836
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

25
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,552
and Cassie, her sister.

26
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,130
- Hmm.
- Note the wrapping.

27
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,607
Nicole gives great presents.

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,441
Uh...

29
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:35,369
She is a mother who plays,
really plays.

30
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,659
- Lizard?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,445
She never steps off playing

32
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,737
or says it's too much.

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,126
- Mom.
- And it must be too much some of the time.

34
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,800
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

35
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,378
All right.

36
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,627
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

37
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,966
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

38
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,342
Goddamn it!

39
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,260
- Do not laugh at me! Stop it!
- She's competitive.

40
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,761
She's amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

41
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,853
which I've always found very sexy.

42
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,149
She keeps the fridge over-full.

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,072
No one is ever hungry in our house.

44
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,483
She can drive a stick.

45
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:16,823
How could you?

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,826
After that movie, All Over The Girl,

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,743
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star,

48
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,530
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in New York.

49
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,123
You might as well get what you paid for.

50
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,748
She's brave.

51
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,387
She's a great dancer.

52
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,967
Infectious. She makes me wish
I could dance.

53
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,049
She always says when she doesn't know
something, or hasn't read a book,

54
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,598
or seen a film or a play,

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,894
whereas I fake it or say something
like I haven't seen it in awhile.

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,864
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

57
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,823
Let's try it...

58
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,657
crawling...

59
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,040
but also standing.

60
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,704
She's my favorite actress.

61
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,674
What I love about Charlie...

62
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,713
Charlie is undaunted.

63
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,511
He never lets other people's opinions
or any setbacks

64
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,305
keep him from what he wants to do.

65
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,227
And he liked me, so...

66
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,190
Charlie eats like he's trying
to get it over with

67
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,771
and like there won't be enough food
for everyone.

68
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,527
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

69
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,562
Is your sweater on backwards?

70
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,819
But he's incredibly neat,
and I rely on him to keep things in order.

71
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,159
So...

72
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,732
He's energy-conscious.

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,621
Hey.

74
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:50,958
Sorry.

75
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,544
He doesn't look in the mirror
too often.

76
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,179
I cried four times.

77
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,178
Me too.

78
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,716
He cries easily in movies.

79
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,550
I wonder if it was the same four.

80
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,840
He's very self-sufficient.
He can darn a sock,

81
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:05,051
and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

82
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,764
How are we doing over here?

83
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,022
The peppers are cut.

84
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,234
He rarely gets defeated, which...

85
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,198
I feel like I always do.

86
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,524
...I've got some carrots.

87
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,566
Charlie takes
all of my moods steadily.

88
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,036
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

89
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,283
He's a great dresser.

90
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,869
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

91
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,459
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

92
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,911
He's very competitive.

93
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,250
Oh, come on!

94
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,373
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

95
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,503
How much is it?

96
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,470
- I don't have enough.
- $450.

97
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,011
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

98
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,635
This is so frustrating!

99
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,843
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

100
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,368
- Dad.
- He loves being a dad.

101
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,565
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

102
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,897
the waking up at night.

103
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,902
I had a bad dream.

104
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:00,945
It's okay.

105
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,943
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

106
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,036
but... then, it's mostly nice.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,791
Dad, stay.

108
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,074
He disappears into his own world.

109
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,440
Shit.

110
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,252
- What's "shit?"
- This is our stop.

111
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,740
He and Henry
are alike in that way.

112
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,993
He can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face

113
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,163
in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

114
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,918
Perfect.

115
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,054
Charlie is self-made.

116
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,628
His parents...

117
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,845
I only met them once, but...

118
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,304
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

119
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,236
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they're coming with a camcorder.

120
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,785
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called?

121
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,762
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net,

122
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,106
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

123
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,072
I made sure they used
the right almond milk.

124
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,981
Genius.

125
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,441
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

126
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,527
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

127
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,163
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

128
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,588
He could remember all the inside jokes.

129
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,208
And where do you go when it's windy?

130
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

131
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,549
He's extremely organized
and thorough.

132
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,547
He's very clear about what he wants,

133
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,850
unlike me, who can't always tell.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,761
Let's stop right there.

135
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,496
Who wants to start?

136
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,793
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

137
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,469
Why is that?

138
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,681
Because I don't like what I wrote.

139
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,308
As we mediate your separation

140
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,805
and eventual divorce,

141
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,407
things can get quite contentious.

142
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,815
So, I like to begin
with a note of positivity,

143
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:51,447
for the people I work with to remember
why they got married in the first place.

144
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,496
And so that, as you come apart,

145
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,288
you're reminded that...

146
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,003
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

147
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,170
and maybe still do in many ways.

148
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,675
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

149
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,467
For it to really work,

150
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,340
you both have to read.

151
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,630
I'm not going to.

152
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,767
Okay, um...

153
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,097
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

154
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,645
uh, the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

155
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,893
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

156
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,421
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

157
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,856
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

158
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,198
We promised to listen.

159
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,282
That's right.

160
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,660
That's the very first step
in this process.

161
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:41,505
Well, I think I'm going to go
if you two are going to just sit around

162
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,624
and suck each other's dicks.

163
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,338
How can this evil allow moderation?

164
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,388
How can this evil
allow moderation?

165
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,269
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

166
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,556
How is it human to be so...

167
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,851
faithless?

168
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,777
I want no praise from impious men.

169
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,986
No home with them of quiet ease.

170
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,280
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

171
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,904
Shall I fail my father...

172
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,327
stifling my cries,

173
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,544
clipping the wings of grief?

174
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,252
Must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away,

175
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,505
feebly count for nothing?

176
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,417
Must his killers gloat...

177
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,507
Must his killers gloat,

178
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,509
never to pay with blood, for blood...

179
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,465
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

180
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,097
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

181
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,892
Acting is reacting.

182
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,527
I'm responding to you.
You're slowing me down.

183
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,604
Frank, it's closing night, you know.

184
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,940
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

185
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,607
No, I think this time it's really over.

186
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,694
- It still feels weird.
- I feel like my parents are splitting up.

187
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,654
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

188
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,219
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

189
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,964
You're lucky, Nic.
I wish I was going to LA.

190
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,237
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

191
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,667
I want to make a toast

193
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,296
to Charlie...

194
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,635
and to our beloved Nicole,

195
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:18,059
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure,

196
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,097
all the way to sunny California.

197
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,853
And we are also going to try
something new.

198
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,938
We are going to take our play
to Broadway.

199
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,770
It reminds me of when I was a young person

200
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,152
and went to Broadway for the first time.

201
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,239
And I'm telling you,

202
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,119
winning your first Tony at 27,

203
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,334
it can mess with your head.

204
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,955
I mean, I was just a baby.
Elia Kazan was backstage...

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,722
I'm going to go over there now.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,313
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

207
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,959
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

208
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,141
and Marlene, you know,
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

209
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,892
but tonight she was very, very serious.

210
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,100
Could you give me a second?

211
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,423
Well, I'd have to study it, but...

212
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,457
Hey.

213
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,835
Oh. Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

214
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,636
- How's he doing?
- Good, good. He went to bed on time.

215
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,544
No fuss.

216
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,673
Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

217
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,721
God, you guys are so attractive.

218
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,891
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

219
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,092
No, it's okay.

220
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,846
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

221
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,809
Hey, thanks.
And also the travel time.

222
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,676
...conversation
as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

223
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,208
...if you know what I mean.

224
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,966
- Y-You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't moving in.

225
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,288
We'll be back when you get your...

226
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,937
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

227
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,017
- Yeah.
- W-We might not need a mediator.

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,062
We'll just split everything anyway,
I don't care.

229
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,519
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

230
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,250
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

231
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,145
We'll figure it out.

232
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,025
- We want the same things.
- Right.

233
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,447
In the meantime,
the pilot will be fun for you.

234
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,954
You don't think it's bad, do you?

235
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,292
I don't ever watch TV,
so, you know, I can't tell.

236
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,671
Uh-huh.

237
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,174
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

238
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,679
Yes?

239
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,764
Nothing.

240
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,680
I can tell you want to give me a note.

241
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,769
No, I don't.

242
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,692
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

243
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,338
I guess it doesn't matter now.
You won't be with the show anymore.

244
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,364
It's stupid.

245
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,078
You're not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me.

246
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,120
Maybe not.

247
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
Okay, then.

248
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,290
So, there are two things.

249
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,834
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

250
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,802
- Okay.
- And then...

251
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,011
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

252
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,061
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

253
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,641
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

254
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,062
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

255
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,354
it didn't.

256
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,281
That's all I had.

257
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,110
Thanks for indulging me.

258
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,364
Good night, Charlie.

259
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,039
Mom.

260
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,957
G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

261
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,177
What do you want to do today?

262
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,468
Hang out and relax with you.

263
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,346
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

264
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,046
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

265
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,470
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

266
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,518
I hate Fairy Camp.

267
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,804
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

268
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,437
and I think this is true.

269
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,736
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

270
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,283
- Hm?
- Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

271
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,784
Mm.

272
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,989
Oop-a-doodle.

273
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,463
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?

274
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,717
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

275
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,298
Oh, shit.

276
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,512
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

277
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,146
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

278
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,183
Oh, surprise surprise.

279
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,689
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

280
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,559
...into this room.

281
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,898
I can do this part alone.

282
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,563
Fine. I won't look.

283
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,196
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

284
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,955
and until you know what you want to do,
we're going to do what I like to do.

285
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,708
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

286
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,621
Even though I'm 64

287
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,498
and have a dead gay husband,

288
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,336
I manage to get up every day,

289
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,173
live my life,
and feel pretty good about myself.

290
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,338
So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

291
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,132
You know what I would do?

292
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,720
About what?

293
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,225
When Charlie gets here,
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

294
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,440
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

295
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,854
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

296
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,643
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

297
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,738
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

298
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,364
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

299
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,784
When Daddy gets here,

300
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,328
- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.
- Yeah.

301
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,914
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you,

302
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,829
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

303
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,758
No, we'll all go together,
sweetheart.

304
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,126
Did you know that Universal Studios
is where I did my first screen test?

305
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,166
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it,

306
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,219
and I started to think it was just bad.

307
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,841
My agent says it's one to watch.

308
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,138
Mmm.

309
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,805
- This coffee is good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

310
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,103
What if Charlie is on Broadway

311
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,437
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

312
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,022
and I'm just doing bad TV?

313
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,150
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

314
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,797
- She's beautiful.
- Her wig looks great.

315
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,542
Where's she been
the past ten years?

316
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,155
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

317
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,364
- I saw one. It rained onstage.
- Can I say something?

318
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,914
It was good. Edgy.

319
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,659
Directed by her husband,
supposedly very controlling.

320
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,477
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

321
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,063
- We can thank her divorce.
- Can she move her hand?

322
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,941
It's going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

323
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,678
Can... you move your hand
further down the baby?

324
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,967
- Where? Like here?
- Off the head entirely.

325
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,124
I have to support his head.

326
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,607
No, no, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

327
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,541
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

328
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,767
I can't hold a baby like this.

329
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,438
She's right, that's going to look weird.

330
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,133
It was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science.

331
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,879
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

332
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,292
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

333
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,581
I say that with respect.

334
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,125
I was raised by two mothers.

335
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,548
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

336
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,750
Here? How about here?

337
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,005
- How about now?
- Why is there always a flirty grip?

338
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,444
I can do anything you want.
I just need her here two hours...

339
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,389
Can I say something?

340
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,351
Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

341
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,638
She has to know
how to hold a baby.

342
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,161
- Later on, after she kills Donny...
- She kills Donny?

343
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,267
That's a secret.
We didn't give the crew those pages.

344
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,791
...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother
to the plant community.

345
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,356
That's not going to make any sense

346
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,403
if we feel like she's a bad mother
to her own kid.

347
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,906
- She's right.
- Does Donny know?

348
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,464
- Must be nice to get out of New York.
- Well, I'm from out here.

349
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,951
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

350
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,125
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

351
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,585
- We are just so excited to have you.
- I'm excited to be here.

352
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:09,167
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

353
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,421
What signifies early aughts?

354
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,173
Into The Girl was on TV...

355
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,273
- All Over The Girl.
- ...or streaming or something.

356
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,179
You are fucking hot in that movie.

357
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,009
- Carol.
- Fuck it, I speak my mind.

358
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,696
- We're not allowing our son to see it.
- Because you show your tits.

359
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,601
- Carol!
- Yeah.

360
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,301
- Dennis.
- This is Carter Mitchum.

361
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,802
He's a futurist at UCLA.

362
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,355
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

363
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,019
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

364
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:31,977
- What?
- Accurate?

365
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,066
So far, none of it.

366
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,272
This pilot will go.
So get ready to move back to LA.

367
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,154
Listen, everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right.

368
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,343
- If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
- Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

369
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,029
- including Donny.
- I... I thought...

370
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,992
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writer's room.

371
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,212
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

372
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,671
Or I could direct.

373
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,174
- No, yeah.
- Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

374
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,424
No, do you have a reel?

375
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:59,007
No, because I've... I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

376
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,844
Almost ex-husband.

377
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,970
Oh, what's the opposite of fiancé?

378
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,857
Dennis and I will talk
to your agent about it.

379
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,224
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something like,

380
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,152
"The next one,"
but he was always the director,

381
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,688
so there never was a next one.

382
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,737
I don't know. Maybe if we'd
stayed married, there would've been.

383
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,530
Yeah, no. We're going
to kill him off. It seems unlikely...

384
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,731
I'm going to give you a number.

385
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,536
Okay, is it a therapist?
Because I have a therapist.

386
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,460
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

387
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,252
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

388
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:33,919
Oh.

389
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,465
You and Dennis are divorced?

390
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,676
Since 2013.

391
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,966
You still work together.

392
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,334
That's nice.

393
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,836
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

394
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,428
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

395
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,512
Oh.

396
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,012
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

397
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,189
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already,

398
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,769
and I... just... hated them.

399
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,313
Call Nora.

400
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,396
She saved my life.

401
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,901
Sorry, I...

402
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,152
look so schleppy.

403
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,106
I had an event at my kid's school.

404
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,609
Let me get this out of the way.

405
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,031
I think you're a wonderful actress.

406
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,573
Thank you.

407
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,412
I loved All Over The Girl,

408
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,908
but the theater stuff too...

409
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,159
You saw the theater stuff?

410
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,461
I was in New York last year for my book,

411
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,547
which, remind me to give you a copy,

412
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,414
and my publisher took me.

413
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,506
Great.

414
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,883
- Thank you.
- You are awesome.

415
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,553
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

416
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,140
He's very talented.

417
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,308
He is.

418
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,102
They're moving it to Broadway.

419
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,394
Hmm.

420
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,185
Well, without me, of course.

421
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,030
He was lucky to have you.

422
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,743
How are you doing?

423
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,365
- Sorry.
- Oh.

424
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:52,914
Honey...

425
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,764
You take some breaths.

426
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:08,019
And while you do,
I'm going to tell you about myself.

427
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,598
If you should choose to hire me,

428
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,184
I will work tirelessly for you,

429
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,931
and I'm always available by phone or text,

430
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,472
except when I'm with my kids.

431
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,400
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

432
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,645
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

433
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,576
Thank you Annie. So...

434
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,822
I know how it feels.

435
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,739
- You do?
- Yes.

436
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,491
I have a kid from my ex,
who is a narcissistic artist...

437
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,838
and verbally abusive.

438
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,874
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

439
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,301
Oh, good.

440
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,168
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

441
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,597
No, of course not.

442
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,261
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning...

443
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,097
and then once we have babies,
we become the mom

444
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,143
and... they get sick of us.

445
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,225
Yeah.

446
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,319
Where do you want to live now, doll?

447
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,939
Well...

448
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,866
I'm here now, obviously.

449
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,486
I don't know
if the show will get picked up, but...

450
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,904
it feels like home.

451
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,284
It is home.

452
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,329
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

453
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,282
You want to stay here?

454
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,210
Charlie's not going to want that. He...

455
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,249
He hates LA.

456
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,458
We're interested in what you want to do.

457
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,345
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

458
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,053
He can do some time here, no?

459
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,513
He always said we would, but he never...

460
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,349
did.

461
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,979
How old is your son?

462
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,307
Henry's eight.

463
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,644
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

464
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,105
He likes LA.

465
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,652
I don't know if it's fair to him.

466
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,735
I want you to listen to me.

467
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,283
What you're doing is an act of hope.

468
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,529
Do you understand that?

469
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,912
Yeah.

470
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,129
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

471
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,960
I do.

472
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,171
And this, right now, is the worst time.

473
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,584
It will only get better.

474
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,057
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

475
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,140
Oh.

476
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,432
I don't know.

477
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,597
I represented his wife in their divorce.

478
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,306
I got her half of that song.

479
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,100
Oh, I don't want any money or anything.

480
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,101
Hmm.

481
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,104
I just worry because we weren't
going to use lawyers, so...

482
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,696
I don't want to be too aggressive.

483
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,664
I want to stay friends.

484
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,285
We'll do it as gently as possible.

485
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,622
Now...

486
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,335
Oh.

487
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,120
Can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

488
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,464
Because part of what we're going to do
together is tell your story.

489
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,344
It's difficult to articulate.

490
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,720
It's...

491
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,227
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

492
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,638
I understand.

493
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,099
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

494
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:06,524
Well, uh...

495
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,564
I was engaged to Ben

496
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,404
and living in LA, you know?

497
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,454
And I felt like yes,
I want to make movies and marry Ben.

498
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,372
Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

499
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,536
I never felt older in my whole life.

500
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,874
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

501
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,080
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

502
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,337
or dead-ish.

503
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,335
You know, you tell yourself,

504
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,424
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

505
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,888
Oh, this tea is delicious.

506
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,223
- Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.
- Mm.

507
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,931
Anyway, uh, you were asking about Charlie.

508
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,853
So, um...

509
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,239
So, yes. So, I was... I was...

510
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,395
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

511
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,065
and I went to New York

512
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,447
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

513
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,243
But one where they take space seriously,
like...

514
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,116
sex trafficking in space.

515
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,751
You know, it was political.

516
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,750
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was.

517
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,081
Anyway, it just...

518
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,458
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

519
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,341
Um, but anyway, so...

520
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,842
while I was there...

521
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,419
the producer...

522
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,800
invited me to see a play.

523
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,678
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

524
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,146
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

525
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,278
This strange...

526
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,316
surreal, dystopian story,

527
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,193
and it was so well-acted.

528
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,440
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

529
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,362
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

530
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,741
uh, which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

531
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,416
And then later, of course,
I learned that it was.

532
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:45,915
Mmm.

533
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,302
- These cookies are really great too.
- I'll send you home with some.

534
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,629
Afterwards,
I was introduced to the cast,

535
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,306
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

536
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,637
He talked to me and...

537
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,346
I talked back.

538
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,063
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

539
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,562
And...

540
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,523
it was better than the sex, the talking.

541
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,982
Although the...

542
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,442
the sex was also like the talking.

543
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,869
You know, everything is like everything
in a relationship.

544
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:17,947
Don't you find that?

545
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:19,865
And, um...

546
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,326
So, we spent...

547
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,990
the whole night
and the next day together and...

548
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,663
I just never left.

549
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:32,001
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

550
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,380
But... I just went along with him
and his life

551
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,297
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive.

552
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,932
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star, and...

553
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,437
That felt like something, you know.
People came to see me at first, but...

554
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,557
the farther away I got from that and...

555
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,401
the more acclaim the theater company got,
and I had less and less weight.

556
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,814
I just became...

557
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,409
"Who?"

558
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,739
"Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

559
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:00,873
And he was the draw.

560
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,411
And... that...

561
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,991
would've been fine, but...

562
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,073
I got smaller.

563
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,002
I realized I...

564
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,470
I didn't ever really
come alive for myself.

565
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,303
I was just feeding his aliveness.

566
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:24,555
And...

567
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:26,844
you know...

568
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,229
he was so smart and creative, it...

569
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,895
it was fine.

570
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,850
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private,

571
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,524
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work, and...

572
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,032
For a while, that felt like enough.
I mean, I was just so...

573
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,198
so...

574
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,531
so flattered
that someone like him would...

575
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,790
would find an idea I had worth trying

576
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,333
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

577
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,668
and then, I got pregnant.

578
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,253
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

579
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,758
but also really mine.

580
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,215
And... you know, he was so excited.

581
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,762
So, it was nice.

582
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,345
For a while.

583
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,344
I mean, kids, they...

584
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,976
they belong to themselves. It's like...

585
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,734
the instant they leave your body,
it's just...

586
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,894
the process of them going away...

587
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,562
And I didn't belong to myself.

588
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,071
And it was small stuff, stupid stuff,
and big stuff.

589
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,533
All the furniture in our house

590
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,907
was his taste.

591
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,072
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

592
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,412
because I had never been asked to use it.

593
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,665
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

594
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,661
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA, but...

595
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,002
they came to nothing.

596
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,629
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

597
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,336
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

598
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,306
he'd just put me off.

599
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,886
It would be...

600
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,597
strange if he turned to me and said,

601
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,021
"And what do you want to do today?"

602
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,351
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

603
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,150
and I thought, "Own it.

604
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,819
Just own it.

605
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,527
Be like George Harrison's wife.

606
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,743
Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

607
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,197
Yeah, then I realized
I couldn't remember her name, so...

608
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,996
This pilot came along.

609
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,872
It shot in LA
and it paid so much...

610
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,920
And it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

611
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,171
Here's this bit of earth that's yours,
and...

612
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,673
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

613
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:30,433
yeah, this is who I am,
and this is what I'm worth.

614
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,598
And maybe it's stupid,
but at least it's mine.

615
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:38,689
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

616
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,395
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

617
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,447
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours."

618
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:45,905
Then...

619
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,283
Well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

620
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,534
But...

621
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,327
he made fun of it and...

622
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,080
was jealous like he is, and...

623
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,122
then he realized about the money.

624
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,801
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

625
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,550
And that's when I realized...

626
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,718
he...

627
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,222
truly didn't see me.

628
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,138
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

629
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,438
And I asked him to say my phone number.

630
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,729
He didn't know it.

631
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,273
So, I left.

632
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:23,898
Oh.

633
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,774
Mmm.

634
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,028
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

635
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,489
That fucking asshole.

636
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,740
Seventy-five...

637
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,207
just 70,

638
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,791
those two zeros,

639
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,227
- seventy-five point zero zero...
- "If railroad is unowned...

640
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,544
- that's zero cents.
- ...you may buy it from the bank."

641
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,341
"Advance to Illios...

642
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,676
- Illinois.
- ...Illinois Avenue."

643
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,053
"Advance..." what does that mean?

644
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,260
It means you've got to go
to Illinois Avenue.

645
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,680
So where is Illinois Avenue?

646
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,767
That one.

647
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,866
So Cassie,
when Charlie gets here,

648
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,415
you're going to hand him the envelope.

649
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,111
Why do I have to do it?

650
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:06,233
Because Nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her.

651
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,780
That's not what this is.

652
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,984
I wiped her butt
until she was nine years old.

653
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,283
She's very seductive that way.

654
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,158
No, Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

655
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,455
But still, what I'm saying is true.

656
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,419
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

657
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,227
Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

658
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,384
Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal.
Where's Henry?

659
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,544
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

660
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,861
Let's get them upstairs.
Charlie's going to be here soon.

661
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:31,926
Sam, go upstairs.

662
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,221
So, I'll tell Charlie
what's happening,

663
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,227
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

664
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,308
Okay...

665
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,597
I just get nervous.

666
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,897
Well, can you un-serve?

667
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:45,059
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

668
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,449
- I think so.
- You should check.

669
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,239
- In case we change our minds...
- I'm not going to change my mind.

670
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,049
- ...or we feel too bad for him.
- Maybe in case I do something wrong.

671
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,995
Now you're both
just making me feel bad, okay?

672
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,456
Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

673
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,327
Well, we all are.

674
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,205
And we love Charlie.

675
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,171
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

676
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,081
You can't be friends with him anymore.

677
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,581
Charlie and I have our own relationship...

678
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,833
...independent of your marriage.

679
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,633
Just like I'm still friends

680
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,588
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

681
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,048
Are you still seeing Jeff?

682
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,260
An occasional lunch.

683
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,598
I can't believe you!

684
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,513
He still wants his camera back,
by the way.

685
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,733
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

686
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,855
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

687
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,311
- Okay.
- And...

688
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,111
stop seeing Jeff!

689
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,493
Cassie, you're the server.

690
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,905
Just let me practice a few times.

691
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,955
I was never a good auditioner.

692
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,788
- That's because you wanted it too badly.
- It's not an audition.

693
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,665
- I'll play Charlie.
- It's just my palms are so perspired.

694
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,124
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

695
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,163
Maybe Nicole should play you.

696
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,415
Did you really just say that?

697
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,668
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

698
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,239
Did we finish the other wine already?

699
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,403
Yeah.

700
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,478
Oh!

701
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,385
- Oh.
- Okay, let me get him.

702
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,991
- Okay.
- You both go in the other room.

703
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,768
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

704
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:03,853
Happening now.

705
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,733
- Mom!
- I'm getting my wine.

706
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,438
What?

707
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,276
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

708
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,962
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

709
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,359
- I think it's mid-poop.
- Just grab him when he comes out.

710
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,659
- Cassie?
- What?

711
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:20,074
I'm... I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

712
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,291
Copy you.

713
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,505
- Hi.
- Hi.

714
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,758
- Where's Henry?
- Uh, he's pooping.

715
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,464
Hi, Henry!

716
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,055
Does this couch still open?

717
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah.

718
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,352
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

719
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,521
Okay.

720
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,273
I won a MacArthur grant.

721
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:47,688
Charlie!

722
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,321
Oh, my God, that's great!

723
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,569
Congratulations.

724
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,823
I'll say it because you can't,
it's the genius grant. You're a genius.

725
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,905
Oh, I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

726
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,490
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

727
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,574
Thank you, but...

728
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,952
it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

729
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:03,834
I'm starving.

730
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,075
It's good money,
and they parse it out over five years.

731
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,686
But it means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

732
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,752
pay my credit card debt.

733
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:10,955
So great.

734
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,798
Of course, I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

735
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,383
- Now my first Broadway play has to fail."
- No.

736
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,468
We just started rehearsals again,
and I don't know.

737
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,906
You always don't know at this point,
and then, it gets there.

738
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,431
Do I? Because I don't remember.

739
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,606
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

740
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,185
Okay, I hope you're right.

741
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,358
- Everyone says hi.
- Oh.

742
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,194
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

743
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,276
You'll see them again
when you come back.

744
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,480
A MacArthur, Broadway...

745
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,982
It's so exciting.

746
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,202
Congratulations, Charlie.

747
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,038
Which bathroom?

748
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,251
- What?
- Is he pooping?

749
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,712
Oh, uh, downstairs.

750
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,880
Is your mom home?

751
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,638
Yeah, she's upstairs.

752
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,646
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

753
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:02,970
- It's me.
- I know.

754
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,014
- I just got here.
- Hi.

755
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,700
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

756
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,438
Mom's getting me a present too.

757
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,609
- Why?
- For pooping.

758
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:12,815
Oh.

759
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,270
- I love you.
- I love you.

760
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,318
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

761
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,736
Oh, I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

762
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:24,496
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

763
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,458
Oh! No! Stop it!

764
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,168
Oh, God, I'm huge!

765
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,329
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

766
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,757
- Why didn't you respond to my last email?
- Well, your emails are so articulate.

767
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,438
I get intimidated.

768
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,757
- Mom, can you...
- Now, I'm going to lift you!

769
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,433
Mom?

770
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,511
Mom?

771
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,847
- Mom?
- What?

772
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,011
Upstairs.

773
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,559
Oh.

774
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,343
I'm going to write you back now.

775
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,484
Cassie?

776
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,233
Hey, Charlie.

777
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,567
I like your haircut.

778
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,028
Oh, thanks.

779
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,204
- Mom?
- I'll go.

780
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,611
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

781
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,700
I hear him.

782
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,112
What's going on, Henry?

783
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,825
Can you ask Mom to come?

784
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:12,833
He wants you.

785
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,296
What kind of pie is that?

786
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:20,925
It's...

787
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,513
pecan.

788
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,559
- Did you make it?
- I don't know.

789
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,346
No, it's store bought.

790
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,312
You know Joan's on Third?

791
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,447
- Oh, yeah. It's good, right?
- What?

792
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,892
The store? Yeah.

793
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,234
Jules and Molly love it.

794
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,739
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

795
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,905
I'm just hot!

796
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,704
Uh, I'll pour you some water.

797
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,822
Nicole says you're doing a play?

798
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,454
I-I think you'd like it.

799
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:54,121
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

800
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,561
- So, you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

801
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,627
- It's more northern England.
- Oh.

802
00:38:58,712 --> 00:38:59,833
What does that sound like?

803
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,719
Ooh, you want a cup of tea, do ya?

804
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,883
Right. Good.

805
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:12,596
Oh, thank you, missus. What is...

806
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,641
What's this?

807
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,859
Oh, it's a manila envelope, love.

808
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,334
- Ooh, can I start over?
- It has my name on it.

809
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,359
Ooh.

810
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,197
Oh.

811
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,653
Jesus.

812
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,114
Sorry. You're served.

813
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,997
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

814
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,119
I can't lie.

815
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,668
You're being served.

816
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,503
You guys are getting a div...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

817
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,595
I was going to warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

818
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,480
I feel like I'm in a dream.

819
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,909
We don't have a marriage anymore.

820
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,622
I-I know you don't want the disruption,
but you don't want to be married.

821
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,541
Not... really.

822
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,958
But I don't want this.

823
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,125
What did you expect was going to happen?

824
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,176
I... I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

825
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,812
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

826
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,604
I want...

827
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:36,725
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

828
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,972
I want...

829
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,646
an entirely different kind of life.

830
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,074
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

831
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,154
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

832
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,175
- Nora's known for being very fair.
- We don't need to do it with envelopes.

833
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,030
- This is Nora?
- Yeah.

834
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,238
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

835
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,538
- Why do I feel like that won't happen?
- It's just a formality.

836
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,433
- Why...
- You don't have to respond right away.

837
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,958
Why did Cassie have a pie?

838
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,844
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

839
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,750
Are you sure?

840
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,040
I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?

841
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,543
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

842
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,758
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

843
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,855
So, what...

844
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,972
What do I do?

845
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,858
You get a lawyer too.

846
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,907
"Well, I guess
I better be going.

847
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,240
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

848
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,453
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

849
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,122
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

850
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:42,584
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

851
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:44,458
the way seemed long...

852
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,795
but the sky was bright.

853
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,504
And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

854
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,144
I forgot it ended that way.

855
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:59,688
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

856
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,187
He was upset about his boat.

857
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,067
Dad, you go away.

858
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,073
Mom, you stay.

859
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:14,409
- Hey, Daddy just got here.
- It's okay.

860
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:16,826
Love you.

861
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:24,828
You can come back, and wake me up,
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

862
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,336
Okay.

863
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,925
Will you come sleep
in my bed later?

864
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,008
Yeah.

865
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,186
Oh.

866
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,523
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

867
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:45,689
Thanks, G-ma.

868
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,677
- He's in a mommy phase right now.
- It's okay.

869
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,852
Whoo!

870
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,031
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

871
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,154
- I can imagine.
- And didn't eat dinner.

872
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,567
Stressful time.

873
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,864
I hope Henry didn't notice.

874
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,948
I'm sure he didn't.

875
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,672
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

876
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,342
were probably drunk all the time with me.

877
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,370
Yeah.

878
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,582
I'm sorry again.

879
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:45,374
Thanks.

880
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,589
Where are you staying?

881
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,962
Oh, well, I...

882
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:55,549
hadn't...

883
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,722
I guess I'll...

884
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,392
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

885
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,691
supposedly not too expensive
and... and pretty nice.

886
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,818
Oh, okay, I'll check it out.

887
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,693
Again, that's great
about the MacArthur.

888
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,070
Thanks.

889
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,163
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

890
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:29,876
Thanks.

891
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:37,922
Fuck.

892
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,263
- What?
- She's being represented by Nora.

893
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,757
She's supposedly very fair?

894
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,639
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

895
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:48,270
I charge $950 an hour.

896
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,814
Ted is 400.

897
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,944
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

898
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,279
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

899
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,382
- That's more than I can...
- And all your financials.

900
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,947
We need to do a forensic accounting.

901
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,536
Which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

902
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,877
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad,

903
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:10,289
- right?
- You were married here in LA?

904
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,667
Yes... because her mom and sister
are out here

905
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,425
- and I'm not close with my family.
- Your son was born out here?

906
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:19,008
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not...

907
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,634
So, you got married here,

908
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,471
your kid was born here...

909
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,357
and she served you here?

910
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,223
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

911
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,227
Why?

912
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:33,064
- Is there a problem?
- We'll have to reshape the narrative.

913
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,981
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

914
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,700
this is what I suggest.

915
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,661
You take your kid...
D-Did you say his name was Fred?

916
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,237
Henry.

917
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:44,246
Henry?

918
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,537
Why did I say Fred?

919
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,120
I have a kid named Fred.

920
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:50,747
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

921
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,134
Then we file an action in New York.

922
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,579
We make this a New York case.

923
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:57,147
We need to make an argument
that you're a New York-based family.

924
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,002
Well, we are.

925
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,012
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

926
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,764
Really? No.

927
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,057
It's very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid.

928
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,343
As soon as you let your wife and child
leave New York,

929
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:12,266
you made life very difficult for yourself.

930
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,605
Yes, but as I said,

931
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,150
we're a New York family,
that's just a fact.

932
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:19,027
She's... here temporarily.

933
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,908
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

934
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:26,706
I don't... know,
but Henry wants to go back to New York.

935
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,747
Don't quote your kid.

936
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,710
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

937
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:35,462
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

938
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,045
Let me have the Barber file!

939
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,340
It's right here.

940
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,335
Move my lunch to 1:30.

941
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:45,929
What's...

942
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,473
"Exit Goat"?

943
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,524
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

944
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,603
You're a director?

945
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,395
Theater director, yeah.

946
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,192
- Anything I've seen?
- I don't know. What have you seen?

947
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,859
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

948
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:04,954
which is exciting.

949
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,243
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

950
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,961
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

951
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,079
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

952
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,127
I wonder, do we ask for support?

953
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:18,256
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

954
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,718
I'm not going to do that.

955
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,835
Does your wife's family have money?

956
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:26,054
Uh, her mother has some
from her TV career.

957
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,477
And her father died.

958
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,978
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

959
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,640
draw her into the case.

960
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,850
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

961
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,314
No.

962
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,362
I'm very close to her mom.

963
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:43,697
- Nicole's family has been my family...
- Yeah, but that's going to change.

964
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,569
And I suggest you get used to it.

965
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,114
- We need to hire a private investigator.
- Really? I mean...

966
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,203
- Really?
- Does your wife do drugs or anything?

967
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,289
Coke?

968
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:56,955
Not in any real way.

969
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,046
Well, we're not going to win
if she's the perfect mother.

970
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,010
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

971
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:06,598
It wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

972
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,468
Have you noticed anyone following you?

973
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,554
No.

974
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:12,135
Well, keep an eye out.

975
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,396
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

976
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:18,570
that Nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

977
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,275
- But I'm not.
- You live in New York.

978
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,029
You're consumed with your work.

979
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:26,940
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

980
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,403
Nora's going to use that strategy.
I'm sure of it.

981
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:31,693
But Nicole's not going to lie.

982
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,626
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

983
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,996
and they start from a place of crazy,

984
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,125
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

985
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,091
Which is still crazy.

986
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,752
Half of crazy is crazy.

987
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,901
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best,

988
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,007
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

989
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,926
Before this is all over,
you're going to hate me and Ted,

990
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,646
just because of what we represent
in your life.

991
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:55,725
I'm sure you're right.

992
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,311
So tell me the story again.
You came out here to see your kid.

993
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,540
- Maybe I'm not explaining this well.
- She serves you.

994
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:02,249
- We're friendly, we're fine.
- What a bitch.

995
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,460
We're just trying to figure this out.
She's not a bitch.

996
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,735
Thanks, but this isn't...

997
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,150
We're doing it a different way.

998
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,241
And... I can't even close to afford this.

999
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:14,489
I've got to get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

1000
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,211
I was the hot shit at that time.

1001
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:27,258
Young, very sexy,
with a great head of hair.

1002
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,963
I just so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

1003
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,473
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

1004
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:34,105
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

1005
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,762
And they put Henry in school out there.

1006
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,050
Well, is Charlie moving too?

1007
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,222
Not Charlie.

1008
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,521
He won't abandon us.

1009
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:41,224
And you can't do theater in LA.

1010
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,695
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

1011
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,525
when she finishes filming her show.

1012
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,020
I wouldn't be so sure.

1013
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,023
Nicole was never going to stay
in New York, that was obvious.

1014
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,115
She was probably
planning this move all along.

1015
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,532
When she sees an opportunity,
believe me, she takes it.

1016
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,741
Well, LA is nice.

1017
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,073
The space.

1018
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,326
Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

1019
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,498
Okay, how is everyone today?

1020
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,798
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

1021
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,633
- Sorry, Charlie.
- I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

1022
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,427
so I might have to step out.

1023
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:14,968
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

1024
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,347
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

1025
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,594
Thanks, Frank.

1026
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:21,187
- Another thing.
- Yeah?

1027
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:25,810
Fuck as many people
as you can right now.

1028
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:28,101
Women, men.

1029
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:31,338
- Take what I said seriously.
- You might need help wrapping gauze.

1030
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,075
- It needs to stay tight.
- Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

1031
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,319
What... scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

1032
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,361
No, that's my Halloween costume.

1033
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,995
And the Frankenstein
is for Henry.

1034
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:43,950
He's coming here this weekend.

1035
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,872
We're going to trick or treat
in the Slope.

1036
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,252
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

1037
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,089
- Perfect.
- Can I talk to you?

1038
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,510
Yeah, over...

1039
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,548
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

1040
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:59,440
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

1041
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,437
Where'd you find it?

1042
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,100
- The library, duh.
- Ha!

1043
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:05,639
Can I come over tonight?

1044
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,893
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

1045
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,065
I just can't be with anyone right now.

1046
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:14,075
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

1047
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,425
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

1048
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,492
I'm not not married yet.

1049
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:21,705
You're torturing yourself.

1050
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:23,867
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

1051
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,126
- I'm relying on you, okay?
- Fine.

1052
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,793
- Thanks.
- I wish you'd accept generosity better.

1053
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,130
Uh, hold on. Let me...

1054
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,511
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

1055
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:34,839
Yes.

1056
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,728
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

1057
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,675
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

1058
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,845
- Hi.
- Do you have an attorney yet?

1059
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:41,773
No.

1060
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,411
Okay, then it's okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

1061
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,436
Okay.

1062
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,933
I'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

1063
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,490
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

1064
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,651
You're going to need
to file your response.

1065
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,367
- Nicole said there was no rush.
- It's been more than 30 days

1066
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,451
since you were served.

1067
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,376
By law, you're meant to respond
within 30 days.

1068
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,893
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

1069
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,475
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

1070
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:07,370
Did you read it?

1071
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,220
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

1072
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,045
We weren't even going to do it
with lawyers.

1073
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,298
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

1074
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:17,361
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

1075
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:20,572
- It comes out during the love scene.
- Could you hold a second? What love scene?

1076
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:21,928
When I hug Beth.

1077
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,057
You don't hug Beth.

1078
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,431
I think it's something we should explore.

1079
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:28,391
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

1080
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,361
I also have a kind of a thing

1081
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,782
- about, uh, tucking things in.
- Charlie?

1082
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,398
If you don't file your response,

1083
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,968
we're going to file a request
for default judgment against you.

1084
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,864
...insecurities about my figure.

1085
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,160
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

1086
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,414
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

1087
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,597
We'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

1088
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,493
W-What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

1089
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,994
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

1090
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:50,915
We...

1091
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,845
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

1092
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:55,643
She can have
pretty much whatever she wants.

1093
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,778
And it means we'll set the number
for child support at its highest level

1094
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:00,673
and claim full custody of your child.

1095
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:03,765
Full custody?

1096
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,149
- I mean, that's not even...
- This is what the law says.

1097
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,896
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

1098
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,983
No, Charlie, I represent Nicole,

1099
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:16,359
and she's aware of everything
I'm saying to you.

1100
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,766
I just spoke to her this morning.

1101
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:21,024
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on the call.

1102
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,453
Okay, so what do I do?

1103
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,839
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

1104
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:31,287
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

1105
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,127
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

1106
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,173
- I don't know where "here" is.
- New York.

1107
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,596
Ah!
That's what all that honking is?

1108
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,341
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

1109
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,385
I'm rehearsing a...

1110
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,761
If you don't respond in Los Angeles
by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

1111
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,469
Wh... Which line?

1112
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,854
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

1113
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,794
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

1114
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,342
- I thought the plane landed at nine.
- What are you wearing?

1115
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,428
Sock pants.

1116
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,187
It did. What are sock pants?

1117
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:28,186
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

1118
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,097
He dressed himself.

1119
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,536
- There are long pants. Can I talk to you?
- It's almost noon.

1120
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,442
There was traffic. We've got to get going.

1121
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,208
- Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
- Henry, can you wait a minute?

1122
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,483
No talking alone.

1123
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,779
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

1124
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,610
I got a call from your lawyer.

1125
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,198
She said you'd take everything and...

1126
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,285
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

1127
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,210
It's better if we just
let the lawyers do this.

1128
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:51,367
Yeah, but she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

1129
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,117
Henry, we need to get going.

1130
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,668
I don't want to go now.

1131
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,104
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
- That's what I'm here to do.

1132
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,679
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

1133
00:54:58,754 --> 00:54:59,926
I have three more clues.

1134
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,609
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

1135
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,725
- Cool
- You were late. We were killing time.

1136
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,185
Honey, come. We're going to finish
the treasure hunt later.

1137
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,845
- I'm going to be rich!
- Okay.

1138
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:11,160
You're going to go with your daddy,
it's going to be fun.

1139
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:14,437
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

1140
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:16,514
He's not going to the dentist.

1141
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,526
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm staying here.

1142
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,608
Come on.

1143
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:24,447
Henry?

1144
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,413
- Got the booster?
- I have a booster.

1145
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:35,828
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

1146
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:37,210
What's not in?

1147
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,545
The seat's not connected.

1148
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,345
I asked the rental company to install it.

1149
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:47,178
Yeah, I think they can't
for liability reasons.

1150
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,656
- Do you know how these things...
- Let me just... If you...

1151
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,393
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- ...dig...

1152
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,687
Ow! Fuck!

1153
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,564
- Why "fuck?"
- Something sharp.

1154
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,031
- Can't I stay with Mom?
- No.

1155
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,151
Why not?

1156
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,238
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

1157
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,192
I don't want to.

1158
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,781
Henry, get in the fucking car!

1159
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:12,203
I'm sorry, but Jesus,
get in the fucking car.

1160
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,453
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

1161
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,916
That's two words.
What does Lego start with?

1162
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,046
Just tell me.

1163
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,441
- Don't you want to learn it?
- No.

1164
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,846
- It's on the box, anyway.
- L...

1165
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:26,926
Then what?

1166
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:29,885
E... You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

1167
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:30,892
Hi.

1168
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:31,852
Then what?

1169
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,472
A "g-g-g" sound.

1170
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,519
- Are you excited for Halloween?
- J?

1171
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:36,432
G.

1172
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,181
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

1173
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:40,393
- O?
- Are you excited for Halloween?

1174
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,402
Yeah.

1175
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,984
I brought both our costumes.

1176
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,359
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

1177
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,576
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

1178
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,827
I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

1179
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:50,908
Are you sure?

1180
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,617
Maybe just look at it.

1181
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:56,794
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

1182
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,874
Mom bought me a ninja costume,

1183
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,665
which is better because it costs more.

1184
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,344
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

1185
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,553
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

1186
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,883
The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

1187
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,808
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

1188
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:14,472
Okay.

1189
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:15,558
Whatever you want.

1190
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,816
Please take the ticket.

1191
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,838
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

1192
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,525
Please take the ticket.

1193
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,539
So, I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

1194
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,811
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

1195
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:43,836
I've been here.

1196
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:47,420
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

1197
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,547
I remember those fish.

1198
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,098
A lot of fish look the same.

1199
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,679
Can I help you?

1200
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:56,224
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

1201
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,059
Oh, hi. Where's your little man?

1202
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:01,305
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

1203
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,688
Okay.

1204
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,024
Oh, okay.

1205
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:07,155
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

1206
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,027
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

1207
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:12,275
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

1208
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:14,617
on the 7th of August about representation.

1209
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,785
B-But she hired somebody else.

1210
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,202
- Uh... Nora...
- Fanshaw?

1211
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:22,020
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

1212
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,085
he's legally barred from representing you.

1213
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:25,634
Oh.

1214
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,353
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

1215
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,386
- It happens all the time.
- Really?

1216
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:32,758
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

1217
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:34,303
Oh.

1218
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:37,449
You know, it's common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible

1219
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,395
so that their spouse has limited options.

1220
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,517
Oh, I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

1221
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,941
You'd be surprised.

1222
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,729
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

1223
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,523
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

1224
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,741
Not so many.

1225
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,364
Like 11.

1226
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,282
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

1227
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,538
I need somebody today.

1228
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,331
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

1229
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:03,308
I didn't know who else to call.
There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

1230
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,463
I have a name for you.

1231
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,373
Bert Spitz.

1232
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,214
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberto's agency.

1233
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,505
Great.

1234
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:16,055
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

1235
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,137
and he went into family law.

1236
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,053
- I called him.
- Thank you, G-ma.

1237
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,813
- He can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

1238
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,019
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

1239
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,457
You got it. I love you.

1240
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,482
- Aw.
- Dad!

1241
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,107
- I need a new burger.
- Why?

1242
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:35,488
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

1243
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,363
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

1244
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:42,405
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

1245
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,408
Because I've been away
and want to see you.

1246
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:48,469
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

1247
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:51,046
named, um, Lily Tuber.

1248
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,422
- Yeah.
- And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

1249
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:54,508
Uh-huh.

1250
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:59,430
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

1251
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,980
It's like a death without a body.

1252
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:08,437
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

1253
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,144
You've been divorced four times?

1254
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:11,354
Married four times.

1255
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,936
Three divorces.

1256
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:16,319
This last one will stick, God willing.

1257
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,787
That's why I graduated into family law,

1258
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,327
to help people survive this painful time.

1259
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,290
Here's how I see it.

1260
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:28,669
If we get bogged down
in "who did this," and "who did that,"

1261
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,433
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

1262
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:33,134
it'll just cost you more money
and time and...

1263
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,264
emotional stress,

1264
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:37,763
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

1265
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:38,844
Right.

1266
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,967
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

1267
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,138
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

1268
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,598
You know, most people in my business
make up the truth

1269
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,167
so they can get where they need to go.

1270
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,820
You're just transactions to them.

1271
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:53,781
I-I like to think of you as people.

1272
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,651
Oh, okay, good.

1273
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,198
And not just you, her too.

1274
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,110
Yes.

1275
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,329
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

1276
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:03,080
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

1277
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,740
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1278
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:06,289
Um...

1279
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:09,245
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

1280
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,334
Of course you do.

1281
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:14,922
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

1282
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,636
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

1283
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,470
And keep in mind,
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

1284
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,005
Oh. I didn't...

1285
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,470
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

1286
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,141
It doesn't make sense, does it?

1287
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,573
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

1288
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:36,525
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

1289
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,572
- It seems ridiculous.
- Oh, it is.

1290
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:39,988
It is, boy.

1291
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,366
We'll have to respond right away.

1292
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,665
Your son goes to school out here?

1293
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,997
Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

1294
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:52,039
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her,

1295
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,248
as she's often felt
we do things on my terms.

1296
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:56,589
Be a better husband in divorce.

1297
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,595
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

1298
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,600
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

1299
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,139
the court may see it differently.

1300
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,263
Will we go to court?

1301
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:07,350
No, no, we don't want to go to court.

1302
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,517
The courts in California are a disaster.

1303
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:11,644
No, that's just how
we have to think about it.

1304
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,897
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

1305
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:15,984
Where are you living while you're here?

1306
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,368
I'm in a hotel right now.

1307
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,654
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

1308
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,197
- To who?
- The court.

1309
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,200
You just said
we weren't going to go to court.

1310
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,562
No, of course, of course.

1311
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:26,118
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

1312
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,202
Okay.

1313
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,997
You should get a place in LA.

1314
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:32,170
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

1315
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,542
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

1316
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:36,539
I-I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

1317
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:37,630
Don't rent it.

1318
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:40,215
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

1319
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,431
And of course, if you have a place in LA,

1320
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,892
it's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

1321
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,971
So...

1322
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:48,010
what do I do?

1323
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,474
I recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son.

1324
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:54,347
Many people fight for that time,

1325
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,849
then they don't even use it.

1326
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:57,600
They just want to win.

1327
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,411
This shouldn't be
that complicated, right?

1328
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,107
I mean, we're a New York family.

1329
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,865
I think it's all
pretty straightforward. Right?

1330
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,990
I hope so, yes.

1331
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,362
I see no reason...

1332
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,252
You both love your child.

1333
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,420
You respect each other.

1334
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,922
Why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

1335
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,083
Right.

1336
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,082
I think you have my glasses.

1337
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,761
That makes sense.

1338
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,473
- What have you been doing?
- Reading this magazine.

1339
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:29,517
You were reading California Lawyer?

1340
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:30,439
Yeah.

1341
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,188
Okay, I'm almost done.

1342
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,694
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

1343
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,489
- What kind of pet do you want?
- I don't know...

1344
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:43,320
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

1345
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,205
and whatever we win or lose...

1346
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:48,704
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

1347
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,411
Thank you.

1348
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:54,331
You're the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

1349
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,972
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

1350
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,971
Come! Come! Come! Come! Oh!

1351
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,635
You have fun with Daddy?

1352
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:11,844
- We drove around to offices.
- Oh.

1353
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,775
Do you want to see your ninja costume?
It's on G-ma's bed.

1354
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,103
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1355
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,893
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

1356
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:22,485
with the plugs and...

1357
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:25,010
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that...

1358
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,902
But he and I had decided together.

1359
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,671
Oh, well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

1360
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:31,177
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

1361
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,204
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

1362
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:35,623
I'll try.

1363
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,083
What's the...

1364
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,169
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

1365
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,302
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.

1366
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,173
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

1367
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:48,514
You don't like it?

1368
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:51,887
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

1369
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,937
Oh, sorry, it's just absurd.

1370
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,642
Is everything okay?

1371
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,360
Yeah. Why?

1372
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:03,398
You seem, I don't know,
like something is...

1373
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:04,615
Everything's fine.

1374
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,323
Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel,

1375
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,368
but I should be able to get to you guys
by 5:00, 5:30...

1376
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,912
We're going to Cassie's
in Pasadena

1377
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,706
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

1378
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:16,949
Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

1379
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,291
Yes. She and Sam moved there
a couple months ago.

1380
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,776
Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

1381
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,813
- I'll figure it out. What's the address?
- My mom is looking forward to it...

1382
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,839
- I'll text Sam.
- ...and Cassie and Sam are mad.

1383
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,254
- Mad at who?
- You.

1384
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,503
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

1385
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,805
So, I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens.

1386
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,409
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

1387
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,785
- Let's do it this way this time.
- Do you not want me there?

1388
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:37,680
I'm fine with it.

1389
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,730
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

1390
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,143
He'll have two Halloweens.

1391
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:45,437
What am I going to do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

1392
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:49,239
Maybe the hotel has something. Or you can
drive to a different neighborhood.

1393
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,779
The sun sets forever.

1394
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,960
There shall never be another dawn.

1395
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,084
No!

1396
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:05,460
Lady...

1397
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:08,966
I require the solace of the shadows...

1398
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,349
and the dark!

1399
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:33,821
Okay, ready for Halloween?

1400
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:36,286
- Hi.
- Wow, elaborate.

1401
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:39,305
Sweetheart, don't forget to wear
your jacket. It's getting colder.

1402
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,474
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

1403
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,976
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

1404
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,001
He does.

1405
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:46,463
Uh, some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

1406
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:48,690
You can keep that Bear-Bear,
because I got another one.

1407
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:50,395
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

1408
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,926
- It was his idea.
- David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

1409
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,553
Let's Dance.

1410
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,840
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

1411
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:00,768
Have fun.

1412
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:05,903
Go pee and then we're going back out.

1413
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,876
I'm too tired.

1414
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,442
Go pee, and then
we're going to go drive to Halloween.

1415
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,703
This block looks promising.

1416
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:14,820
I wish Halloween was over.

1417
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,318
Well, it isn't.

1418
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,991
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

1419
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,205
But I like that we're sitting right now.
I like to sit.

1420
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:26,038
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

1421
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:29,001
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

1422
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,178
Because you get to sit?

1423
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,377
No, because I like my friends here better.

1424
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,681
That's not true.

1425
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,807
What about Horatio and Poppy?

1426
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:38,889
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

1427
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,689
And I don't like Poppy.

1428
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,522
Here, I have Axel.

1429
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:45,353
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

1430
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,736
And my family's here.

1431
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:49,942
Besides you.

1432
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,132
Everyone's asleep.

1433
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:11,690
I need to pee!

1434
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:19,827
Who gave you a lighter?

1435
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,077
Lift the seat.

1436
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,415
I'm going to have to go back to New York
on Monday.

1437
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,961
Did you flush?

1438
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:41,762
Wash your hands.

1439
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,972
Will you play with me?

1440
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,475
I'm tired, honey.

1441
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,945
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

1442
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:04,164
Ah, watch out!
Whoosh! I'm falling!

1443
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:09,494
You didn't catch me.

1444
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,418
Okay?

1445
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,503
Why aren't you here more?

1446
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:19,041
I have to work.

1447
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,384
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

1448
01:10:22,094 --> 01:10:24,046
Is it because you don't want to be
near Mom?

1449
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,219
No. You know,
like we talked about,

1450
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,859
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

1451
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:30,555
but we both want to be with you.

1452
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,767
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

1453
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,156
Well, we all still live in New York.

1454
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,658
Yeah, but I go to school here.

1455
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,370
Just for right now.

1456
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,661
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

1457
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,163
Remember all those kids in buckets?

1458
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:47,414
I like my school here,

1459
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:50,037
and Mom says we could stay here
if we want.

1460
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:52,958
What do you mean?

1461
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:56,003
She said that?

1462
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:57,254
Yeah.

1463
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,932
Vroom.

1464
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:07,973
Aah!

1465
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,324
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

1466
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,180
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

1467
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,455
Have your lawyer call Nora.

1468
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:33,871
I want to talk about it as us.

1469
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:34,958
Who the fuck is "us"?

1470
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:37,124
Let's just get in a room,
you and me.

1471
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,751
That's what we always said we'd do.

1472
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:41,232
- My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
- It's our divorce.

1473
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,468
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

1474
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,798
What am I walking into?

1475
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:47,267
What are you walking into?

1476
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,977
Yes, what the fuck is going on?!

1477
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:52,689
I read your fucking emails, Charlie!
I read them all.

1478
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,868
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

1479
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:56,497
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

1480
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,194
- You fucked Mary Ann!
- It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

1481
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:00,946
All this bullshit about working on us.

1482
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:02,898
You know what? I have been working.

1483
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,647
I've been doing the work alone.

1484
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,069
How did you read my emails?

1485
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,538
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

1486
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:09,747
I think that's illegal!

1487
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,409
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

1488
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,157
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

1489
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,409
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

1490
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,461
Surprise! I want things
that aren't what you want,

1491
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,423
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

1492
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:23,585
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

1493
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,305
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

1494
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:26,975
I am conflating, motherfucker!

1495
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:28,513
You watch me conflate!

1496
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,347
Did you just stamp your foot?

1497
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,602
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

1498
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,863
- You look like you needed one.
- Yes, I do, thanks.

1499
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:46,905
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

1500
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:48,865
That's exciting, I guess.

1501
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:52,749
- What are you so angry about?
- My fucking ex-husband.

1502
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,619
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

1503
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:57,707
It's pointless.

1504
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,048
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

1505
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,264
Oh, hey, Pablo. Uh, we met at...

1506
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:06,381
- You held the bounce board.
- The flirty grip.

1507
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,425
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
- What?

1508
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,769
- I want you to finger me.
- What?

1509
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,721
- Just finger me.
- Okay.

1510
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,642
That's all we're going to do,
just fingering. Okay?

1511
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,024
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

1512
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:31,696
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

1513
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:34,947
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

1514
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:36,868
and Nicole works in Hollywood

1515
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:39,547
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

1516
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,750
with classes of swim, art,

1517
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,628
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

1518
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,672
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

1519
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:54,144
and to the extent that Charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time,

1520
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,515
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

1521
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,392
Nora, you seem to be
ignoring the fact

1522
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,650
that they lived in New York for ten years.

1523
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,189
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

1524
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:08,578
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

1525
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:12,325
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

1526
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:13,698
to spend time with her family,

1527
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,245
who all live in LA.

1528
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,745
She and Charlie were married in LA.

1529
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,817
Would you like to see the photos?

1530
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,784
No, I don't need to see the photos.

1531
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,382
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

1532
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,629
It's my client's expectation

1533
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,383
that after this TV show is completed,

1534
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,429
the parties will move back to New York

1535
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,302
where they currently keep an apartment.

1536
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,510
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

1537
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:40,892
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles during the marriage.

1538
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,900
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

1539
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,864
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

1540
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:51,238
In fact, a few years ago,

1541
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,912
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

1542
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,664
that would have taken his work
and his family

1543
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,080
to Los Angeles for a year.

1544
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,542
And he, um...

1545
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,665
turned it down.

1546
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,211
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

1547
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:10,428
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

1548
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,639
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

1549
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:16,181
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

1550
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:19,346
Now, while I understand
Charlie lives in New York...

1551
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,726
and when it's convenient to his work
schedule, he flies out to see his son...

1552
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,274
He flies out here every chance he gets,
at great expense.

1553
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:28,568
I don't see any reason
you can't be out here full time.

1554
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,211
He makes his living in New York.

1555
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:32,777
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
- Good idea.

1556
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,864
I'll order now so it'll come
when we're all hungry.

1557
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:35,948
Yeah. Mm.

1558
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,094
- Everyone good with Manny's?
- I'd love Manny's.

1559
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:39,119
Mm-hmm.

1560
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:40,412
Have you had Manny's?

1561
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,075
Oh, you'll love it.

1562
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:44,786
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

1563
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,376
I'll have the BLT.

1564
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,460
Dad?

1565
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,045
Turkey.

1566
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,543
I'll have the BLT.

1567
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,624
- You'll have the kale?
- Kale salad.

1568
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:02,892
Uh...

1569
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,698
I don't know, sorry.

1570
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,363
Charlie will have, um...

1571
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:18,283
the Greek salad,

1572
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,453
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

1573
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:22,367
Okay.

1574
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:24,866
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

1575
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:25,957
Thank you.

1576
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,505
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

1577
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:33,630
Oh, thank you.

1578
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:35,046
He's a genius.

1579
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:39,177
Well, I told Nicole
I loved your play.

1580
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,973
- Ah. Really.
- Oh, thanks.

1581
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:43,270
You are one smart cookie.

1582
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:45,480
Oh, thanks.

1583
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,812
I would just love to...

1584
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,238
crawl inside that brain.

1585
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:54,942
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast, smell.

1586
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,828
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

1587
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,369
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

1588
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,452
Thank you.

1589
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,205
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

1590
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,081
They couldn't smell the toast.

1591
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,089
It was so emotional.

1592
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:13,590
It's very competitive, I imagine.

1593
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,551
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

1594
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:21,928
Nicole, of course, agrees
that it will be best for Henry

1595
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:24,721
that he see each parent equally.

1596
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:30,312
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

1597
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:32,859
- Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.
- Mmm.

1598
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,981
I love it too.

1599
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:38,110
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

1600
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:42,410
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

1601
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,794
It was very clearly their deal

1602
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:48,162
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

1603
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:49,799
I'm not aware of any deal.

1604
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,295
Well, I didn't get it in writing.

1605
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,216
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

1606
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,753
that you Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

1607
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,677
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

1608
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:05,855
But...

1609
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:08,815
So, it's a deal
when it's something you want

1610
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,015
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

1611
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:15,317
Sidebar...

1612
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:19,199
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

1613
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:20,119
Sure.

1614
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,118
- Can you, um...
- I can show you.

1615
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:23,658
Come on.

1616
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:32,420
- Nora is a very good lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

1617
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:34,916
- Tough, right?
- Yeah.

1618
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:38,386
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

1619
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:40,257
and rent an apartment to see your son.

1620
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:42,043
- You told me to do that.
- I know that.

1621
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,388
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

1622
01:18:45,472 --> 01:18:48,054
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

1623
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,472
And a judge might look at it that way.

1624
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,773
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

1625
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:55,857
No, because then it would look
to the court

1626
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,812
like you don't care about seeing your son.

1627
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,063
Court or no court? Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

1628
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,906
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

1629
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,204
- Are you aware of how maddening you sound?
- I am.

1630
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,328
And I know it seems unfair.

1631
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,383
But imagine if you were...

1632
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,332
a poor mother whose husband abandons her,

1633
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:21,173
and then refuses to pay anything.

1634
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,678
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

1635
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:28,931
Listen...

1636
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,053
if I were representing you...

1637
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,304
You are representing me.

1638
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:33,895
Right, no, of course. No...

1639
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:38,601
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

1640
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,483
I think we try and settle today.

1641
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:42,854
Settle meaning what?

1642
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:44,656
She gets LA.

1643
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,108
No, Bert, just...

1644
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,159
No.

1645
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,991
I mean, we have to win this.

1646
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,082
Remember, the win
is what's best for Henry.

1647
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:55,607
And if you guys go to court,
he's going to get pulled into it.

1648
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:58,710
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

1649
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,087
then I won't...

1650
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,840
I'll never get to really be
his parent again.

1651
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:03,755
It'll be different.

1652
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:04,882
It won't exist.

1653
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,844
So maybe you move here.

1654
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,051
You heard what Aamir said about space.

1655
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,771
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

1656
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,232
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

1657
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,354
I've seen these things go on and on,

1658
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:20,490
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

1659
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:24,611
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

1660
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:26,147
What about filing in New York?

1661
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,319
It's too late.

1662
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,659
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

1663
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,543
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

1664
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,251
You're... You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

1665
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,142
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

1666
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,758
If this continues, she might.

1667
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,463
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

1668
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,508
The court would never agree
with this, right?

1669
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:46,513
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

1670
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:48,014
to go to court and prove it.

1671
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,101
I feel like a criminal.

1672
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,679
But you didn't commit any crime.

1673
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,098
It doesn't feel that way.

1674
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,438
If we give on LA right now,

1675
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,530
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

1676
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,649
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

1677
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,646
There are no other fronts!

1678
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:06,783
This is the thing!

1679
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,572
He needs to know that I fought for him!

1680
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:10,658
He'll know.

1681
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,901
I should never have
let her come out here with Henry.

1682
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,307
If it wasn't LA and New York,
it'd be something else.

1683
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:33,810
You'd be fighting about a house,
or a school district, or...

1684
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,355
You know what this is like?

1685
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:40,438
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

1686
01:21:40,522 --> 01:21:42,393
- Do you know this?
- I don't.

1687
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,404
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

1688
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:45,865
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

1689
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,446
And he says, "Oh, really?
What... what airline are you taking?"

1690
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,941
She says, "Alitalia."

1691
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:52,288
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

1692
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:54,619
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

1693
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:56,263
He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

1694
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,090
She says, "I'm going to stay
at the Hassler."

1695
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,204
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

1696
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,204
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

1697
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,246
You won't sleep.
What are you going to see?"

1698
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,750
She says, "I think I'm going to try
to go to the Vatican."

1699
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,252
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

1700
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,779
You'll never get to see anything..."

1701
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:14,005
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

1702
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,606
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

1703
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,354
He's growing up. He's going to have
opinions on the subject.

1704
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:24,686
Time is on your side, Charlie.

1705
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,615
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

1706
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:41,631
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's...

1707
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,670
- Right.
- ...but I'm keeping my dollars

1708
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:45,883
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

1709
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:50,542
So, that is one twenty plus 50,
what is that?

1710
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:51,964
Goddamn it.

1711
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,469
What's "Goddamn it"?

1712
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:55,434
Did you guys lose power where you are?

1713
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,645
Dad? Did we lose power?

1714
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,141
No.

1715
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:02,473
There's rolling blackouts
in the hills and now...

1716
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:05,525
Oh, damn it.
Now the gate won't close.

1717
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,108
Her gate won't close.

1718
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:13,656
Mom!

1719
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,991
Hey.

1720
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,763
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

1721
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:21,509
- You tried all the...
- I tried everything.

1722
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,250
Sorry I made you come out.

1723
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,173
It's fine.

1724
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,293
- I just...
- You don't want your gate open.

1725
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,461
Right.

1726
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:31,175
- There should be a panel or something...
- Maybe this is something here.

1727
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:34,724
- It's a cute house.
- Oh, yeah.

1728
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:36,514
I mean, from what I can see.

1729
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:37,597
Thanks.

1730
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:42,513
You're getting shaggy.

1731
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:45,194
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

1732
01:23:46,773 --> 01:23:47,904
You want me to cut it?

1733
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:49,817
Okay.

1734
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:01,744
Close your eyes.

1735
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:07,835
He's out.

1736
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:09,831
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

1737
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:12,131
It's my night.

1738
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:43,865
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

1739
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:45,276
Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

1740
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,392
- We're taking a walk.
- Fine, all right. She's crazy.

1741
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,798
We're mostly finished.

1742
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,971
Bert and I hammered out
90 percent of the details,

1743
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:55,169
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

1744
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:56,378
but it should be easy.

1745
01:24:57,343 --> 01:24:59,676
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

1746
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,636
Oh. That's good.

1747
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,427
- Fuck me.
- What?

1748
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,390
Who's that?

1749
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,232
Oh, Charlie shouldn't have done this.

1750
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,897
What do you mean? Where's Bert?

1751
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:16,607
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

1752
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,110
We've got LA, right?

1753
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:20,249
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

1754
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:22,286
This is a street fight now.

1755
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:25,912
And I'm going to have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

1756
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:29,000
This system rewards bad behavior.

1757
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,631
- Jay.
- Hey.

1758
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:32,712
Hi.

1759
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,049
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

1760
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,592
- Yeah?
- Looking very handsome.

1761
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:39,677
Oh, you know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

1762
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:42,003
- Uh, John Legend's going to play.
- Oh, love him.

1763
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,157
Okay? It's going to be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

1764
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,242
- Great.
- Okay?

1765
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:47,028
She said you're spending
more time in Malibu.

1766
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,600
- Oh, really?
- Me too.

1767
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:50,648
I haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

1768
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:52,900
A little history...

1769
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,736
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

1770
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:01,443
when he first hires Nicole as an actress
in his play in New York City.

1771
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,701
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

1772
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:06,237
of the avant-garde.

1773
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:09,741
And she's known
as the girl in that college sex movie

1774
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,834
who takes her top off.

1775
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,104
- My client will not be slut-shamed...
- Ten years on...

1776
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,299
...for an artistic choice.

1777
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,752
...and many prestigious
theater roles later...

1778
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:20,850
she becomes an actress
of great credibility.

1779
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:23,179
And it's because of that credibility,

1780
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:27,314
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

1781
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:30,815
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

1782
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:34,859
Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay
support money at this point.

1783
01:26:35,775 --> 01:26:39,528
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

1784
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,613
present and future earnings of the show.

1785
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:49,245
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

1786
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,782
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

1787
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,935
- Of which he gets...
- This is for the theater work...

1788
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:55,631
- ...he conducted during the marriage.
- ...in 125,000 installments

1789
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,963
...over five years.

1790
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:59,482
- So by Jay's same logic, this is work...
- He uses the money...

1791
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,194
- ...that Nicole contributed to.
- to employ actors and crew members...

1792
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:04,780
- One at a time, please.
- ...and to pay debts that he's accumulated

1793
01:27:04,804 --> 01:27:07,686
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

1794
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:12,810
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down

1795
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:14,857
a lucrative and successful career
in movies

1796
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:17,231
to perform in his little theater,

1797
01:27:17,817 --> 01:27:21,821
but she actually supplied Charlie
with a loan early on to help out.

1798
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:24,406
- Which he paid back.
- She lent her name to the marquee,

1799
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,760
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

1800
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:28,535
That may have been true ten years ago.

1801
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,784
And in turn,
she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

1802
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,832
Now, over the next ten years,

1803
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:38,000
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

1804
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:40,461
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

1805
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,220
to be a mom and act in his plays.

1806
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:47,805
So, while we are willing to be flexible
on support,

1807
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:51,592
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

1808
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,146
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

1809
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:56,190
dedicated to his genius.

1810
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:57,833
He became a genius during the marriage.

1811
01:27:57,857 --> 01:27:58,778
Oh, come on, Nora.

1812
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:01,610
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

1813
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,986
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

1814
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,495
That's what people say
when they win awards.

1815
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:09,536
Mmm. No, he was implying what was true.

1816
01:28:10,244 --> 01:28:13,707
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

1817
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,833
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

1818
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:19,500
as a ramshackle downtown dump

1819
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,088
when you're arguing custody,

1820
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:23,124
but when you want more money,

1821
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:25,885
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

1822
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:27,259
You can't have it both ways.

1823
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:28,345
Oh, really? Why not?

1824
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:31,058
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

1825
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,188
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

1826
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:37,080
was put into a joint marital account,
and thus became communal property.

1827
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,736
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

1828
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,878
There's not going to be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

1829
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,494
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

1830
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:48,154
takes place in an alternate reality.

1831
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:54,206
By suddenly moving to LA
and insisting on an LA residence,

1832
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:56,410
Nicole is withholding Henry...

1833
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:59,311
- Counsel, please be seated.
- ...alienating him from his father,

1834
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,298
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

1835
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,149
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

1836
01:29:04,173 --> 01:29:06,345
"Witholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

1837
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,050
Well, those are fighting words,

1838
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:11,178
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

1839
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:15,231
Your recap of this situation
is outrageous.

1840
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:18,312
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

1841
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:21,568
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation

1842
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,570
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

1843
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,243
- An extramarital affair.
- Do you really want me to go there?

1844
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,282
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

1845
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:31,450
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

1846
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,945
and reading his emails,

1847
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,447
which, if proven, is a felony.

1848
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,579
And, Nora,
I don't think you'd be too happy

1849
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:41,048
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

1850
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:41,958
What?

1851
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:44,626
She confided in Charlie
one night recently,

1852
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,096
having just carried Henry to bed,

1853
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:51,518
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

1854
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:55,142
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

1855
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:57,396
So you let me know, Nora,

1856
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:59,818
- and we will go there as needed.
- Charlie?

1857
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:01,855
Can I ask you,

1858
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:03,941
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

1859
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:06,477
when you don't exercise the time
you already have,

1860
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,860
and exercise it responsibly?

1861
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:12,118
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

1862
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:14,831
after failing to call, text,

1863
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,123
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

1864
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:18,892
Charlie finally arrived two hours late

1865
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,877
to pick up Henry
at Nicole's mother's house.

1866
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,879
At that point, the car seat,

1867
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,713
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

1868
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:28,209
was clearly not even belted in.

1869
01:30:28,299 --> 01:30:31,236
- It was just sitting in the back seat.
- You have to buckle in the car seat.

1870
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,141
- It's the law.
- I know.

1871
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,822
- I thought the rental place did it.
- They can't. It's a liability.

1872
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,950
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

1873
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:37,975
Counsel?

1874
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,434
You can see my courtroom is full

1875
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:44,073
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

1876
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,694
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

1877
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,079
the arguments in the case of this child.

1878
01:30:50,154 --> 01:30:52,696
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

1879
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:56,375
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

1880
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,952
I took over this department recently,

1881
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:02,171
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

1882
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:06,253
So, I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

1883
01:31:06,712 --> 01:31:09,675
who knows much more about young children
than I do.

1884
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:12,463
Once the evaluation is done,

1885
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,429
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

1886
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:21,558
Hey.

1887
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:23,359
Hey, where's Henry?

1888
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,112
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

1889
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:28,354
You want something to drink?

1890
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,064
I have unfiltered tap water, beer,
and some juice boxes.

1891
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,525
I'll take a juice box.

1892
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,705
You don't have anything on the walls?

1893
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,911
I don't have anything to put on them
except Henry's art, which is being framed.

1894
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:48,712
I can give you some stuff,
you know, until you get some things.

1895
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:52,468
How about that great picture of Henry
on the Staten Island Ferry?

1896
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:53,794
Aren't you in that one?

1897
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:56,643
I guess I... You could...

1898
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,323
- cut me out.
- I have to leave a day early

1899
01:31:58,347 --> 01:31:59,558
to New York on the 22nd.

1900
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,722
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

1901
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:04,850
Uh, the 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

1902
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:07,349
Mmm, we have plans, actually.

1903
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,482
We're going to, um, some thing at LACMA
with the cousins.

1904
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:13,160
But could you change it
so I could take him?

1905
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:14,908
Mmm. It's just one night.

1906
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,530
- He's looking forward to it.
- Really?

1907
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,365
It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

1908
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,661
Okay, fine.

1909
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:22,746
But what?

1910
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:24,750
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

1911
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,674
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

1912
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,914
- This one night we have tickets to...
- It's not only this one night, but fine.

1913
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:34,375
- Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.
- You mean his LA teacher?

1914
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:37,429
Can you, uh, answer the email
so we could set a time?

1915
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:39,265
Yeah, I've been distracted.

1916
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:41,520
I understand.

1917
01:32:41,932 --> 01:32:44,535
They just want to rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

1918
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,562
I just think
he's a little over-anxious.

1919
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,067
I think he wants it too much.

1920
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:50,069
They said he's off the charts in math.

1921
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:52,544
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

1922
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:54,240
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

1923
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,324
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money.

1924
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:04,788
So...

1925
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,547
- I thought we should talk.
- Mm-hmm.

1926
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,667
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

1927
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:11,542
Uh-huh.

1928
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:14,881
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

1929
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:16,257
I thought I paid Nora.

1930
01:33:16,342 --> 01:33:18,053
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

1931
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:20,637
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

1932
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:22,889
I've just agreed to direct
two shitty plays,

1933
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:25,336
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

1934
01:33:25,851 --> 01:33:29,145
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

1935
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:30,561
and this will change that.

1936
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:31,732
Mm-hmm.

1937
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,024
We have to protect him.

1938
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:33,939
I agree.

1939
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,279
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

1940
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:40,073
they're going to interview Henry
in addition to us,

1941
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:43,250
our friends, family, enemies,

1942
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:46,620
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

1943
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:48,297
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

1944
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:52,551
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

1945
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:55,714
That was a joke.

1946
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,425
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

1947
01:33:58,509 --> 01:33:59,510
So...

1948
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,054
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

1949
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:05,596
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

1950
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:07,974
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

1951
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,891
I was anticipating these circumstances.

1952
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,691
Anyway, shall we try this?

1953
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:13,774
Okay.

1954
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:29,330
I don't know how to start.

1955
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,206
Do you understand
why I want to stay in LA?

1956
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:35,125
No.

1957
01:34:35,212 --> 01:34:36,593
Well... That's not...

1958
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:39,255
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

1959
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,462
I don't understand it.

1960
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:45,178
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

1961
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:46,265
We discussed things.

1962
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:48,185
We were married, we said things.

1963
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:49,938
We talked about moving to Europe.

1964
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,230
About getting a...

1965
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:54,435
sideboard, or what do you call it?

1966
01:34:54,523 --> 01:34:57,155
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

1967
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:58,365
We never did any of it.

1968
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,155
You turned down the residency
at the Geffen

1969
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:02,409
that would've brought us here
for a... a year.

1970
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:03,740
It wasn't something I wanted.

1971
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:06,657
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

1972
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:09,286
- You call that a great life?
- You know what I mean.

1973
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,083
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean, life in Brooklyn.

1974
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:13,959
Professionally.

1975
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,918
I don't know. Honestly, I never considered
anything different.

1976
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,635
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

1977
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:21,797
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

1978
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:25,507
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

1979
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:29,107
Okay. Okay.

1980
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:30,264
Let's...

1981
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:33,479
M-My work is here now, my family is here.

1982
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:36,458
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

1983
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:39,586
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he'd come back to New York.

1984
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:40,651
Honey, we never said that.

1985
01:35:40,694 --> 01:35:43,381
That may have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said that.

1986
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:45,987
- We did say it.
- When did we say it?

1987
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:47,956
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

1988
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,929
- I thought...
- We said it that time on the phone!

1989
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:51,495
Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

1990
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,881
I keep saying that.

1991
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:55,829
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

1992
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,750
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

1993
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:01,049
I was not privy to that thought process.

1994
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,853
The only reason
we didn't live here

1995
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,545
is because you can't imagine desires

1996
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:07,087
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

1997
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:10,101
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you'd had a different life,

1998
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,513
but this is what happened.

1999
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,145
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know.

2000
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:18,193
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

2001
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,817
Fuck Nora! I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA

2002
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:23,604
even though I never lived in LA.

2003
01:36:24,571 --> 01:36:26,533
How could you have her
say those things about me?

2004
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:28,287
Jay said them about me too.

2005
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,246
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

2006
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:31,538
I needed my own asshole.

2007
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:37,212
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

2008
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,424
Nora was worse.

2009
01:36:38,794 --> 01:36:40,085
Jay called me an alcoholic.

2010
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:42,982
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

2011
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,728
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

2012
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,081
Oh, is that what that was, hell?

2013
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,530
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing

2014
01:36:48,554 --> 01:36:51,032
- so you can yet again get what you want!
- It's not what I want.

2015
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:53,308
I mean, it's what I want,
but it's what was...

2016
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:54,685
was...

2017
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,189
what's best for him.

2018
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:59,733
Oh, well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry and what he wants.

2019
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:00,736
Fuck off!

2020
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:04,239
No, you fuck off!
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

2021
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:06,121
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

2022
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,996
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

2023
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,533
He tells me he likes it better here.

2024
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:11,844
He tells you because he knows
it's what you want to hear!

2025
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,597
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't play with him.

2026
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:17,809
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

2027
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:20,876
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity for me...

2028
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,923
You're fighting for something
you don't even want!

2029
01:37:22,963 --> 01:37:24,399
And I let everyone down.

2030
01:37:24,423 --> 01:37:26,475
You're being so much like your father.

2031
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:28,379
Do not compare me to my father!

2032
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:30,881
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

2033
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:32,252
You're exactly like your mother.

2034
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:35,493
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

2035
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:38,229
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

2036
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,707
- I'm just repeating what you told me.
- Secondly, how dare you

2037
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:42,563
compare my mothering to my mother!

2038
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:45,612
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

2039
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:46,695
You are!

2040
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,319
And you're like my father!

2041
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:49,826
You're also like my mother!

2042
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,118
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

2043
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:53,699
But mostly your mother.

2044
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:55,146
When we would lie in bed together,

2045
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,046
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

2046
01:37:58,123 --> 01:38:00,836
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

2047
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:02,599
I made all the beds,
closed all cabinets...

2048
01:38:02,628 --> 01:38:05,921
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off.

2049
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:08,338
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2050
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,927
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

2051
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:13,383
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

2052
01:38:13,472 --> 01:38:16,605
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

2053
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:19,005
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

2054
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:22,313
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2055
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:25,318
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

2056
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,033
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

2057
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,985
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

2058
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:33,785
And I used to defend you.

2059
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,238
They were absolutely right.

2060
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,039
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

2061
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:41,294
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

2062
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:44,838
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

2063
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,003
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

2064
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:50,420
You wanted it until you didn't!

2065
01:38:51,468 --> 01:38:53,720
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2066
01:38:53,804 --> 01:38:54,845
I didn't use you.

2067
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,262
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

2068
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,855
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

2069
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:01,226
how I was falling short!

2070
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:03,013
Life with you was joyless!

2071
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:05,647
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

2072
01:39:05,732 --> 01:39:07,373
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2073
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,282
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

2074
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,191
Do you love her?

2075
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:11,530
No.

2076
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:14,075
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

2077
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:15,238
You hated me.

2078
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:17,027
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2079
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,621
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

2080
01:39:19,705 --> 01:39:21,206
I never cheated on you.

2081
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,380
That was cheating on me!

2082
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,419
But there was so much I could have done.

2083
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:27,133
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

2084
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:30,385
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

2085
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:33,428
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2086
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,762
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

2087
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:38,679
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

2088
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:40,306
and I kinda did!

2089
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:43,149
And you wanted so much so fast.

2090
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:44,940
I didn't even want to get married.

2091
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,613
And fuck it!

2092
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,652
There's so much I didn't do.

2093
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:51,406
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

2094
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,660
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

2095
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,822
You're fucking insane!

2096
01:39:57,618 --> 01:39:59,820
And you're fucking winning!

2097
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,035
Are you kidding me?

2098
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:04,245
I wanted to be married.

2099
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:06,132
I'd already lost!

2100
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:08,927
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2101
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,468
What does that have to do with LA?

2102
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:15,642
What?

2103
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:19,142
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

2104
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:22,345
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

2105
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:24,978
You're such a dick!

2106
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,694
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

2107
01:40:27,773 --> 01:40:30,816
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

2108
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:34,735
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

2109
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:56,549
Oh, God!

2110
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:07,520
I'm sorry.

2111
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:10,273
Me too.

2112
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:38,476
Okay. No, we can make this nice.

2113
01:41:38,844 --> 01:41:42,227
Um, I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

2114
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:45,523
And, uh, do you have things
we can put on the walls?

2115
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:07,253
All right, that's it.
Thank you very much.

2116
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,703
We miss you,
and it looks great, really.

2117
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,477
- Let us know how it goes, okay?
- All right.

2118
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,583
I'll see you guys on, uh... on Monday.

2119
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,552
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

2120
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:42,943
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

2121
01:42:43,033 --> 01:42:45,720
We'll have to return some of this stuff,
so don't get too used to it.

2122
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:47,706
I find plants kind of scary.

2123
01:42:48,038 --> 01:42:49,409
These plants are good guys.

2124
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:51,997
Hey, come here.

2125
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:55,586
Yeah?

2126
01:42:57,255 --> 01:43:00,428
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come
and visit us...

2127
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:03,969
and be with us while we eat dinner.

2128
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:05,966
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No, no.

2129
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:09,102
- Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
- No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

2130
01:43:09,184 --> 01:43:11,266
I don't know. Does she?

2131
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,765
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

2132
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:16,822
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

2133
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,271
I know, it's weird.

2134
01:43:19,069 --> 01:43:20,771
It's just something we have to do.

2135
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:22,697
Which has to do with...

2136
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,491
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

2137
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:27,783
and how we're going to be.

2138
01:43:28,745 --> 01:43:29,746
Um...

2139
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:31,497
You know?

2140
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:33,837
Will you read to me?

2141
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,172
Sure. Grab your book.

2142
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:39,169
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

2143
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:40,590
I drink alcohol.

2144
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:42,968
How much alcohol do you drink?

2145
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:45,386
Hmm...

2146
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,550
I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

2147
01:43:47,806 --> 01:43:49,768
- Sometimes more.
- How much more?

2148
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,358
It's... Sometimes a...

2149
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:54,768
a few...

2150
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,945
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

2151
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:01,087
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

2152
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:04,694
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

2153
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:07,073
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

2154
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:10,992
When you say, "Do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

2155
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:14,625
- You get a bottle?
- Well, sometimes.

2156
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:18,296
I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

2157
01:44:19,004 --> 01:44:20,135
You know, it depends.

2158
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:27,798
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

2159
01:44:29,139 --> 01:44:30,140
In college.

2160
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:33,974
- Anything since you've been...
- I... I don't do it regularly.

2161
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,782
Anything since you've been
a mother?

2162
01:44:38,148 --> 01:44:39,439
Pot a few times.

2163
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:43,406
Coke once at a party.
I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

2164
01:44:45,989 --> 01:44:48,952
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

2165
01:44:51,244 --> 01:44:52,245
Uh...

2166
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:58,084
I listen.

2167
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:00,378
I play.

2168
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:05,338
I-I put in the time. I...

2169
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:07,052
love...

2170
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,550
taking care of him...

2171
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:11,887
watching him grow.

2172
01:45:13,975 --> 01:45:14,976
And sometimes...

2173
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:19,272
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

2174
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:21,772
sometimes it's not.

2175
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:24,948
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

2176
01:45:26,321 --> 01:45:27,993
What are your weaknesses?

2177
01:45:30,909 --> 01:45:33,581
I'm too precise. I care too much.

2178
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:36,251
Are those weaknesses?

2179
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,292
Maybe not.

2180
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,053
You know, he can be an asshole and...

2181
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:48,444
I can get really pissed off,
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

2182
01:45:48,468 --> 01:45:49,870
I'm going to stop you there.

2183
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:52,425
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

2184
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,675
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

2185
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,767
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

2186
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,353
I get it. I do it too.

2187
01:45:59,062 --> 01:46:01,144
We can accept an imperfect dad.

2188
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:05,525
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

2189
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:09,072
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

2190
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:12,869
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

2191
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,195
and can all say
we want them to be different.

2192
01:46:15,578 --> 01:46:18,661
But on some basic level,
we accept them.

2193
01:46:18,957 --> 01:46:21,009
We love them for their fallibilities,

2194
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:24,918
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

2195
01:46:25,005 --> 01:46:28,048
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

2196
01:46:28,133 --> 01:46:31,806
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

2197
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:35,350
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,
and she's perfect.

2198
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,351
She's a virgin who gives birth,

2199
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:43,354
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

2200
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:46,652
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

2201
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:48,116
God is in heaven.

2202
01:46:49,112 --> 01:46:53,156
God is the father
and God didn't show up.

2203
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:57,413
So, you have to be perfect, and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

2204
01:46:58,538 --> 01:47:01,831
You will always be held
to a different, higher standard.

2205
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,423
And it's fucked up,
but that's the way it is.

2206
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,812
Ooh! Whoosh!

2207
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:18,141
Oh.

2208
01:47:32,405 --> 01:47:35,908
Oh. I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.

2209
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:37,283
Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

2210
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,582
Henry's just playing in his room.

2211
01:47:41,081 --> 01:47:42,452
Nancy, can I get you anything?

2212
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,543
Um, I'm easy. A glass of water?

2213
01:47:54,344 --> 01:47:56,046
It's a new apartment.

2214
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:03,978
Shall we go in here?

2215
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:05,271
Sure.

2216
01:48:12,112 --> 01:48:13,113
Um...

2217
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:25,378
Um, what's a day like
for the two of you here?

2218
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:28,209
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

2219
01:48:28,294 --> 01:48:30,336
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

2220
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,720
What prevents you from picking him up?

2221
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:34,008
Um...

2222
01:48:34,467 --> 01:48:37,800
You know, work. I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

2223
01:48:38,096 --> 01:48:39,267
Oh, what is that?

2224
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,593
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

2225
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:44,555
We’re doing it at the Barrow in New York.

2226
01:48:44,644 --> 01:48:46,146
So, you have to be away?

2227
01:48:46,229 --> 01:48:49,352
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

2228
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,941
I come back and forth a lot.

2229
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,083
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

2230
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:56,951
And expensive. I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

2231
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,033
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

2232
01:48:59,117 --> 01:49:02,750
Well, that can be hard on a child,
all that recycled air.

2233
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:05,960
Well, he's sturdy.

2234
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:08,833
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant

2235
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:10,750
because of these superbugs.

2236
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:13,179
Uh-huh.

2237
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:18,549
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,
you came on a Sunday

2238
01:49:18,636 --> 01:49:20,058
and left on a Thursday.

2239
01:49:20,138 --> 01:49:21,939
Why not stay for a weekend?

2240
01:49:22,432 --> 01:49:27,437
Oh. Um, on that time,
I had tech for Electra in New York.

2241
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:29,024
What's that?

2242
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,812
It was my Broadway debut.

2243
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,112
Oh, I don't know what "tech" is.

2244
01:49:34,194 --> 01:49:37,647
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

2245
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:39,925
- And Monday's our day off.
- What's a weekend day like?

2246
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:42,612
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12.

2247
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:43,823
Eleven, I'm sorry.

2248
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:46,334
And so, we go there.
And then, afterwards...

2249
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:50,793
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere,
and then, if there's a movie to see...

2250
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:52,665
Does he like basketball?

2251
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:53,754
He does.

2252
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:57,337
His coach, uh, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

2253
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,971
- Uh-huh.
- Ron.

2254
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:01,764
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

2255
01:50:01,846 --> 01:50:03,348
Rick's his dentist in New York.

2256
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:06,644
Well, you know our home home was...
is in New York.

2257
01:50:06,726 --> 01:50:08,057
That's where we live.

2258
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:10,276
New York is a long way from here.

2259
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:12,565
Well, we like it because we can walk.

2260
01:50:12,648 --> 01:50:14,150
You can walk here.

2261
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:15,526
Not really.

2262
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:17,029
And the space...

2263
01:50:23,409 --> 01:50:24,790
Do you like your school?

2264
01:50:25,745 --> 01:50:26,746
I love it.

2265
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:29,202
What's your favorite part
about it?

2266
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:30,666
I don't know.

2267
01:50:32,168 --> 01:50:33,169
Maybe gym.

2268
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:34,672
You like math.

2269
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:36,959
Not anymore.

2270
01:50:38,758 --> 01:50:39,959
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

2271
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:42,553
- But you're getting really good at it.
- No.

2272
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,100
Well, you are, but...

2273
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:50,142
What do you and your dad
like to do together?

2274
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:53,436
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie,

2275
01:50:53,523 --> 01:50:55,144
or build a Lego, or something.

2276
01:50:55,941 --> 01:50:57,783
My dad's a great Lego builder.

2277
01:50:58,194 --> 01:50:59,535
And at your mom's?

2278
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,783
At home, I have most of my toys,
and there's a pool,

2279
01:51:04,284 --> 01:51:06,326
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

2280
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:11,451
We have super secret treasure hunt,
which is really fun.

2281
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:16,379
- Sweetheart?
- Army men ride in here and...

2282
01:51:16,462 --> 01:51:18,093
Want to help me set the table?

2283
01:51:18,673 --> 01:51:19,594
Do I have to?

2284
01:51:19,674 --> 01:51:22,257
- Just come in here and grab a plate.
- I'm playing.

2285
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:23,344
Henry?

2286
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:25,643
Okay.

2287
01:51:26,556 --> 01:51:27,557
Fine.

2288
01:51:31,644 --> 01:51:33,476
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

2289
01:51:33,563 --> 01:51:35,435
If I ask you to help out, help out.

2290
01:51:35,523 --> 01:51:37,695
- What is this?
- Special Meal.

2291
01:51:38,526 --> 01:51:39,907
What are the green things?

2292
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:42,578
There aren't green things in Special Meal.

2293
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:44,947
- It's just a garnish.
- Ugh.

2294
01:51:45,032 --> 01:51:46,033
I'll take it off.

2295
01:51:47,076 --> 01:51:49,078
I don't want to eat anything it touched.

2296
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:52,875
- It doesn't change the taste of anything.
- I might want to be a vegetarian.

2297
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:54,670
Mom's a vegetarian.

2298
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,131
Is she a vegetarian now?

2299
01:51:56,711 --> 01:51:58,513
- Yeah.
- Well, then, you should like garnish.

2300
01:51:58,588 --> 01:52:00,460
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

2301
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:03,929
I'm done with my water.

2302
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:15,270
Sure I can't get you anything?

2303
01:52:15,355 --> 01:52:17,056
No, I'm fine, thank you.

2304
01:52:19,692 --> 01:52:21,063
Do the thing with the knife.

2305
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,983
No, I'm not.

2306
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:24,947
No.

2307
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:26,741
Come on.

2308
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:28,202
It's not a dinner thing.

2309
01:52:31,245 --> 01:52:32,707
It's not an any time thing.

2310
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:34,877
What's the thing with the knife?

2311
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:36,879
It's hilarious.

2312
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:39,422
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my keychain,

2313
01:52:39,504 --> 01:52:40,755
which is only for adults.

2314
01:52:42,465 --> 01:52:44,216
And I do a thing with it sometimes.

2315
01:52:45,718 --> 01:52:47,300
You said I could get a knife.

2316
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:49,685
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

2317
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:51,391
Like ten.

2318
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,271
No, like 20.

2319
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:54,935
Yeah.

2320
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:04,529
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

2321
01:53:04,612 --> 01:53:06,654
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

2322
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:08,819
Ugh, I don't want to do it.

2323
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:12,495
- What's the first letter?
- I don't want to do it. Can I do the iPad?

2324
01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:14,039
No, look. What's the first letter?

2325
01:53:14,414 --> 01:53:16,576
- I don't want to.
- It's a T. What sound does T make?

2326
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:18,998
- Tuh.
- Right. Then just do the rest of it.

2327
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:20,586
Dime.

2328
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:22,333
No.

2329
01:53:22,422 --> 01:53:24,714
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

2330
01:53:27,843 --> 01:53:28,844
Time.

2331
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:30,388
It's time.

2332
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:32,640
It's time.

2333
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:38,688
You'll see, honey.

2334
01:53:38,771 --> 01:53:41,814
One day, it's just going to click
and you'll be able to read everything.

2335
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,861
I need a break.

2336
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:46,068
Can I go play in my room?

2337
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:47,154
Sure.

2338
01:53:49,407 --> 01:53:50,408
Hey.

2339
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:53,578
Yeah?

2340
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:12,762
Do you ever observe married people?

2341
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:14,018
No. Why would I?

2342
01:54:14,849 --> 01:54:16,641
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

2343
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:31,361
The knife thing is...
I carry this knife on my keychain,

2344
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:33,160
which his mother got me, actually.

2345
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:37,371
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

2346
01:54:37,455 --> 01:54:40,127
but I retract the blade,
but I-I don't do it with him.

2347
01:54:43,419 --> 01:54:44,760
Oh.

2348
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:47,171
- That's fine.
- Are you okay?

2349
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:49,629
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

2350
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:51,178
- Do you need...
- Yeah.

2351
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:54,767
Yeah, no, it's fine.

2352
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,432
What else can I tell you?

2353
01:54:57,307 --> 01:55:00,310
- Um, I think I have enough.
- You have enough?

2354
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:03,393
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

2355
01:55:04,023 --> 01:55:06,936
Uh, well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

2356
01:55:07,527 --> 01:55:08,528
Oh, okay.

2357
01:55:09,403 --> 01:55:12,487
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

2358
01:55:13,574 --> 01:55:15,075
Uh... Oh, thanks.

2359
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:16,160
Um...

2360
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:18,876
Oh, thanks. Um...

2361
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:23,628
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

2362
01:55:23,709 --> 01:55:26,251
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

2363
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,708
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2364
01:55:28,673 --> 01:55:29,884
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

2365
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:36,256
Oh. Sorry.

2366
01:55:37,682 --> 01:55:38,683
All right, let...

2367
01:55:41,477 --> 01:55:42,818
I think you turn the...

2368
01:55:46,566 --> 01:55:47,897
- Okay.
- Sorry.

2369
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,401
Okay.

2370
01:56:52,965 --> 01:56:54,296
Dad, are you okay?

2371
01:56:55,009 --> 01:56:56,390
Yeah, I'm just tired.

2372
01:57:13,611 --> 01:57:15,162
Dad, did she like us?

2373
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:19,662
Yeah, she thought we were great.

2374
01:58:53,127 --> 01:58:54,168
Guys, slow down.

2375
01:58:55,838 --> 01:58:56,839
So...

2376
01:58:57,006 --> 01:58:59,378
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York,

2377
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:00,517
we're mostly done.

2378
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,092
Jay's lost interest,

2379
01:59:02,261 --> 01:59:04,593
and Ted, his associate,
is doing the paperwork.

2380
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:06,431
And we're not taking any money, right?

2381
01:59:06,515 --> 01:59:08,718
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

2382
01:59:08,809 --> 01:59:10,971
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

2383
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:13,313
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

2384
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:16,031
Thank you for everything, Nora.

2385
01:59:16,358 --> 01:59:17,780
You're welcome, doll.

2386
01:59:18,527 --> 01:59:20,279
To your new home in LA.

2387
01:59:24,074 --> 01:59:25,075
Mmm.

2388
01:59:25,409 --> 01:59:26,410
And...

2389
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,948
whenever Charlie is in LA,

2390
01:59:28,037 --> 01:59:31,080
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

2391
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:34,453
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

2392
01:59:34,877 --> 01:59:36,248
I thought we made it equal.

2393
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,092
I tweaked it at the last minute.

2394
01:59:38,172 --> 01:59:41,005
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

2395
01:59:41,091 --> 01:59:42,552
bragging to his friends.

2396
01:59:43,052 --> 01:59:45,094
- But I don't want to do that.
- Take it.

2397
01:59:45,554 --> 01:59:46,595
You won.

2398
01:59:48,223 --> 01:59:49,224
Uh-huh.

2399
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,292
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

2400
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:16,376
Nope.

2401
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:37,938
Oh, my God!

2402
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:39,191
Hi.

2403
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:56,881
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

2404
02:00:56,959 --> 02:00:58,881
But I mean... it was our couch.

2405
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:00,803
It's not like I was going to buy
another couch.

2406
02:01:00,838 --> 02:01:03,240
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch

2407
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:04,679
and I have no couch, and...

2408
02:01:05,384 --> 02:01:06,675
Hey, guys, what's up?

2409
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:09,805
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

2410
02:01:12,432 --> 02:01:15,185
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

2411
02:01:15,269 --> 02:01:16,270
No, come on.

2412
02:01:16,353 --> 02:01:18,105
No, it's so stupid. I'm sorry.

2413
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:21,021
- It sounds really tough.
- No, no, no, no. It is sad.

2414
02:01:40,419 --> 02:01:42,461
It's true, but there's more than that.

2415
02:01:42,671 --> 02:01:44,423
Is that all you think there is to it?

2416
02:01:44,506 --> 02:01:46,869
You have so many reasons
for not being with someone, Robert,

2417
02:01:46,926 --> 02:01:48,968
but you haven't got one good reason
for being alone.

2418
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:51,513
C'mon, you're onto something.
Robbie, you're onto something.

2419
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:07,322
You see what you look for, you know?
You're not a kid anymore, Robbie.

2420
02:02:07,404 --> 02:02:09,536
I don't think you'll ever be
a kid again, kiddo.

2421
02:02:21,543 --> 02:02:24,877
Blow out the candles, Robert,
and make a wish.

2422
02:02:24,964 --> 02:02:26,295
Want something.

2423
02:02:27,091 --> 02:02:28,422
Want something.

2424
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,052
Hello?

2425
02:04:52,902 --> 02:04:54,234
Hello?

2426
02:04:55,905 --> 02:04:58,028
- Hi. Sorry, the door was open.
- Shh.

2427
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,034
Oh, okay.

2428
02:05:02,287 --> 02:05:03,498
Whoa! Gotcha!

2429
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:04,581
Aah!

2430
02:05:04,998 --> 02:05:06,500
Oh, Charlie!

2431
02:05:07,084 --> 02:05:09,586
Oh! Was your flight okay?

2432
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:11,131
- Yeah.
- Carter.

2433
02:05:11,213 --> 02:05:12,294
Charlie.

2434
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:13,542
Nicole's still at work.

2435
02:05:21,098 --> 02:05:22,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

2436
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:23,433
Can I get a hug?

2437
02:05:28,688 --> 02:05:30,100
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Hey.

2438
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:33,253
Good, yeah. Donny's dead now. We shot
the scene where he merges with the ficus.

2439
02:05:33,277 --> 02:05:35,560
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

2440
02:05:35,779 --> 02:05:38,242
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

2441
02:05:39,908 --> 02:05:41,740
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2442
02:05:41,826 --> 02:05:44,579
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

2443
02:05:44,663 --> 02:05:46,575
- Um, we should get ready.
- Yeah.

2444
02:05:46,665 --> 02:05:48,559
- We're the Beatles.
- Come on, Charlie.

2445
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:50,145
I didn't really get a costume together.

2446
02:05:50,169 --> 02:05:52,438
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anything.

2447
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:54,815
- You've got to be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

2448
02:05:54,839 --> 02:05:56,984
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

2449
02:05:57,008 --> 02:05:59,881
And we should leave soon. I'm saying that
as much for me as anyone else.

2450
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:02,532
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

2451
02:06:02,556 --> 02:06:04,117
You're George. Nicole is John.

2452
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,853
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

2453
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:17,947
I'm going to direct two plays
in rep at REDCAT.

2454
02:06:19,989 --> 02:06:20,990
Oh.

2455
02:06:21,783 --> 02:06:23,325
So, I'm going to be here for a while.

2456
02:06:26,538 --> 02:06:27,539
That's great.

2457
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:31,710
Are you okay?

2458
02:06:34,213 --> 02:06:35,214
Yeah.

2459
02:06:37,716 --> 02:06:38,917
It's only good.

2460
02:06:39,218 --> 02:06:40,669
Nicole?

2461
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,802
Can you help me with my zipper?

2462
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:06,453
"Charlie is... in... cr..."

2463
02:07:06,536 --> 02:07:07,407
...something.

2464
02:07:07,496 --> 02:07:08,497
"...neat

2465
02:07:08,788 --> 02:07:12,202
and I re-ly on him

2466
02:07:12,626 --> 02:07:17,130
to keep things in or-der.

2467
02:07:18,006 --> 02:07:19,878
He is energy con..."

2468
02:07:21,134 --> 02:07:24,348
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

2469
02:07:25,013 --> 02:07:26,134
What is that?

2470
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:32,644
"He doesn't look in the mirror too of-ten.

2471
02:07:33,104 --> 02:07:35,227
He cries eas-ily

2472
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,692
in movies...

2473
02:07:38,777 --> 02:07:41,400
He is very self-suf..."

2474
02:07:42,322 --> 02:07:43,363
Self-sufficient.

2475
02:07:44,824 --> 02:07:47,987
"He can dar-n a sock..."

2476
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:50,620
That means sew, like a hole.

2477
02:07:51,248 --> 02:07:54,251
"...and cook himself dinner

2478
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:57,592
and ir..."

2479
02:07:57,671 --> 02:07:58,882
Break it into two parts.

2480
02:07:59,256 --> 02:08:00,967
"...Ur. On."

2481
02:08:01,049 --> 02:08:02,711
Not "ur" but "ire."

2482
02:08:03,009 --> 02:08:04,100
Ire. On.

2483
02:08:04,177 --> 02:08:05,178
Iron.

2484
02:08:07,013 --> 02:08:08,225
"...a shirt.

2485
02:08:10,099 --> 02:08:13,393
He rarely gets def-eated,

2486
02:08:13,687 --> 02:08:16,149
which I fell...

2487
02:08:17,482 --> 02:08:20,825
feel like I always do.

2488
02:08:21,861 --> 02:08:25,235
Charlie takes all of my moods stead-ily.

2489
02:08:25,824 --> 02:08:28,026
He doesn't give in to them

2490
02:08:28,368 --> 02:08:30,780
or make me feel bad about them.

2491
02:08:31,663 --> 02:08:33,995
He's a great dress-er
and never looks em..."

2492
02:08:34,499 --> 02:08:36,591
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

2493
02:08:37,419 --> 02:08:38,420
"...embarrassing,

2494
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:42,252
wh-ich is hard for a man."

2495
02:08:43,216 --> 02:08:44,258
You read it now.

2496
02:08:46,553 --> 02:08:47,974
"He's very competitive.

2497
02:08:49,097 --> 02:08:50,799
He loves being a dad.

2498
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:54,222
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

2499
02:08:54,644 --> 02:08:56,055
like the tantrums,

2500
02:08:56,563 --> 02:08:57,984
the waking up at night.

2501
02:08:58,607 --> 02:09:01,149
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

2502
02:09:01,526 --> 02:09:02,907
but then, it's mostly nice.

2503
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:06,237
He disappears into his own world.

2504
02:09:06,323 --> 02:09:08,415
He and Henry are alike that way.

2505
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:11,120
He can tell...

2506
02:09:11,453 --> 02:09:14,245
people they have food in their teeth

2507
02:09:14,956 --> 02:09:17,829
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

2508
02:09:18,752 --> 02:09:20,133
Charlie is self made.

2509
02:09:20,504 --> 02:09:22,966
His parents, I only met them once,

2510
02:09:23,047 --> 02:09:25,840
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

2511
02:09:29,513 --> 02:09:32,015
He moved to New York from Indiana

2512
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:33,688
with no safety net,

2513
02:09:33,767 --> 02:09:36,520
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

2514
02:09:37,312 --> 02:09:40,315
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

2515
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,061
With the theater company...

2516
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:44,444
he casts a spell...

2517
02:09:45,069 --> 02:09:47,532
that made everyone feel included.

2518
02:09:48,072 --> 02:09:50,825
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

2519
02:09:52,201 --> 02:09:53,242
What's an intern?

2520
02:09:53,453 --> 02:09:54,824
Uh, it's like a...

2521
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:57,464
helper, but who isn't paid.

2522
02:09:57,666 --> 02:09:58,867
Why aren't they paid?

2523
02:10:00,126 --> 02:10:01,878
They're young, they're learning.

2524
02:10:03,338 --> 02:10:06,220
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

2525
02:10:06,466 --> 02:10:07,677
Okay, keep going.

2526
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:12,934
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,

2527
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:16,563
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

2528
02:10:17,101 --> 02:10:20,144
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

2529
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,552
And I'll never stop loving him,

2530
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:48,012
even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

2531
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:04,683
- See you. Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you too.

2532
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:06,436
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

2533
02:11:06,526 --> 02:11:08,147
I'm so happy you came.

2534
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:10,189
I'll email you that article.

2535
02:11:10,363 --> 02:11:11,445
- Yes, please do.
- Yeah.

2536
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:13,693
- All right. Thank you.
- Take care.

2537
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:20,875
We were going to bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

2538
02:11:20,957 --> 02:11:22,048
You want to take him?

2539
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:25,422
- It's your night.
- I know.

2540
02:11:25,504 --> 02:11:27,440
- Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Good.

2541

02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:31,558
You're going to go with your dad, okay?

I love you.

2545
02:11:46,274 --> 02:11:47,476
I love you too.
