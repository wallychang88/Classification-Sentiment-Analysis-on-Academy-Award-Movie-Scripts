1
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,555
This is the Australian

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,227
Broadcasting Commission.

3
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,350
And now the news.

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,522
Japanese forces continue
their heavy attack on

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,898
the Philippines and Dutch East Indies.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,399
Occupation of Manila is now complete.

7
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,106
With American and Philippine forces,

8
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,408
under the command of General MacArthur,

9
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,532
withdrawing to the Bataan peninsula.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,363
His Majesty's forces are carrying out an

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,039
orderly evacuation

12
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,413
of the New Guinea coast, in preparation

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,745
for defense of Port
Moresby and the southern...

14
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,921
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,842
Get off.

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,401
Boom!

17
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,210
Here, just a minute.

18
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,176
Where do you think you're
going with those, hmm?

19
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,098
Do you know who I am?

20
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,390
Um...

21
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,638
not exactly, no.

22
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,061
Well, we'll let it go this time.

23
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,821
Yes, sir, I understand.

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,904
Salamaua will be cleared
by noon, the latest.

25
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,115
Nothing left that the Japanese
will be able to use, sir.

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,995
Sir, there's a chap outside who...

27
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,951
- May I respectfully
remind the admiral that

28
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,038
I was harbor master here
for nearly 20 years?

29
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,464
I helped put the docks
together, so I should

30
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,541
certainly be able to blow them apart.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,716
Sir, there's a chap outside, sir,

32
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,009
who's pinching our petrol.
- Yes, sir, all our

33
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,555
coastal watching stations
are assigned, except.

34
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,222
Matalava, sir.

35
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,970
Except Matalava, sir.

36
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,017
I haven't been able to find
a replacement for Anderson.

37
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,345
I don't believe there's a civilian left

38
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,554
on the entire north coast.

39
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,184
We could have transferred George Dickens

40
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,017
from the interior if he hadn't
got himself eaten that way.

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,320
- You needn't make him sound
such a shirker, Stebbings.

42
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,647
What's that, sir?

43
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,653
For want of a nail, the war was.

44
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,702
Yes, I'm well aware of that, sir.

45
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,160
Hello, hello, hello.

46
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,957
I think I may have found our nail, sir.

47
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,501
A rusty one, I grant you, sir,

48
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,419
but they don't come any sharper.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,212
Excuse me, sir.

50
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,712
- Sir, that's the chap
I was telling you about.

51
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,919
He was leeching.
- Later, Stebbings.

52
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,925
- Who is he, sir, is he
someone I should know?

53
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,101
His name's Walter Eckland, an American.

54
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,145
He knows these islands
like the back of his hand.

55
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:33,971
Oh.

56
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,398
Oh well, now that America's in the war

57
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,101
he's probably on his way back to enlist.

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,858
- Eckland's not on his
way anywhere, Stebbings.

59
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,358
Hasn't been for years.

60
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,365
Hello, Walter.

61
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,242
Frank!

62
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,915
That you inside there, Frank?

63
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,116
What have you done to yourself?

64
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,793
There's a war on, Walter.

65
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,960
Everybody's saying that.

66
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,256
At the moment, we're losing it.

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,675
I guess you must be.

68
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,047
Cheek of the man!

69
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,097
- That's quite a boat
you have there, Walter.

70
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,391
Doesn't it belong to old Van Der Hoeven?

71
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,092
No!

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,017
Whose is it, then?

73
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:12,969
Mine.

74
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,429
How did you get it?

75
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,105
I bought it from old Van Der Hoeven.

76
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,308
What with?

77
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,438
American dollars.

78
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,189
You've never had more than $200

79
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,191
at one time since I've known you, Walter.

80
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,942
You can't tell me that
Van Der Hoeven sold you

81
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,366
an $18,000 launch for $200.

82
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,068
No, it cost me $400.

83
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,574
$400?

84
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,156
- You know, that's exactly
the way he said it.

85
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,832
Only, I pointed out to him
he might as well sell it

86
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,909
to me as let the Japanese
have it for free.

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,118
What impresses me, Walter, is the fact

88
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,126
that you even had $400.

89
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,628
- Well, I didn't, I only
had 200, just as you said.

90
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,176
I owe him the rest.

91
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,128
Well, come along, lend a hand.

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,212
Come on.

93
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,764
Empty hands make idle minds.

94
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,763
Here, pick those up.

95
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,764
No, no, no.

96
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,436
Two, come on.

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,233
Coastwatching Service is, Walter?

98
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:01,900
I beg your pardon?

99
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,102
The Coastwatching Service.

100
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,358
It's a chance to become a hero.

101
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,610
Why would I want to do that?

102
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,941
- It's a cushy
assignment for anyone

103
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,741
who knows these waters intimately.

104
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,364
- With never a dull
moment, I can tell you!

105
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,071
Working behind the enemy
lines, never knowing from one

106
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,748
moment to the next what...
- Stebbings, please.

107
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,621
Walter, listen to me.

108
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,077
There's nothing to it, really.

109
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,037
Each man is assigned an island,

110
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,918
often uninhabited.

111
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,500
He stays there alone and
he radios to headquarters

112
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,429
any movement of Japanese
planes or ships which...

113
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,720
You're not listening
to me, are you, Walter?

114
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,468
Hold it, hold it.

115
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,721
Hey, hey, hey, come on, beat it, scram!

116
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,472
Come on, get off!

117
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,771
Did you hear what I was saying?

118
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,813
No, what were you saying?

119
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,186
About the Coastwatchers.

120
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,767
Matalava will be in the center of things

121
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,569
when the Japanese start
moving towards New Guinea.

122
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,271
It's important work, Walter.

123
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,732
Damned important, I'd
like you to volunteer.

124
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,613
Oh, I'd love to, Frank.

125
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,909
But I've only just volunteered for

126
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,578
another important watching service,

127
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,496
the Watch Out For Walter Eckland service.

128
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,327
- A great many
lives are at stake, Mr. Eckland.

129
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,377
Now listen to me, both of you.

130
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,047
Several years ago, I made
peace with the world.

131
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,794
Now if the world isn't
bright enough to make peace

132
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,423
with itself, it'll have to
settle things without me.

133
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,051
It isn't anything permanent, Walter.

134
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,258
It's just until I find
a replacement for you.

135
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,433
The other man went down with fever,

136
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,886
and we had to take him off.

137
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,061
Well, now, Frank.

138
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,809
You've known me a long time.

139
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,439
Do you really think you're
gonna talk me into it?

140
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,987
No, I suppose not.

141
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,612
Stebbings, confiscate all
the small craft on this pier.

142
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,987
But this is the only one there is, sir.

143
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,159
Confiscate it.

144
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,657
- Frank, you
won't get away with that!

145
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,158
Proceed with your orders, Stebbings.

146
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,991
Frank, you can't do this to me!

147
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,825
I'll go over your head!

148
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,539
Frank, you can't do this to me!

149
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,791
That boat's all I have.

150
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,170
- You said we've been friends
for a long time, Walter.

151
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,674
Do you really think you
could talk me out of it?

152
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,804
If I go to Matalava,

153
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,806
I can keep the boat, right?

154
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,517
Well, no use fighting it.

155
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,473
What time do I shove off?

156
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,934
An hour be all right?

157
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,142
Anything you say, Frank.

158
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,819
You're the skipper.

159
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,022
Hey, buddy, lend me a
hand with those cans.

160
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,199
I'll get on board.

161
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,618
But sir...

162
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,742
you don't really expect him to
go to Matalava, do you, sir?

163
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,074
As soon as he clears harbor,
we'll never see him again.

164
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,284
- Where's your faith in
human nature, Stebbings?

165
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,041
Da-da-da-da,, oh yeah.

166
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,862
Good heavens!

167
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,285
What is it?

168
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,362
He...

169
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,824
He made a gesture, sir.

170
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,227
You set a fine course there, Walter.

171
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,770
My compliments.

172
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,974
Yeah, I shoulda led you up on the reef!

173
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,686
It's a sorry day when a man's
friends don't trust him.

174
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,067
What about all those provisions?

175
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,569
You don't suppose that boat
of yours could carry them?

176
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,617
Frank...

177
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,945
I want you to take all those provisions,

178
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,905
and I want you to...

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,583
Hey, be careful with that!

180
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,427
We'll be at Kings Point in Australia.

181
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,307
When you call us, we want you
to use the following code.

182
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,764
Kings Point is Briar Patch.

183
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,769
I'm Big Bad Wolf,

184
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,101
Stebbings here is Bo Beep,

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,652
and you're...

186
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,855
Mother Goose, sir.

187
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,236
That's it. You're Mother Goose.

188
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,488
Now try to remember all that, Walter.

189
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,693
It's bloody important.

190
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,279
Yeah, bloody.

191
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,363
All right, then.

192
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,199
Goodbye, Mother Goose.

193
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,158
Mother Goose.

194
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,537
Let's get under way, Stebbings.

195
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,839
- Sir, it has occurred to me
that as soon as we've gone,

196
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,382
Mr. Eckland might...

197
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,925
Proceed, Stebbings, hard to port.

198
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,800
All right, sir, Coxswain, hard...

199
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,597
Excuse me, sir, but did you say.

200
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,970
Hard a port, son.

201
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,050
Aye-aye, sir.

202
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,933
Coxswain, hard a port!

203
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,569
Hey, hold it, hold it!

204
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,022
Are you crazy?

205
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,652
Look out, look out, Frank!

206
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,608
Do you hear me?

207
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,284
Hard a starboard, Frank!

208
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,202
All in all, watch out!

209
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,530
Are you gone nuts, look out!

210
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,284
Frank, can you hear me?

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,742
Hard a starboard, you
ignorant, silly son of a...

212
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,462
Oh, great.

213
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,508
Have you lost your mind?

214
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,836
Look at my boat!

215
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,091
Terribly sorry, Walter.

216
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,424
Our steering must have jammed.

217
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,928
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,009
If you didn't know how to work

219
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,185
one of those things,
why didn't you say so?

220
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,808
I'm sorry!

221
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,266
- Oh, stop saying
that, look at my boat!

222
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,100
What am I gonna do now?

223
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,858
Become a coastwatcher, I expect.

224
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,110
Lucky we put all those supplies ashore.

225
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,316
Oh, Walter.

226
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,653
We'll stand by until you get safely in.

227
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,204
Frank, I'll sue ya!

228
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,283
I'll sue, I'll sue the entire war!

229
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,867
Quite right, Walter.

230
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,702
I'll be your witness.

231
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,538
Oh, and Walter.

232
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,750
Thanks for volunteering.

233
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,299
Oh come on, buzz off.

234
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,545
Mother Goose?

235
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,880
Frank!

236
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,010
I knew you wouldn't leave me here!

237
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,059
- Mother Goose,
this is Big Bad Wolf.

238
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,683
Go away!

239
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,230
- I know you're saying
something, Mother Goose,

240
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,227
but I can't hear you.

241
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,525
You've got to flip the key.

242
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,233
I said go away.

243
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,940
- You're still not
coming through, Mother Goose.

244
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,320
There's a button on the
microphone, you have to

245
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,653
press it down while you're speaking.

246
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,249
Can you hear me now?

247
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,076
That's better.

248
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,161
You'll find some charts there, Walter,

249
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,213
identifying enemy ships and aircraft.

250
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,757
Study them, will you?

251
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,084
Have you seen anything yet?

252
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,214
Any planes or ships?

253
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,466
Yeah, some planes.

254
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,263
Ours or theirs?

255
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,841
- Kind of depends which
side you're on, doesn't it?

256
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,676
- Walter, news has just come
through that the Japanese

257
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,306
took Singapore this morning.

258
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,979
Frank.

259
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,398
What keeps them from
taking Walter Eckland?

260
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,693
- We've 32 spotters
spread over 3,000 islands.

261
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,190
So you see the odds are
in our favor that you'll

262
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,613
never be found.

263
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,281
Our favor?

264
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,701
You're not stuck out here in
the middle of nowhere, I am.

265
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,823
Now when do I get off?

266
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,903
- I've told you
as soon as we can find

267
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,910
a replacement for you.

268
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,742
Meantime, be good enough
to keep in touch, Walter.

269
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,793
Oh, and I am sorry about your boat.

270
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,712
I really am.

271
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,540
Is Big Bad Wolf really sorry?

272
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,671
Because if he is,

273
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,924
Big Bad Wolf and Little Bo Peep

274
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,051
can do something for Mother Goose.

275
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:15,676
They can go...

276
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,886
I don't really blame him, do you?

277
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,188
- I can't see that we've
accomplished anything, sir.

278
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,890
I don't think he'll report in.

279
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,896
I mean you can lead a horse to water,

280
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,851
but can you make it drink?

281
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,151
When he gets thirsty enough,

282
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,229
he'll drink, Stebbings.

283
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,906
He'll drink.

284
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,995
Frank, can you hear me?

285
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,577
Frank?

286
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,169
- Loud and clear, Mother
Goose, what is it?

287
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,045
- Where'd those men of
yours put the whiskey?

288
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,501
I've been looking all over this dump.

289
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,586
You don't suppose they kept
it for themselves, do you?

290
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,592
Seamen of His Majesty's Navy?

291
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,593
You must be joking.

292
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,549
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where is it?

293
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,726
- Well, I can
imagine how dull it must get

294
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,055
for someone left all
alone on a small island,

295
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,605
so I decided...
- Alright, alright.

296
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,727
Get to the bad news.

297
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,855
- Well, I decided
to liven things up a bit by

298
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,733
making a little fun and
game thing out of it.

299
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,689
What sort of fun and games?

300
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,024
- I had my men
hide all the bottles

301
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,326
around the island.

302
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,531
In very unlikely places, you'd
never find them by yourself.

303
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,490
The ground rules are simple.

304
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,577
You report an enemy
ship or plane movement,

305
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,162
and I tell you where the bottles are.

306
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,419
One report, one bottle.

307
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,966
Hold it a minute, Frank.

308
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,668
I hear a flight going over right now.

309
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,968
Yeah, isn't that odd, now just a minute

310
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,762
while I get the binoculars.

311
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,340
Oh yes, there's

312
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,176
six, seven, eight of them heading south.

313
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,977
They're...

314
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,349
Nakajima 97s.

315
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,396
But just a minute while I

316
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,098
verify that on one of
these little old charts.

317
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,853
Walter, there's,

318
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,776
there is another rule attached to this.

319
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,026
It has to be a confirmed report.

320
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,356
Confirmed how?

321
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,693
- By other
spotters along the line.

322
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,988
Now just tell me what all
those planes were that you saw.

323
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,914
Hmm?

324
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,385
Frank?

325
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,057
Frank, Frank.

326
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,225
Frank, wake up, Frank.

327
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,144
Frank?

328
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,938
Briar Patch here, Mother Goose.

329
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,765
Bo Peep speaking.

330
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,146
- Briar Patch, what's that,
that's a new one, isn't it?

331
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,273
We've moved.

332
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,899
Are you at Kings Point already?

333
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,948
- Listen, Mother Goose, you
must use the code names.

334
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,400
If you don't like it, fire me.

335
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,484
Now, get Houghton.

336
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,035
The regulations...

337
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,157
Frank here, Walter.

338
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,284
Mother Goose, sir.

339
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,285
What's new?

340
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,241
Five Mitsubishi light bombers,

341
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,578
at around 10,000, headed southwest.

342
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,457
Southwest.

343
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,254
Huh.

344
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,457
At 10 thou.

345
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,508
Got it, sport, thanks!

346
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,210
Hold on now, wait a minute, whoa!

347
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,294
Now it's fun and game time.

348
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,301
Now I played the game, how about the fun?

349
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,099
Confirmed, Walter, remember?

350
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,642
But Frank, I swear!

351
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,014
- Well, in that case,
you've nothing to worry about,

352
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,220
have you?

353
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,681
Sit tight, Mother Goose.

354
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,481
Sit tight, sit tight.

355
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,663
Briar Patch here.

356
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,410
Are you there, Mother Goose?

357
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,082
I'm here, Frank!

358
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,204
I'm here, I'm here.

359
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,082
- We've just received
news that your report

360
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,832
has been confirmed.

361
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,380
Congratulations.

362
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,832
Never mind the congratulations.

363
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,633
Where is it?

364
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,181
- Proceed 50 yards east
northeast to a large rock.

365
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,098
Okay.

366
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,347
- Then 20 yards
due east to a coconut palm.

367
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,304
- No, no, not so fast, not
so fast, wait a minute.

368
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,139
Large rock, 20...
- 20 yards due east

369
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,226
to a coconut palm.

370
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,181
Sir?

371
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,604
Sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir,

372
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,230
but we've heard from Humpty Dumpty.

373
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,859
Oh come on, Stebbings, you can tell me.

374
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,609
Who's Humpty Dumpty?

375
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,657
Perry on Bundi Island.

376
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,122
He reports enemy landings
here on this fare,

377
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,042
here and here on Greater
and Lesser Samengo,

378
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,290
and here on Prince Consort.

379
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,622
- They've ringed him in
pretty well, haven't they?

380
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,876
- He says they don't
know that he's there yet,

381
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,048
but he expects somebody
along at any time now,

382
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,250
and requests to be withdrawn.

383
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,883
- Well, Combat can't
spare a thing, Stebbings.

384
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,384
All our planes and ships are committed.

385
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,432
Who's our nearest man?

386
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,933
I'm afraid he is, sir.

387
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,898
Briar Patch calling Mother Goose.

388
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,601
Come in, Mother Goose.

389
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,778
Briar Patch calling Mother Goose.

390
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,981
Come in, Mother Goose.

391
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,576
Do you read me, Mother Goose?

392
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,201
This is Briar Patch.

393
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,703
Do you read me, Mother Goose?

394
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,753
Yes, yes, I read you.

395
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,081
What's even worse, I can hear you.

396
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,790
Now what do you want?

397
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,341
Walter.

398
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,839
I haven't been sleeping
too well because I've

399
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,546
treated you so badly, so
I'm gonna make it up to you.

400
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,802
- Whatever it is,
Frank, the answer is no.

401
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,178
I don't blame you, sport.

402
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,475
I don't blame you at all.

403
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,894
I'm not listening, Frank.

404
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,186
But supposing I got someone

405
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,890
to repair your boat for you?

406
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,267
I'm listening, Frank.

407
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,193
And after it's repaired,

408
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,113
to stay on there as your replacement.

409
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,235
Who is he?

410
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,783
Malcolm Perry, he's one of our regulars.

411
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,702
When can he be here?

412
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,245
Tonight too soon?

413
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,913
No, Frank, tonight's just fine.

414
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,208
There's just one small thing

415
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,251
Uh-oh.

416
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,294
- He's not able
to get to you, so you'll

417
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,122
have to go and fetch him.

418
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,832
From where, Frank?

419
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,542
Bundi Island.

420
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,218
Bundi?

421
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,966
How do you suggest I get there, Frank?

422
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,174
- That launch of yours
has a dinghy, doesn't it?

423
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,476
- All those miles of
open sea and back again

424
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,223
in a seven-foot dink?

425
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,725
You're nuts!

426
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,647
Shall I call him back, sir?

427
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,482
Frank?

428
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,485
Yes, Walter?

429
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,240
Suppose I could make it to Bundi,

430
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,947
where would I put in, the south jetty?

431
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,282
That's right.

432
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,164
Only be careful, there's a
pretty fair moon tonight.

433
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,245
- You got some special reason
for telling me that, Frank?

434
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,501
No, no, no.

435
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,675
Only it'd be better without a moon.

436
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,252
Why, Frank?

437
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,805
Well, Bundi's liable to be occupied.

438
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:54,972
With what, Frank?

439
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,096
I didn't say it would be.

440
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:57,676
Frank.

441
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:58,601
Yes, Walter?

442
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,270
Kiss my foot, Frank.

443
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,563
If he leaves within the hour,

444
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,736
he should make Bundi just after dark.

445
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,860
But sir, you heard what he said.

446
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,441
He won't go to Bundi.

447
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,117
Frank!

448
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,611
Yes, Walter.

449
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,117
- All those miles of open sea,
a man would need something

450
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,824
to keep warm, wouldn't he?

451
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:21,999
Two bottles.

452
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,793
All of them, Frank.

453
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,369
Three.

454
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,500
All of them, Frank.

455
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,501
Five.

456
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,423
All of them, Frank.

457
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,503
Got a pencil?

458
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,058
Number four,

459
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,512
is ten yards west of
the shack under a mango.

460
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,058
Five is 30 paces from there, due north,

461
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,233
in a stunted palm.

462
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,279
Just a second, slow it down.

463
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,447
Number six is.

464
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,948
Perry?

465
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,685
Who are you?

466
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,437
I...

467
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,268
I asked you first.

468
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,524
Where's Perry?

469
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,730
Who's Perry?

470
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,487
Perry, the man who lives here.

471
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,659
I buried him.

472
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,703
He was dead.

473
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,905
I found him here.

474
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,037
A Japanese plane must
have attacked the house.

475
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,539
How did you get here?

476
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,041
I.

477
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,499
Duck.

478
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,557
They've passed by before.

479
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,595
I think they are landing on
the other side of the island.

480
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,895
What makes you think that?

481
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:54,642
Well, I saw them.

482
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,440
If you want to look,
there's a place over there.

483
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,735
Why would I do a silly thing like that?

484
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,027
Come on, let's get out of here.

485
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,901
Do you have a boat?

486
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,237
No, I walked.

487
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,317
Come on.

488
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,744
Come on, we're leaving now.

489
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,101
Look out.

490
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,302
Come on, look out.

491
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,683
Just...

492
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,307
What?

493
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,314
What are all those?

494
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,146
As you can see, they're young ladies.

495
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,072
Now listen, miss, whatever your name is.

496
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,445
Oh, Freneau, Catherine Freneau.

497
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,116
Charmed.

498
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:47,908
Now suppose you tell me.

499
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,361
What is your name?

500
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,490
Eckland.

501
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:51,704
How do you do.

502
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,530
Now, miss,

503
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,957
I don't what this is all about but...

504
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,375
Please, miss!

505
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,203
I don't believe it.

506
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,959
Miss?

507
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,961
Shh.

508
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:03,791
Where is your boat?

509
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:04,842
I can't see it.

510
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,136
Lady, it's right where we're standing.

511
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,929
If you spit, you'd sink it.

512
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,507
Oh dear.

513
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,677
Oh well, I suppose we'll
just have to manage.

514
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,806
Come on, girls, into the boat.

515
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:15,808
Wait, wait, wait.

516
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:16,763
Wait a minute, hold it.

517
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,349
Everybody settle down.

518
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,651
You don't think they'll
all gonna fit in that?

519
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,478
All right, Mr. Eckland.

520
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,610
Which ones do you suggest we leave behind?

521
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,404
You decide.

522
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,158
I'll leave it to you.

523
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,832
It's suicide.

524
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,710
- Would you stand a
better chance without me?

525
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,335
Naturally.

526
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,383
Very well.

527
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,962
Well, I suggest you leave immediately.

528
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,672
Well, that's really very decent of you.

529
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,133
You're a very good sport, thank you.

530
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,015
Now, the rest of you, snap it up.

531
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,811
- Jenny, you're the
smallest, sit in the back.

532
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:58,729
You'll be out of the way.

533
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,851
Do you mind, lady?

534
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,353
This is my boat, such as it is.

535
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,525
If anyone's going to
sink her, it'll be me.

536
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,693
Now I'll seat them.

537
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,112
You sit in the back.

538
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,564
That's right.

539
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,362
Give it to me, let go.

540
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,909
Mr. Eckland!

541
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,031
Well, this is not the Queen Mary,

542
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,987
there's no room for baggage, come on, you.

543
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,743
My glasses!

544
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,835
I don't want to go.

545
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,333
Oh, that's tough, come here.

546
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,667
Please, take your hand off that.

547
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,967
All right, now.

548
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:29,544
My scent.

549
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,219
Huh?

550
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,796
Scent.

551
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,131
It's called Anticipation.

552
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,682
Two pounds, 10 the ounce.

553
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,555
You don't say.

554
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,469
Oh, no, no, no, no.

555
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,769
Sit there, that's right.

556
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,188
Take your hands off that.

557
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,981
Hey, hey, ooh!

558
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,182
Oh.

559
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,439
What is that thing?

560
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,735
A cricket bat.

561
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,858
Isn't it a smasher?

562
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,355
I only hope you all can swim.

563
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,281
Take your hand off that.

564
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,325
Now you two, get in
the bottom of the boat.

565
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,072
Get in the bottom of the...

566
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,119
They don't understand English.

567
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,867
Sure, they do.

568
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,665
See?

569
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,538
Oh!

570
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,164
Please.

571
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,587
All right.

572
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,881
Now, I guess that's about all.

573
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,299
Don't forget Gretchen.

574
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:08,966
What?

575
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,169
Don't forget Gretchen.

576
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,129
Oh, that's her friend.

577
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,884
I'll help her in, dear.

578
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,887
Would you mind?

579
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,388
Oh.

580
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,939
- Now, then, Mr. Eckland, I
suggest you leave immediately.

581
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:24,766
Oh.

582
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,692
Lady, lady, do you mind?

583
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,064
Just get in the boat.

584
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,895
Well, you said it would...

585
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,025
I don't care what I said.

586
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,573
If by some miracle we do make
it, I'd be stuck with them.

587
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,116
Now get in the boat.

588
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,193
All right.

589
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:36,903
That's right.

590
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,614
No, no, no, no, not that!

591
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,324
We'd have had a use for that.

592
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,624
Come on.

593
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,872
Come on!

594
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,170
All right.

595
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:49,791
It's all right, now, don't be afraid.

596
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,670
Quiet, quiet.

597
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:51,376
Oh for goodness...
- Mr. Eckland,

598
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,927
please keep the boat quiet, the girls

599
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:53,969
are extremely frightened.

600
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,264
Will you shut up, lady?

601
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,467
Now, here, get off of my paddle.

602
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,471
Well, I'm terribly sorry,

603
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,053
but you put it there in
the first place, you know.

604
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,730
Now, that's all right,
children, don't be scared.

605
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,523
There we go.

606
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,465
Mr. Eckland.

607
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,921
Must you?

608
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,847
- What are you, some kind
of religious fanatic?

609
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,052
- I couldn't care less what
you do to yourself, but...

610
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,136
must you do it in front of the children?

611
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,187
No.

612
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,058
Well then.

613
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,017
Well then, tell them to turn around.

614
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,980
- That is not exactly what
I had in mind, Mr. Eckland.

615
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,109
Now, lady.

616
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,280
The name is Freneau,

617
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,699
Catherine Freneau.

618
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,697
I don't know what you had in mind.

619
00:33:58,912 --> 00:33:59,948
I don't even know who you are

620
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,199
or what you were doing on that island.

621
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,452
- Well, if you must know, an
American plane left us there.

622
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,872
from New Britain...
- I wanna go home.

623
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, Anne, it's rude to interrupt.

624
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,922
We were on our way from New
Britain to Port Moresby,

625
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,341
when the pilot was ordered to
pick up eight survivors of an

626
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,966
Australian bomber that
had crashed in the water.

627
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,136
Unfortunately our...
- Hey, you, take that

628
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,884
bat or whatever it is out of the water.

629
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,181
It's acting like a rudder.

630
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,679
Harriet, really?

631
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,260
The name's Harri.

632
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,811
All right, Harri.

633
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,809
He said he'd try and
come and pick us up later

634
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,062
but that was five hours ago and he.

635
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,394
Quiet.

636
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,773
You don't have to be so rude.

637
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,197
Quiet, I think I hear something.

638
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:54,882
What?

639
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:55,549
Put your heads down,

640
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,922
do as I tell you, keep your faces covered.

641
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,106
Hey, keep your face down!

642
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,334
Are they Japanese?

643
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,212
I don't know, do you want me to ask?

644
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,225
Hold on, we've gotta ride out the wake.

645
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,480
We're sinking!

646
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,402
- Well, don't just sit
there, damn it, bail!

647
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,152
Mr. Eckland, your language, really!

648
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,069
Just bail!

649
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,401
Do as I say!

650
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,861
Come on, you can move faster than that!

651
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,661
Come on, all of you!

652
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,079
Use your hands, anything!

653
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,906
Come on, keep bailing.

654
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,161
Faster!

655
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,209
Bail, why aren't you?

656
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,376
Ow!

657
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,248
Come on, now get to work!

658
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,799
Go on!

659
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,047
That's better.

660
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,252
Hold on to the boat, Harri!

661
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,462
Hold on!

662
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,924
Bail the boat!

663
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,632
Well, really.

664
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,676
Come on, girls.

665
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,723
Right, come on.

666
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,642
Come on, Anne.

667
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,104
Kings Point?

668
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,026
Get Houghton.

669
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,321
Is that you, Mother Goose?

670
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,867
- Walter, I can't tell
you how delighted I am.

671
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,616
- Oh, you've Mother Goosed
me for the last time.

672
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,696
What are you talking about?

673
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,326
Now don't play stupid with me,

674
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,625
You'd sell out your father
if you know who he was.

675
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,330
Oh no!

676
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,293
Walter?

677
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,294
What happened?
- Run along.

678
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,084
Frank, get them off of here!

679
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:43,713
Get who off?

680
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,669
You know who, get 'em off.

681
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,721
- No one could have known
we were there, Mr. Eckland.

682
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,343
The radio was destroyed.

683
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,891
Will you please stay out of this, lady?

684
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,013
I'm only trying to...

685
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,469
- I'm quite
capable of handling it

686
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,929
myself, thank you.
- I'm hungry!

687
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,435
I say, so am I!

688
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,232
Walter, what's?

689
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,904
Walter, who's?

690
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,742
Walter!

691
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,949
Thank you.

692
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,781
Now, suppose you tell me who's there.

693
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,207
Well.

694
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,875
I am Miss Catherine Freneau.

695
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,917
Who is this, please?

696
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,246
- Commander Frank Houghton
of His Majesty's Navy.

697
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,798
Who are you, Miss Freneau,
and what are you doing there?

698
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,671
I'd like to hear that myself, go ahead.

699
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,002
I am the daughter

700
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,760
of Charles Freneau, the
French Consul at Rabaul.

701
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,181
I heard children's voices.

702
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,132
Yes.

703
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,265
I am in charge of seven students
from the consulate school.

704
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,063
Four English, two French, one Australian.

705
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,687
All of them daughters
of diplomatic personnel.

706
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,064
When the bombing started, it
was decided to evacuate them

707
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,520
to Australia.

708
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,446
Unfortunately, the plane our group was on

709
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,365
put us down at Bundi.

710
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,613
And now Mr. Eckland
has been kind enough to

711
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,161
bring us here.
- Come on, come on.

712
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,453
What about Malcom Perry?

713
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,497
Well, I'm sorry, Commander.

714
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,916
The house had apparently
been attacked from the air

715
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,663
and when we found him.

716
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

717
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,340
- Commander, how soon do you
think you'll be able to...

718
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,214
arrange for our transportation?

719
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,919
I'd like to hear that as well, yeah.

720
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,630
- That's a difficult question
to answer, Miss Freneau.

721
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,966
If you'll just be a little patient.

722
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:13,890
No.

723
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,764
Never mind their patience, Frank.

724
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:16,685
My patience.

725
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,682
Get them off of here!

726
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,264
- All right, Walter,
I'll take it to the top.

727
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,724
Stand by.

728
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,237
Stand by.

729
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,217
- If you're waiting for
the big finale, I'm sorry,

730
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,045
this is all I do.

731
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:55,849
Oh, son of a...

732
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,722
Mr. Eckland.

733
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,601
I'm bleeding.

734
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,148
Oh dear.

735
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,782
Mr. Eckland,

736
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,490
we could all do with some food.

737
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:25,871
Elizabeth,

738
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,706
you and Harri open some tins.

739
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,462
Anne, Christine and Jenny.

740
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,669
Find the knives, forks and napkins.

741
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,720
That'll be a good trick, napkins.

742
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:34,467
Angelique, Dominique.

743
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,053
Hey what, be careful.

744
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,729
What are you doing with those?

745
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,401
Mr. Eckland, where are your tea things?

746
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,443
My what?

747
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,647
Your tea things.

748
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,606
- Last time I looked, they
were next to the finger bowls.

749
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,487
Hey, hey, be careful with that!

750
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,284
Didn't I tell you to?

751
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,577
Oh, it's an empty.

752
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,327
Are you standing by, Walter?

753
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:00,951
All set to go, Frank.

754
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,658
What did you work out?

755
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,118
A parachute drop.

756
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,544
A what?

757
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,872
They've got to be picked
up, Frank, not put down.

758
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,582
- We thought you
could do with more provisions,

759
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,009
what with all those extra mouths.

760
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,461
I want their mouths out of here.

761
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,761
When are you coming for them?

762
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,590
- Well, that's
rather difficult to say.

763
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,141
Well, try saying today.

764
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,765
I don't think it'll be today, Walter.

765
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,937
- Well, what's
making that parachute drop,

766
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,559
a seagull?

767
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,141
We can only manage a night drop.

768
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,773
There's no way to land.

769
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:30,899
Frank?

770
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,026
You still haven't said when
you're gonna get them off.

771
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,028
No, I haven't, have I?

772
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,529
Two or three weeks.

773
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,109
Two or three?

774
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,034
Four.

775
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:38,656
Four?

776
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,782
With luck.

777
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,615
We'll have to stay here a month?

778
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,042
I don't want to stay here.

779
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,829
- Well, Frank, you've slipped
it to me again, haven't you?

780
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,960
I'm sorry, Walter, there's a war on.

781
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,291
Oh, stop saying that!

782
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,045
Commander,

783
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,753
would you be so kind as to
contact my father in Rabaul

784
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,429
and have him inform the
parents of the girls

785
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,596
that they're quite safe?

786
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,765
- All civilian personnel
are being evacuated from

787
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,309
New Britain, Miss Freneau.

788
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,512
But I'll see to it that they're informed.

789
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,972
Signing off.

790
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,687
Three or four weeks.

791
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,019
I heard it, I heard that.

792
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,276
Mr. Eckland,

793
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,608
may I speak with you outside for a moment?

794
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:18,863
Some other time.

795
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:19,864
I've been up all night.

796
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,536
I'm going to bed.

797
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,039
Girls.

798
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,992
Go outside and play.

799
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,543
But stay close to the house.

800
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,666
Tell 'em to stay off the beach

801
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,338
or out in the open.

802
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,043
Mr. Eckland?

803
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,173
Yes, sir.

804
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,971
- It now appears likely
we'll remain here together

805
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:40,969
for some time to come.

806
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:41,890
Mhmm.

807
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,684
- This being the case, I
think it would be wise of us

808
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,730
to arrive at an understanding.

809
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,102
It must be quite clear to
you that the children must be

810
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,105
our first consideration.

811
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,440
Your first consideration.

812
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,738
I'm my first consideration.

813
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,363
- They are young, sensitive
and impressionable.

814
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,443
They've been through a most
- So am I.

815
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,119
trying experience,

816
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,620
and they will need a normal,
orderly routine established,

817
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,370
and I would expect you to do your share.

818
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,246
Oh, sure, sure.

819
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,203
- It was quite one thing
for you to live as you did

820
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,788
when you were alone on this island,

821
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,499
but you are no longer
alone and your behavior

822
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,051
is totally unsuitable.

823
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,254
Your language is common, your

824
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,510
eating habits...

825
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,465
revolting.

826
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,970
Your appearance disgraceful, and...

827
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,020
as for your drinking, that
must stop immediately.

828
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,441
I will not have the
children subjected to it.

829
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,359
You are, after all, the
only man with whom they'll

830
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,654
come in contact, that makes
you the father figure.

831
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,696
Are you finished?

832
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,279
Good, now let me tell you something.

833
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,951
I am not a father figure.

834
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,494
I am not an uncle figure,

835
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,867
or a brother figure or a cousin figure.

836
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,200
In fact, the only figure
I intend being is a

837
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,410
total stranger figure.

838
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,254
So now,

839
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,173
if you'll excuse me, I'm going to bed.

840
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,253
- And now I'm
supposed to cover my eyes

841
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,089
and run screaming from the
room, you'll be disappointed.

842
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:04,764
Ain't she a pip?

843
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,639
I doubt very much anything
you could do would shock me.

844
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,844
Let me repeat.

845
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,180
My only concern is for the children.

846
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,230
Well then, why don't you go and

847
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,524
concern yourself with them
and let me get some sleep?

848
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,478
- Gladly, as soon as you've
told me where we will stay.

849
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,029
Stay anywhere you like.

850
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,697
- Well, as
this hovel seems to be

851
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,149
the only shelter on the island,

852
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,155
it's obvious we will have to stay here.

853
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,032
You know what fat chance means?

854
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,829
This is my hovel, so why don't you

855
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,872
back out and let me get some sleep.

856
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,871
Very well.

857
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,347
Oh, for.

858
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,525
Huh, what, what, what?

859
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,194
What the?

860
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,551
Lady,

861
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,855
you are making a powerful enemy.

862
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,148
Girls, let's get in.

863
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,120
- You ought to
be ashamed of yourselves.

864
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,497
A gentleman simply does not enter a room

865
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,920
when ladies are not decent.

866
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,339
- Well, you
learn something every day.

867
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,171
I have to use the radio!

868
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,507
All right, Mr. Eckland,

869
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,590
you may come in now.

870
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,971
Oh.

871
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,412
Didn't you want to use the radio?

872
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,711
Yes, radio.

873
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,421
What's it doing over here?

874
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,133
Kings Point, this is Eckland.

875
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,462
Six Mitsu 104s heading east at 10,000.

876
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,047
Message received, Mother Goose.

877
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,007
Message received.

878
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,648
- Are you looking for
something, Mr. Eckland?

879
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,995
I asked you to stop
drinking, but you wouldn't.

880
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,286
Oh, no.

881
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,367
Where is it?

882
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,330
Somewhere where you won't find it.

883
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,460
Gone again.

884
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,086
Of all the meddlesome.

885
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,463
Oh.

886
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,464
Come on, prod, now where is it,

887
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,089
you got it up here?

888
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,921
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

889
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,005
Wait.

890
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,136
Oh you wait, you just wait!

891
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,853
Kings Point, this is Eckland again.

892
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,181
- Hello, Mother Goose,
this is Briar Patch.

893
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,982
Get Houghton on the double.

894
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,981
Big Bad Wolf is engaged.

895
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,188
- I don't care if he's
married, you get him.

896
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,772
You know, lady, you missed your calling.

897
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,323
You ought to carry a tambourine and put

898
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,820
fig leaves on statues.

899
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,322
What is it, Walter?

900
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,368
Frank?

901
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,196
Now this is a military
zone and you're in command.

902
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,998
You tell Miss Goody Two Shoes
here to get off my back.

903
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:04,950
Goody Two Shoes?

904
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:05,784
Yes, you tell her.

905
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:06,663
Tell her she's a pain in the...

906
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:07,494
Uh.

907
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,545
Please, Walter, be civil.

908
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:10,747
Civil?

909
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,707
Who pushed who out of whose home?

910
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,008
Who stole whose liquor?

911
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,301
Who bit whose hand?

912
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,299
Twice.

913
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,004
She bit you?

914
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,137
Miss Freneau?

915
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:18,884
No.

916
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,557
Now you tell her, you tell
her to give me back my booze.

917
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,055
You tell her to butt
out, you tell her to...

918
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,808
All right, Walter, I'll speak to her.

919
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,434
Here.

920
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,767
Yes?

921
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,146
Miss Freneau.

922
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,945
I'm sure you've noticed
that Mr. Eckland is not the

923
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,363
most sociable sportsman in...

924
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,112
Mr. Eckland is a rude, foul-mouthed,

925
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,693
drunken, filthy beast.

926
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:40,402
- Give me that.
- Well, be that

927
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:40,986
as it may.

928
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,537
This is the filthy beast speaking.

929
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,114
Now listen, Frank, when
you send those supplies,

930
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,164
send plenty of whiskey.

931
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,501
- I insist you do nothing
of the kind, Commander.

932
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,125
Now be quiet, both of you.

933
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,421
We've arranged for the parachute drop

934
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,250
to take place tomorrow night at 2200.

935
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,461
I suggest therefore if
you want anything at all,

936
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,512
you better give me a list of your needs.

937
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,509
Whiskey!

938
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,464
Yes, we know about you.

939
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,141
What about Miss Freneau and the girls?

940
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:03,808
Summer clothes.

941
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:04,725
Girl magazines.

942
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:05,597
Peppermint drops.

943
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,812
Tennis balls!

944
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:09,889
Bow and arrow!

945
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,225
Girls, please.

946
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,809
I have prepared a list.

947
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,065
Now hold it.

948
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,738
You've taken over everything else,

949
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,657
but the radio is still my responsibility.

950
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,452
Eight nighties.

951
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,539
Would you repeat that, Walter?

952
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,246
- Mr. Eckland isn't here
any more, Commander.

953
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,455
I'll give you the list.

954
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,416
Eight nighties.

955
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:38,797
Nighties?

956
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:39,719
That is correct.

957
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,764
In various sizes, starting
with children's size six.

958
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,638
And would you please make
that one a bunny suit?

959
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:46,434
A what?

960
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,852
A bunny suit.

961
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,270
I'm sure you've seen them, Commander.

962
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,064
You know, with the hands and feet.

963
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,774
With the hands and feet.

964
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,236
Mother Goose?

965
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,915
Mr. Eckland?

966
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,244
Big Bad Wolf is calling
you on the wireless.

967
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,544
Oh.

968
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,622
Don't touch anything.

969
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,128
In fact, you'd better get off the boat.

970
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,470
Look, his shirt,

971
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,270
and his pants too.

972
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,906
Good morning.

973
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:46,324
Er, I'm wanted on the radio.

974
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,073
Ah.

975
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,405
Oh.

976
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,917
Hey, Kings Point, this is Eckland.

977
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,091
Come in, Mother Goose.

978
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,465
This is Briar Patch.

979
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,047
Well, you had something to tell me.

980
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,473
- Big Bad
Wolf had a message for you

981
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,301
concerning the parachute drop.

982
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,183
He gave it to Goody Two Shoes.

983
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,103
Oh, er.

984
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,230
Er, Commander Houghton couldn't wait.

985
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,653
He asked me to give you the message.

986
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,657
Well?

987
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,828
Well what?

988
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,700
The message.

989
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,623
What message?

990
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,872
The message message.

991
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,750
Oh, oh, that message.

992
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,252
Oh, I wrote it down for you.

993
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,839
That's in French.

994
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,013
Oh, is it?

995
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,512
Oh, so it is.

996
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,969
Read it, please.

997
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,019
No, no, no, no, no.

998
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,691
You're reading it in French.

999
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,063
Well, it's written in French.

1000
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,815
Oh...

1001
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,271
Translate it.

1002
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,608
Oh, you want it in English?

1003
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,570
Commander Houghton says
there's too much enemy activity

1004
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,121
in the area to chance a...

1005
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,742
How do you say in English "parachute?"

1006
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,666
Parachute.

1007
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:20,963
Oh, really?

1008
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,338
There's too much enemy activity
in the area to chance a

1009
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,761
parachute drop, and he asked us to make do

1010
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,464
with the supplies we have.

1011
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,514
Oh no.

1012
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,217
Mr. Eckland?

1013
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,018
Er?

1014
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,642
- I don't suppose there's any
use my asking your permission

1015
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,441
to share certain of your
personal belongings with us?

1016
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,110
- So far, you've shared
me out of my home, my bed,

1017
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,688
my food and my shirt.

1018
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,819
Now how about sharing
some of my things with me?

1019
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,570
Would you like some tea?

1020
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,321
Tea?

1021
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,777
Lemon or milk?

1022
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:51,907
Milk?

1023
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,408
Oh sorry, we're out of milk.

1024
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,034
Oh.

1025
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,080
But we could use

1026
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,535
some additional place
settings, some rope, some

1027
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,541
tools, and above all,

1028
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,247
a change of clothing.

1029
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,173
Above all, I could use some whiskey.

1030
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,000
Now how about making a trade?

1031
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,461
Sorry.

1032
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,170
That I can't do.

1033
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,096
Then, madam, I wish you a good day.

1034
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,549
Mr. Eckland, wait!

1035
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:13,758
Hello, Mr. Eckland.

1036
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,218
The answer is no.

1037
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,935
I wouldn't think of it.

1038
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,810
Ah!

1039
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,562
You stepped on my foot!

1040
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,734
You put it under mine!

1041
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:24,857
Look out!

1042
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,608
All a bunch of nuts.

1043
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,612
Oh, now, hold it.

1044
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,038
And what have you got there?

1045
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,827
Oh no!

1046
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,624
Come back here, you pirate!

1047
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,877
Mr. Eckland, stop chasing the girls.

1048
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,583
I'm not chasing them.

1049
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,044
They're all crooks, and
you're the crookiest.

1050
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,971
And a good day to you, Mr. Eckland.

1051
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,792
Rumplestiltskin?

1052
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,624
Rumplestiltskin?

1053
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,381
Can anyone hear me?

1054
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:33,384
I can hear you, Rumplestiltskin.

1055
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,215
I can hear you, too.

1056
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,096
Where's Mr. Eckland?

1057
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,347
He is not here.

1058
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,270
Nobody is here except my friend Gretchen.

1059
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,564
We're not well today.

1060
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,892
Say hello, Gretchen.

1061
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,980
Did you hear Gretchen?

1062
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,609
She said hello.

1063
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,736
Hello, Gretchen, I'm sorry

1064
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,362
you're not well today.

1065
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,410
Go and get Mr. Eckland, please?

1066
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,113
The Filthy Beast?

1067
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,789
Oh, we don't speak to him.

1068
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,241
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1069
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,452
Come on, get away from there.

1070
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,706
Come along, Gretchen.

1071
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,163
Is that you, Walter?

1072
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,713
No, it's Gretchen.

1073
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,008
- Keep them away from
that radio, will you?

1074
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,301
You keep them away from the radio.

1075
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,137
Beat it.

1076
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,266
- Miss Freneau told us
to stay in the house.

1077
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,472
- After breakfast, may we
go out with the others?

1078
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,343
No.

1079
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,970
Not until you're feeling better.

1080
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,721
It's Gretchen that's not well.

1081
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,553
And I'm tired of staying here.

1082
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,263
Oh, do stop complaining.

1083
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,314
You sound like Anne.

1084
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,274
Is anything wrong?

1085
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,321
- The whole Japanese
navy's anchored off shore,

1086
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,319
they're sending a boat in.

1087
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,320
Where are the other children?

1088
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,241
Er, there...

1089
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,193
Come on, let's round them up.

1090
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,074
Let's get them in the shack.

1091
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,449
Mr. Eckland, shouldn't we report the

1092
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,909
Japanese to Commander Houghton?

1093
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,711
- In five minutes, he can
talk to them personally.

1094
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,752
You and Gretchen stay in the house.

1095
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,765
Come on, hurry it up.

1096
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:24,512
Get in the house.

1097
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,318
Quickly, where are the other two?

1098
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,940
- They're down on the
beach collecting coconuts.

1099
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,067
- I told you to
keep them off the beach.

1100
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,113
No, you didn't.

1101
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,317
- Yes, I did, but you
weren't listening as usual.

1102
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,694
Come on, let's go.

1103
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,201
Show me where.

1104
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,783
Anne's up in one of those trees.

1105
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:49,662
Uh-huh.

1106
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,460
Get down.

1107
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,412
Stay here, don't move.

1108
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,404
Hey, stay, shh.

1109
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,875
If she opens her mouth, we've had it.

1110
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,077
Jenny hasn't said a word since she

1111
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,663
left her parents seven days ago.

1112
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,339
I thought you might have noticed.

1113
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,042
She can still scream, can't she?

1114
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,512
Here.

1115
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:58,750
There you are.

1116
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,331
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

1117
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,041
Baby, shh, baby, shh.

1118
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,546
Don't cry, shh, shh.

1119
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,845
Don't cry, don't cry.

1120
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,686
Stay up.

1121
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,029
I wish I knew what they were saying.

1122
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,280
Shh.

1123
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,491
The one with the glasses is the cook.

1124
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,993
Their captain adores turtle soup.

1125
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,334
He sent them ashore for turtles.

1126
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,458
There doesn't seem to be any.

1127
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,961
Oh, it's all right,
they're going to leave now.

1128
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,515
Oh dear.

1129
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,967
What?

1130
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,270
- One of them suggested they
bring back coconuts instead.

1131
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,518
It's a bad dream.

1132
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,944
- The cook says the captain
wants turtle soup or nothing.

1133
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,737
He's sick of coconuts.

1134
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,565
Good for him.

1135
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,400
Oh!

1136
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,030
What?

1137
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,612
He just called the captain a dirty name,

1138
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,367
and they're leaving.

1139
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,083
Help!

1140
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,756
I'm slipping.

1141
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,179
Oh!

1142
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,551
Quick, let's go.

1143
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,234
Go on, beat it.

1144
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,035
Come on, buzz off.

1145
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,282
You're not supposed to be on the boat.

1146
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,113
Get off the boat.

1147
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,762
Thank you.

1148
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,389
Thank you.

1149
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,850
And what's your name?

1150
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,896
You got a name, haven't you?

1151
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,450
See this whistle?

1152
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,657
Would you like to have it?

1153
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,616
Okay.

1154
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,872
Now all you have to do is
repeat three simple words

1155
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,329
after me.

1156
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,004
Is that a deal?

1157
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,674
Just repeat three words.

1158
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,046
All right.

1159
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,672
Elephant.

1160
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,139
Elephant.

1161
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,806
Rhinoceros.

1162
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,807
Rhinoceros.

1163
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,058
Wrong.

1164
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,104
Why?

1165
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,272
No, not why, wrong.

1166
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:07,318
Wrong is the third word, you lose.

1167
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,236
No, give me that back!

1168
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:13,111
Oh, I didn't think you'd
be a sore loser, here.

1169
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,570
Fine.

1170
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,920
- I'm sorry,
we're all out of whistles.

1171
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,215
I told Harri she could help us.

1172
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,587
Help us do what?

1173
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:31,758
Fix your boat.

1174
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:35,213
Harri knows everything about boats.

1175
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,173
How'd you like to swab down the deck?

1176
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,258
Smashing, I'd love to!

1177
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,389
Good, you'll find a mop down below.

1178
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,140
Go ahead.

1179
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,650
Oh, hello, hello.

1180
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,445
Er, well, you do that.

1181
01:05:58,663 --> 01:05:59,528
Do that, mhmm.

1182
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,329
But do it quietly.

1183
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,006
Mr. Eckland?

1184
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:19,931
Quiet, quiet.

1185
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,930
Want me to mess this up?

1186
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,852
Mr. Eckland?

1187
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,058
- Now, I know you've
saved up a lot to say,

1188
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,769
but would you mind
spreading it out a little?

1189
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,399
You're doing it wrong.

1190
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,901
It's backwards.

1191
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,448
No, it isn't.

1192
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,991
See, the boat's upside down.

1193
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,946
Do it this way so when
you turn it over, you...

1194
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,125
How can I get anything done when you're

1195
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,623
chattering all the time?

1196
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,170
Besides, you should be working.

1197
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,747
Go on.

1198
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,175
It can't be.

1199
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,013
Red light!

1200
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,482
So this is where you are.

1201
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,364
What are you all doing here?

1202
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,115
Look at their clothes!

1203
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,538
They're my clothes.

1204
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,785
But they're filthy!

1205
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,617
No they're dirty, I'm filthy.

1206
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:29,872
All of you get back to the house.

1207
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,329
It's nearly time for your lessons.

1208
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,631
- Mr. Eckland asked us
to help fix his boat.

1209
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,128
Well, I'm sure he will excuse you now.

1210
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,676
But we want to stay here.

1211
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,094
I don't...

1212
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,264
What did you say, Jenny?

1213
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,091
We want to stay here.

1214
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,973
- Mr.
Eckland got her to speak.

1215
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,770
I created a monster.

1216
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,848
A talking person.

1217
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,437
Well, better do as she said.

1218
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:55,019
Get going.

1219
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,535
Thank you, Mr. Eckland.

1220
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,114
Next time I want them to talk
or do anything, I'll call you.

1221
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,198
Well, it's not my fault that boats are

1222
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,410
more fun than lessons.

1223
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,632
I did it on purpose.

1224
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,506
Nothing is ever your fault, Mr. Eckland.

1225
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,843
And if I return seven wild
Indians to their families,

1226
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,145
who trusted me with them, that
won't be your fault either.

1227
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,265
Shh-shh-shh.

1228
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,645
Huh?

1229
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,572
- Well, you don't have to be
a schoolteacher all the time.

1230
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,899
I am not a schoolteacher.

1231
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,986
But some form of discipline
has to be maintained.

1232
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,954
Shh.

1233
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,252
When did you teach them something useful?

1234
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,249
What do you suggest?

1235
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,877
Drinking and swearing?

1236
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,627
Why are we whispering?

1237
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,675
Oh!

1238
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,465
I don't know, why were we whispering?

1239
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:07,640
Hmm?

1240
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,138
Is it edible?

1241
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,970
No, I get lonely.

1242
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,396
Now why don't you teach
them something like that?

1243
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,099
Something practical, like catching fish.

1244
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,776
- Oh well, that doesn't
seem too difficult.

1245
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,196
I mean, if you can do
it, I'm sure anyone can.

1246
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:21,772
Try it.

1247
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,108
I haven't had my morning laugh yet.

1248
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,693
All right.

1249
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,129
Oh, that was good.

1250
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,714
Good.

1251
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,356
Woo!

1252
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,688
I didn't quite understand the reason

1253
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,394
for that last movement.

1254
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,354
Would you mind demonstrating it again?

1255
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,410
I have an infuriating lack of talent

1256
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,534
for doing simple things.

1257
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,241
- You probably don't do
'em right, that's why.

1258
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,873
All right, all right, just stay there.

1259
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,920
I like fish, but fish don't like me.

1260
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,969
- All right, now, be
quiet, just keep still.

1261
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,092
Give me your hand.

1262
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,388
Cup them, cup them.

1263
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,010
That's right.

1264
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,467
Oh.

1265
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,051
Mhmm.

1266
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,512
Now, watch what you're doing.

1267
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,142
Hey, here she comes again.

1268
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,689
How do you know it's a she?

1269
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,062
Her mouth is open, now be quiet.

1270
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,436
Okay, now,

1271
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,487
now slowly.

1272
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,190
Slowly, now.

1273
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,195
Slowly.

1274
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,871
Mr. Eckland?

1275
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,916
Aren't we moving too slowly now?

1276
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,618
Hmm, hmm?

1277
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,544
Shouldn't we.

1278
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,842
Shouldn't we what?

1279
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,168
What?

1280
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,049
You said shouldn't we.

1281
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,298
Shouldn't we what?

1282
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,981
Well, you've got the hang of it now.

1283
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,149
Oh.

1284
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,521
We didn't catch a fish.

1285
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,315
That's right, that's right.

1286
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,611
We didn't.

1287
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,904
But you got the hang of it.

1288
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,573
You already said that.

1289
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:29,866
Oh, I did, huh?

1290
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,193
Mr. Eckland, are you going to show me

1291
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,745
how to catch a fish or aren't you?

1292
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,907
I aren't.

1293
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,676
I wanna go back now.

1294
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,975
- Just as soon as I've
picked some of these berries.

1295
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,927
What if they're dangerous?

1296
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,388
- Oh, we can
always ask Mr. Eckland.

1297
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:02,190
- Yeah, if he says eat them,
we'll know they're poisonous.

1298
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,357
Oh.

1299
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:03,934
Oh!

1300
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,654
Something bit me.

1301
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,653
A snake, there, next to your leg.

1302
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:11,324
Woo!

1303
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,027
It bit you, it bit you!

1304
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,202
Oh.

1305
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,154
Let's go back, quickly.

1306
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,760
I don't know what she's saying.

1307
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,678
snake, I saw it.

1308
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,885
It bit mademoiselle on the leg.

1309
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,145
Okay, everyone out.

1310
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,726
- Girls,
do as Mr. Eckland says.

1311
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:46,935
I'll be all right.

1312
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,486
I want to watch!

1313
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,906
Oh, Harri, please.

1314
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,740
Is it painful?

1315
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,325
Your hand is wet.

1316
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,751
Yeah.

1317
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,544
Now this is going
to hurt a little.

1318
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,745
You should enjoy that.

1319
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,297
Quiet.

1320
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,793
Go ahead, you can yell
if you feel like it.

1321
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,925
I don't feel like it.

1322
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,261
Okay, it's all done.

1323
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,092
- Do you really
think it was poisonous?

1324
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,144
Well, no sense taking any chances.

1325
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,563
Lie back, this isn't going to hurt.

1326
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,651
Mr. Eckland,

1327
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,529
I want you to know I really
appreciate what you're doing.

1328
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:35,780
Save it.

1329
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,750
Come in, Kings Point, this is Eckland.

1330
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,248
Briar Patch, Mother Goose.

1331
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,423
Bo Peep here.

1332
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,968
- Get Houghton, will
you, we got trouble here.

1333
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,135
What's wrong, Walter?

1334
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,760
- What kind of snakes
they got around here, Frank?

1335
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,341
Is that a rhetorical question, I hope?

1336
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,552
No, Miss Freneau went and found one.

1337
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,353
Good grief, is she?

1338
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,100
She seems all right at the moment.

1339
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,852
Find out if they're
poisonous, will you, Frank,

1340
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,400
and if so what we can do about it.

1341
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,647
Right away.

1342
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,103
Oh, and Walter.

1343
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,530
Until we get a positive
identification, don't try

1344
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,700
and be a movie hero
and suck out the venom.

1345
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:33,758
Walter?

1346
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,506
Are you there, Walter?

1347
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,430
Yeah, I'm here, Frank, shoot.

1348
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,724
Plug in the phones, will you?

1349
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,560
Yeah.

1350
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,776
Go ahead.

1351
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,449
It's not good.

1352
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,071
I've got Dr. Bigrave here.

1353
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:02,950
He's checked with Tropical
Medicine, I'll put him on.

1354
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,406
Mr. Eckland.

1355
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,912
There are three varieties of
serpent indigenous to those

1356
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,496
islands and I'm afraid all of
them are extremely poisonous.

1357
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,251
Well, I opened the wound, Doctor.

1358
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,128
I think I got all the venom out.

1359
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,175
- Taken orally, it can't
hurt you, Mr. Eckland,

1360
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,424
but if she were bitten and
it's entered her bloodstream,

1361
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:19,629
there's nothing we can do.

1362
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,216
I'm afraid she's bought it.

1363
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,141
Well, there must be some...

1364
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,561
- The venom is neurological,
it attacks the nervous system.

1365
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,014
The end will come suddenly
preceded by a general

1366
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,065
numbing sensation and dizziness.

1367
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,768
Oh, oh, I see, Doctor.

1368
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,398
- I suggest you do
everything to make her as

1369
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,024
comfortable as possible.

1370
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,106
Including the liberal use of any strong,

1371
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,783
analgesic sedative you happen to have.

1372
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,452
- I don't have
anything like that.

1373
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,700
- Nonsense, Walter, you've
been using one for years.

1374
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:45,621
No, I haven't.

1375
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,415
Oh yes, I have, yeah.

1376
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,539
Call me, Walter, when it's over.

1377
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:51,745
Goodbye.

1378
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,296
Yeah.

1379
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,175
It's bad, isn't it?

1380
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:03,973
Where's the whiskey?

1381
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,767
Oh, I knew it.

1382
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,219
I'm going to die and
you're afraid I'll take

1383
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,804
the secret to my grave.

1384
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,605
- Whiskey is still the
best thing for snake bite.

1385
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,727
Where is it, lady?

1386
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,103
Stop calling me lady.

1387
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,855
It sounds so awful.

1388
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,437
It's in the oven.

1389
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,070
It can't be in the oven.

1390
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:18,988
I looked there.

1391
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:19,860
I know you did.

1392
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,362
Gretchen told me.

1393
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,944
I put it there after you looked.

1394
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,296
- Hey, I
thought that was for me?

1395
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,595
- Just want to make
sure it hasn't gone bad.

1396
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:46,554
Come on, drink that.

1397
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,681
It won't hurt you, go on.

1398
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,812
Hey, hey, be careful.

1399
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,065
You'll ruin your amateur standing.

1400
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,067
I'm French, Mr. Eckland.

1401
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,319
My parents started me
on wine mixed with water

1402
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,026
when I was six.

1403
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,123
But I don't believe in excessive drinking.

1404
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,411
Especially in front of children.

1405
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,337
Oh.

1406
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,165
No, the truth is,

1407
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,046
when my mother died,

1408
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,344
I became the mistress of...

1409
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,092
the consulate.

1410
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,548
Oh, oh.

1411
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,270
- I presided over all
the diplomatic dinners.

1412
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,519
We had martinis before dinner,

1413
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,225
white wine with the fish.

1414
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,310
Red wine with the main course,

1415
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,271
champagne with the dessert.

1416
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,651
Cognac with the coffee,

1417
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,654
and port after dinner.

1418
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,996
Sounds great.

1419
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,000
- Isn't it
getting hot in here?

1420
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,791
Woo, isn't it getting hot in here?

1421
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,172
Isn't it getting hot in here?

1422
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,128
No, no, you mustn't move around now.

1423
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,554
Come on, just...

1424
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,348
That's right, just lie quietly.

1425
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,098
I bet you think I'm an iceberg.

1426
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,401
Do you know how old I am?

1427
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,568
No.

1428
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,145
The truth is,

1429
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,777
we've lived in 11 countries

1430
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,405
I can speak seven languages.

1431
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,111
I'm excellent at bridge.

1432
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,663
I play the cello very well.

1433
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,035
I'm double-jointed,

1434
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,663
and I know how to ride a camel.

1435
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,455
I was engaged once.

1436
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,288
Huh, uh-huh.

1437
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,918
His name was Cesare and he worked

1438
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,797
in the Italian consulate at Fiume.

1439
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,753
Do you know where Fiume is?

1440
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,338
Yugoslavia, isn't it?

1441
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,220
No, it's in Yugoslavia.

1442
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,892
He called me Carissima and gave me

1443
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,436
handkerchiefs with my initials on them.

1444
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,015
Every time he wanted to kiss me, he'd say,

1445
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,854
And then afterwards, he'd say,

1446
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:02,314
You've had enough.

1447
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,614
- Oh, Cesare would never
have done to my leg

1448
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,569
what you did.

1449
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,202
Oh, probably couldn't reach it.

1450
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:20,120
- I liked what you did to my
leg, the last part, I mean.

1451
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,329
Oh, that.

1452
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:24,291
Tell me, I'd like to know.

1453
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,172
What did my blood taste like, hmm?

1454
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:27,298
Delicious, now come on.

1455
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,176
No, no, no, no, I'm being serious.

1456
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,472
What did it taste like?

1457
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:32,265
How would I know?

1458
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,717
I'm not a vampire.

1459
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,427
Oh.

1460
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:38,104
Was it salty?

1461
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,431
A little salty, yes.

1462
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,016
Too salty?

1463
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:42,271
No, it was just right.

1464
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,476
Oh no.

1465
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,234
You thought it was too salty,
I can tell you didn't like it.

1466
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,905
No, no, I liked it.

1467
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:48,857
Oh, really?

1468
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:49,566
I liked it.

1469
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,571
You're not just saying that?

1470
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,823
No, great blood.

1471
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,121
Please, now, buzz off, will you?

1472
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,322
Miss Freneau isn't feeling very well.

1473
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,204
Now come on.

1474
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,670
I'm gonna kill that rotten snake.

1475
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,505
Anne!

1476
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,342
Your opinion of me is correct, you know.

1477
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:16,551
I'm a...

1478
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,012
a picture straightener.

1479
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,597
You're a what?

1480
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:22,933
A picture straightener.

1481
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:23,517
Oh.

1482
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,602
- When I see a picture
on a wall that doesn't

1483
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,108
hang straightly...

1484
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,235
I straighten it.

1485
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,566
Oh, you do that.

1486
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:34,448
- And I brush my teeth every
morning and every night.

1487
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,201
And if I don't have a toothbrush...

1488
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,828
I use my finger.

1489
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,125
Mm.

1490
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,830
Oh.

1491
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,381
I feel so numb.

1492
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,799
Numb?

1493
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:48,750
Where?

1494
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:49,834
Everywhere!

1495
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,010
What does it mean?

1496
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,964
Oh, you'd better lie down.

1497
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,219
And I'm so cold.

1498
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,268
Oh, why am I so cold?

1499
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,390
Oh, I'm dizzy.

1500
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:00,095
I'm very dizzy.

1501
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:01,475
You lie down, just rest.

1502
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,350
Oh.

1503
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,102
That's right.

1504
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:07,356
- Oh, come closer so I
can tell you something.

1505
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,107
My coconut is empty.

1506
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,241
Oh.

1507
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,122
Have a belt yourself.

1508
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,574
Oh...

1509
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:21,954
no, no thanks.

1510
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,000
There'll be plenty of time later.

1511
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,329
I mean, you go ahead.

1512
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,587
What was she like?

1513
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:31,884
She, who?

1514
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:34,588
The lady who drove you to this.

1515
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,389
Drove me to what?

1516
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,054
Drink.

1517
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,181
Oh, there was no lady.

1518
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,683
That was your wife.

1519
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,731
No, there was no wife.

1520
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,531
- Then from what are
you running away from?

1521
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:54,277
Mmm?

1522
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:55,950
Oh, I'm not running away.

1523
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,279
Oh, there must have been some, some.

1524
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,488
Well, there was.

1525
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:01,948
A necktie.

1526
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:02,577
A what?

1527
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,534
A necktie.

1528
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:05,743
I was late for class one morning.

1529
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:08,376
I forgot my tie, they wouldn't let me in.

1530
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,007
How long ago was that?

1531
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,301
About eight years ago.

1532
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,004
- Weren't you a little
old to be going to school?

1533
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,431
Oh, I wasn't going, well...

1534
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,061
I was teaching.

1535
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,309
Oh!

1536
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,481
I was a professor of history.

1537
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,268
And what about the necktie?

1538
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,103
- Well now this is no
time to talk about me now.

1539
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,608
Why not?

1540
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,532
Why not.

1541
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:37,859
Well...

1542
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,286
See, I thought they'd be more
interested in what was inside

1543
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,204
a man's head, not around his neck.

1544
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,123
Mmm.

1545
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,826
Then I noticed they all wore ties.

1546
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,581
They all looked alike,
they all behaved alike,

1547
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,504
and they all talked alike.

1548
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,252
But they were all going the same way,

1549
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,630
no matter which way they
said they were going.

1550
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,212
So, what was the use of
teaching them history,

1551
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:58,217
or anything?

1552
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,264
They weren't learning by it.

1553
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,843
Still creating the same old problems.

1554
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,348
So I packed, got on a boat,
and got away from them.

1555
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,226
Mmm.

1556
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,603
Now look what they've got me doing.

1557
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,730
Ah-ha.

1558
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,485
What's so funny?

1559
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,281
You're the schoolteacher.

1560
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,035
Oh dear.

1561
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,574
What's that?

1562
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,204
The snake.

1563
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,333
But that's not a snake.

1564
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,289
It looks like a snake.

1565
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,591
You ninny.

1566
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,668
You better tell Mr. Eckland.

1567
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,253
I wanna go home.

1568
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,509
He'll be furious.

1569
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:23,931
Why?

1570
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,225
Because Miss Freneau's not dead.

1571
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,773
This is Eckland, is Houghton there?

1572
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:37,979
I'm here, Walter.

1573
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,110
Frank.

1574
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,191
It's all over, Frank, she's.

1575
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:44,869
I'm sorry.

1576
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,196
Yeah.

1577
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:48,330
What do I do about the kids, Frank?

1578
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,033
They don't know yet.

1579
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:52,209
They'll have to be told, Walter.

1580
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,912
Yeah.

1581
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:54,587
Stick around, will you?

1582
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,164
I may need you later.

1583
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,089
Sure, sure.

1584
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:58,758
I'll stand by.

1585
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:10,511
Mr. Eckland?

1586
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,063
Oh, oh, oh.

1587
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,890
Just a minute, I...

1588
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,277
Er, will you all come over here, please?

1589
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,478
Mr. Eckland?

1590
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,313
Please.

1591
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:21,238
There's something I want to tell you.

1592
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,782
There's something we want to tell you.

1593
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:23,733
Just a minute, now.

1594
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,659
This isn't going to be easy.

1595
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,237
Now, er...

1596
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,283
Those of you who are old
enough to understand what I'm

1597
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,367
going to say will be able to

1598
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,874
help the ones who...

1599
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:36,545
well.

1600
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,373
Mr. Eckland?

1601
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,879
Please, there's a good girl.

1602
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,552
Now, Miss Freneau...

1603
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:46,006
who I guess we all gave
a very difficult time to

1604
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,510
when she...

1605
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,137
well.

1606
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,345
Miss Freneau has...

1607
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,313
has gone away.

1608
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:55,514
No she hasn't.

1609
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:56,941
You tell him, Anne.

1610
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:57,938
Why me?

1611
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,940
Because it was all your fault.

1612
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,111
Er, just a minute.

1613
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,531
Tell me what?

1614
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,155
It wasn't a snake, it was this.

1615
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,533
But that's not a snake.

1616
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,705
It looks like a snake.

1617
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,877
But that's not a snake.

1618
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,330
Here.

1619
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,379
Watch out for the thorns.

1620
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,206
Uh!

1621
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,586
Thank you.

1622
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,126
Not a snake.

1623
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,303
It looks like a snake.

1624
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,470
No, that doesn't.

1625
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,229
This looks like a snake!

1626
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,247
Is it morning already?

1627
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,204
Walter?

1628
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,790
Are you there, Walter?

1629
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:02,873
I have the chaplain.

1630
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:06,211
I thought it might be a
comfort if he said a few words.

1631
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,046
Never mind the chaplain, Frank.

1632
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:09,472
She's alive.

1633
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,299
The snake's dead.

1634
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:14,635
Walter,

1635
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:15,936
explain yourself.

1636
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,106
Walter?

1637
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,026
Walter?

1638
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:24,778
Walter!

1639
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,319
Were you really a schoolteacher?

1640
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,955
All of you, raise your right hands.

1641
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,083
Come on, raise your right hands.

1642
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:43,748
All right.

1643
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,708
Now none of you heard
anything I said in there,

1644
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,259
you got that?

1645
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,216
Okay.

1646
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:50,547
Now spit.

1647
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,299
Go ahead, spit.

1648
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,222
The first one who breaks
the pledge will get warts.

1649
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,564
warts?

1650
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:49,155
Er, Mr. Eckland?

1651
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,691
May I speak with you, please?

1652
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:52,779
Oh.

1653
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,530
You don't have to shout.

1654
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,747
I don't even have to talk.

1655
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,497
Mr. Eckland, do I

1656
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,295
owe you an apology or a...

1657
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,624
an explanation or anything like that?

1658
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,709
Probably, some other time.

1659
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,920
I seem to remember someone saying that a

1660
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,255
drop or two helps.

1661
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,931
Ooh!
- Not today!

1662
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:18,592
I went through enough nonsense with you

1663
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,724
just to get this much.

1664
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,266
Mr. Eckland.

1665
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:28,023
What exactly did I do yesterday?

1666
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,196
Nothing.

1667
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,273
You just put a flower
between your teeth and

1668
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,154
danced around the room naked.

1669
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,450
But I couldn't have!

1670
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,698
I did?

1671
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,080
You mean you don't remember?

1672
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:42,199
No.

1673
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,284
Oh.

1674
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:46,416
Oh, well then, you don't
remember anything I said, do you?

1675
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,463
Why, what did you say?

1676
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,507
Nothing.

1677
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,302
- Well, there doesn't seem
to be much to remember then,

1678
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:53,878
does there?

1679
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,759
No, no, no, no.

1680
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,300
- Unless you mean what you
said about running away from

1681
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:02,011
civilization because of a necktie.

1682
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,189
- I thought you said
you didn't remember anything!

1683
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,107
Oh, nothing after that.

1684
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,776
There wasn't anything after that.

1685
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,899
- Then when did I dance
around naked with a

1686
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,321
flower between my teeth?

1687
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,818
I only told you those things about me in

1688
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,150
strictest confidence.

1689
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,109
Why, I haven't told anyone!

1690
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,195
You just told me, didn't you?

1691
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,497
You are the one who told me.

1692
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:22,664
Well, I don't care.

1693
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,663
I only told you because
I thought you were dying.

1694
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,837
Sorry I disappointed you.

1695
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,129
Ugh.

1696
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,800
- I don't mind that you
were a schoolteacher.

1697
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:37,846
There you go again!

1698
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,596
Now it's none of your business.

1699
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:43,143
- I thought you were
running away from something

1700
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,017
much worse than that.

1701
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:46,893
I wasn't running away, I was escaping,

1702
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,474
from hypocrites like you,
who have to get drunk

1703
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,605
before they can let go.

1704
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:56,691
There.

1705
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,367
Why then, you're a happy man.

1706
01:30:58,578 --> 01:30:59,489
That's right.

1707
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,617
- And that's why you drink so
much, because you're so happy.

1708
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:03,913
Yes.

1709
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,203
Is this boat tilted?

1710
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:09,957
No!

1711
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,380
Now you listen to me.

1712
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,423
Before you mess around
with other people's lives,

1713
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,046
you better take a look at your own.

1714
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:16,297
And what's wrong with it?

1715
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,379
- Well, maybe if you stopped
straightening pictures and let

1716
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,260
men wear their own pants,

1717
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,011
maybe they'd be able to
touch you without asking

1718
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:43,200
Dear Lord.

1719
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,451
- Oh Harriet,
it's Dominique's turn

1720
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,123
to say grace.

1721
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,798
Amen.

1722
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,510
Oh, Mr. Eckland.

1723
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,768
Oh.

1724
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,220
I thought if you had enough food, I.

1725
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,055
Well, certainly.

1726
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:10,810
Look, he's combed his hair.

1727
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,019
And he's actually wearing socks.

1728
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,980
Well, you see, my feet were chilly.

1729
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,985
Oh...

1730
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,987
we're delighted you could come.

1731
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,070
Anne, move over next to
Elizabeth so Mr. Eckland

1732
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,075
can sit down.

1733
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,406
I don't want to sit there.

1734
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,286
She never wants to do anything.

1735
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:29,116
That's not true.

1736
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,496
I wanna go home.

1737
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:31,998
All right, Anne.

1738
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,420
Change places with Harriet.

1739
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:34,212
The name's Harri.

1740
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,790
Oh, sorry. Harri.

1741
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,296
On the other side of Mr. Eckland.

1742
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:39,342
Thank you, Harri.

1743
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,591
We fellows should stick together.

1744
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,405
Pass to Monsieur Eckland.

1745
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:09,615
That's my dinner.

1746
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,450
Well, then, take it.

1747
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,787
I'm sick and tired of tinned beef.

1748
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,122
Then give it back.

1749
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:17,832
I wanna go home.

1750
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,634
Why can't we have fish once in a while?

1751
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,053
Professor Eckland was giving me lessons,

1752
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,051
but he never finishes what he starts.

1753
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:28,350
Raise your arms.

1754
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:29,472
Lower your head.

1755
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:33,055
- Drink something, give
him something to drink.

1756
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,105
Quick.

1757
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:34,977
Drink!

1758
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:37,105
Yeah, hold it.

1759
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,436
Jenny!

1760
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:41,697
Well, how strange.

1761
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:42,568
Why?

1762
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,991
That you should bring me this.

1763
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,033
I've done it before.

1764
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:46,451
Yes, I have.

1765
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,949
Shut up.

1766
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,408
Well, since it's here, I'll.

1767
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,995
- There's already a beverage
on the table, Mr. Eckland.

1768
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:56,829
Yes, what?

1769
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,664
Coconut milk.

1770
01:33:58,883 --> 01:33:59,999
You're kidding.

1771
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:03,131
- Well, it happens to be very
tasty and quite healthful.

1772
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,303
Oh, I'm sure it is.

1773
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:08,132
Ah-ah-ah, Mr. Eckland?

1774
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,279
Delicious.

1775
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,658
Coconut milk.

1776
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:32,331
Young coconuts must love it.

1777
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,657
Get back, get back!

1778
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:37,058
Come on, let's get back in the shack.

1779
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,186
I hurt my ankle when you...

1780
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:41,733
when I fell.

1781
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,528
Now get up.

1782
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,480
Let's see.

1783
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,315
Put your weight on it.

1784
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,026
That's not too bad.

1785
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,246
All right.

1786
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,575
That's fine.

1787
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,262
This is Eckland, get Houghton.

1788
01:36:10,473 --> 01:36:12,886
Standy by, Mother Goose.

1789
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,344
Yes, Walter, what is it?

1790
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:18,895
A plane, Frank. He dove at us.

1791
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,393
Go on.

1792
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,019
Go on where? He spotted us.

1793
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:23,567
- And now you'd like me to
take you off the island.

1794
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:24,234
Is that it?

1795
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:24,980
Naturally.

1796
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:25,856
Really, Walter.

1797
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,529
You never give up, do you?

1798
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,527
All right, tell me what happened.

1799
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,234
- I've already told you, a
Japanese plane flew over.

1800
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,193
What kind?

1801
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,119
I don't know what kind.

1802
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,787
- Well, that's what you're
there for, isn't it?

1803
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:36,910
Really, Walter.

1804
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,616
Planes are supposed to fly over.

1805
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:41,873
We wouldn't need you where
planes didn't fly over, would we?

1806
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:43,670
Now, just because one gets a little close.

1807
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:44,621
A little close?

1808
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:45,706
Now you listen to me, Frank,

1809
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,666
you get us out of here by tonight.

1810
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,968
- I really don't think
it'll be tonight, Walter.

1811
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,590
Well, thanks a lot.

1812
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,638
I won't need you when
I get the launch ready.

1813
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,308
- Walter, I'd forget about
the launch if I were you.

1814
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,727
You're completely ringed in
there, which means you can only

1815
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,224
travel by night,

1816
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,682
in a boat which you can't be too sure of.

1817
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,267
And even if you could break
through, which I doubt,

1818
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,352
Port Moresby's the only
place open and that's over

1819
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:08,813
200 miles away.

1820
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:10,443
Then do something.

1821
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:11,944
Walter...

1822
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,698
I have 32 men in precisely
the same position you're in.

1823
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,076
How is it that I spend most
of my time listening to you?

1824
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:21,284
Now be a good chap and relax, signing off.

1825
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,586
The fathead.

1826
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:26,538
I'll be down at the launch.

1827
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,178
Mr. Eckland?

1828
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,471
Hmm?

1829
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:44,898
Oh, I thought your
ankle was bothering you.

1830
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,435
Well, it's feeling much
better now, thank you.

1831
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,234
Fine.

1832
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:49,436
I wanted to thank you.

1833
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:50,941
For saving my life, I mean.

1834
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,398
I behaved quite stupidly.

1835
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:53,357
Can you forgive me?

1836
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:54,191
Sure.

1837
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,867
- I wouldn't want you
to think badly of me.

1838
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:57,035
Do you think badly of me?

1839
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,032
No.

1840
01:37:58,247 --> 01:37:59,533
I don't think badly of you either.

1841
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:00,580
Well, good for you.

1842
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,124
Mr. Eckland?

1843
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:05,461
You can kiss me if you want.

1844
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:09,840
I may?

1845
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:14,003
Oh, my darling.

1846
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,215
I have thought of nothing
else since that moment we met.

1847
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:20,141
This first burning kiss
is but the beginning.

1848
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:22,595
Tonight you will leave those children

1849
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:24,430
and come live with me on my boat.

1850
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,265
What are you doing?

1851
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,817
But of course, how thoughtless of me.

1852
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,735
We must be careful.

1853
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,281
What time can I expect you tonight?

1854
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,451
- But mademoiselle doesn't
let us out at night.

1855
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:46,622
Oh well.

1856
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,212
- Mr. Eckland,
have you been listening to me?

1857
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:59,299
- How can I help it with
you screaming in my ear?

1858
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,725
- Because you've
been talking total nonsense,

1859
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:02,926
as usual.

1860
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:05,638
It's quite clear you know nothing
whatsoever about children.

1861
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:06,347
Uh-huh.

1862
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:08,148
And you're an expert, of course.

1863
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,520
Well, I know one thing.

1864
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:10,395
Elizabeth is at that...

1865
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:11,647
Wait, wait, wait.

1866
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:12,979
Hand me those pliers, will you?

1867
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:14,188
The small ones.

1868
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:15,193
Those?

1869
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:17,024
Thank you.

1870
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,529
Now what were you saying?

1871
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:21,782
- Elizabeth is at that difficult
age and you frightened her.

1872
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:22,988
Yeah.

1873
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,414
Well, I'm at a difficult age myself.

1874
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,582
She nearly scared me to death.

1875
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:30,254
How about teaching those
kids the facts of life,

1876
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,001
or don't you feel you're
up on the subject?

1877
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,299
I wouldn't exactly call them backward,

1878
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,547
not the way they were
watching during lunch.

1879
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,048
Watching what?

1880
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,843
It works!

1881
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,893
Course it works!

1882
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,596
Now what were they watching during lunch?

1883
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,602
They were watching us.

1884
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,103
Watching us what?

1885
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,685
Watching us watch each other.

1886
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,987
So we watched each other, so what?

1887
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:57,440
Well, they're not blind, you know?

1888
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,526
- What do they think watching
is, a proposal of marriage?

1889
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:01,701
Whoever said anything about...

1890
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:04,951
- Just because a man puts
on socks and comes to lunch?

1891
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,499
- If you think I'd want
to get involved with an

1892
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,498
undisciplined, self-indulgent
escapist like you.

1893
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,080
- Well, that's better than
being a frustrated spinster

1894
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,586
who can't find a husband.

1895
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:34,351
It's Matalava, sir.

1896
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,607
Mother Goose is requesting a chaplain.

1897
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:37,278
A chaplain?

1898
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,606
Good heavens, he's killed her.

1899
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:39,610
No, sir.

1900
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:42,067
They want to get married.

1901
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,743
Married?

1902
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:46,698
Goody Two Shoes and the Filthy Beast?

1903
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,578
What's taking him so long?

1904
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:55,210
He's had enough time to get
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

1905
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,960
Oh, Mr. Eckland, really.

1906
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,964
- Oh, stop calling me Mr.
Eckland, it sounds ridiculous.

1907
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:00,885
Walter?

1908
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:02,838
Are you ready, Walter?

1909
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,799
Just a minute, Frank.

1910
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,682
Here, use my tie.

1911
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:10,387
Oh.

1912
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:13,974
Thank you, Harri, but ties
don't suit Mr. Eckland.

1913
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:17,985
Oh.

1914
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,484
Well, have you got the chaplain, Frank?

1915
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,282
Yes, he's here.

1916
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,701
There's a little paperwork, Walter.

1917
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,699
Bride's full name.

1918
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:27,904
Catherine,

1919
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:28,989
Louise,

1920
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:30,324
Marie,

1921
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:33,411
Ernestine Freneau.

1922
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:35,336
Groom's full name.

1923
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:37,915
Walter Christopher Eckland.

1924
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:40,709
Witnesses.

1925
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,760
Who's the maid of honor?

1926
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:44,838
Elizabeth Anderson.

1927
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:47,049
And the best man?

1928
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,263
Harri McGregor.

1929
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:54,643
Harri?

1930
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:57,146
Just believe me.

1931
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,727
Proceed, padre.

1932
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,278
Thank you.

1933
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:02,606
Now.

1934
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,487
Is everyone ready?

1935
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:06,238
Yes, padre.

1936
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,411
Dearly beloved.

1937
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,744
We are gathered here...

1938
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,544
and there,

1939
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:20,215
in the presence of these
witnesses to join together

1940
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:21,962
this man and this woman

1941
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:24,135
in the bonds of holy matrimony

1942
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:26,339
which is an honorable estate,

1943
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,389
instituted of God.

1944
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,467
Into this holy estate,

1945
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:32,803
these two persons come now

1946
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:33,762
to be joined.

1947
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,973
Duck, down, quickly!

1948
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:43,813
If there be any present...

1949
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:44,982
Who know any

1950
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:46,282
just cause...
- Hurry up, quickly!

1951
01:42:46,494 --> 01:42:47,905
- Why they may not
lawfully

1952
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,782
be joined in marriage,

1953
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:52,705
I require him now to make it known,

1954
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:56,376
or ever after to hold his peace.

1955
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,247
Anything there?

1956
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:01,206
Good.

1957
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,290
Now, then.

1958
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:06,094
Do you, Walter Christopher
Eckland, take this woman

1959
01:43:06,305 --> 01:43:08,718
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1960
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,220
To love and to cherish,

1961
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:13,267
to have and to hold,

1962
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,095
so long as you both

1963
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,431
shall live?

1964
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:23,311
Mr. Eckland?

1965
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,442
Do you, -

1966
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,024
Walter Christopher Eckland...

1967
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:27,653
Walter!

1968
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,736
- To be your
lawful wedded wife?

1969
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,116
Hold it, padre, hold it.

1970
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:33,867
Mr Eckland, do you...

1971
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:34,869
I do, I do.

1972
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,541
Get Houghton, quick.

1973
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:37,708
What is it, Walter?

1974
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,036
They came back, Frank.

1975
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,120
I told you they would.

1976
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:41,079
Who came back?

1977
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,335
You know who, now listen.

1978
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:51,719
Did you hear that?

1979
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:52,890
Yes, I'll get onto it right away.

1980
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:54,263
Stand by.

1981
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:57,061
I want the name and exact
position of every Allied submarine

1982
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,981
within 12 hours running distance
between here and Matalava.

1983
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:00,807
And get onto it right away.

1984
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,437
Aye-aye, sir.

1985
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,275
Walter?

1986
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:08,026
I told you to stay where you were.

1987
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,858
The plane's gone.

1988
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:13,286
I was afraid I was a widow
before we were even married.

1989
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,077
Mr. Eckland?

1990
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:18,705
What should we do now?

1991
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:19,750
Well,

1992
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:20,998
all right, we'll take another whack at it

1993
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,329
if you will, padre.

1994
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:23,880
So take your time, but hurry it up.

1995
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:27,004
Oh, yes, yes, of course, I understand.

1996
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:28,426
Let me see now.

1997
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:31,971
Do you, Walter Christopher
Eckland, take this woman?

1998
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,424
We did that part, padre.

1999
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,725
Oh, I'm sorry.

2000
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:37,802
I'm a little rattled.

2001
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:38,637
Let me see here.

2002
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,188
All right, then.

2003
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:42,106
Do you, Catherine Louise

2004
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:44,605
Marie Ernestine Freneau,

2005
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,903
take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband,

2006
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:48,901
to love and to cherish,
to have and to hold,

2007
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,403
for as long as you both shall live?

2008
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,609
I do.

2009
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,410
- For as much as you
have consented together

2010
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,705
in holy wedlock, and have
given and received a ring

2011
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:57,997
in token of your troth.

2012
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,370
Wait a minute, what ring?

2013
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:00,826
Didn't we do the ring?

2014
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:02,252
No, we didn't do the ring.

2015
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:04,580
- Oh, I'm afraid
we'll have to do the ring.

2016
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,300
Hold it, padre.

2017
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:22,059
All right, padre, we did the ring.

2018
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:23,060
Oh good.

2019
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:25,892
For as much as you have consented
together in holy wedlock,

2020
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,194
and have given and received a
ring in token of your troth,

2021
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:30,772
I now declare you husband and wife.

2022
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,321
You may kiss the bride, Mr. Eckland.

2023
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:39,789
Mr. and Mrs. Eckland,

2024
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,287
if you're finished now, I
suggest you get the hell

2025
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:43,539
out of there.

2026
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:45,541
- Yeah, that's a good
suggestion, padre, thank you.

2027
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,460
Hold on, Walter, hold on.

2028
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:49,462
What, Frank?

2029
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,760
- One of your American
submarines, the Sail Fin,

2030
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,337
is in your area.

2031
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,673
She's running submerged, so
we will not be able to make

2032
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:59,384
radio contact with her
until she surfaces tonight.

2033
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:00,434
But she ought to be able
to get through to you

2034
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:02,478
by dawn tomorrow.

2035
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,932
She'll have to lie off the
reef and await your signal,

2036
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,732
so I suggest you stay on the beach.

2037
01:46:06,944 --> 01:46:07,775
Have you got that?

2038
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:08,477
I've got it.

2039
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,938
- Oh and incidentally,
Walter, congratulations to you

2040
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:12,272
and Mrs. Eckland.

2041
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,983
And the best of luck to all of you.

2042
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,033
And they're going to need it.

2043
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,288
Walter, are you awake?

2044
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:25,869
Uh-huh.

2045
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:30,040
I was thinking about yesterday.

2046
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:34,177
Somehow the word "wedding"
has always called to mind

2047
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:36,505
a different picture.

2048
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:38,135
- Somehow, the words
"wedding night" have always

2049
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,763
called to mind a different picture, too.

2050
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,932
- Well, we couldn't very
well have left the girls

2051
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,060
by themselves.

2052
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:48,232
They're our responsibility.

2053
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:49,935
They're not our children.

2054
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,440
- If they were our children,
they'd have never gotten

2055
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:52,691
to be our children,

2056
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,569
would they?

2057
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,487
You won't be coming with us, will you?

2058
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:03,622
How did you know?

2059
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:05,951
- Oh, when a woman has been
married as long as I have,

2060
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:09,163
she knows what her husband's thinking.

2061
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:10,417
Oh well.

2062
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:11,840
I'll shove off right after the rest of you

2063
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:13,917
and get to Port Moresby in no time.

2064
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,674
- You know what
Commander Houghton said.

2065
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:18,596
I can't leave my boat.

2066
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:21,261
Must be a good one.

2067
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:24,436
- Good and bad is all the
dowry you're going to get.

2068
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:26,104
I'm thinking of starting
a charter service,

2069
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:27,351
right after the war.

2070
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:29,273
Somewhere around the
Solomons and New Hebrides.

2071
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:32,228
Good money there for anyone
who knows the islands.

2072
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,404
All right.

2073
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:36,948
I'm not leaving without you.

2074
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,276
Oh, yes you are.

2075
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:42,283
Someone's got to get those
children back to their parents.

2076
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:44,205
Lord, you're stubborn.

2077
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,123
That's right, now come on.

2078
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:47,166
There, come on.

2079
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:49,461
That's it, go to sleep.

2080
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:09,392
They're here.

2081
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:11,099
Girls?

2082
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:12,479
Hold it.

2083
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,282
That's a Japanese patrol boat.

2084
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,909
Oh my God.

2085
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:28,082
They picked a fine time to check us out.

2086
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:29,283
What about the submarine?

2087
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,371
- She won't surface
while that thing's there.

2088
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:32,999
Get off the beach!

2089
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:34,167
Come on, girls, wake up.

2090
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:36,796
- Quickly as you
can, wake up, come on!

2091
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,172
Take your gear!

2092
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:39,594
Now this.

2093
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:03,530
They're sending two boats ashore.

2094
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:04,782
Now these fellas aren't
looking for turtles,

2095
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:05,612
they're looking for us.

2096
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,493
- Oh, what if the submarine
leaves without us,

2097
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:08,494
can't you radio them?

2098
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:10,325
- No, I can't make contact
while they're submerged.

2099
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,250
Now, take the kids to the launch,

2100
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,499
and for God's sakes, keep them quiet.

2101
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:15,000
Oh.

2102
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:16,501
Walter?

2103
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:17,753
Hmm?

2104
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,675
I look awful in black.

2105
01:51:27,014 --> 01:51:28,471
Over here.

2106
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,182
The house is on fire.

2107
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:33,055
I know, I started it.

2108
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:35,557
When did you do that?

2109
01:51:35,772 --> 01:51:36,979
Last night when you were asleep.

2110
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:38,352
What else was there to do?

2111
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:39,933
Hey, hide all that stuff.

2112
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:41,142
We're getting off this island.

2113
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:42,021
Is the submarine there?

2114
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:42,977
It had better be.

2115
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:43,983
Are we going home now?

2116
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:44,779
That's right.

2117
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,606
I don't wanna go home.

2118
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:48,946
Oh come on.

2119
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,823
Get in the dinghy and hurry it up.

2120
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:58,122
- Commander
Houghton said there'd be

2121
01:51:58,337 --> 01:52:00,795
a signal, he wasn't joking.

2122
01:52:01,006 --> 01:52:03,123
- They're coming out
to meet us on a launch.

2123
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:05,341
Dead slow.

2124
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,088
Dead slow, sir.

2125
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:10,755
Answer's dead slow.

2126
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,725
Holy Cow!

2127
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,732
An enemy patrol boat giving chase.

2128
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,074
Ready the bow torpedo tubes.

2129
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:40,910
- Tubes forward, con,
make ready forward tubes.

2130
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:43,212
Submerged reef 300 yards from shore.

2131
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:45,289
No torpedo clearance.

2132
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:48,300
The launch is heading out

2133
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,549
beyond the reef.

2134
01:52:50,764 --> 01:52:52,847
They're following.

2135
01:52:53,058 --> 01:52:55,926
That's what he's up to, he's
bringing them out to us.

2136
01:53:04,903 --> 01:53:06,769
They're plastering him.

2137
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:10,573
He's cleared the reef.

2138
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:13,697
They're right behind him.

2139
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:18,448
Bearing?

2140
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:19,908
Mark.

2141
01:53:21,128 --> 01:53:22,209
Zero-two-five.

2142
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:24,253
Range?

2143
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,875
Mark.

2144
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:28,128
Six-five-oh.

2145
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:30,881
Tubes one and two open outer doors.

2146
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:33,463
Tubes one and two open outer doors.

2147
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:40,265
Check fire, check fire.

2148
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,937
The launch is veering into target path.

2149
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:55,660
Get going, get going.

2150
01:54:09,217 --> 01:54:10,833
Final bearing.

2151
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:12,793
Mark.

2152
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,504
Fire one.

2153
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:16,339
Fire two.

2154
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:27,524
On the nose!

2155
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:32,772
Not that it'll do those
poor devils any good.

2156
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:35,654
Let's take her up and look for survivors.

2157
01:54:37,996 --> 01:54:39,783
Walter?

2158
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,619
Mr. Eckland!

2159
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,660
Walter?

2160
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:47,336
Oh, zit!

2161
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,163
What's the matter with this thing?

2162
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:51,170
Mr. Eckland?

2163
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:57,717
There's his hat!

2164
01:54:57,933 --> 01:55:00,596
Jenny, move over, I want to catch it.

2165
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:07,231
Mrs. Eckland, I presume?

2166
01:55:07,442 --> 01:55:09,729
Mr. Eckland!

2167
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:11,311
Took me forever to tie the wheel off.

2168
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:13,522
I thought I'd have to stay with her.

2169
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,982
Our boat, The Catherine, I'm sorry.

2170
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,113
- Yeah, well, in a war,
everybody loses something.

2171
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:19,444
I'm just glad it was that Catherine.

2172
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:22,158
Hey, wait a minute, hold it.

2173
01:55:22,374 --> 01:55:23,785
Wanna invite me in first?

2174
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,081
Oh, oh!

2175
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:26,329
Walter, no, you'll tip us in!

2176
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:30,588
Not if you do it right, now.

2177
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:32,040
Just shift your weight, get over there.

2178
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:33,466
Walter, I really don't think it's such a

2179
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:34,463
good idea.
- Now please, please.

2180
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:38,342
Just this once, will you do it my way?

2181
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:39,422
All right.

2182
01:55:53,905 --> 01:55:55,112
Shut up.

2183
01:55:55,323 --> 01:55:57,906
I didn't say anything.

2184
01:55:58,118 --> 01:55:58,949
Looks like we'll be taking on passengers

2185
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:00,993
after all, Mr. Cartwright.

2186
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:02,194
Break out a raft.

2187
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:03,871
Aye-aye, sir.

2188
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:06,032
Ah.

2189
01:56:06,251 --> 01:56:09,335
I wonder if they serve
coconut milk on submarines.
