1
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:40,798
# Daddy wouldn't buy
me a bow-wow, bow-wow

2
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:43,487
# I've got a little cat,
and I'm very fond of that

3
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:46,918
# But I'd rather have a
bow-wow-wow-wow-wow... #

4
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,323
Well, do you like it?

5
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:53,361
- What?
- Well, the parting, you clot.

6
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,958
- What's the matter with it?
- Well, it's on the other side.

7
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,361
Why?

8
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:02,196
I don't know, I... thought it gave
me a sort of intellectual look.

9
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:04,398
It conceals the incipient baldness.

10
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:07,918
- I thought Sue was on leave.
- No, she's due back this evening.

11
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:14,563
Hello. It looks like you've been
jumped on by a 20-plus flock of wolves.

12
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,839
- I tried to pull out of a flat-out
dive just now. - Oh, good show.

13
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:20,448
The damn stick needed Carnera to move it.

14
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,084
The harder I pulled, the
more the nose went down.

15
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,563
It felt for a moment as if
the controls were reversed.

16
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:30,317
- And were they?
- Of course not, you clot, or I wouldn't be here.

17
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:36,238
There was a lot of buffeting too. It was
almost as if I'd suddenly run into a...

18
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,598
a solid sheet of... water, or something.

19
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:41,082
Really?

20
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,556
Why don't you marry her?

21
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:48,204
You know, all prospective
father-in-laws are a bit frightening.

22
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,526
- After all, mine was.
- Yours wasn't the great John Ridgefield.

23
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,924
- What, because he makes a few aeroplanes?
- A few aeroplanes?

24
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:57,721
He owns a hundred ruddy acres of
factory, he's a millionaire twice over

25
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:59,918
and Sue's his only daughter.

26
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,961
Anyway, heiress of not, I'm meeting her train,
I shall take her for a quiet little drive

27
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:07,319
and ask her to marry me
simply, firmly and directly.

28
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,567
What's the matter?

29
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:22,806
Oh, I don't know, I just thought it
was a good place to stop for a breather.

30
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,964
Oh, how nice.

31
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,999
Sue, what do you think of me?

32
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,968
- As a driver?
- Er, no.

33
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,999
As a man.

34
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,879
Oh. Well, I...

35
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,156
I told you, I...

36
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,566
I think I prefer you with your
hair parted on the other side.

37
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,839
- Sue, I...
- Yes?

38
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,162
- Sue...
- Yes, Tony?

39
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:30,357
Tony, I've got my answer ready. In fact,
I've had it ready for an awful long time.

40
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:32,807
Oh, gosh.

41
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,567
Is that all you can say,
Tony? Just, "Oh, gosh"?

42
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:46,361
- You have looked at this from every angle?
- I haven't left an angle out, I promise you.

43
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:50,765
- I mean, you know the sort of chap I am.
- I know the sort of chap you are.

44
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:54,039
- Not on your level at all.
- Miles above.

45
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:55,965
Oh, gosh.

46
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:59,842
Please, Tony, stop saying "Oh, gosh".
Can't you think of anything else to say?

47
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,164
I love you so very much.

48
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,960
I shan't be a tick.

49
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,158
It's time this came off.

50
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,166
Give it to me, I'll keep it as a souvenir.

51
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,721
Mrs Garthwaite.

52
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:25,847
Mrs Garthwaite.

53
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:30,679
Mrs Garthwaite? Mrs Garthwaite. I suppose if
I say it often enough, I shall get used to it.

54
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,206
- Hello, Eddie.
- ? Tony, you old basket.

55
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,365
- Got anything going to Ridgefields?
- Sure, we're bound to have.

56
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:41,923
Why Ridgefields, though?
- Because I went and married a Ridgefield.

57
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:45,005
- You don't say? - I'm off to get
the once- over from her old man.

58
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,767
Well, I'll have to treat
you with respect from now on.

59
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,527
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thanks.

60
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,366
You're welcome.

61
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:53,524
An Anson here, takeoff 14:30.

62
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,559
- Fine.
- Sign here.

63
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,164
There you are, darling. Ridgefields.

64
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:21,119
- And it's all your
father's? - Mm-hm.

65
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,800
We're landing.

66
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,442
Hi. Susie!

67
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:42,758
Hi!

68
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,760
- Your father?
- No, Will Sparks, our chief designer.

69
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,481
- Oh, Will!
- I saw you from the office windows.

70
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,917
Susie, darling!

71
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:55,007
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you, Will.

72
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,597
- What have you done? You're thinner.
- Oh, I've gone on the wagon.

73
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:02,800
- Will, why?
- With all these Americans about, you can't get it.

74
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:06,762
I hate beer! Though I'll be
off it tonight in your honour.

75
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,924
- So this is the gent.
- This is the gent.

76
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:10,447
I've heard a lot about you.

77
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:13,446
I've heard a lot about you. I'm glad
you had the sense to pick a flyer.

78
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:16,879
For a moment, I thought
you were my father- in-law.

79
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,284
- Glad to meet you and welcome to Ridgefields.
- Thank you.

80
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,405
Oh, your dad's at a board meeting. I was asked
to tell you he won't see you before dinner.

81
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:28,484
- Are you coming to dinner?
- I haven't been asked.

82
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,122
- Oh.
- Well, I suppose he wants to keep it family.

83
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,922
But you are family, Will.

84
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,687
- Of course, I am coming to the do tonight.
- Oh dear, is there a do?

85
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,720
Slap-up. Champagne, the
whole board of directors.

86
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,362
- How are you, Mason?
- Very well, thank you, Miss Susan.

87
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,285
I'll come as far as the office block.

88
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,879
I wish I worked union hours.

89
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,079
- How many people work here?
- Twelve thousand.

90
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,804
- Twelve thousand?
- Yes, we've got another 8,000 over at Hillbank.

91
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,049
- What's that? -
Top-secret, sir.

92
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,164
Those are test-beds, aren't they?

93
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:46,607
- Is this top-secret going to win the war, Will?
- A good deal more than that, if you ask me.

94
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,563
- Hello, Factor, how are you?
- Very well, thank you, madam.

95
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,964
- This is my husband.
- Welcome, sir.

96
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:14,201
He called me madam. I realise now
I've been "Miss" for far too long.

97
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,241
I simply love being madam.

98
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,796
However hideous your threshold,
do you know what my duty is?

99
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,998
- No, what?
- I'll show you.

100
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,722
- Tony, no!
- Hang on to your hat.

101
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,646
- This could be quite a drop.
- Tony!

102
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,319
Tony, drop me. You're not strong enough.

103
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:34,359
- Not strong enough?
- No, you're not.

104
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,160
- Which way?
- This way, sir.

105
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,800
- Right, here we go.
- This way.

106
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:41,598
Take my cap off.

107
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:43,241
This way, sir.

108
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:48,487
Blimey.

109
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,441
Tony.

110
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,646
Oh!

111
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:56,962
Oh.

112
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,598
Oi.

113
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:06,637
Chris!

114
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:12,085
- How are you, darling?
- Hello, Sue.

115
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,325
- Meet your new brother-in-law. - How
do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

116
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,837
- I suppose it's too late to say congratulations.
- Not at all.

117
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,799
Congratulations.

118
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:22,726
- Oh, Chris, what is that?
- It's the RAF badge.

119
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,486
You get it when you pass the interview.

120
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:28,316
- Oh, I thought you were going into the navy.
- I've changed my mind.

121
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,201
- Did you get my present?
- Oh, darling, thank you so much.

122
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:34,638
- It was lovely. We adored it, didn't we?
- Oh, yes, rather. We adored it.

123
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,963
Good. Er, let's have a drink.

124
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,044
- What was it?
- Paperweight.

125
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,318
- When are you going in?
- About six months, I think.

126
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:45,681
In the meanwhile, I'm learning to fly. Dad's
got one of his ex-pilots teaching me at Hillbank.

127
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:46,717
Tiger Moth.

128
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,206
- Darling, how exciting. Have you gone solo yet?
- Not yet. I think I may tomorrow.

129
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:52,921
- Whisky?
- No, thank you, darling.

130
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,606
Not for me, thanks. No, it's too early.

131
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,243
- Since when have you been swigging whisky?
- I'm not at school now, Sue, I'm in the RAF.

132
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:00,279
Well, practically, anyway.

133
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,124
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

134
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:05,124
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you.

135
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,399
- How many hours dual have you done?
- Rather a lot.

136
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,644
- Fourteen.
- Oh, that's not too bad.

137
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,565
I knew a fellow who did 20 before he passed.

138
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,964
I don't suppose his name
was Ridgefield, though.

139
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:17,045
How many hours dual did
you do before you went solo?

140
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,558
Tony's an exceptional case. One
of the great geniuses of the air.

141
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,561
Like Dad.

142
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,917
He went solo after only
two-and-a-half hours dual.

143
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,004
Really?

144
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:32,838
Would you like to know something
rather shocking? I get airsick.

145
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,767
- You shouldn't worry, you'll soon get over that.
- Yes?

146
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,924
Yes.

147
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,961
- What the heck is that?
- Dressing gong.

148
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,240
Chris, give me a quarter of an hour for
my bath and then come up and talk to me.

149
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,159
- I won't be a
second. - Mm-hm.

150
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,199
- Approve?
- Terrific.

151
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,968
He's just been telling me about
that do on the Gestapo prison.

152
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,999
You must have used a thumbscrew
to get that out of him.

153
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,242
I had to, practically.

154
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:06,520
It was a wonderful thing, Sue. They came in
at 50 feet and flew slap down the main street.

155
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,559
But of course you'll know it all.

156
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:13,807
I'll be able to shoot a line
about my new brother-in-law now.

157
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,998
Looks as if I'll need one.

158
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:19,165
You're a bit unhappy about
it all, aren't you, darling?

159
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:23,163
Oh, no. Not really.

160
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:30,004
Why don't you reapply for a ground job?

161
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,563
- What do you think Dad would say if I did that?
- Well, does it matter?

162
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,281
You know it does.

163
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:39,998
Anyway, I don't want to let him
down, Sue. Heaven knows I don't.

164
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,084
- Chris.
- Hm?

165
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,838
Would you let me talk to him?

166
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:51,166
No, thanks awfully, Sue. If anyone's
got to talk to him, I've got to.

167
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,201
As a matter of fact, I half thought
I might tackle him about it tonight.

168
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:59,197
Not about a ground job, I mean RAF ground
job, but, well, commandos or something.

169
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,560
- Commandos?
- I've got to show him it isn't a matter of guts.

170
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:08,247
Look, you're either born to fly or
you're not. I'm not. I'm really not.

171
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:15,205
Darling, you go downstairs and
give yourself another whisky,

172
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,284
then take him aside and
tell him how you feel.

173
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:21,207
- It's going to be jolly difficult.
- Well, I'll be there behind you.

174
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,482
Darling. I'd almost forgotten.

175
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,520
Come on, you two.

176
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,121
Here's to you both.

177
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:41,921
- To us.
- To us.

178
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,799
- Tell them that from me.
- Father.

179
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:47,727
I don't like it, JR. We may find the
Ministry will never agree to it at all.

180
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:50,965
If they want, we stop
production on the 696 altogether.

181
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:54,080
- Nervous?
- Nervous? I'm scared stiff.

182
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:57,040
- That'll be the second. Good night.
- Good night, JR.

183
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,999
Hello, Father.

184
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,925
Hello, Susan.

185
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,407
This is Tony.

186
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,758
So, this is Tony.

187
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:11,596
The DFC and Bar I know
about. What's the AFC for?

188
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,559
Oh, just for bumbling around.

189
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:18,444
They don't usually give that for bumbling around.
Well, I'm very glad to meet you at last, Tony.

190
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,956
I must say, I'm surprised
at Susan falling for a flyer.

191
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:25,365
Christopher, I've just had Fletcher on the
phone. He says he hopes you may go solo tomorrow.

192
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,320
- Yes, Dad, I know.
- Well done.

193
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,359
Who knows, we may make a pilot of you yet.

194
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:31,080
- What time is it to be?
- At 10:30.

195
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:33,517
Hm. Well, let's go in.

196
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,362
You sit here, will you,
Tony? Place of honour.

197
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,643
- Quite a room, eh?
- Yes, quite a room.

198
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,486
I hope you like the pictures.
There's some of them quite well known.

199
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:51,645
Of course, Susan hates them all, I know that.

200
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,964
Yes, I sent her to Oxford to get an education

201
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,637
and all she comes back with is a passion for
donkey-tailed doves and modernistic music.

202
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,397
Where she gets her tastes from, I don't
know. Certainly not from me or her mother.

203
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,245
Mother liked modern music very much.

204
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,722
First I've heard of it. If she
did, she didn't let on to me.

205
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,997
- No.
- This is lobster Dominique,

206
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,767
a sort of speciality de la maison.

207
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,527
No, not for Mr Christopher.
He's flying tomorrow.

208
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,720
Fletcher says young Jackson's
gone solo after six hours.

209
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,645
Yes, he's rather good.

210
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,317
Is this fellow running a sort of
flying kindergarten over there, sir?

211
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,357
Just the two boys.

212
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:27,367
Jackson, that's my head of airframes,
his son's waiting to go into the RAF too,

213
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:29,478
so I've let Fletcher take him on as well.

214
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,758
Won't do them any harm
to get a start, eh, Tony?

215
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:35,688
No, you'll probably shatter your RAF
instructor by going solo in about 20 minutes.

216
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:38,640
That's right, something like that
won't look so bad on the record.

217
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:41,760
14 hours wouldn't have been so good.

218
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,004
That's the noise we heard this afternoon.
It comes from the test-beds, doesn't it?

219
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,609
Yes, I heard you were asking questions.

220
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,606
Well, I tell you what. I'm giving
this party down at the works,

221
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,003
and on our way, well, you're
a member of the family now.

222
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,438
I don't suppose it'll do any harm for
you to have a look at our little secret.

223
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,484
I think it's the most
exciting sound I've ever heard.

224
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,646
It isn't only the sound
that's exciting, Tony boy.

225
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,439
- Evening, Joe.
- Good evening, JR.

226
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,604
- How's the missus?
- That stuffs done her good.

227
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:27,083
- Told you it would. Good evening, Mike.
- Good evening, JR.

228
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:29,358
Hm. Put up the lights.

229
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,003
- What the heck is it, sir?
- It's the aircraft engine of the future.

230
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:39,119
- Where's the propeller?
- There is no propeller.

231
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:42,001
- How does it keep the aircraft in the air, then?
- By propulsion.

232
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,516
- Propulsion?
- Yes. Jet propulsion.

233
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:46,560
Come on, I'll show you.

234
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,405
You two had better stay there.

235
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,046
- By the way, don't call me sir.
- What do I call you?

236
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:57,558
Susan calls me father, Chris calls
me Dad. You can take your choice.

237
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:04,238
Now, this is something quite extraordinary.

238
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:08,247
Like all great inventions, from the
wheel to radar, perfectly simple.

239
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,848
Yes, I know it looks complicated,

240
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:15,279
but the beauty is how little there is
to it and how much power comes out of it.

241
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,843
Now, there's a fan here in
the front which draws in air.

242
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,449
- The air's heated here with paraffin.
- Paraffin?

243
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:22,887
Ordinary paraffin.

244
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,158
Hot air blows out here at the end.

245
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,440
It comes out at such terrific force
that that alone drives the aircraft.

246
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:32,446
- Who invented it? One of your men?
- No, a chap called Whittle.

247
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,399
- Whittle? Englishman?
- Yes.

248
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:38,839
We aren't the only firm working on them.
De Havilland and Rolls are ahead of us.

249
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,568
Excuse me.

250
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,964
Well, Susie, how do you like our new toy?

251
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:07,605
- What did you think of that, Chris lad?
- Wizard, wasn't it?

252
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:10,607
- Wizard, Dad.
- Come on, we'll be late for the party.

253
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,405
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, JR.

254
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:36,040
- I'll get out now. Are you ready for the joyride?
- Yes.

255
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,876
- Sure you wouldn't like another circuit with me?
- No, thanks.

256
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:44,638
You'd rather not have me bawling
in your ear, eh, I suppose?

257
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,919
- Are we in time, Chris?
- Bang on.

258
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,800
Thanks for coming.

259
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:51,679
Is that your rival?

260
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,400
Yes.

261
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,086
Good approach.

262
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:56,801
- Good morning, Fletcher.
- Morning.

263
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,442
- Come and have some food with us afterwards.
- I'd love to.

264
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:02,719
- All set?
- There's nothing to it.

265
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,880
All the best, darling.

266
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:10,319
By the way, Ridgefield, just for once
you can make any sort of landing you like.

267
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:14,567
I'm going to have a drink. Only try to get
her down in one piece, there's a good chap.

268
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,879
A very bad turn.

269
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,920
Hm, better.

270
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,285
Hasn't he learned anything at all?

271
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:05,167
He'll be all right. You
can't get hurt from those.

272
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:19,319
Sue!

273
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:26,808
- Chris!
- Sue! Sue, stay here!

274
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:16,839
What about that?

275
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:22,158
Oh, that's fantastic.

276
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:25,967
- This the future 901?
- That's it.

277
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:29,318
- What's her landing speed?
- It's high at the moment, but we're working on it.

278
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:32,678
Well, I have to go to the works at 1:00
so I shan't be back before your train goes,

279
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:34,526
so I'll say goodbye now.

280
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:37,605
Goodbye, Tony, it's nice to have
you in the family. Especially now.

281
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:39,162
Well, it's nice being in the family.

282
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,005
- Come and see me again soon.
- I will.

283
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:44,085
You... You know how I feel
about this awful business.

284
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,322
Mm.

285
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:50,600
Fletcher on the phone today said he'd not have
caught fire if he hadn't forgotten to switch off.

286
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:55,164
- Heaven knows he had plenty of time.
- Here, I'm awfully sorry.

287
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:58,120
- What are your plans for after the war?
- Plans?

288
00:27:58,168 --> 00:28:03,002
I only ask because if you've nothing definite in
mind, there's always a job at Ridgefields for you.

289
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,278
Well, what sort of a job?

290
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:10,042
- You mean... test pilot?
- Well, that's the thing I had in mind.

291
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:17,762
Well, don't say anything now. Think it over.

292
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,798
You've plenty of time.

293
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,117
- Well, goodbye, Sue.
- Goodbye, Father.

294
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,838
Write to me and let me know.

295
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:35,721
- Would you like a drink, darling?
- No, thank you.

296
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>Ridgefield Tower, this is Glass Jar 1
- 0.</i>

297
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:26,767
<i>I've just crossed the coast at
Seaford Head, descending through cloud.</i>

298
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,446
<i>Approaching the airfield.</i>

299
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,921
Roger, 1-0.

300
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,880
<i>Climbing through clouds,
full throttle, ASl 320.</i>

301
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:18,558
<i>- Will, she's a
beauty. - Roger, 1-0.</i>

302
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,565
30,000, I'm levelling out.

303
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:25,521
Auto-observer on.

304
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:29,527
<i>I'm starting dive now. If I get
any buffeting, I'll throttle back.</i>

305
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:33,079
<i>Here we go. This is it.</i>

306
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,443
<i>Thirty thousand.</i>

307
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:38,797
<i>Twenty-nine.</i>

308
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,884
<i>Twenty-eight.</i>

00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:42,884
<i>Twenty-seven.</i>

<i>Twenty-six.</i>

311
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:48,240
Twenty-five thousand.

312
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,526
Mach 0.7.

313
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,079
<i>I'm getting buffeting now.</i>

314
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,919
<i>Air brakes open, throttling back.</i>

315
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:12,167
<i>OK. Coming down to land now.</i>

316
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:26,806
Ridgefield Tower to 1-0.
Clear to join circuit and land.

317
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:28,042
Runway 3-0.

318
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,522
<i>- Call downwind.
- Roger.</i>

319
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:54,077
<i>- I said use 3-0, not the control tower.
- Your message received and understood.</i>

320
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:55,357
Hm!

321
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,206
- What-ho.
- What-ho.

322
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,682
- How was the wonder kite?
- What do you think?

323
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:33,765
- Can I take her out tomorrow?
- No, Windy. She's my baby.

324
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:37,847
- I've nothing on AM.
- Oh, yes, you have. I've got a job for you.

325
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:41,685
I promised to deliver a
Vampire for De Havilland.

326
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,003
- Where to?
- Cairo.

327
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:46,040
Cai... Cairo! Ooh, whizzo!

328
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,238
Er, don't tell the wife.

329
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:49,957
Hello?

330
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:51,566
Hello, darling.

331
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:54,520
Yes, just a few minutes
ago. Hey, what's for dinner?

332
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,847
No. Piece of cake.

333
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:00,640
No, really.

334
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,281
I shan't be long.

335
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,556
Goodbye.

336
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:09,006
- Here, Windy, let's have that back.
- Here, I say...

337
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:12,245
I remembered there's a type I know in
Cairo and I could do with a little sun.

338
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:15,564
- But...
- You have a nice quiet weekend at Shoreham.

339
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,681
- Well, how was it?
- All right.

340
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,764
- Did you take her flat out?
- No, nothing like.

341
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,560
- Pity.
- Why pity?

342
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:26,158
I thought our intrepid air ace might be
the first man through the sound barrier.

343
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,436
There ain't no such thing.

344
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:30,798
You ought to check up on your supersonics,
not to mention the popular press.

345
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:33,841
What's so ruddy peculiar
about the speed of sound?

346
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:38,404
We all know exactly what it is, don't
we? 750 miles per hour at ground level.

347
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,962
If we go slower than that,
we can hear ourselves going,

348
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,397
and if we go faster, we
can hear ourselves coming.

349
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:44,881
It's a mere matter of acoustics.

350
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,242
- Hello, Miss Mitchell.
- Good afternoon.

351
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:07,803
<i>19,000, Mach 0. 7.</i>

352
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:10,602
<i>Slight buffeting commencing on wings.</i>

353
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:14,277
<i>18,500. Buffeting increasing.</i>

354
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:20,079
<i>17,500. Mach 0.8. Buffeting's rather bad.</i>

355
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:26,317
- She's shaking to pieces. She's disintegrating.
- Don't do that. You'll give me heart failure.

356
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:31,044
<i>- I'm throttling back and pulling out.
- What an exquisite voice I do have, to be sure.</i>

357
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:33,807
- Coming for a drink?
- No, got too much work to do.

358
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:36,719
How's the 902 coming along?

359
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:46,287
I want JR to find a name for her. Something
that would suggest the highest speed yet flown.

360
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:50,287
- How about the line shoot?
- There won't be any line shoot about her.

361
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:57,278
- She'll do it, all right.
- Do what?

362
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,319
The speed of sound.

363
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:03,358
What would happen if you put
the wings on back to front?

364
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:06,366
Oh, go away. Go away.

365
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:11,803
- Well...
- What?

366
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,362
- Seriously?
- Uh-huh.

367
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,797
Apart from the buffeting and heavy controls

368
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,807
and general wanging about and
other little things we know about...

369
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:25,603
what exactly does happen to an
aeroplane at the speed of sound?

370
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:31,725
I don't know. And shall I
tell you something, Tony?

371
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:34,841
- What?
- No one else in the world does either.

372
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,804
- Darling?
- Hoo!

373
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,278
- How was it?
- Piece of cake.

374
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,478
It's always a piece of cake.

375
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,520
- Sherry?
- A little one.

376
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:11,282
- What was your day like?
- Pretty good.

377
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:15,426
- I've got the most wonderful news.
- Have you?

378
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:19,504
Two bits of wonderful news, in fact.

379
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:24,258
Only one's not quite so wonderful as the other,
so I'll start with the less wonderful, shall I?

380
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,377
Uh-huh.

381
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:28,306
You know that little house at
Andrew's Corner, Broom Cottage?

382
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:31,341
- Mm-hm? - I think
we can have it.

383
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,347
- But that belongs to that fellow Franklin.
- Mm, but he's leaving.

384
00:36:35,388 --> 00:36:40,143
- Oh. But this place isn't so bad, is it?
- No, of course not.

385
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:44,545
But don't you see what a difference it would
make if we had a place that belonged to us?

386
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:48,343
Oh, I see all that. But the old
man will hate us leaving him.

387
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,697
- He'll hate you leaving him.
- Hate you leaving him too.

388
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:54,502
Oh, darling, don't you yet know after two years
what Father and I really feel about each other?

389
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:58,383
- Well, I know you don't exactly see eye to eye...
- Eye to eye?

390
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,737
He's always despised me
for not being born a son.

391
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:02,744
- Darling...
- It's true.

392
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:08,658
Just as later he despised Chris for not
turning out the sort of sort of son he wanted.

393
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:12,701
Well, I can't despise him in
return, because I admire him.

394
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:15,898
I admire him tremendously for what he's done.

395
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:20,864
As for what he is... Well, all I can say,
it's best I should live out of his house.

396
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,135
What was the other wonderful piece of news?

397
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,138
It'll keep.

398
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,261
Dinner.

399
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:39,741
Were there any other symptoms
besides this buffeting?

400
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:46,341
Well, I noticed that the controls got...
hard at Mach 0.85, in rather a funny way.

401
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:48,744
- What height was that?
- 18,000.

402
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:53,259
Hm. There's no doubt about it, we're
just on the fringe of the problem.

403
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,185
- Father?
- Mm?

404
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,947
- What problem?
- Supersonics.

405
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:00,741
- The sound barrier?
- Yes.

406
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:04,144
- That's a newspaper phrase.
- And like most of them, pretty misleading.

407
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:07,305
- You mean there isn't a barrier?
- Oh, there's a barrier all right.

408
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:11,944
But it's... spread out, on
either side of the speed of sound,

409
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,060
from roughly between Mach 0.85...

410
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:16,178
Mark? What mark?

411
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:20,382
You see, it's a way we have of
measuring the speeds at which we fly.

412
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,738
We no longer fly at miles per
hour, we fly at Mach numbers.

413
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:26,746
Now, Mach One is the speed of sound.

414
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:30,100
But why sound?

415
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:31,820
What makes a barrier? Is it sound?

416
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:35,178
- It's a combination...
- It's air.

417
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:39,221
You see, Sue, there's a limit to the
speed at which air itself can move.

418
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:45,427
Now, this rule's travelling
at... 30 mile an hour, let's say.

419
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:51,148
You can hear the air whistle
as it moves out of its way.

420
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:56,501
But if it were travelling at 750 mile
an hour - the speed of sound, Mach One -

421
00:38:56,548 --> 00:39:00,746
the air could no longer move out of its
way, because it just can't move that fast.

422
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:06,227
It'd pile up in front of the rule, or the
aircraft, making, if you like, a barrier.

423
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:12,621
Now, we don't exactly know what happens to an
aircraft when it gets into these conditions.

424
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:16,183
Tony knows it buffets
as he gets near to them.

425
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:21,097
Some say the craft would go right out of
control, others that it'll break up altogether.

426
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,740
Now, I don't believe that, Sue.

427
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:29,387
I believe with the right aircraft and the right
man, we can force our way through this barrier,

428
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:33,740
and once through, there is a world.

429
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:39,340
A whole new world, with speeds
of 1,500 to 2,000 mile an hour,

430
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:40,980
within the grasp of man.

431
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:45,465
And Tony here may be the first
man to see that new world.

432
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,978
Well, let's go, shall we.

433
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:52,383
- Do you think the Americans will beat us to it?
- They may,

434
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:55,419
but we're two years ahead
in jet-engine development.

435
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:58,665
I think it's between ourselves,
Vickers and De Havillands at the moment.

436
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:02,496
It's a pity De Havillands will
have their 108 up before our 902.

437
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:05,858
Oh, by the way, Will wants a
name for her. Got any ideas, Dad?

438
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:10,299
- Yes. Prometheus.
- Prometheus? Who was he?

439
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:13,545
- He was a Greek god.
- Who stole fire from heaven.

440
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:16,660
Oh, yes, I remember. Came
to a sticky end, didn't he?

441
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,937
He did. But the world got fire.

442
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:21,901
How long before I can have a crack at it?

443
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:26,579
Not long, but you've got quite a bit of homework
to do first. You'd better get started right away.

444
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:32,020
"A theory of supersonic shockwaves.
" I shan't understand a word of this.

445
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:33,786
There's nothing to understand.

446
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:37,059
That fellow spends 50 pages
telling us he doesn't know a thing.

447
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:40,384
- But you'd better read it, all the same.
- I shall need you to do some explaining.

448
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:44,262
You go up to the observatory,
I'll be with you in a minute.

449
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,459
- How's the new telescope working?
- It's good, but it might be better.

450
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:52,059
I think one day I'll build myself a
proper observatory out in the park.

451
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:55,498
- Father, answer me a question, will you?
- Yes?

452
00:40:57,028 --> 00:41:02,341
Is the ability to travel at 2,000 miles an
hour going to be a blessing to the human race?

453
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:05,425
Well, I'd say that's up to the human race.

454
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,620
Well, as a member of it, I
can't feel unduly optimistic.

455
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:14,662
In fact, if that's all that
lies beyond this barrier,

456
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:17,506
what purpose is there in
risking lives to pierce it?

457
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:24,182
Well, I could talk about national security,
beating the potential enemy bomber;

458
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:27,937
flying to New York in two hours,
but that's not the real point.

459
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,218
The real point is, it's just got to be done.

460
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:34,545
What purpose did Scott have
in going to the South Pole?

461
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,504
I wish I knew.

462
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,300
I really wish I knew.

463
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,585
Hm.

464
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:46,744
This coffee's bitter.

465
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,981
Yes, I got it at Weymouth's
in the high street.

466
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:57,106
Franklin tells me you've
been looking at his house.

467
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,661
Yes, Father, I made him an offer.

468
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:03,020
That house is not suitable either for
my daughter or my chief test pilot.

469
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,104
Franklin won't accept your offer.

470
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,299
- How do you know?
- For, my dear Susan,

471
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:11,579
Mr Franklin likes his present job very much.

472
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:15,985
And I have no doubt, no doubt at
all, he'll be anxious to keep it.

473
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,306
Good night, darling.

474
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:34,019
- Tony?
- Mm?

475
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,742
Will you try not to use piece
of cake talk for a moment?

476
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,781
I'll try not to.

477
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,779
How dangerous is it going to be?

478
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:47,426
Well, exploring the unknown must
always be a little... chancy.

479
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:50,581
Yes, I see.

480
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,107
Darling?

481
00:42:55,388 --> 00:42:57,583
I did go and see the doctor this morning.

482
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,744
When?

483
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:08,542
- End of December.
- Oh, how clever of you.

484
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,498
We'll save money on birthday presents.

485
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:14,064
Certainly not. Even if arrives on
Christmas Day, he will still get two lots.

486
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,862
- We might give him a false birthday in June.
- That's right, darling. Say "him".

487
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:19,821
Say "him" whenever you think about it.

488
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:22,223
A psychologist I know says
there is something in that.

489
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:24,498
- Tony?
- What?

490
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:27,665
Must it be you? This sound barrier?

491
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:30,585
- Must it be you?
- Yes, darling, I'm afraid it must.

492
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:35,822
- Couldn't someone else?
- No, Sue, it's my pigeon.

493
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:42,980
I promised myself when you took this job
that I'd never nag you about it, Tony,

494
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:47,624
and I really wouldn't have done if
you'd just gone on testing aeroplanes,

495
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:54,267
but I find now I'm married not only to a
test pilot but married to an explorer as well.

496
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,028
It's a bit unfair, Tony, really it is.

497
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,298
Darling, I hate it.

498
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,657
I'll think about it, darling, I promise you.

499
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,825
I'll think most awfully hard about it.

500
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:10,741
- Hey. Do you remember Philip Peel?
- Of course.

501
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:12,938
Like to fly with me tomorrow
and have lunch with him?

502
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:18,062
- Fly... Hey, will he be all right?
- According to modern theory, yes.

503
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:20,098
- He'd like to very much.
- Good.

504
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:26,822
Now, it's strictly unofficial, so
not a word to anyone. Not even Dad.

505
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:29,623
And we should be back by dinner.

506
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:32,626
- All right?
- Yes.

507
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:37,459
- Where are we going, Tony?
- Cairo.

508
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:42,144
- Funny, I thought you said Cairo.
- Oh, I did say Cairo.

509
00:44:42,188 --> 00:44:43,906
Oh, silly.

510
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,339
You all right?

511
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,060
Fine.

512
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:08,862
Ridgefield Tower from Glass
Jar 1-0, clear for takeoff?

513
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:11,467
1-0 clear for takeoff. Have a good time.

514
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:07,024
We're starting to climb now.
We use too much fuel down here.

515
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:10,185
- How high are we going?
- About 40,000.

516
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,708
Eight miles.

517
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:21,106
- Is our engine all right?
- I think so. Why?

518
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,582
I can hardly hear it.

519
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:29,227
Glass Jar 1-0, this is Ridgefield
Tower. Transmit for a fix.

520
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,307
<i>Ridgefield Tower, this is Glass
Jar 1-0 transmitting for a fix.</i>

521
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:40,217
<i>On course, 156, altitude 25,000 feet. Over.</i>

522
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:41,749
Your position is Dover.

523
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:51,062
Darling. France.

524
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:53,906
Cap Gris-Nez.

525
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:00,618
Belgium, and Holland on the horizon.

526
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:10,783
Paris.

527
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:14,741
There you are. See the Arc de Triomphe
and all the avenues branching off it?

528
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:19,987
- I can't see the Eiffel Tower.
- Well, look ahead, you can see the Alps.

529
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:26,539
We'll go over the top if the weather's OK.

530
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:28,658
Geneva Tower, this is Glass Jar 1-0.

531
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:05,265
Mediterranean.

532
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:14,697
You'll be able to see Athens in a moment.

533
00:48:18,548 --> 00:48:22,541
The Earth is beginning to look
awfully small and insignificant.

534
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:25,864
- I don't know that I like it. -
You're being old-fashioned, darling.

535
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:29,503
Why worry about the poor
old Earth? Look up there.

536
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:32,665
There's our future. Space. You
can't make that insignificant.

537
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:34,816
Down there's had it.

538
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:20,541
Hey. There's the Comet.

539
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:29,297
- One ladder!
- You're lucky to have one.

540
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,137
Tony!

541
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:34,780
Phil!

542
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:37,388
- It's good to see you.
- How are you?

543
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:40,705
- And Sue, how are you?
- Wonderfully well, Phil.

544
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:41,737
Isn't this exciting?

545
00:49:41,788 --> 00:49:43,187
- Good trip?
- Piece of cake.

546
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:45,664
I see you haven't widened
his vocabulary much.

547
00:49:46,988 --> 00:49:50,776
- I say, this is the Vampire,
isn't it? - Uh-huh. Night fighter.

548
00:49:50,828 --> 00:49:53,183
I suppose I couldn't take her
on a quick circuit, could I?

549
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:55,184
No, you certainly couldn't.

550
00:49:55,228 --> 00:49:57,298
I always said you'd get
bored being an oil magnate.

551
00:49:57,348 --> 00:50:02,183
I'm not bored with it. It's just that I haven't
flown anything for 18 months, that's all.

552
00:50:02,228 --> 00:50:07,746
If you want to fly, you'd better take that
job at Ridgefields. The offer's still open.

553
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:10,348
I'd better go and check
in at the flight office.

554
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:13,061
- Look, meet us over there by the Jeep, will you?
- OK.

555
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:17,225
- What job at Ridgefields, Philip?
- Test pilot.

556
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:20,227
He mentioned it in his last letter,
but I didn't take him seriously.

557
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,384
I didn't think he was high
enough to give out jobs.

558
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:25,022
- He is, you know.
- Does he get on with the great man?

559
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,344
- He calls him Dad.
- Oh.

560
00:50:29,187 --> 00:50:31,065
Whew, it's hot.

561
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:35,067
Oh, Tony, why did you bring that
awful thing? You know how I hate it.

562
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:37,019
When I got your wire, I
thought you must be tight.

563
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,387
I probably was.

564
00:50:39,388 --> 00:50:41,698
I say, how are you going to get back?

565
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,705
Get back? Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

566
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:47,787
Why don't you try going by sea? It's
a nice restful trip. Only 15 days.

567
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:51,707
- Fifteen...? Tony, do you mean to say...
- Don't worry, darling, we'll think of something.

568
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,900
Why not ask Cunningham? He tests the
Comet between here and London most days.

569
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:58,020
No, rival firm. No, we'll
catch a lift somewhere.

570
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:00,502
Hey, where are you taking us for lunch?

571
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:03,267
- An open-air place. Jessie's
meeting us there. - Oh, good.

572
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:05,424
- It's the best food in Cairo.
- Hooray!

573
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:09,420
To think you were in England only
this morning. It seems like a miracle.

574
00:51:09,468 --> 00:51:11,744
I can't quite believe it myself.

575
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:16,304
- I'm so glad, Jess, to meet you at last.
- I can never realise you don't know each other.

576
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:18,862
- Here's to us.
- To us.

577
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,699
- How are the children?
- Fine, thank you.

578
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,784
Isn't that Cunningham?

579
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:25,056
Yes, I think it is.

580
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:28,102
Darling, do you think I ought to swallow
my pride and cadge that lift home?

581
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:33,426
I certainly do. If we have to go back by boat, I
shall be wearing these trousers for a fortnight.

582
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:39,387
How much would they pay you as a test pilot?

583
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:44,456
What? Oh, about 200 a year less
than I'm getting at the moment.

584
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:46,703
Oh well, I expect we'll manage somehow.

585
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,900
They're off!

586
00:53:09,107 --> 00:53:11,338
Home. In five hours.

587
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:21,667
Thanks, John, she's a nice steady old crate.

588
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:27,095
- Who was it said, "Oh, to be in England"?
- Browning. But he wasn't!

589
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:35,866
- Oh, Tony, it was a wonderful trip.
- I knew you'd love it.

590
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:39,298
Love it? I shall treasure it
all my life. Every single moment.

591
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:41,384
Darling, stop a minute, will you?

592
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,259
Paper.

593
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:46,266
Thank you.

594
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:50,096
I remember you telling me once that one
of the reasons you love flying so much

595
00:53:50,148 --> 00:53:54,938
was that you found a sort of peace up there
that you couldn't find anywhere on Earth.

596
00:53:54,988 --> 00:53:57,707
When we seemed to be hanging up
there between heaven and Earth,

597
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:00,864
I found a strange, secure sort of peace too.

598
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:04,298
Almost like the feeling one gets in
one of those especially comfy dreams.

599
00:54:04,348 --> 00:54:06,862
I never thought it would be like that.
