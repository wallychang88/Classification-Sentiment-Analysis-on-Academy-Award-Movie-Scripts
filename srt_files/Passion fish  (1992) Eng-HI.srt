1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,962
[short breaths]

2
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,038
[Woman on TV]
It'’s all so strange.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,217
All I remember
is that I wasn'’t happy.

4
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,089
Was I?

5
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,873
[Second woman, on TV]
Scarlet--

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,659
You keep calling me that.
Sounds like some other person.

7
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:54,315
Isn'’t there anything
that you can remember?

8
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,534
There is something.

9
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,841
It'’s more like a dream

10
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,408
than anything
that really happened.

11
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:05,108
I'’m walking down a hallway.

12
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,241
It'’s dark.

13
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,636
And it'’s so quiet I can hear
my footsteps echoing.

14
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:15,118
The hallway is very long.
It seems never to end.

15
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:17,164
All the time I'’m walking,
I have this feeling

16
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,861
that when I reach
the end of the hall,

17
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,081
I'’ll find something.

18
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,779
It'’s very frightening
at first,

19
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,824
but if I can stand up to it
and face it,

20
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,088
it could be something
wonderful.

21
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,353
[Scarlet, on TV]
But I can'’t remember
my dreams.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,963
That'’s my close-up.

23
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,444
[Scarlet, on TV]
Maybe I just don'’t want to.

24
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:40,317
He gave her
my fucking close-up.

25
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,884
[nurse]
Is something wrong?

26
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,756
I thought that was
the call button.

27
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,976
[nurse]
Do you know where you are?

28
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,805
Yeah.
I'’m in the fucking hospital.

29
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,415
I was here yesterday,
wasn'’t I?

30
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,896
[nurse]
You'’ve been here for a while.

31
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:56,420
My legs... fell asleep.

32
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:59,075
I wanted to get up.

33
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,512
-Do you know who you are?
-[laughs]

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,863
She'’s the one with the amnesia,
not me.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,866
Just help me sit up,
all right?

36
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,826
-[inhales sharply]
-You had surgery yesterday.

37
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:14,308
We put the rods on your spine.
Do you remember?

38
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,311
I'’m going to call Dr. Miles.

39
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,182
He'’ll give you something
to calm you down.

40
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,228
No, I don'’t need
to be calmed down.

41
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,882
I need to be helped up.

42
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,450
You did something to me,
didn'’t you?

43
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,497
You gave me a shot
and my legs went to sleep.

44
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,890
-I'’m going to call Dr. Miles.
-No!

45
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,979
Just give me a straight
fucking answer!

46
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,766
-What did you do to me?
-I think he'’s on the floor.

47
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,990
[gasping]

48
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:47,036
I'’ll get Dr. Miles.

49
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,517
He'’ll give you something
to calm you down.

50
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,867
No.
What happened to my legs?

51
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,784
[nurse] Sometimes the medication
makes it hard to remember.

52
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,961
[woman, sobbing]
What am I doing here?

53
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,921
[heavy breathing]

54
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,445
What is wrong with me?

55
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,317
What is wrong with me?

56
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,624
[Max, on TV] It'’s good to see
you out of the hospital.

57
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,017
-How are you feeling?
-Fine, Dr. Buckner.

58
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,769
[therapist]
Try to hold your position

59
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,423
without using your arms
too much.

60
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,295
[woman gasping
and breathing heavily]

61
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:33,213
Okay. Now turn your head
to the left, very slowly.

62
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:39,131
[gasping]

63
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,525
I'’m right here.
I'’m not going to let you drown.

64
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,705
I knew there was a catch.

65
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:51,100
[therapist 1]
Look at Carlos.

66
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:53,581
He'’s doing ten reps already
with weights on his shoulders.

67
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:57,585
Carlos is a fucking monster.
Carlos belongs in a circus.

68
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,501
[therapist 1]
You'’re just as good a candidate
for rehab as he is.

69
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,590
Right. Can you take me
back to my room now?

70
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,288
-No.
-My shoulders hurt.

71
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,945
Are you gonna make me
stay here?

72
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,034
[therapist 1] Go back
to your room if you want.

73
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:14,906
-You know the way.
-[therapist 2] All right.

74
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:18,301
Let'’s try a little
weight on it.

75
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,217
[therapist counting]

76
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,931
[therapist 1] If you had
some upper body strength,

77
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,672
you wouldn'’t have
any trouble with that.

78
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,500
Fuck you!

79
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,504
Fuck you too, Carlos!

80
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,642
Who are you?

81
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,818
[man]
I'’m Dr. Kline.

82
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,254
A shrink.

83
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,605
[Kline]
I'’m a psychologist.

84
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,259
You got the voice.

85
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,739
[Kline]
Do I?

86
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,830
I was under analysis
for seven years.

87
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,658
[Kline]
I see.

88
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,095
I'’m going to ask you
some questions about yourself.

89
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,184
You going to make me walk?

90
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,533
[Kline]
No, May-Alice.

91
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,667
You going to make it
so I can pee

92
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,670
without sticking plastic
inside me?

93
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,281
[Kline]
I'’m not a urologist.

94
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,501
Then go peddle it
somewhere else.

95
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,289
[therapist]
Okay, I want you to raise
yourselves up on your elbows.

96
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,771
That'’s it. Not too much
side to side with the head.

97
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,338
Okay.

98
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,383
Now push your body back
to where your elbows are

99
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,776
underneath your shoulders.

100
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,168
That'’ll give you
the leverage.

101
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,259
Hey, that'’s really good,
Chuck.

102
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
Okay, I want you
to roll to the left.

103
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,829
Really slowly now,
under control.

104
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,223
Go right to the supine
elbows position.

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,051
Use your momentum.

106
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,663
Don'’t lie back.

107
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,320
Okay, from the elbows,
we extend the arms,

108
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,843
keeping balance.

109
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,498
Walk it up
to a sitting position.

110
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,068
Wonderful.

111
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,722
Okay, leaning forward,

112
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:15,897
those of you with your legs
still crossed...

113
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:21,119
[sobbing]

114
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,168
[May-Alice, into phone]
I just want out of this
fucking boot camp.

115
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,996
It'’s like a fraternity here.

116
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,260
All these gang members
shot in holdups,

117
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:35,090
motorcycle casualties,
hang gliders.

118
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,875
I want to go home.

119
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,400
No. "Home" home, down there.

120
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,098
You'’re my business manager.

121
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,100
You'’re supposed to know
about this stuff.

122
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,538
Square it with
the insurance company

123
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,758
and get me out of here.

124
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,153
[woman 1]
Scarlet.

125
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,938
[woman 2]
We read all about your tragedy

126
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,200
in the Digest.

127
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,680
[woman 1]
We were so shocked.

128
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,377
[woman 2]
You'’re one of our favorites.

129
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,814
[woman 1]
Could you sign this?

130
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,821
Thank you so much.

131
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,649
You'’re going to make
a wonderful comeback.

132
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,738
I just know it.

133
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,348
Thank you very much.

134
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,542
[therapist] Hold it there
as long as you can.

135
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,069
Is that as much
as you can do?

136
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:43,463
[May-Alice] I don'’t have any
upper body strength.

137
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,595
We'’re going to get you some.

138
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,338
Car accident.

139
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,210
Fucking taxicab.
I was getting out of one,

140
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,430
another one comes along
and sideswipes it.

141
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,476
Hit me,
took the door right off.

142
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:59,479
Fucking kamikazes.

143
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,350
Don'’t let me push this down.

144
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,787
I was going to have
my legs waxed.

145
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,789
New York City.

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,837
It says you'’re some kind
of actress.

147
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,752
Some kind.

148
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,580
I was on daytime.

149
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,713
-"Daytime"?
-Soap opera.

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,020
Some of my patients
watch those.

151
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,892
Yeah, we always got
lots of letters from shut-ins.

152
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,374
What brings you down
to Louisiana?

153
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,594
I heard what a brilliant
therapist you were.

154
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:31,554
Might not be New York City,
but we do alright.

155
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,035
Can even get your legs
waxed here, if you want.

156
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,819
I have a house here.

157
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,995
Vacation house?

158
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:41,303
No. I grew up here.
Jeff Davis Parish.

159
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,697
Could'’ve fooled me.

160
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,351
I spent a fortune
losing my accent.

161
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,354
Okay, there'’s two kinds
of therapy

162
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,487
I'’m going to work on with you.

163
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,794
One is to strengthen
the muscles

164
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,100
you still have control over.

165
00:08:56,187 --> 00:09:00,365
Keep your back lined up right,
increase your range of motion.

166
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,717
The other is to promote
circulation and tone

167
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,067
in the areas
you'’ve lost the use of.

168
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,938
I'’m not the wheelchair
Olympics type.

169
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:12,377
May-Alice, you'’re a T-10
complete spinal lesion.

170
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,336
Whatever movement
and sensation you'’ve lost

171
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,207
because of that
isn'’t ever coming back.

172
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:19,080
But the rest of your body,
the rest of your life,

173
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,647
it'’s whatever
you want to make it.

174
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,605
Right, Coach.

175
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,739
I don'’t know what you were like
before the accident.

176
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,089
You mean my premorbid
personality?

177
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,266
Oh, you'’ve been reading
the literature.

178
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,573
You got a standing frame
at this house?

179
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,052
My business manager said

180
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,706
he bought everything
in the catalog.

181
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,142
Well, you have to use it.

182
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,796
I want you to stand
one hour a day.

183
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,232
[May-Alice snorts]

184
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,799
Sure.

185
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,801
If you'’re going to be
my patient--

186
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:49,066
Look, I know the whole routine,
and I'’m not buying into it.

187
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,982
I don'’t want you
coming to my house.

188
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,723
I don'’t want your pep talks.

189
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,377
This visit is just something

190
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,248
that my business manager
cooked up

191
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,120
with the insurance company.

192
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,036
Am I going to meet this guy,
this business manager?

193
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,909
I'’m out of business.

194
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:27,801
Mm-hm. No ramp.

195
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,629
No.

196
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,675
The house
has not been prepared.

197
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:36,505
I figured we'’ll sort of
work our way into it.

198
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,290
An old house.

199
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,075
Not that old.

200
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,990
Old houses are dirty.

201
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,431
I had my business manager call
to get it cleaned.

202
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,390
[grunts]

203
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,784
There should be a ramp.

204
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,338
That hurts.

205
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,166
You must be clean.

206
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,951
I'’m clean enough.

207
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,779
It hurts.

208
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,955
You think this is pain?

209
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:38,393
At home I do 100 abortions.

210
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,483
Illegal. No drugs.

211
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,180
That is pain.

212
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,665
[laughter on TV]

213
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,016
[indistinct chatter on TV]

214
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,628
[nurse]
You eat now.

215
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,895
What exactly is this?

216
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,766
Kasha. Big fiber.

217
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,334
Is good for stool.

218
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,205
Yeah.

219
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,512
It looks like it might
have something to do with that.

220
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,868
[Rhonda, on TV]
That'’s what it'’s all about.

221
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,001
[Jessica, over TV]
Look, it was a computer error.

222
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,654
[Rhonda]
Computer error?

223
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,396
Well, isn'’t somebody
supposed to check dosages

224
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,442
before the prescriptions
are filled?

225
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,488
[Jessica] Do you know how many
patients a day we treat here?

226
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,534
[Rhonda]
I don'’t care how many.

227
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,188
The only one I care about
is Scarlet.

228
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,320
A little cleaning?

229
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,021
It'’s important
that we have clean walls.

230
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,675
I'’ll be climbing them soon.

231
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,373
[snorts]

232
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,331
[announcer chattering
indistinctly over TV]

233
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,687
Can you hear this?

234
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,690
It is 3:00 in morning.

235
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,692
I'’ll turn the volume down.

236
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,174
Is night.
You must sleep.

237
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:08,309
I got the rest of my life
to sleep.

238
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,832
[sighs]

239
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:21,888
Eat.

240
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,153
I'’m not hungry.

241
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,330
Is good breakfast.
Eat.

242
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,897
I'’m not hungry.

243
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,899
I'’m not even awake.

244
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,694
No eat, no TV.

245
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:50,090
Weren'’t you in
"Ilsa: She-Beast of the Gulag"?

246
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,832
Eat.

247
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,554
I call agency.

248
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,774
They send new person
tomorrow.

249
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,568
Before I found him,

250
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,613
I used to get, like,
really depressed and all.

251
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,007
You know?
Like, I'’d try to go on a diet.

252
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,140
And I'’d starve myself and, like,

253
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,229
throw up a lot and everything,
you know?

254
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,057
But then the minute
I went off the diet,

255
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,059
I, like, gained back
all the weight I'’d lost,

256
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,712
and then some.

257
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,758
And I'’d feel
so weak and worthless

258
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,674
and, you know, like...

259
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,067
Pudgy.

260
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,546
Pudgy. Yes.

261
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,679
But then I found him,

262
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,333
and it, like,
clicked in my head

263
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,944
that he loves you
whether you'’re, like,

264
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,425
pudgy or skinny,
or short or tall,

265
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,776
or really smart
or kind of stupid,

266
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:11,388
or all healthy and athletic or,
like...

267
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,042
Crippled.

268
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,827
Physically challenged,
you know?

269
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,134
And then it, like...

270
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,484
[crying]

271
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,009
I'’m sorry!

272
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,575
You hate this job.

273
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,751
No, it'’s not that.

274
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,753
I mean, I do hate this job,

275
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,495
but that'’s not
what'’s so terrible.

276
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,758
You got problems
with your boyfriend.

277
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,499
Yes.

278
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,153
Well, you shouldn'’t
let some big dope

279
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,938
get you all hysterical.

280
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,070
But he'’s not a dope.

281
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:44,204
He'’s not even American.

282
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,249
What'’s his name?

283
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,903
Derek?

284
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,818
No.

285
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,733
-Jean-Claude?
-No.

286
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,430
Paulo?

287
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,737
Yes.

288
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,568
[woman on TV]
It just seems a little
convenient, that'’s all.

289
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,786
I mean, Rhonda is...

290
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,005
Do you know that Blake?

291
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,661
Different show.

292
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,446
I hate her.
How'’s about Lucinda?

293
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,361
Lucinda?

294
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,320
Lucinda on the stories.
Do you know her?

295
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,887
A different show.

296
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
Raven? Dominique?

297
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:20,762
Different show.

298
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,982
It'’s on the same network,
though.

299
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,027
She comes on
right after you.

300
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,595
There'’s not like a room
where they store us all

301
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,249
in between shows.

302
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,164
What about that Erica?

303
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,296
[new nurse]
Morgan City, which is, like...

304
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,038
-[indistinct audio from TV]]
-...the lowest pit of hell,
you know?

305
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,519
I was stuck there for about
two or three weeks

306
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,652
until I met this guy,
Blackout, this biker.

307
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,219
You like bikes?

308
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,221
Hm.

309
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,354
Well, Blackout got these
disability checks

310
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,095
from the government,
you know?

311
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,531
Because he was in this

312
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,663
psychological drug
experiment thing

313
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,753
when he was in the Army,
and something went wrong.

314
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,278
I mean, you know what it'’s like
to sleep with somebody

315
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,193
that'’s got, like,
a ten-inch hunting knife

316
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,847
strapped to his thigh?

317
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,588
Hm.

318
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:08,331
But you know,
he was an okay guy, really.

319
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:11,856
As long as he stayed
on medication.

320
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:14,381
Boy, if he skipped a dose
or two, that was like...

321
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,383
[pops lips]

322
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,168
And besides, he had to go back
in the hospital to get a refit

323
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:23,433
on this steel plate that he--
You know, he had in his head.

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,219
And that'’s when I met
this guitar player.

325
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,656
Okay, you know, heavy metal?

326
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:29,874
-Mm-hm.
-Okay, well, like,

327
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,528
this is way beyond that.

328
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,400
I know this guy
that got electrocuted once

329
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,184
when he was working out
on the rigs.

330
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,794
And he told me
that he sees, like,

331
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,840
exactly the same
kind of blue flashes

332
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,060

337
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,262
Didn'’t think they'’d send
another one.

338
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,136
How long have you been
without somebody?

339
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,052
I dropped the remote.

340
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,665
I think it'’s behind
the couch.

341
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:07,102
You really ought
to have a ramp out there.

342
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,588
Breakfast.

343
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,290
Oh, shit.

344
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:28,384
I haven'’t been taking
my Ditropan.

345
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,951
I had an accident here.

346
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,170
I'’ll help you wash up.

347
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,658

00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,191
You got any problems...

351

personal problems...

352
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,197
I don'’t want to hear them.

353
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,204
You been doing this long?

354
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,553
No.

355
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,556
You?

356
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,388
You are a nurse,
aren'’t you?

357
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,433
Yeah.

358
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,524
I just haven'’t done
this caretaker thing before.

359
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,048
I mean, staying over
at somebody'’s house.

360
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:28,009
Well, I'’ll tell you,
Shondelle, it'’s a snap.

361
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,229
Chantelle.

362
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,580
All the things I can'’t do,
you do them for me.

363
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,974
These days,
that'’s just about everything.

364
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:40,761
Can'’t go anywhere by myself.
I can'’t cook anymore.

365
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,938
I can'’t work anymore.

366
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,984
I can'’t shit
without a suppository.

367
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,335
I can'’t have sex I can feel,

368
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:52,251
unless I really
get into blowjobs.

369
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,469
Sorry.

370
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,430
You'’re probably
some big Christian, right?

371
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,867
And I just put my foot
in my mouth.

372
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,434
It'’s none of my business

373
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,219
what you put in your mouth,
Miss Culhane.

374
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,399
Chantelle, huh?

375
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,880
Chantelle.

376
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,926
What'’d they tell you about me
at the agency?

377
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,581
You'’re a T-10.

378
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,757
What else?

379
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,804
You have your own money,

380
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,415
so the pay was better
than the state cases.

381
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,462
Did they tell you
I was a bitch?

382
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,161
On wheels.

383
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,949
[May-Alice chuckling]

384
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,299
[gasps]

385
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,822
Hey.

386
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,346
You found my umbilical cord.

387
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,915
[laughter and indistinct chatter
over TV]

388
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,526
Do you have any way to call me
if you need anything?

389
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,181
I just turn the volume
way up.

390
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,837
Look, I got no idea

391
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,970
what the last one left you
up there.

392
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,930
I'’ll be fine.

393
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,497
Good night, Miss Culhane.

394
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,281
Chantelle?

395
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:11,591
I don'’t usually wet myself.

396
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,378
Don'’t worry about it.

397
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,108
[cries softly]

398
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,350
[Chantelle]
You need me to cut that up
for you more?

399
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:21,182
I can'’t deal with grapefruit
in the morning.

400
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,793
[Chantelle]
We don'’t have any eggs.

401
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,882
I'’ve got them on the list.

402
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,104
I can'’t deal with breakfast
at all.

403
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,768
There'’s still a car out back,
isn'’t there?

404
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,726
Big brown thing?

405
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,902
Good.

406
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,165
Last one took it into Lafayette
a couple times.

407
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,429
Afraid she might have
sold it.

408
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,567
Is there anything you need
before I go?

409
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,657
I can change
the channels myself.

410
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,792
Should I...

411
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,837
Should I help you
in the bathroom before I go?

412
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,536
[scoffs]

413
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:15,062
I was the best voider
in my rehab group.

414
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:18,282
Thought they would give me
a fucking medal or something.

415
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,810
Your bathroom'’s
not set up too well.

416
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,901
Keys should be in the car.

417
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,907
Try to get back
as soon as I can.

418
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,605
Don'’t kill yourself.

419
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,085
You neither.

420
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,388
[sighs]

421
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,135
[groans]

422
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,659
[sighs]

423
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,095
Ooh.

424
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,054
Oh, God.

425
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,840
All right.

426
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:43,542
I can do this.

427
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:47,807
[grunts]

428
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,286
[panting]

429
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,165
You ain'’t from around here.
I can tell.

430
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,775
Yeah.

431
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:03,170
And you are. I can tell.

432
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:06,956
Somebody'’s in a bad mood.

433
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:10,481
Must'’ve walked, what?
Three, four miles?

434
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,359
What do you do for this lady
you work for?

435
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,710
I take care of her,
I guess.

436
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,495
White lady?

437
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,585
-Mm-hm.
-Old?

438
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,110
Are you a detective?

439
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,590
You a nurse?

440
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,983
I was. Almost.

441
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,074
The pay must be real good

442
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,772
to get a fine-looking
young lady

443
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,905
to live out with some sickly
old white woman.

444
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,864
Pay'’s all right.

445
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,914
Well, I hope you stay
working around here.

446
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,829
If you'’re trying
to be charming,

447
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,571
don'’t be wasting it on me.

448
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,399
What is that smell?

449
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,186
[laughs]

450
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,623
That'’s horse, darling.

451
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,146
You put a horse back there?

452
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,843
I take care of them.

453
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,932
Put shoes on their hooves.

454
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,282
Train them for their owners.

455
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,634
You'’re giving me grief
about working for a white woman.

456
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,942
Is this the town?

457
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,075
Most of it.

458
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,253
Where you want me
to leave you?

459
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:28,821
Right here is good.

460
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,693
Right.

461
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,570
Want me to find gas
when you'’re back out?

462
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,268
I can manage, thanks.

463
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,401
-Sugar.
-What?

464
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:45,881
[turns engine off]

465
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,449
Sugar LeDoux. That'’s me.

466
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,669
You have got to be kidding.

467
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,061
[chuckles]

468
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,455
Well,
my real name is Ulysse.

469
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,197
Like Ulysses in the ballad.

470
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:00,026
My man, beaucoup le classique.

471
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,463
What'’s your name?

472
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,206
-Chantelle.
-Chantelle what?

473
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,384
Chantelle who'’s got no time

474
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,866
for French-talking
Louisiana cowboys.

475
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,694
You dance, Chantelle?

476
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,698
No. Not anymore.

477
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,052
Excuse me.

478
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,359
Could I buy
one of those cans?

479
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,275
Them are mine.

480
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,755
Oh, you don'’t work here?

481
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,757
Well, nobody work here.

482
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:37,193
Old Abe there
owns the pumps,

483
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,282
but he mostly drinks
and sleeps.

484
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,545
Leave the box out for people
to put the money in.

485
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,243
He'’s sleeping now.

486
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,246
So they just leave the money
for what they take?

487
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,814
-You'’re not from here, are you?
-No.

488
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:52,034
And your car'’s broke down
somewhere without no gas?

489
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,343
Wait one minute,
I'’ll take you, put some in.

490
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,215
Well, I have a lot of stuff
over at the liquor store.

491
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,564
Oh, we can go by there,
pick them up.

492
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,526
[gasping and panting]

493
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,185
[grunts]

494
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,623
[grunting]

495
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,843
Shit! Shit!

496
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,105
Shit.

497
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,323
[panting]

498
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,585
Shit.

499
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,828
Propane guns keep the birds
off the rice seed.

500
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,090
It'’s that time of year.

501
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:49,613
Well.

502
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,137
This used to belong
to Mr. Culhane.

503
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,399
Lived out by the lake.

504
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,488
It'’s his daughter'’s now.

505
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,969
-Word is she'’s stuck in a bed.
-She'’s paraplegic.

506
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,149
Well, how'’s she doing?

507
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:07,022
I just started out there.
The place could use some work.

508
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,590
It wasn'’t set up
for somebody in a chair.

509
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,855
[car door closes]

510
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,642
I'’ll do the carpentry.

511
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,994
A little plumbing,
fix your roof.

512
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,869
I'’ll talk to her.

513
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,610
You maybe wanna have this car
looked at.

514
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,699
I'’ll tell her you said hi.

515
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:35,224
Nah. She won'’t remember me.
Bon chance.

516
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:39,576
[engine starts]

517
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,407
[sighs]

518
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,856
[breathing heavily]

519
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,863
[turns TV on]

520
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,778
[Chantelle]
I'’m really sorry I'’m so late.

521
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,347
I need a glass of wine.

522
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,394
The car broke down.
Didn'’t have any gas in it.

523
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,786
With ice.

524
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:19,747
I had a really terrible day.

525
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,923
Mine was a scream.

526
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,363
If you'’d just bring
the bottle over,

527
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,104
I can pour my own.

528
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,717
-I'’m not your waitress.
-What are you then?

529
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,288
I'’m going to get
the rest of the groceries.

530
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,030
If you want a drink,
I'’ll be in the kitchen.

531
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,336
I can'’t make it out there.

532
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,120
Where'’s your chair?

533
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,646
You'’re all sweaty.

534
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,953
I couldn'’t get back into it
in the bathroom.

535
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,563
It was easier
to come out here.

536
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,696
You fell?

537
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:58,090
-What are you doing?
-I need to look at your legs.

538
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:00,614
-I didn'’t hit hard.
-I need to look at your legs.

539
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,224
No!

540
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,538
Please. You might be hurt.

541
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,038
You got a big bruise
under your hip.

542
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:36,911
Nothing'’s broken, but we
need to take you for x-rays.

543
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,434
No.

544
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,306
There'’s no way for me
to be sure.

545
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,439
No! It'’s my fucking body!
I said no!

546
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,360
[May-Alice sobbing softly]

547
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:53,754
I'’m not very good at this,
am I?

548
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,235
[sighs]

549
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,502
Yeah, I know.

550
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:08,595
I'’ve been thinking
about a career change myself.

551
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:14,427
I thought that you drove back
into the agency

552
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,298
and told them
you were quitting.

553
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,649
I need this job.

554
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:23,697
Okay.

555
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,700
I'’ll get you some dinner.

556
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,182
Could you help me
pull up my pants first?

557
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,320
[man]
Hello there!

558
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,410
Anybody home?

559
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,815
Can I help you?

560
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:57,600
I was wondering
if May-Alice might be in.

561
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:00,560
No one seems to answer
your telephone.

562
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:03,041
I was something of
an afterthought in the family.

563
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:09,134
May-Alice'’s father was already
in high school when I was born.

564
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,968
What time does May-Alice
usually rise?

565
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,014
About noon or so.

566
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,537
Oh.

567
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,018
Sensible girl.

568
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,629
Noon'’d suit me just fine.

569
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,893
But as long
as there'’s real estate

570
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,983
to be bought and sold
in Crescent City,

571
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,116
I have no rest.

572
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,424
Real estate.

573
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,469
That'’s what our dreams come to.

574
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,170
Can I help you find
something?

575
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,955
Oh, I'’m poking around, aren'’t I?

576
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:52,002
I lived here for a spell,

577
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,397
after May-Alice'’s parents
passed on.

578
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,400
Bachelor days.

579
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,881
If you'’re looking for the
bottles, I threw all that away.

580
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,276
I see.

581
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,104
There wasn'’t so much left.

582
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,891
We got some white wine
cold here.

583
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,849
That might be pleasant.

584
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:26,211
My brother, May-Alice'’s father,
was an amateur flyer.

585
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,737
He was quite a sportsman,
actually.

586
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:34,915
His house was once filled
with his trophies on every wall.

587
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,439
Until I was compelled
to donate them

588
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:40,442
to the local museum
of natural history.

589
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:44,185
Their eyes seemed to follow me
from room to room.

590
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,673
They were flying
down at the Keys

591
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,067
for the bonefishing, I believe,
not the marlin.

592
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,592
May-Alice'’s father
was a great admirer

593
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,246
of Mr. Hemingway.

594
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,249
He flew everywhere hunting,
fishing.

595
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,165
-Her mother went along?
-Whither thou goest,

596
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,949
I shall go.

597
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,909
[inhales and sighs]

598
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:15,347
At the service,
three people rose

599
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:18,959
to comment on what an excellent
pilot my brother was.

600
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,618
Not my drink, I'’m afraid.

601
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,403
[pours drink into sink]

602
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,102
I built this myself.

603
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,456
When I was younger,

604
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,372
photography was quite
an obsession of mine.

605
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:41,851
Huh!

606
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:44,637
[camera clicks]

607
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:46,204
[chuckles]

608
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,642
You ever seen the work
of Mr. E.J. Bellocq?

609
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,600
I don'’t think so.

610
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,733
Well, it'’s very striking.

611
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,345
Anyhow...

612
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:02,742
photography remained
an avocation...

613
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,702
not a way of life.

614
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,443
[chuckles]

615
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,840
Mm-mm.

616
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,103
Improves with age.

617
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:23,371
My friend Jason got his first
taste of financial independence,

618
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,113
and it was gone
with the proverbial wind.

619
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,636
[Reeves and May-Alice laugh]

620
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:28,942
[May-Alice]
Oh!

621
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,726
He inherited money?

622
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,294
The only thing Jason'’s
in line to inherit

623
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,991
is a Naugahyde dinette set.

624
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,690
[both laugh]

625
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,735
You remember he was something
of a potter?

626
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:42,303
Well, he came up
with a scheme

627
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,437
to manufacture
homoerotic delftware.

628
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:47,003
Go on!

629
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,614
Dinner plates
with little Dutch boys

630
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,355
painted in compromising
positions.

631
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,531
[laughs]
Oh!

632
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:55,185
Perversion is rampant
in our society.

633
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,404
[chuckles]

634
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,234
You'’re better off
without him.

635
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,890
I keep telling myself that.

636
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:14,857
I was so sorry to hear about
your affliction, May-Alice.

637
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,469
I always wanted you
to be the one who went away

638
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:20,820
and became famous
and was always happy.

639
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,088
Now this.

640
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,309
Reeves, if you start to cry,

641
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,788
I'’m going to throw
my drink at you.

642
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:37,750
[gasps]

643
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,630
That'’s my Uncle Reeves.

644
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,286
Inn'’t he great?

645
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:58,161
He'’s real... literary.

646
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,338
[chuckles]

647
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:04,994
Reeves has been, uh...
"literary" ever since
he was a boy.

648
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,258
Didn'’t go down real big
in my family.

649
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,260
Takes all kinds.

650
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,396
He gave me his camera.

651
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,747
Isn'’t that sweet?

652
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,053
Mm.

653
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:25,841
[woman, on TV] But you were
insane toward the end,

654
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,409
making up all kinds
of crazy stories,

655
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,804
sleeping with every man in sight
and then accusing...

656
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,023
Hey!

657
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,721
-This.
-What--

658
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,070
What is this?

659
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,550
I'’m taking them out with us.

660
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,553
-Us?
-Us. You and me.

661
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,729
-Out?
-Outside.

662
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,209
Uh-uh. I don'’t like
the sound of this.

663
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,342
You need strength
in your upper body.

664
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,388
Oh, really?
And why is that?

665
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,781
Because I'’m not taking you
to the potty every four hours,

666
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,436
wiping your butt, and pretty
soon you'’re going to be too weak

667
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,395
to do it for yourself,
how'’s that?

668
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,530
When was the last time
you were outside?

669
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:06,360
They used to park us on the roof
at the rehab hospital.

670
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,014
You need sun.

671
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,364
Raisins need sun.

672
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,714
Alfalfa needs sun.

673
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:15,761
Do you swim?

674
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,850
Not willingly.

675
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,155
Can you swim
in this lake?

676
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,418
[chuckles]

677
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,245
You mean,
with the snakes?

678
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,684
Maybe I can find you a pool.

679
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,077
Okay.

680
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:32,081
Let'’s see what you can do.
Here.

681
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,481
That'’s what I can do.

682
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,788
Now push me back inside.

683
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,877
Push yourself back inside.

684
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,924
Don'’t pull that motivational
crap on me.

685
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,187
I want to go back in!

686
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:54,103
I'’ll have lunch ready
when you get there.

687
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,758
Chantelle, get back here.

688
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,587
You get back here!
I want to go back inside!

689
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,328
Chantelle!

690
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,590
It'’s uphill!

691
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,418
So'’s life!

692
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:11,207
Chantelle!

693
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,473
Chantelle!

694
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,479
Chantelle!

695
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:22,958
Damn it!

696
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,832
Chantelle!

697
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,154
Here'’s some hot tea.

698
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,390
Water gets lively
this time of year.

699
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,959
Saw some fish.

700
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,442
Couple of herons too.

701
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,750
Are there really
snakes out there?

702
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:17,578
There were when I was little.

703
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:19,406
We kind of ignored them.

704
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,930
Kids aren'’t scared
of anything.

705
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:23,715
I was scared of stuff.

706
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,589
Are you going to do something
to get stronger?

707
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:31,026
And why do you think
I need to be stronger?

708
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:33,246
Because the next one
may not be so nice as me.

709
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,336
Right.

710
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,165
And you'’re
Florence fucking Nightingale.

711
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:42,472
You got a telephone anytime
you want to get rid of my ass.

712
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:50,611
But if I'’m going to stay,
I have to be able to do my job.

713
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,052
Are you going to try it?

714
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,883
Don'’t leave me places.

715
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:14,287
[exhales]

716
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,074
[gasps]

717
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:20,946
[woman]
Hello.

718
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,252
May-Alice.

719
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,430
Oh, shit.

720
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,823
[laughs]

721
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:33,393
[forced laughter]

722
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,005
We'’re so glad
to find you at home.

723
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:38,790
We'’ve been so naughty
about not visiting.

724
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,356
And we weren'’t sure if--

725
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:43,142
We weren'’t positive
you'’d remember us.

726
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,013
That'’s the character
she played, Precious,

727
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,667
not May-Alice.

728
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:48,626
You do remember us,
don'’t you, darling?

729
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,758
Hello?

730
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,455
Chantelle,
these are my old friends,

731
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,501
Ti-Marie
and Precious Robicheaux.

732
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,938
Chantelle is my assistant.

733
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,550
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hello.

734
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,640
[mouths]
Don'’t.

735
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:04,337
Would you like to stay
for lunch?

736
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,861
We'’d love to.

737
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,037
[chuckles]

738
00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:11,170
We'’ve been following
your program.

739
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:14,347
Everybody is so proud
of you.

740
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,566
There are so few people
from here to be recognized

741
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,394
on a national level.

742
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,658
Unless, of course,
you read the sports pages.

743
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:23,443
Edward reads them
out loud to me.

744
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,358
Edward is her husband.

745
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:27,882
Twenty years next May.

746
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:30,493
Precious has inertia
confused with romance.

747
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,452
And Ti-Marie
changes husbands

748
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,541
like Edward changes
automobiles.

749
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:37,239
A new one
every four years.

750
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,198
Anthony lasted five.

751
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:42,549
It took you a year to find him
to serve the papers.

752
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:45,204
Of course,
we'’re very provincial

753
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:49,251
compared to the goings-on
on your television program.

754
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:50,557
What was it called?

755
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,211
"The Young and the Stupid."

756
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:54,604
Was that it?

757
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,781
It'’s a joke, Precious.

758
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,746
What do these people eat
for lunch?

759
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:08,880
And you never married,
did you?

760
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:11,056
-Once.
-Oh!

761
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:16,714
And were you blessed?

762
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,194
-Pardon?
-Children?

763
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,719
She wants to know
if you had children.

764
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,199
I don'’t need an interpreter,
Ti-Marie.

765
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,245
I do speak English.

766
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:27,768
I never had children.

767
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:30,249
What a shame.
And now you can'’t.

768
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:32,599
Precious, slow down,
darling.

769
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,255
I thought about having them,

770
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,257
but I never really did
anything about it.

771
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:40,912
You were always
so eccentric at school.

772
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:42,957
She means different.

773
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:45,394
I just knew you'’d do something
original with your life.

774
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:46,961
Didn'’t we always used to say,

775
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,747
"I wonder how May-Alice
is gonna end up"?

776
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,879
Now you know.

777
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,100
[door closes]

778
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:58,277
Chantelle.

779
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:04,109
Well, what have we here?

780
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,589
We haven'’t unpacked
the china yet.

781
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,809
Moving is such a bother.

782
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,246
You haven'’t moved
in 20 years, Precious.

783
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,119
Well, I can empathize,
can'’t I?

784
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,774
Chantelle, could you bring
some wine?

785
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,522
She is such a jewel.

786
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:28,307
Wherever did you find her?

787
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:30,483
Did her people
work for your parents?

788
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,267
She works for an agency.

789
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:35,531
Ah. You don'’t see as much
colored help these days.

790
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,404
It was the '’60s,
those riots up north.

791
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:40,928
Right. How you'’re going
to keep them down on the farm

792
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,712
after they'’ve burned Chicago?

793
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,324
Did they burn Chicago too?

794
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:47,892
It'’s a joke, Precious.

795
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,546
[chuckling]

796
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,551
Well, ours down here have
certainly caught the attitude.

797
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:58,032
[Ti-Marie] Precious and Edward
have a Guatemalan woman.

798
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,556
-[Precious] Spanish.
-[Ti-Marie] She speaks Spanish.

799
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:02,123
She'’s from Guatemala.

800
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,952
[sighs]

801
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,391
Oh, it'’s warm.

802
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,004
I thought it was gazpacho.

803
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,354
I wasn'’t expecting--

804
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,877
Campbell'’s?

805
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,400
[laughs]

806
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:21,055
Just a little surprised.
Excuse me.

807
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:24,189
My husband, Edward,
can'’t tolerate truly hot soup.

808
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,799
He'’s very sensitive.

809
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,106
Edward? Sensitive?

810
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:30,195
You are so critical of him

811
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:32,371
just because he'’s faithful
and steady.

812
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,026
Steady?
He'’s practically comatose.

813
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:37,506
Edward is in perfect health.

814
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,291
-It'’s a joke, Precious.
-[door slams]

815
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,075
[both chuckle]

816
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:43,208
Chantelle, I just thought
of something else

817
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:44,557
we need at the market.

818
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:53,740
[Precious] I remember
when we were here last.

819
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:57,570
Your parents, God bless them,
were still with us.

820
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,224
Some sort of soiree.

821
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,052
A slumber party.

822
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:04,577
Oh, yes, I remember now.

823
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,579
Laurel Pettibone was there,

824
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,060
and Stacy Lee Ellis.

825
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:10,365
[gasps]

826
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:13,194
And who was that girl?

827
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:15,327
That one with the hair?

828
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:17,111
We all had hair, Precious.

829
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:21,420
No, the one with the hair
who we were so awful to.

830
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:24,597
She wore it in that enormous
braid down her back

831
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:26,904
like some sort
of peasant woman.

832
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:29,167
That was me.

833
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:30,603
[cork pops]

834
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,779
Oh, May-Alice.

835
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,041
[chuckles]

836
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:36,348
It couldn'’t have been you.

837
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,002
It was a picture I had
of Joan Baez.

838
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:41,440
Took me hours
to get the same effect.

839
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,137
Perhaps I misremember.

840
00:48:43,224 --> 00:48:47,750
I'’m thinking of someone
we just tortured.

841
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:49,927
That was me.

842
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,670
[Chantelle]
Miss Culhane?

843
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:56,455
It'’s 2:15.

844
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,283
It'’s time for your injections.

845
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,806
[gasps]

846
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:01,895
Right.

847
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,941
My injections.

848
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:06,073
Oh, dear.

849
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,684
Have we overstayed
our welcome?

850
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,993
If I don'’t have the spasms,
they only take about an hour.

851
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,864
Well, we were just
passing through anyway.

852
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,257
And now we know
where you are.

853
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:17,955
Yes.

854
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,347
You think I'’ll need
the restraints today?

855
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:20,914
They'’ve been set up.

856
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,698
Excuse us, please.

857
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:33,796
That was her
with the strange hair,

858
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:35,668
wasn'’t it?

859
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:37,496
[sighs]

860
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,933
I feel like I'’ve been
picked clean by buzzards.

861
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,718
You hadn'’t seen them
in a while?

862
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:45,765
Not since I boarded with them
at Grand Coteau.

863
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:49,856
I thought that soup bit
was brilliant.

864
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:51,945
You just open the can
and heat it up.

865
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,338
What'’s so brilliant
about that?

866
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:56,036
Well, I thought, you know,

867
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:58,473
you were trying to help me
get rid of them.

868
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:00,867
I can'’t cook.

869
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:02,825
Sure you can.

870
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:05,698
Is there some rule all black
people got to know how to cook?

871
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,265
[in Creole accent]
Darlin'’, down here
there'’s a rule

872
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,397
that everybody got
to know how to cook.

873
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,055
[music playing over TV]

874
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:29,200
You want to watch with me?

875
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:30,679
What is it?

876
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:32,594
Bette Davis
and Joan Crawford

877
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:35,075
pretending they'’re
the Robicheaux sisters.

878
00:50:35,162 --> 00:50:36,555
[chuckles]

879
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,865
Oh!

880
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,258
You thought I looked bad.

881
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,477
[chuckles]

882
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:56,749
Chantelle, do you have to wear
that uniform all the time?

883
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,316
I thought you wanted it on.

884
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,752
It'’s so nursy.

885
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:04,148
I am a nurse.

886
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,454
Not an assistant.

887
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,414
Well, I don'’t know
what else to call you.

888
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:10,806
You'’re not my servant.

889
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:13,766
Thank you.

890
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:17,074
You'’re not my babysitter
or my housekeeper.

891
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,858
I'’m not your friend.

892
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,520
You know, you can go out
at night if you want.

893
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:32,611
Oh, no, I'’m fine
right here.

894
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,787
Must be so boring for you.

895
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:37,224
It'’s a job.
It'’s supposed to be boring.

896
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:40,314
"Oh, no, Miss Culhane.

897
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:42,490
It'’s never boring
working for you."

898
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:43,709
[chuckles]

899
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:47,104
If you want me to be that way,
I'’ll try.

900
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,062
No.

901
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:52,326
You have to be totally
straight with me, okay?

902
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:55,329
Whatever you got on your mind,
I want to hear it.

903
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,287
Yeah?

904
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:58,941
Yeah.

905
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:02,075
You drink too much.

906
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:11,954
No, I don'’t.

907
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,967
Is this the one where
she feeds her sister the rat?

908
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,460
[hammering]

909
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,247
[sighs]

910
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,124
Chantelle?

911
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,346
Somebody is pounding
on my house

912
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:58,479
with a large,
blunt object.

913
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:01,700
He'’s been doing that
for a long time now.

914
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:03,397
Who'’s "he?"

915
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:05,443
He'’s the guy that I hired
to build a ramp

916
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,748
and to fix up the bathroom.

917
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:09,011
You told me you wanted to,

918
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,578
and I think he'’s given
a good price.

919
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:15,496
Why'’d he have to start
so early?

920
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:18,238
It'’s past noon,
Miss Culhane.

921
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,587
Hm.

922
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,378
Could you call me May-Alice?

923
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:30,032
What, you mean when your friends
aren'’t here?

924
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,121
I mean all the time.

925
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,994
Whatever you want.

926
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:42,741
How long have I been
wearing these?

927
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:45,352
Since Monday.

928
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,226
I kind of gross you out,
don'’t I?

929
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:50,836
Is this a trick question?

930
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,722
Rennie.

931
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:10,812
Hi.

932
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:14,076
It'’s Rennie, right?

933
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,687
Yeah, yeah, it'’s--
Yeah, it'’s me.

934
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:16,905
[laughs]
Wow.

935
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,256
How are you?

936
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,258
I'’m fine.

937
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,911
I'’m older.

938
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:25,087
[laughs]

939
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,175
How are you?

940
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:29,396
Um... uh...

941
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:33,835
So you'’re a carpenter?

942
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:38,840
Yeah, some of this,
some of that.

943
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,107
Oh, Chantelle wondered
if you wanted to come inside,

944
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:46,370
have something to drink.

945
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,285
Lemonade, iced tea.

946
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:51,113
Sure.

947
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,637
Great.

948
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:56,467
[laughs]
Rennie.

949
00:54:57,685 --> 00:54:59,339
May-Alice.

950
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,389
You have a family,
I guess.

951
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:07,304
Mm-hm. Oh, yeah.

952
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,176
-How many kids?
-Five.

953
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:12,178
Wow.

954
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:15,616
I didn'’t realize
people had that many anymore.

955
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,358
Us coon-asses do.

956
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:20,317
You still go out
on your daddy'’s boat?

957
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,014
Oh, I suppose
you got your own now.

958
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,190
No, that'’s mostly what I do.

959
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:25,670
Take tourists out
on the swamp

960
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:28,629
and point out the alligators
and snakes.

961
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:30,892
Beats chasing around
an oil patch, like my daddy.

962
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:34,722
Five kids.

963
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:36,594
Mm-hm.

964
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:38,335
I know your wife?

965
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,469
I don'’t see
how you'’d have met.

966
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:46,212
Well...

967
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:52,218
thanks.

968
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:54,873
Later you might want to show me
what you need in the bedroom.

969
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,309
[snickers]

970
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,053
We got all these rails
and things

971
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,750
from the gimp catalog,

972
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:06,537
but I never got around
to having them installed.

973
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:08,843
Well, I'’ll take a look at it.

974
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,804
And, you know,
that'’s a real nice boat you got

975
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:14,414
sitting out front.

976
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:16,416
Hasn'’t been run
in 20 years.

977
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:20,028
Well, ought to somebody
check it out someday.

978
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,340
[door opens and closes]

979
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,736
Why didn'’t you tell me
it was him?

980
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:33,433
Was he somebody special?

981
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,304
[sighs]

982
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,045
At least he'’s not in jail.

983
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,395
[chuckles]

984
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,919
Did you go to school
with him?

985
00:56:41,006 --> 00:56:43,965
He'’s from before
I went off to Grand Coteau.

986
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:47,273
He was real wild.
We all had crushes on him.

987
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,406
But he was--

988
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,104
You know, his daddy wore
alligator teeth around his neck

989
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:54,672
and had all these tattoos.

990
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,849
Rennie'’d come over
and sell fish bait to my daddy.

991
00:56:57,936 --> 00:56:59,938
White trash?

992
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:01,940
It was more complicated
than that.

993
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:06,814
They was the real
swamp Cajuns, darling.
[speaks French]

994
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,862
Rennie Boudreau.
Five kids.

995
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,429
Jesus.

996
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,954
[sighs]

997
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,913
I look like shit,
don'’t I?

998
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:23,875
[indistinct chatter on TV]

999
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:34,929
[man, on TV]
Rolling at first,

1000
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,757
trickling ever downward,

1001
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:40,108
gathering force,
winter snows go into a torrent.

1002
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:43,721
Scouring their ancient pathways
to the valley floor.

1003
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,252
And above it all,

1004
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,515
an eagle soaring

1005
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,691
on the moon-settled mountains.

1006
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:01,478
The river and valleys
all sprang forth.

1007
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:05,264
From this celestial vantage...

1008
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:07,005
[continues indistinct]

1009
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:15,927
[sobs]

1010
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,631
[answering machine beeps]

1011
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:27,982
Hi, May-Alice
isn'’t here right now.

1012
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:30,115
If you want to leave a message,

1013
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:33,727
wait till after the beep
and leave your phone number.

1014
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,121
[answering machine beeps]

1015
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,384
May-Alice is always here.

1016
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:40,168
They know that.

1017
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,257
And what if it'’s for you?

1018
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:44,172
I won'’t be getting
any messages.

1019
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:49,177
Listen, what if the car
takes longer than a day to fix?

1020
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:50,527
Stay over, I guess.

1021
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,354
Be a nice break for me.

1022
00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:57,359
I should tell them to leave
the time they call, huh?

1023
00:58:57,446 --> 00:59:00,798
Hi. May-Alice has crawled
into a hole to die.

1024
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:03,017
If you'’d like to leave
a message, forget about it.

1025
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,671
[answering machine beeps]

1026
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:08,936
-[May-Alice humming]
-[water splashing]

1027
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:33,308
Hello?

1028
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,397
Chantelle here?

1029
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:40,402
No.

1030
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:41,969
She went to town.

1031
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,060
You the lady she...

1032
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:47,540
she working for?

1033
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:49,542
Yes.

1034
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:54,286
I don'’t know
when she'’s going to be back.

1035
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:03,600
You afraid of me?

1036
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,954
Don'’t be.

1037
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,651
Is she okay?

1038
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:12,913
Chantelle?

1039
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,350
Sure. She'’s fine.

1040
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:18,484
Yeah. Happy?

1041
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:21,052
Well, happy. I don'’t know.

1042
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:24,142
I mean, she seems okay.

1043
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:26,623
She lives upstairs.

1044
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,103
I don'’t know if she'’s happy.

1045
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,757
Yeah, no reason you would.

1046
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:32,977
I just live with her
24 hours a day.

1047
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,937
Was she expecting you?

1048
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:39,984
No, I don'’t think
she really wants to see me.

1049
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:41,681
Ah.

1050
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:48,819
It'’s nice to live
near the water.

1051
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:52,300
Yeah. I suppose it is.

1052
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:59,873
You can'’t feel anything
in your bottom half?

1053
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,790
That'’s the general idea.

1054
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:06,706
[sighs]

1055
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,361
Yeah, I felt that once.

1056
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:11,711
Yeah, it started in my feet.

1057
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:15,062
And then it moved
to my knees.

1058
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:20,633
And I remember thinking
how when it reached my heart,

1059
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,243
I'’d be dead.

1060
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,419
What happened?

1061
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:27,988
Well, I just did some more
of whatever it was

1062
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:29,773
I was all messed up on, and...

1063
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,602
and it shot me right past
into somewheres else.

1064
01:01:36,214 --> 01:01:39,173
Did she finish
with the detox?

1065
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:46,615
Yes. I think so.

1066
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,751
Yeah. When she make up her mind
to do something,

1067
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,623
you do not want
to be in her way, Chantelle.

1068
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:57,278
I'’ve noticed.

1069
01:01:57,365 --> 01:02:00,107
Well, you know,
that'’s good.

1070
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,937
She'’s keeping it straight.

1071
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:09,116
I don'’t think I want
to wait around for her.

1072
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,988
Don'’t mind me.

1073
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:13,251
No.

1074
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:17,037
I just ain'’t ready
to do this.

1075
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:21,128
When you see Chantelle,
you tell her...

1076
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,745
I'’m sorry.

1077
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,749
Who do I say came to call?

1078
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,099
Bad news.
She'’ll know who you mean.

Yeah, you'’re right.

1084
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,615
Only thing good here'’s
breakfast,

1085
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:15,313
and that'’s long over.

1086
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,228
Then what are you
doing here then?

1087
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:20,535
Coffee machine busted
over at work.

1088
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:23,234
Come on with me,
get you some real food.

1089
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:26,933
I have to be somewhere.

1090

[laughs]

1091
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:30,589
You got time to burn, girl.

1092
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,504
I'’ve seen that old car
of your white lady'’s

1093
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:35,550
sitting over at
the Bourgeois Brothers garage.

than a three-legged mule.

1095

Can'’t tell you what to do

1096
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:46,518
with the rest of your life,
Chantelle,

1097
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:48,302
but I know you don'’t want
to be spending

1098
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,304
no five hours of it in here.

1099
01:03:55,614 --> 01:03:57,834
How'’s that for you?

1100
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,052
It'’s fine.

1101
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:03,013
That there on top
is court bouillon.

1102
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,450
I made that myself.

1103
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:06,712
Hm.

1106
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,110

1107
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:16,591

Hey, darling.

1110
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:27,602
Hello.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

1112
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:32,129
Albertine'’s my first girl.

1113
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:34,305
She stays with me
most of the summer.

1114
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:35,828
You'’ve got more?

1115
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,352
Yeah, by Albertine'’s mama,

1116
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,311
which was my first wife.

1117
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:43,183
I had her and a boy, Henri.

1118
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,143
Henri just got him
a scholarship to LSU.

1119
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:51,104
Then with my second,
I had Cecile and Eugenie.

1120
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:53,193
They live over
by Breaux Bridge now.

1121
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,196
Don'’t see enough of them.

1122
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:58,068
Then, let'’s see.

1124
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:02,289
Ah, Rosalynn, yeah.

1125
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:05,771

Delia and Lorenzo.

Man who gonna put
his top stallion

1129
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:15,389
on one of my mares.

1130
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,130
You'’re going to let him do that?

1131
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,437
I'’m getting paid,
darling.

1132
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:21,004
Kind of bloodline
his stallion got,

1133
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:23,571
cost me a fortune
for that semen.

1134
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:33,320
You gonna do that, huh,
just like in the cowboy movies?

1135

I'’m a blacksmith.

1136

1138
01:06:50,615 --> 01:06:51,877
Are you following me?

-Come on.

-I don'’t know how.
-Ain'’t nothing to it.

1143
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,104
You have to show me
how to do it.

1144
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:02,322
Show me how.

1145
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,513
No, don'’t be sorry.

1146
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,081
Just don'’t be so suspicious.

1147
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:25,476
The man been married
25 times,

1148
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,391
got more kids
than a field got corn.

1149
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:30,046
How am I supposed
to trust you?

1150
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,179
I never asked you
to trust me, darling.

1151
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:36,008
I just want you
to be with me,

1152
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,966

1153
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:43,363
I already had enough fun
to last me a lifetime.

1154
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:52,285
Will you spend the night
with me?

1155

1156
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,424
You don'’t have to like it.

who wasn'’t satisfied before.

But you'’re the first that
come out and cried about it.

More salt than sugar so far.

1181

I'’m sorry, I just don'’t think
it'’s going to happen.

1182
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,585
Not tonight.

1183
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:47,112

out of my sails there anyway.

It'’s morning.

1210
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:37,178
Really?

1211
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,660
I stayed all night.

1212
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:42,009
They didn'’t finish the car.

1213
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,490
No sense of time in here.

1214
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,321
I see you'’ve been busy.

I don'’t need a sermon.

01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,721
Do you think you can get
through a day without a drink?

1218
01:12:57,808 --> 01:12:59,766
-Sure.
-Okay.

1219
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:02,639
Twenty-four hours,
starting right now.

1220
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:05,119
You have enough problems
with your liver and kidneys--

1221
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:06,730
Hey, you'’re the addict,
not me.

1222
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,995
What do you mean by that?

1223
01:13:18,219 --> 01:13:19,438
He was here?

1224
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:21,092
In the afternoon.

1225
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,094
I hope he didn'’t scare you.

1226
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,965
He wouldn'’t hurt anybody.

1227
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:27,707
I'’m glad to hear it.
He didn'’t seem too healthy.

1228
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,666
Turn that light on,
would you?

1229
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:42,940
Shoot.

1230
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:46,117
This is the only part
I can'’t remember how to do.

1231
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,163
I cleaned up.

1232
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,776
Finished detox a month ago.

1233
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:55,082
Maybe the fixer'’s worn out.

1234
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,344
Am I fired?

1235
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:00,479
I lied to the agency.

1236
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:02,786
I gave them my records
from back in Chicago

1237
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:05,702
and told them I'’d been off
in Europe for two years.

1238
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:10,402
Luther had some restaurants.
He owned a big car.

1239
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:13,231
It was fun living high.
It was exciting.

1240
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:15,625
And then we got
to freebasing,

1241
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:19,237
and all of it
just fell away.

1242
01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:22,806
What stopped you?

1243
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:26,810
I guess I didn'’t want
to die.

1244
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:32,468
I need this job.

1245
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,731
You'’re not fired.

1246
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:39,475
And...

1247
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,348
If I'’m not going
to drink today...

1248
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:45,481
I may as well go to bed.

1249
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,669
[Chantelle]
How are you feeling?

1250
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:04,804
Like shit.

1251
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:14,335
How did you do it?

1252
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,993
First, I was in the hospital.

1253
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,648
There'’s no place to score.

1254
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,392
It'’s back in the real world
that'’s hard.

1255
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:34,573
This isn'’t the real world.

1256
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,664
I know.

1257
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:50,388
[engine sputters]

1258
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:53,609
[camera clicks]

1259
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:02,966
People been cutting your grass
all these years had any sense,

1260
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:05,664
they'’d have brought this inside.

1261
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:08,014
You got you some rust.

1262
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:12,932
A couple or three parts, though,
I can have her running.

1263
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:17,502
Did Chantelle ask you
to fix this?

1264
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,723
No, I just thought
I'’d do it.

1265
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:26,598
Why, you live by the water,
you want a boat.

1266
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,822
So how'’s your daddy
these days?

1267
01:17:34,345 --> 01:17:36,042
Oh, he'’s dead.

1268
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:37,827
Oh.

1269
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:40,003
Yeah, he started him a fight
in Smokey'’s

1270
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:42,483
over at the Sabine Pass.

1271
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,661
A couple of roughnecks
put him away in a parking lot.

1272
01:17:47,488 --> 01:17:49,621
Ah, that'’s the way
he lived it.

1273
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:53,451
I'’ll have her running someday,

1274
01:17:53,538 --> 01:17:54,974
I'’ll take your friend
and you out,

1275
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:56,193
show you the neighborhood.

1276
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,195
Sure.

1277
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:02,155
You never did like it much
down here.

1278
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:04,723
The place is all right.

1279
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,553
I just had problems with
who people expected me to be.

1280
01:18:12,383 --> 01:18:13,776
You okay?

1281
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:16,430
You seem a little upset
about something.

1282
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,737
I'’m fine.

1283
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:20,696
I'’m trying to...

1284
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:25,352
I'’ve started a diet.

1285
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,746
It makes you cranky,
raises your blood sugar

1286
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,356
and all that.

1287
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:33,099
So did you ever
get away from here?

1288
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:35,711
Drafted.

1289
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:37,190
Sent me to the Philippines,

1290
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,236
guard ammunition
on the way to the war.

1291
01:18:41,412 --> 01:18:43,631
And all of us are real proud of
how you did on the TV.

1292
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:46,156
Sure.

1293
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:47,679
You know, I...

1294
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,769
I never did see
your program.

1295
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,119
Arlene won'’t have it
in the house.

1296
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,078
A critic.

1297
01:18:55,165 --> 01:19:00,039
No television, no radio,
no liquor, no card playing.

1298
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:02,520
Can'’t sing a song
unless the Lord'’s name'’s in it.

1299
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:04,696
-That'’s serious.
-Oh, she took religion

1300
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:06,742
between the second
and third babies.

1301
01:19:08,656 --> 01:19:10,310
Her people were like that,

1302
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:13,183
but she'’d run off from them
when I met her.

1303
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,449
She got the kids in it
with her now.

1304
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:19,885
They pray for me a lot.

1305
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:23,106
[chuckles]

1306
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:27,414
Was I snotty to you
when we were kids?

1307
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:30,591
Well, you...

1308
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:32,768
you weren'’t much
of anything to me.

1309
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:37,685
You know, we kind of just
looked at each other.

1310
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:42,778
I think you were real nice
to the people you knew.

1311
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:44,605
You were different,
you know,

1312
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:47,260
but, yeah,
you were real nice.

1313
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:50,220
Then how'’d I get like this?

1314
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:00,621
I'’m laying cement
over at Landry'’s today.

1315
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,971
I'’ll be by
in a couple of days.

1316
01:20:04,016 --> 01:20:05,670
Bye, Rennie.

1317
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:24,210
[grunts]

1318
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:35,395
All right, game'’s over.

1319
01:20:35,482 --> 01:20:36,657
What game?

1320
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,836
Where'’d you put
all the liquor?

1321
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:43,577
-I threw it out.
-It'’s in the trash?

1322
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:44,840
I poured it out.

1323
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,798
The bottles are in the bin.

1324
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,495
You poured it out?

1325
01:20:48,582 --> 01:20:50,062
The recycle people
don'’t want

1326
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,325
nothing left
in the bottles.

1327
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:56,025
Look, Chantelle,
I am not ready for this.

1328
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:59,158
When I get stronger,
I'’ll quit drinking.

1329
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:01,334
If you keep drinking,
you will not get any stronger.

1330
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:05,469
Okay. The deal was 24 hours,
right?

1331
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,514
I'’ve already done that.
Ernie'’s closes by 9:00.

1332
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,168
I'’m not getting you any more.

1333
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,866
What?

1334
01:21:10,953 --> 01:21:12,998
You want it,
you get it yourself.

1335
01:21:14,347 --> 01:21:16,175
I can'’t drive.

1336
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,090
That'’s something
to work towards, isn'’t it?

1337
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:20,788
Don'’t hand me
that condescending bullshit!

1338
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,139
Just go in and get me
some fucking wine!

1339
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:24,836
-Listen to you.
-No, you listen to me.

1340
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:27,186
I hired you, and I want you
to do what I tell you!

1341
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:28,535
Dream on, girl.

1342
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:30,102
Who made you
the fucking warden?

1343
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:33,236
Who made you queen
of the whole damn world?

1344
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,368
You sit around feeling sorry
for yourself,

1345
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:37,805
you miserable, TV-watching,
dried-up old witch!

1346
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,026
You can'’t even go
for more than a day

1347
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:43,115
without a drink, and you'’re not
even a drunk yet!

1348
01:21:43,202 --> 01:21:44,595
You'’re just fucking spoiled!

1349
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,379
Most mornings I wake up,

1350
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,425
I want to get high so bad
I can'’t even breathe!

1351
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:50,035
Cocaine is different!

1352
01:21:50,122 --> 01:21:52,516
Bullshit!
What do you know about it?

1353
01:21:52,603 --> 01:21:54,997
-Where are you going?
-I am going away from you.

1354
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:57,173
I don'’t want to be
around your shit anymore,
do you understand that?

1355
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,522
Away from you!

1356
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,659
[whimpers]

1357
01:22:09,402 --> 01:22:11,317
[breathing heavily]

1358
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:16,279
-[screams]
-[dishes shatter]

1359
01:22:16,366 --> 01:22:18,542
[sobs]

1360
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,755
You'’ve been cooking.

1361
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:01,802
Got to do something
to keep busy.

1362
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:05,197
Smells good.

1363
01:23:05,284 --> 01:23:06,416
Sit.

1364
01:23:16,687 --> 01:23:17,993
Nice plates.

1365
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:21,126
I broke most
of the other stuff.

1366
01:23:21,213 --> 01:23:23,824
You did a number on them.

1367
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:27,045
That'’s okra gumbo there.
You can start with some of that.

1368
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,742
Thank you.

1369
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:31,615
I was going to make biscuits,

1370
01:23:31,702 --> 01:23:34,009
but I couldn'’t find
the lard.

1371
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:37,664
[sighs]

1372
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:41,320
-Chantelle?
-Yeah?

1373
01:23:45,368 --> 01:23:47,022
Iced tea or Kool-Aid?

1374
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,120
-[Chantelle] May-Alice.
-[May-Alice] Yeah?

1375
01:23:58,207 --> 01:24:00,948
-[Chantelle] We'’ve got company.
-[May-Alice] Who is it?

1376
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,863
[Chantelle]
They say they'’re from daytime.

1377
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,126
[May-Alice]
Damn.

1378
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:05,475
Ah!

1379
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:07,955
[laughs]

1380
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,653
Oh, hi.

1381
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,524
-Dawn.
-Oh, baby.

1382
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:13,657
It'’s so good to see you.

1383
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,789
May-Alice. Mwah!

1384
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:18,140
You tracked me down.

1385
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:20,881
Florida junket. They expanded it
to New Orleans this year.

1386
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:25,190
Oh, May-Alice, Nina.
This is Nina Crossley.

1387
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:26,800
-She'’s playing you.
-Yeah, Scarlet.

1388
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:29,847
-Hi.
-Hi.

1389
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:31,718
I'’m back in the story.

1390
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:34,460
Mm-hm.
Vance thought it was time.

1391
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:36,810
-I'’m pregnant.
-Oh, I'’m sorry.

1392
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:39,378
Have a seat, please.

1393
01:24:39,465 --> 01:24:40,945
Oh, no, no, no.

1394
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:42,990
Scarlet is pregnant,
on the show.

1395
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,168
Oh. Wow.

1396
01:24:46,255 --> 01:24:48,866
I'’m taking Lamaze classes.

1397
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:51,825
You know, me, personally,
as a preparation, you know.

1398
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:56,178
I had a hysterectomy.

1399
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:58,615
Oh. I'’m sorry.

1400
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:01,139
On the show. Scarlet.

1401
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,141
-[chuckles]
-My third season.

1402
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:05,578
A hysterectomy?

1403
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:07,363
They took the crib
and left the playpen.

1404
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:08,973
[scoffs]

1405
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:12,107
Oh. Something my mother
used to say.

1406
01:25:12,194 --> 01:25:14,935
-Was she from the South?
-She was from the south side.

1407
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:17,068
Maybe that'’s why the baby
had to be by Zon-Dar.

1408
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,678
Oh, I haven'’t been
keeping up lately.

1409
01:25:18,765 --> 01:25:20,245
Zon-Dar?

1410
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:22,639
-He went back to his planet.
-Ah.

1411
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:25,946
Well, this is a great
surprise.

1412
01:25:26,033 --> 01:25:28,297
-[laughs]
-Have a seat.

1413
01:25:28,384 --> 01:25:29,863
Would you like something
to drink?

1414
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:33,954
Yes. Do you have
sassafras tea?

1415
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,609
Oh, she read that someplace.

1416
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:38,568
Wine spritzer?

1417
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:41,875
We don'’t have anything
alcoholic.

1418
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:44,095
I'’ll just go and bring out
a bunch of stuff.

1419
01:25:49,535 --> 01:25:52,190
Chantelle isn'’t my maid
or anything.

1420
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,105
-Oh. I'’m sorry.
-Oh.

1421
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:56,586
Oh, I thought she was
a family retainer.

1422
01:25:56,673 --> 01:25:58,544
Right.

1423
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:01,939
May-Alice,
this country is so...

1424
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:04,115
It'’s so laden, you know?
It'’s--

1425
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:06,639
Laden? With what?

1426
01:26:06,726 --> 01:26:09,816
Oh, just atmosphere
and portent.

1427
01:26:09,903 --> 01:26:14,647
It'’s like the air
is thick with...

1428
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:16,127
Oh, what'’s it thick with?

1429
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:17,955
Humidity.

1430
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:20,697
Right. Right.
It'’s liquid and heavy

1431
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,481
with history and tradition.

1432
01:26:22,568 --> 01:26:25,354
It'’s fecund.

1433
01:26:25,441 --> 01:26:27,312
Well, it must be great
for the soil.

1434
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:33,492
This land,
deep and inviolate,

1435
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,973
paid for in blood,

1436
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,498
infused with the life spirit
of those

1437
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:42,719
who would endure
on its face.

1438
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:47,724
Standing in mute
and eternal reproach

1439
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:50,814
to the cheap
intransigent babble

1440
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:54,078
of the towns that fester
in its nether parts.

1441
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:57,560
This land,

1442
01:26:57,647 --> 01:27:00,302
whispering
with overripe breath,

1443
01:27:00,389 --> 01:27:04,349
its tale of original sin.

1444
01:27:05,959 --> 01:27:09,702
[Nina]
That'’s amazing. Who wrote that?

1445
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:11,574
I forget.

1446
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:13,532
That'’s why
I'’ve never had kids.

1447
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:15,882
After surviving me as a mother,
they'’d grow up and write

1448
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:18,015
more of that twisted
gothic shit.

1449
01:27:18,102 --> 01:27:19,930
-[laughs]
-May-Alice,

1450
01:27:20,017 --> 01:27:22,062
I think you'’d make
a great mother.

1451
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:25,109
Oh, Dawn, I couldn'’t keep
a pet turtle alive.

1452
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:28,286
And when I was married,
it was to that...

1453
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:29,940
that actor.

1454
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:31,158
He was on the show.

1455
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,554
Jamie? On a soap?

1456
01:27:35,641 --> 01:27:36,903
He played Zon-Dar.

1457
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:39,819
He got you pregnant?

1458
01:27:39,906 --> 01:27:41,473
Ha!

1459
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,301
He'’s got a sperm count
of two.

1460
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:45,390
[all laugh]

1461
01:27:45,477 --> 01:27:47,087
Does this place have a name?

1462
01:27:47,174 --> 01:27:49,568
-[in Cajun drawl]
You mean Lake Arthur?
-Author?

1463
01:27:49,655 --> 01:27:51,266
Arthur, like the king.

1464
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,746
May-Alice is turning back
into a cracker down here.

1465
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,401
I meant the house. Does your
family have a name for it?

1466
01:27:56,488 --> 01:27:58,403
You mean like Belle Rive?

1467
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,579
Well...

1468
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,407
Your apartment in New York
have a name?

1469
01:28:02,494 --> 01:28:04,540
-14-G.
-[Nina laughs]

1470
01:28:04,627 --> 01:28:06,585
Jeffrey calls our apartment
in the Hamptons

1471
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:08,761
-Uncle Tom'’s Condo.
-[laughs]

1472
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:11,024
Excuse me.

1473
01:28:12,243 --> 01:28:13,723
[Dawn sighs]

1474
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:17,161
I feel terrible.

1475
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:21,383
Here I am, I'’m--
I'’m sitting in your backyard,

1476
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,560
having a nice time, and...

1477
01:28:24,647 --> 01:28:26,518
I'’m the one
who stole your part

1478
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:28,390
and had an affair
with your ex-husband.

1479
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:31,218
And now I'’m carrying
his baby.

1480
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,438
An affair?

1481
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:35,614
Oh, not in real life.

1482
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:38,138
Oh, no, no, no.
No, she--

1483
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:44,841
He was taken.

1484
01:28:44,928 --> 01:28:46,930
Taken?

1485
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:49,411
[chuckles]

1486
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:53,719
He'’s grown a lot
since you knew him.

1487
01:28:53,806 --> 01:28:56,635
At least that'’s what I thought,
anyway.

1488
01:28:56,722 --> 01:28:59,595
You poor baby.
How'’d it come out?

1489
01:29:00,944 --> 01:29:03,120
He went back
to his planet.

1490
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:11,302
Can I help you
with anything?

1491
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:12,695
I'’m fine.

1492
01:29:16,307 --> 01:29:18,614
Kim, she doesn'’t eat meat.

1493
01:29:18,701 --> 01:29:21,268
And Nina, she'’s just going
to open it up

1494
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,836
and scrape out
the mayonnaise.

1495
01:29:23,923 --> 01:29:25,055
What about you?

1496
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:27,797
Oh, I eat anything.

1497
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:31,801
So...

1498
01:29:31,888 --> 01:29:33,803
you from around here?

1499
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,414
-Chicago.
-Really?

1500
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,198
[chuckles]
Me too.

1501
01:29:38,285 --> 01:29:40,505
Cooley High.

1502
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:41,898
DuSable.

1503
01:29:41,985 --> 01:29:43,116
Where'’d you live?

1504
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:45,031
Euclid Street.

1505
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:47,251
Ooh. Pill Hill.

1506
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:49,384
Father must have been
a doctor.

1507
01:29:51,037 --> 01:29:53,213
I'’m from out
of Cabrini-Green.

1508
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,432
It'’s a long way out.

1509
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:57,043
Hmm. Yeah.

1510
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,306
So...

1511
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,917
how is she doing?

1512
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:03,398
See for yourself.

1513
01:30:03,485 --> 01:30:05,704
I don'’t think
I could handle it.

1514
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,185
Are you and her
good friends?

1515
01:30:09,882 --> 01:30:12,624
We spent a lot of time
together.

1516
01:30:12,711 --> 01:30:14,017
Work, you know.

1517
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:16,193
Yeah.

1518
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,631
You two seem to get along
pretty well.

1519
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:24,854
We spend a lot of time
together.

1520
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:29,511
I did Blanche.

1521
01:30:29,598 --> 01:30:32,078
I did Laura.

1522
01:30:32,165 --> 01:30:35,604
I did Alma
in "Summer and Smoke."

1523
01:30:35,691 --> 01:30:37,910
I did Frankie
in "Member of the Wedding."

1524
01:30:37,997 --> 01:30:39,434
Where was this?

1525
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:42,001
Minnesota. In school.

1526
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:43,873
Oh, Minnesota, huh?

1527
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:46,963
One more year on daytime,

1528
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,181
save my money,

1529
01:30:48,268 --> 01:30:50,314
I am going to quit.

1530
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,795
I'’m going to go back to class
and I'’m going to do theater.

1531
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:55,406
Uh-huh. I think I'’ve heard
this one before.

1532
01:30:55,493 --> 01:30:57,234
I'’ve said that one before.

1533
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:02,369
[Nina]
I didn'’t ask for the anal probe.

1534
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,632
Hm.

1535
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,899
Four years starving
in New York,

1536
01:31:09,986 --> 01:31:12,423
doing showcases
I had to pay for myself.

1537
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,686
That was my first big break.

1538
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:16,949
[laughs]

1539
01:31:17,036 --> 01:31:20,562
My first feature, this,
like, zero-budget movie

1540
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:23,565
about people who are taken up
into alien spaceships

1541
01:31:23,652 --> 01:31:26,263
and given physicals
against their will.

1542
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:28,483
I go in for the audition,

1543
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:32,356
and the director is really
intense and mysterious.

1544
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:35,794
And he has me sit
with my eyes closed

1545
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:38,057
and free-associate,
right?

1546
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:40,495
We do these improvs
about the aliens

1547
01:31:40,582 --> 01:31:42,497
representing our most
primal fears.

1548
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:44,499
And it'’s great.

1549
01:31:44,586 --> 01:31:46,631
Finally, some real acting.

1550
01:31:46,718 --> 01:31:50,069
And they tell me before I leave
that I'’ve got the part.

1551
01:31:50,156 --> 01:31:51,549
Only I don'’t know
what it is yet,

1552
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,029
but I'’m so thrilled,

1553
01:31:53,116 --> 01:31:54,857
because it'’s this feature,
you know?

1554
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:56,685
It'’s not a student film
or anything.

1555
01:31:56,772 --> 01:32:00,079
So the agent gives me my script,
and I go through it

1556
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:03,474
looking for Margaret,
the part that they say I have.

1557
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:07,304
And I'’ve got my yellow
underliner marker in my hand,

1558
01:32:07,391 --> 01:32:09,262
only it'’s drying out.

1559
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:13,397
And finally I find only one page
with the corner folded over.

1560
01:32:13,484 --> 01:32:16,356
And I'’m in this therapy group
of these people

1561
01:32:16,443 --> 01:32:19,403
who have had these
alien physicals.

1562
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:23,886
And I'’ve got only one line.

1563
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:29,326
"I didn'’t ask
for the anal probe."

1564
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:31,546
Not much to build
a character on.

1565
01:32:31,633 --> 01:32:33,983
But I'’m a professional, right?

1566
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:36,028
I prepared.

1567
01:32:36,115 --> 01:32:38,291
I had backstory
on this woman.

1568
01:32:38,378 --> 01:32:40,598
I knew that she had been
to the hairdresser

1569
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:42,731
before she came
to the therapy group.

1570
01:32:42,818 --> 01:32:45,124
I knew that she didn'’t trust
that guy

1571
01:32:45,211 --> 01:32:47,039
who sat next
to the fuchsia.

1572
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:51,391
I knew that she
turned the TV set on

1573
01:32:51,478 --> 01:32:53,219
the minute she got back
to her apartment,

1574
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:55,047
just for the sound of it.

1575
01:32:55,134 --> 01:32:58,268
And I even had my boyfriend--

1576
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,270
My boyfriend at the time--

1577
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:05,057
With a thermometer, you know,
for the sense memory, right?

1578
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:07,886
I was loaded
for fucking bear.

1579
01:33:07,973 --> 01:33:12,499
So finally it comes time
to shoot the scene.

1580
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,850
And they do one take
of the wide shot,

1581
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:17,461
and they stop
before my line.

1582
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:19,898
I was-- I was terrified

1583
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:21,900
that they were going
to cut it.

1584
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:25,034
They move in for reaction shots,
close-ups.

1585
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,819
Mostly things that mean that
I have to go and sit outside,

1586
01:33:27,906 --> 01:33:31,736
because the camera is set up
where my chair is.

1587
01:33:31,823 --> 01:33:33,390
Well, by the time
they get to me,

1588
01:33:33,477 --> 01:33:34,957
the crew is grumpy
because it'’s late

1589
01:33:35,044 --> 01:33:36,480
and they'’re non-union,

1590
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,090
and don'’t get paid extra
for overtime.

1591
01:33:38,177 --> 01:33:40,223
The lead actor is gone.

1592
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:41,833
He'’s got his shrink
appointment.

1593
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,009
And I'’m...

1594
01:33:44,096 --> 01:33:45,576
I'’m alone.

1595
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:48,797
And I'’m staring
at this piece of tape

1596
01:33:48,884 --> 01:33:51,364
stuck to a stand
next to the camera.

1597
01:33:51,451 --> 01:33:53,236
And the director says,

1598
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:56,718
"Okay, let'’s try it a few times
without cutting,

1599
01:33:56,805 --> 01:33:59,546
and show me
a few different colors."

1600
01:34:07,424 --> 01:34:09,948
[fearful] I didn'’t ask
for the anal probe.

1601
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:14,953
[shocked] I didn'’t ask
for the anal probe.

1602
01:34:17,303 --> 01:34:19,958
[intense] I didn'’t ask
for the anal probe.

1603
01:34:22,221 --> 01:34:24,397
[sad] I didn'’t ask
for the anal probe.

1604
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,446
That was it.

1605
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:35,365
[sighs]

1606
01:34:35,452 --> 01:34:37,584
You come back up,
you let me know right away.

1607
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,543
-You promise?
-I promise.

1608
01:34:41,153 --> 01:34:43,025
Take care.

1609
01:34:43,112 --> 01:34:44,896
[engine starts]

1610
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:56,081
Bye, Chantelle.

1611
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,224
[sighs]

1612
01:35:08,311 --> 01:35:11,183
I need a drink.

1613
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,098
That'’s too bad.

1614
01:35:15,535 --> 01:35:17,189
When do you think
I'’ll be strong enough

1615
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:18,843
to have just a little?

1616
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:22,891
Never.

1617
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:29,245
Do you miss it much?

1618
01:35:29,332 --> 01:35:31,638
-Drinking?
-Acting.

1619
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:42,867
It was the only thing
I was ever good at.

1620
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:51,702
Chantelle?

1621
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,922
Chantelle?

1622
01:35:56,011 --> 01:35:57,664
Chantelle?

1623
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,710
Yeah?

1624
01:35:59,797 --> 01:36:02,278
I think I need help
dressing.

1625
01:36:02,365 --> 01:36:05,411
Do my legs look weird?

1626
01:36:05,498 --> 01:36:06,848
A bit pale.

1627
01:36:06,935 --> 01:36:08,110
More than the rest of me?

1628
01:36:08,197 --> 01:36:10,634
No, not really.

1629
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:16,422
Shorts.
It'’s what I'’m wearing.

1630
01:36:16,509 --> 01:36:18,424
Oh, of course.

1631
01:36:19,991 --> 01:36:22,037
Do you have any
I could borrow?

1632
01:36:23,168 --> 01:36:24,822
Yeah.

1633
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:27,520
Look at this.

1634
01:36:27,607 --> 01:36:29,261
Think you can do anything
with this?

1635
01:36:29,348 --> 01:36:30,872
I'’m not a hairdresser.

1636
01:36:30,959 --> 01:36:32,787
Well, you have friends,
right?

1637
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:35,659
Women friends help each other
with their hair.

1638
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,400
My friends don'’t have
your kind of hair.

1639
01:36:37,487 --> 01:36:39,141
Right.

1640
01:36:39,228 --> 01:36:41,534
And we don'’t have time
for cornrows.

1641
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,015
Why am I doing this?

1642
01:36:44,102 --> 01:36:46,496
Why do I give a shit?

1643
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,106
Because he likes you.

1644
01:36:50,456 --> 01:36:51,849
You think he does?

1645
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:55,461
He asked you out
on his boat.

1646
01:36:55,548 --> 01:36:57,246
He asked you out too.

1647
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:58,638
He'’s not after me.

1648
01:36:58,725 --> 01:37:01,424
He'’s not after me either.

1649
01:37:01,511 --> 01:37:04,644
He'’s just asking us out
to be nice.

1650
01:37:06,255 --> 01:37:08,344
He asked you out.
He asked me to come along.

1651
01:37:08,431 --> 01:37:09,780
Now, if you don'’t want me to--

1652
01:37:09,867 --> 01:37:12,739
No! You have to come.

1653
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,918
Oh, I feel like
I am fucking 13 years old.

1654
01:37:17,005 --> 01:37:19,050
-I am pathetic.
-You'’re not pathetic.

1655
01:37:19,137 --> 01:37:23,098
Or maybe he just wants us
to see his boat.

1656
01:37:23,185 --> 01:37:27,842
Men like that,
to show women their machines.

1657
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:29,495
Mm-hm.

1658
01:37:31,628 --> 01:37:34,674
Or maybe he really is
after you.

1659
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,808
You are pathetic.

1660
01:39:52,595 --> 01:39:53,770
Are we lost?

1661
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:55,206
Oh, no.

1662
01:39:55,293 --> 01:39:56,686
How can you tell?

1663
01:39:56,773 --> 01:39:58,731
I'’ve been coming here
all my life.

1664
01:39:58,818 --> 01:39:59,994
Look.

1665
01:40:01,734 --> 01:40:03,040
[Rennie]
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:40:03,127 --> 01:40:04,607
I saw one of those take off

1667
01:40:04,694 --> 01:40:07,305
with a two-foot mud snake
in his mouth.

1668
01:40:07,392 --> 01:40:10,352
My daddy almost
swallowed his tobacco.

1669
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:12,006
It meant something to him?

1670
01:40:12,093 --> 01:40:14,312
Oh, yeah, everything
meant something to him.

1671
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,837
He had all of them
coon-ass superstitions.

1672
01:40:17,924 --> 01:40:19,839
Catch something in his traps,
whatever it was,

1673
01:40:19,926 --> 01:40:21,885
turtle, gator, possum.

1674
01:40:21,972 --> 01:40:25,062
He'’d cut open the stomach,
see what was inside,

1675
01:40:25,149 --> 01:40:26,498
tell the future.

1676
01:40:26,585 --> 01:40:28,326
Are there a lot of snakes
in here?

1677
01:40:28,413 --> 01:40:30,372
Oh, yeah. This is
cottonmouth heaven in here.

1678
01:40:30,459 --> 01:40:33,114
-I'’ll find some for you.
-Don'’t go out of your way.

1679
01:40:44,212 --> 01:40:46,301
I ain'’t never went out
on any boat.

1680
01:40:46,388 --> 01:40:50,479
Not my father'’s style,
the nature stuff.

1681
01:40:50,566 --> 01:40:54,178
Of course,
maybe if he had had sons...

1682
01:40:54,265 --> 01:40:56,528
You had sisters?

1683
01:40:56,615 --> 01:40:58,095
No.

1684
01:40:58,182 --> 01:41:00,532
He wanted boys.
All he got was me.

1685
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:02,056
[sighs]

1686
01:41:03,405 --> 01:41:05,798
Tough on your mother.

1687
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:08,453
I lost her when I was 14.

1688
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:10,325
Diabetes.

1689
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:16,940
Are you still close
to your father?

1690
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:24,600
I got married
right out of high school,

1691
01:41:24,687 --> 01:41:27,472
and he didn'’t want me to.

1692
01:41:27,559 --> 01:41:30,214
So when we split up,
it was like, you know,

1693
01:41:30,301 --> 01:41:31,737
"I told you so."

1694
01:41:31,824 --> 01:41:34,088
And who needs that, right?

1695
01:41:34,175 --> 01:41:37,830
And later on, when I--

1696
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:41,007
When I hooked up
with Luther, well...

1697
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:44,576
We don'’t talk anymore.

1698
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:45,838
[Rennie]
Lunch.

1699
01:41:45,925 --> 01:41:47,275
Ew! That'’s nasty looking.

1700
01:41:47,362 --> 01:41:49,451
She'’s from Chicago.

1701
01:41:49,538 --> 01:41:52,149
Well, let'’s check out what the
future'’s got in store for us.

1702
01:42:16,347 --> 01:42:18,610
What'’s that mean?
Is it good?

1703
01:42:18,697 --> 01:42:21,526
Passion fish.

1704
01:42:21,613 --> 01:42:22,919
Hold out your hands.

1705
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:25,922
It'’s real bad luck not to.

1706
01:42:36,324 --> 01:42:38,195
Squeeze that little fish
tight now.

1707
01:42:38,282 --> 01:42:41,764
Think about somebody
you want some loving from.

1708
01:42:41,851 --> 01:42:43,287
You'’re making this shit up,
right?

1709
01:42:43,374 --> 01:42:44,941
Oh, no.

1710
01:42:45,028 --> 01:42:46,508
Ever since
there been Cajuns,

1711
01:42:46,595 --> 01:42:48,640
they'’ve been squeezing
the passion fish.

1712
01:42:48,727 --> 01:42:51,426
Some says you got
to swallow them raw.

1713
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:53,167
I don'’t need it that bad.

1714
01:42:57,519 --> 01:42:59,303
What is this island, Rennie?

1715
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:02,350
-Does it have a name?
-Oh, yeah.

1716
01:43:02,437 --> 01:43:03,655
Misère.

1717
01:43:05,222 --> 01:43:06,397
"Misery."

1718
01:43:06,484 --> 01:43:08,225
[Chantelle]
Nice.

1719
01:43:08,312 --> 01:43:11,054
The story is some slave woman
went crazy out here.

1720
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:13,883
Lost her only child
to pneumonia,

1721
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:15,667
run off from her people,

1722
01:43:15,754 --> 01:43:17,626
holed up out here.

1723
01:43:22,587 --> 01:43:24,502
Then the trappers come by
in their pirogues.

1724
01:43:24,589 --> 01:43:27,244
They hear her moaning
and crying about her lost baby.

1725
01:43:29,072 --> 01:43:30,769
Isle of Misery.
You okay?

1726
01:43:30,856 --> 01:43:32,162
Mm-hm.

1727
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,383
What'’d she live on?

1728
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:38,386
Oh, bird'’s eggs, fish.

1729
01:43:38,473 --> 01:43:40,039
Everything out here
that flies, walks,

1730
01:43:40,126 --> 01:43:41,954
hops or crawls got a use.

1731
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:43,173
It'’s all good eating.

1732
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,957
[turns engine]

1733
01:43:47,438 --> 01:43:50,746
[turning engine]

1734
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,402
Something broke?

1735
01:43:58,449 --> 01:44:00,103
Yeah.

1736
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,018
Can you fix it?

1737
01:44:02,105 --> 01:44:03,933
Yeah, but it'’s going to take
a little time.

1738
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,674
I'’m real sorry about this.

1739
01:44:05,761 --> 01:44:07,545
No hurry.

1740
01:44:07,632 --> 01:44:11,375
Sure, we'’ll feed the bugs
while you fix it.

1741
01:44:11,462 --> 01:44:14,335
Well, I got just the thing
for that.

1742
01:44:28,436 --> 01:44:30,438
You-- You better do this.

1743
01:44:30,525 --> 01:44:33,049
It keeps the mosquitoes
off your legs.

1744
01:44:35,704 --> 01:44:37,880
-Mm, looks like fun.
-Help yourself.

1745
01:44:41,318 --> 01:44:43,799
[mouths]
He likes you.

1746
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:19,068
Now are we lost?

1747
01:46:19,155 --> 01:46:21,462
No matter where you'’re at,
there you is.

1748
01:46:24,682 --> 01:46:27,903
Your kids must love
being out here with you.

1749
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:31,646
Oh, Arlene won'’t
let them come.

1750
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:33,561
Says the devil
lives out here.

1751
01:46:33,648 --> 01:46:36,215
That'’s why the trees
won'’t grow straight.

1752
01:46:37,608 --> 01:46:39,218
You getting cold up there?

1753
01:46:39,305 --> 01:46:40,829
We'’re fine up here.

1754
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:42,265
[screams]

1755
01:46:43,571 --> 01:46:45,268
Just fine.

1756
01:46:53,145 --> 01:46:55,757
I'’m really sorry
about all this.

1757
01:46:55,844 --> 01:46:58,803
I loved it.
It was wonderful.

1758
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:00,849
A thrill a minute.

1759
01:47:00,936 --> 01:47:03,242
You want to make a call
from the house?

1760
01:47:03,329 --> 01:47:05,680
Your wife.

1761
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:08,247
Oh, no, she knows where I am.
She'’s not worried.

1762
01:47:08,334 --> 01:47:09,771
Right.

1763
01:47:09,858 --> 01:47:11,555
Well, good night.

1764
01:47:11,642 --> 01:47:12,774
Night.

1765
01:47:17,866 --> 01:47:19,389
Good night.

1766
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:27,919
His wife'’s not worried.

1767
01:47:28,006 --> 01:47:29,486
Should she be?

1768
01:47:29,573 --> 01:47:31,227
Why worry about
some cripple

1769
01:47:31,314 --> 01:47:33,447
who'’s got a freezer compartment
for a pussy?

1770
01:47:33,534 --> 01:47:34,883
Don'’t be like that.

1771
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,580
[sighs]

1772
01:47:36,667 --> 01:47:40,758
Look at me, I'’m pitiful.
My palms are all sweaty.

1773
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:43,369
They smell like fish.

1774
01:47:45,415 --> 01:47:47,504
Passion fish.

1775
01:47:53,684 --> 01:47:54,598
[hammering]

1776
01:48:03,868 --> 01:48:07,568
[hammering continues, echoing]

1777
01:48:39,991 --> 01:48:41,950
[Chantelle]
May-Alice!

1778
01:48:45,388 --> 01:48:46,563
May-Alice!

1779
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:48,957
May-Alice, I found her!

1780
01:48:49,044 --> 01:48:51,873
I found her! It'’s okay!

1781
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,440
May-Alice!

1782
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,312
[Chantelle]
May-Alice.

1783
01:48:57,443 --> 01:48:59,533
[gasps softly]

1784
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,751
May-Alice?

1785
01:49:02,971 --> 01:49:04,538
You okay?

1786
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,847
[sighs]

1787
01:49:12,458 --> 01:49:14,460
I was dreaming.

1788
01:49:16,854 --> 01:49:18,552
You were in it.

1789
01:49:20,771 --> 01:49:23,687
You were on that,
ahem, island.

1790
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:27,604
And you had
this little girl with you.

1791
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:30,564
Don'’t dream that anymore,
okay?

1792
01:49:30,651 --> 01:49:33,392
It'’s a dream.

1793
01:49:34,655 --> 01:49:36,221
It'’s time to go.

1794
01:49:46,405 --> 01:49:49,626
We'’re going to have to get you
a car with hand controls.

1795
01:49:49,713 --> 01:49:52,803
I haven'’t driven
in 20 years.

1796
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:55,719
Hey, I lived in New York.
I took taxis.

1797
01:49:55,806 --> 01:49:59,288
Besides, I'’d look like
fucking RoboCop.

1798
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:01,595
Jesus, there'’s Rennie.

1799
01:50:10,342 --> 01:50:13,302
Want me to pick you up anything
while you'’re in session?

1800
01:50:14,564 --> 01:50:16,305
May-Alice?

1801
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:20,396
I don'’t know.

1802
01:50:20,483 --> 01:50:22,093
Some more film.

1803
01:50:27,446 --> 01:50:29,579
I wish she'’d open up
a little more.

1804
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:32,495
She'’s carrying
a lot of weight around.

1805
01:50:32,582 --> 01:50:35,367
You'’ve gotten
a little more flexible.

1806
01:50:35,454 --> 01:50:36,891
What?

1807
01:50:36,978 --> 01:50:38,588
Especially in your neck
and shoulders.

1808
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,242
Try to cross your chest.

1809
01:50:40,329 --> 01:50:42,200
She'’s been all over me
about my drinking.

1810
01:50:42,287 --> 01:50:44,202
Give me some resistance.

1811
01:50:44,289 --> 01:50:46,683
I used to have a few glasses
of wine with dinner,

1812
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,903
another while I learned
my lines for the next day,

1813
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:50,556
then fall asleep.

1814
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:52,080
The rest of the time
I was working.

1815
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:53,734
The other one.

1816
01:50:53,821 --> 01:50:55,431
Then when I had the whole day
to face--

1817
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:57,868
You'’re getting stronger.

1818
01:50:57,955 --> 01:50:59,870
If I ask for a drink
she won'’t give it to me,

1819
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:01,480
like she'’s the boss.

1820
01:51:01,567 --> 01:51:02,786
You think
it'’s something

1821
01:51:02,873 --> 01:51:04,658
you can handle
on your own?

1822
01:51:08,487 --> 01:51:09,663
No.

1823
01:51:11,099 --> 01:51:12,970
How'’s your bowel function?

1824
01:51:13,057 --> 01:51:17,235
Fine. If I eat at the same time
every day.

1825
01:51:17,322 --> 01:51:20,761
I almost feel like
we could be friends.

1826
01:51:20,848 --> 01:51:23,546
Only there'’s so much garbage
in between us.

1827
01:51:23,633 --> 01:51:25,026
Any shortness of breath?

1828
01:51:25,113 --> 01:51:26,854
Pain in the lungs?

1829
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:29,421
So, what do you think?

1830
01:51:29,508 --> 01:51:30,727
I'’m not done yet.

1831
01:51:30,814 --> 01:51:32,903
I mean about her,
Chantelle.

1832
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:34,513
I'’m a physical therapist,
May-Alice,

1833
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,167
not a marriage counselor.

1834
01:51:36,254 --> 01:51:37,821
Right.

1835
01:51:37,908 --> 01:51:39,605
You'’ve been doing
your standing?

1836
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,912
Doc.

1837
01:51:41,999 --> 01:51:43,087
Don'’t call me doc.
Call me Louise.

1838
01:51:44,785 --> 01:51:46,612
Did you ever fall in love
with a married man?

1839
01:51:48,745 --> 01:51:49,920
[shower running]

1840
01:51:50,007 --> 01:51:51,705
I got to go!

1841
01:51:51,792 --> 01:51:53,707
Sugar!

1842
01:51:55,186 --> 01:51:57,798
Oh, hi.

1843
01:51:57,885 --> 01:51:59,451
Hi.

1844
01:51:59,538 --> 01:52:01,410
I'’m Chantelle.

1845
01:52:01,497 --> 01:52:03,064
I remember.

1846
01:52:07,372 --> 01:52:09,723
Sugar said that you
were at the track.

1847
01:52:14,249 --> 01:52:16,555
Albertine, when your parents
broke up

1848
01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:18,819
and Sugar wasn'’t around,
were you mad at him?

1849
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:21,256
Both of '’em.

1850
01:52:21,343 --> 01:52:23,432
Did you stay mad long?

1851
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,304
No.

1852
01:52:26,391 --> 01:52:27,871
I figured
they'’re just people.

1853
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,612
They got their problems
and I got mine.

1854
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:33,094
You got problems
at your age?

1855
01:52:33,181 --> 01:52:36,010
I'’m working on some.

1856
01:52:46,368 --> 01:52:48,457
[no audio]

1857
01:53:24,275 --> 01:53:25,886
[May-Alice]
Chantelle?

1858
01:53:29,498 --> 01:53:31,065
Chantelle?

1859
01:53:36,113 --> 01:53:38,202
-Chantelle.
-Yeah?

1860
01:53:38,289 --> 01:53:41,379
Could we drive on the right side
of the road for a minute?

1861
01:53:41,466 --> 01:53:44,992
Huh? Sorry. I spaced out.

1862
01:53:48,169 --> 01:53:51,694
So, what did you do
while I was with Louise?

1863
01:53:51,781 --> 01:53:53,696
Just killed time.

1864
01:53:55,306 --> 01:53:56,873

Hello.

1865
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,094
I'’m calling for Chantelle.

1867
01:54:02,923 --> 01:54:06,013
It'’s 5:00 on Thursday.

1868
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:10,669
Denita and I would like
to visit you this weekend.

1869
01:54:10,756 --> 01:54:12,671
Please give me a call.

1872
01:54:22,899 --> 01:54:24,466
My daughter.

1873
01:54:58,543 --> 01:55:00,763
Chantelle is such a wonder
in the kitchen.

1874
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:02,591
I was never much of a cook
to begin with,

1875
01:55:02,678 --> 01:55:05,420
and then with my misfortune,
well...

1876
01:55:05,507 --> 01:55:06,725
You like that, darling?

1877
01:55:06,812 --> 01:55:08,292
It'’s got rice in it.

1878
01:55:08,379 --> 01:55:10,729
[chuckles]
That'’s what makes it boudin.

1879
01:55:10,816 --> 01:55:14,255
We'’ve never had someone
in the family work as a cook.

1880
01:55:14,342 --> 01:55:17,780
Oh, we do share the cooking.

1881
01:55:17,867 --> 01:55:20,391
Mine just doesn'’t taste
like much.

1882
01:55:23,525 --> 01:55:25,744
Denita, it'’s just so nice

1883
01:55:25,831 --> 01:55:28,095
to finally have you here
in person.

1884
01:55:28,182 --> 01:55:31,185
Chantelle talks about you
so much.

1885
01:55:31,272 --> 01:55:33,535
I feel like
I already know you.

Can'’t say that I have.

1890
01:55:45,286 --> 01:55:47,418
Don'’t think my family
ever put anything in the ground

1891
01:55:47,505 --> 01:55:49,855
that wasn'’t a drill pipe.

1892
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:52,423
My grandfather
was a farmer.

1893
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:54,469

1895
01:55:58,038 --> 01:56:00,301
He must have had
some stories.

1896
01:56:00,388 --> 01:56:02,868
None that he cared
to pass on.

1897
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:10,050
Do you think you'’ll continue
to employ my daughter?

1898
01:56:10,137 --> 01:56:12,052
As long as she'’ll have me.

1899
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:15,794
Did she tell you I have
legal custody of Denita?

1900
01:56:17,144 --> 01:56:19,798
She never got
into the details.

1901
01:56:19,885 --> 01:56:22,323
The court gave her to me
when...

1902
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:25,717
when Chantelle was unfit
to be a mother.

1903
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:28,851
Right.

1904
01:56:31,288 --> 01:56:33,769
Denita'’s got some school left
this year,

1905
01:56:33,856 --> 01:56:35,205
but for her vacation...

1906
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:38,469
well, I was wondering...

1907
01:56:40,428 --> 01:56:43,300
a house, a place for her
to run around.

1908
01:56:43,387 --> 01:56:45,476
Well, I'’m not going anywhere.

[Chantelle]
Yeah, real ones.

1912

There'’s a man
that'’s a friend of ours

1913
01:56:54,094 --> 01:56:55,878
who knows all about
where they live.

1914
01:56:55,965 --> 01:56:57,923
Maybe sometime he'’ll
take you out to see all that.

1915
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,795

to the... to the ocean.

You'’ve never seen the ocean,
have you?

1919
01:57:10,371 --> 01:57:13,069
Well, that'’s something
we'’ll have to do.

1920
01:57:21,077 --> 01:57:23,862
I have been missing you
so much.

01:57:27,257 --> 01:57:29,129

And I lost you, Denita.

1925
01:57:44,274 --> 01:57:46,059
You didn'’t forget about me,
did you?

1926
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,199
You remember what Mommy was like
when she was sick?

1927
01:57:56,286 --> 01:57:57,722
Yes.

1928
01:58:00,682 --> 01:58:05,165
You'’re not ever going to see me
like that again. I promise.

I love it.

Last time I saw you,
before you went north,

1941
01:59:00,002 --> 01:59:02,265
-was at one of these.
-Yeah?

1942
01:59:02,352 --> 01:59:05,268
I must have sneaked over

-My daddy didn'’t approve.
-Yeah.

And I never got the nerve up
to ask you to dance.

1945
01:59:14,016 --> 01:59:15,887
Right.

1946
01:59:15,974 --> 01:59:19,413
And then I heard
you had gone away for good.

1947
01:59:25,201 --> 01:59:29,292
Well, my dancing days
are over.

Excuse me, young lady.

1964
02:01:17,792 --> 02:01:19,010
May I have this dance?

02:01:56,178 --> 02:01:58,615
[May-Alice] This is the part
that'’s like magic.

1966

Cute guy.

Did you get
his phone number?

No, but I'’m going
to get me some.

1971
02:02:21,464 --> 02:02:23,423
They make great subjects.

1972
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,469
They'’ll hold still for hours
if they'’re not hungry.

1973
02:02:31,431 --> 02:02:33,607
Hm.

1974
02:02:33,694 --> 02:02:35,304
It'’s nice, isn'’t it?

Mm-hm.

Of course, it'’s easier to get

1977

I'’ll call you and your lady
at the end of the school year.

Well, can I come up?

1982

I don'’t think you should
be back in Chicago.

You'’re not the damn
parole board.

1984

I am Denita'’s

is necessary.

1986

This seems like
a good place for you.

1987
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:44,982
You show me
you can hold on here,

1988
02:03:45,069 --> 02:03:47,071
we'’ll make some plans
for Denita.

1989

Bye-bye, Daddy.

Oh, it'’s right under my nose,
huh?

1994
02:04:36,338 --> 02:04:38,732
Actually,
I'’m looking for somebody.

1995

May-Alice Culhane.

1996
02:04:42,257 --> 02:04:45,782

What about Nina?

1999
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,267
She'’s been gone for weeks.

2000
02:04:52,354 --> 02:04:55,183
We sent Scarlet to
the Mayo Clinic for observation,

2001
02:04:55,270 --> 02:04:57,968
and we have hatched a great plan
to bring you back in.

2002
02:04:58,055 --> 02:04:59,666
We found a scene from before

2003
02:04:59,753 --> 02:05:01,711
where you leave Rhonda
in the living room set

2004
02:05:01,798 --> 02:05:04,845
and you actually walk
over to the door.

2005
02:05:04,932 --> 02:05:08,805
So we shoot a couch scene
on the set.

2006
02:05:08,892 --> 02:05:11,460
Right! You'’re back from
the clinic, no improvement.

2007
02:05:11,547 --> 02:05:14,202
Then we cut to the tape of you
actually walking to the door.

2008
02:05:14,289 --> 02:05:16,683
You go outside,
we cut back to her,

2009
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:18,336
watching from the doorway.

2010
02:05:18,423 --> 02:05:21,949
And I still have amnesia,
and I'’m pregnant?

2011
02:05:22,036 --> 02:05:23,777
Bear with me a second.

2012
02:05:23,864 --> 02:05:26,606
We hold on Rhonda,
and then there is the sound--

2013
02:05:26,693 --> 02:05:29,173
Of screeching brakes.

2014
02:05:30,261 --> 02:05:31,828
Edna called you.

2015
02:05:31,915 --> 02:05:33,613
No, no. I'’m just guessing.
Go on.

02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:35,615
-[laughs]
-All right.

2017
02:05:35,702 --> 02:05:38,052
There was a screech of brakes,
Rhonda screams.

02:05:38,139 --> 02:05:39,314
Cut.

2020
02:05:40,881 --> 02:05:42,665
First thing,
you'’re on a stretcher,

2021
02:05:42,752 --> 02:05:44,537
lights flashing
all around you.

2022
02:05:44,624 --> 02:05:46,669
The driver of the car
that hit you steps forward.

2023
02:05:46,756 --> 02:05:48,889
-Guess who it is?
-Max.

2024
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:51,892
[snickers]
Edna did call you.

2025
02:05:51,979 --> 02:05:55,286
No, no, really. Go on.
Max ran me over, and...

2026
02:05:55,373 --> 02:05:58,638
And he says,
"Scarlet, my God."

2027
02:05:58,725 --> 02:06:01,423
But I don'’t recognize him
because of the amnesia.

2028
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:03,512
No, no, you recognize
his voice, see,

2029
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:07,560
because the impact of the car
cured the amnesia.

2030
02:06:07,647 --> 02:06:09,039
A traumatic blow
like that--

2031
02:06:09,126 --> 02:06:11,607
Can reverse the effects
of what happened

2032
02:06:11,694 --> 02:06:13,522
when I was pushed down
the elevator shaft.

2033
02:06:13,609 --> 02:06:15,393
Exactly. So Max is there.

2034
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:19,223
And I remember him.
But now I'’m paralyzed.

2035
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:21,356
Right. That and...

2036
02:06:23,445 --> 02:06:26,840
well, Edna had to go
beyond that.

2037
02:06:26,927 --> 02:06:29,277
Go beyond?

2038
02:06:29,364 --> 02:06:31,018

with Brenda St. Clair
on "Santa Fe."

2041
02:06:34,543 --> 02:06:37,154
So we thought,
you'’ve lost the amnesia

2042
02:06:37,241 --> 02:06:40,636
and you recognize Max'’s voice,
but...

2043
02:06:41,724 --> 02:06:43,378
I'’m blind.

2044
02:06:43,465 --> 02:06:46,381
See, it works as a metaphor
for Scarlet'’s--

2045
02:06:46,468 --> 02:06:48,557
I'’m paralyzed
and I'’m fucking blind.

2046
02:06:48,644 --> 02:06:50,167
It opens up
so many possibilities.

2047
02:06:50,254 --> 02:06:51,734
Sure.

2048
02:06:51,821 --> 02:06:53,867
I can run into walls
with my chair,

2049
02:06:53,954 --> 02:06:56,347
knock over props.

2050
02:06:56,434 --> 02:06:58,175
Have Max take me back

2051
02:06:58,262 --> 02:07:00,134
so that twit Jessica
can get it on with him

2052
02:07:00,221 --> 02:07:01,526
while I'’m in the room!

2053
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:03,528
None of this
is chiseled in stone yet.

2054
02:07:03,616 --> 02:07:07,532
Why not put me in a coma?
Total fucking veg.

2055
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:09,578
Then you can shoot a few angles
of me in bed

2056
02:07:09,665 --> 02:07:13,016
and I can come down here
and phone in voice-over, Vance.

2057
02:07:13,103 --> 02:07:15,671
Brain death.
Think of the metaphoric
possibilities in that!

2058
02:07:15,758 --> 02:07:18,195
-I'’d have to check with Edna.
-You do that.

2059

02:07:23,287 --> 02:07:24,854
May-Alice.

2061
02:07:28,466 --> 02:07:33,167
This is a chance that'’s not
going to come around again.

2062
02:07:33,254 --> 02:07:35,735
You'’d better think about it.

2063
02:07:35,822 --> 02:07:38,302
I'’m at the Ramada
in Lafayette.

2064
02:07:39,608 --> 02:07:41,175

Uh-huh.

02:08:04,502 --> 02:08:07,244
She seems really good,
don'’t you think?

2069
02:08:07,331 --> 02:08:09,464
I guess.

2070
02:08:09,551 --> 02:08:12,075
I mean, she hasn'’t gained
a lot of weight or anything.

2071
02:08:13,947 --> 02:08:15,600
Think I have a shot with her?

2072
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,125

Ask her.

2076
02:08:25,567 --> 02:08:28,396
You know, I might need an ally
on this, Chantelle.

2077
02:08:28,483 --> 02:08:30,441
She'’d have to come up
right away.

2078

It'’s her life.

2079
02:08:33,575 --> 02:08:36,317
Can'’t have her going to seed
down here, can we?

2080

[Chantelle] Guess he'’s not
staying for dinner.

2081

Help me onboard, okay?

2082
02:09:06,303 --> 02:09:08,175
I want to go out.

[turns motor off]

2084
02:09:45,168 --> 02:09:47,214
We have to talk.

2085
02:09:47,301 --> 02:09:49,172
Yeah.

2086
02:09:50,913 --> 02:09:53,786

to come back to daytime.

2087
02:09:56,092 --> 02:09:58,007
-You could do it.
-Yeah.

2088
02:09:59,617 --> 02:10:01,228
I could.

2089
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:12,282
So, what did
your father say?

2090
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:15,590
He thinks you'’re a good
influence on me.

2091
02:10:15,677 --> 02:10:17,810
[laughs, snorts]

2092
02:10:17,897 --> 02:10:19,812
-Shows how much he knows.
-I can'’t believe

2093
02:10:19,899 --> 02:10:23,554
I still have to do whatever
he says, like I'’m 13 years old.

2094
02:10:25,339 --> 02:10:28,690
I played the faithful daughter
in "Lear" once.

2095
02:10:28,777 --> 02:10:30,431
What'’s her name?

2096
02:10:31,562 --> 02:10:32,737
Cordelia.

2097
02:10:34,522 --> 02:10:37,133
There'’s not much you can do
but play it straight

2098
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:39,092
till it'’s over.

2099
02:10:43,183 --> 02:10:47,274
Haven'’t spent a July down here
since I lit out.

2100
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:49,232
It gets pretty steamy.

2101
02:10:49,319 --> 02:10:51,017
I'’ll bet it does.

2102
02:10:55,630 --> 02:10:58,285
You think he'’d let Denita
stay with you this summer?

2103
02:10:59,721 --> 02:11:01,505
I have to have a job.

2104
02:11:01,592 --> 02:11:03,420
You'’ve got a job.

2105
02:11:03,507 --> 02:11:06,641
In New York City?
He wouldn'’t go for that.

2106
02:11:06,728 --> 02:11:09,470
What'’s New York City
got to do with it?

2107
02:11:09,557 --> 02:11:10,819
It'’s where your show is.

2108
02:11:10,906 --> 02:11:13,778
Back to daytime? P'’shaw.

2109
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:16,912
Darling, it'’s either Friday
nights at 10:00 or nothing.

2110
02:11:16,999 --> 02:11:19,045
You turned him down?

2111
02:11:21,003 --> 02:11:22,135
[sighs]

2112
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:26,574
If I'’m going to be here,

2113
02:11:26,661 --> 02:11:29,969
I need you working for me.

2114
02:11:30,056 --> 02:11:32,449
Bullshit.

2115
02:11:32,536 --> 02:11:35,626
If I'’m lying, I'’m dying.

2116
02:11:40,588 --> 02:11:42,851
Then we'’re stuck
with each other.

2117
02:11:45,462 --> 02:11:47,595
Well, for the time being.

2118
02:11:51,381 --> 02:11:53,862
-Chantelle?
-Yeah?

2119
02:11:53,949 --> 02:11:56,821
