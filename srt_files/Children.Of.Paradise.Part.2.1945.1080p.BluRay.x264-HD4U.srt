00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:55,557
CHILDREN OF PARADISE

2
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:12,151
The famous mime Baptiste Deburau
passionately loves

3
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,737
a minor actress, Garance.

4
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:19,367
Out of timidity, he misses his chance
to conquer her.

5
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,287
Instead, she becomes the mistress

6
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:26,791
of the great actor Frederick Lemaitre.

7
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,175
At the Funambules Theatre,

8
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:40,096
a rich dandy, Count de Montray,

9
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:43,099
offers her his protection.

10
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,108
She turns him down.

11
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,861
But when wrongly accused

12
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:59,657
of taking part in a murder attempt
by her friend Lacenaire,

13
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,911
Garance holds out the count's card

14
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,997
to the astonished police.

15
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:16,257
PART TWO
"THE MAN IN WHITE"

16
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,680
Several years have gone by...

17
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,451
The worst play ever seen
on the Boulevard.

18
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,161
The absolute worst.

19
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,664
- Why do it then?
- Because I signed on.

20
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,582
- Why did you sign?
- I need money.

21
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,376
You earn a fortune.

22
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,171
I end up with nothing,
since I spend more than I earn.

23
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,640
Hurry UP-

24
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:06,975
The authors are impatient.

25
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,643
Alas.

26
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,524
THE INN OF THE ADRETS
IN REHEARSAL

27
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,328
If punctuality
is the courtesy of kings...

28
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,373
it's not that
of Frederick Lemaitre.

29
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,003
And they call them authors. Really.

30
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,674
Why do honest folk persist
in writing tales of brigands?

31
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:43,428
Even convicts could write better
than that.

32
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,638
At least they have experience.

33
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,765
A drink, my little kittens.

34
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,642
For pity's sake.

35
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,357
Thank you, child.

36
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:01,988
Not at all convincing.

37
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,657
Poor Robert Macaire.

38
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:09,579
What's going on, my kittens?

39
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,456
I can't hear you.

40
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,958
We're sad.

41
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,085
We both love you,

42
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,962
but we're friends, so...

43
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:18,796
So?

44
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,882
We don't want to quarrel.

45
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,053
Then do as I do.

46
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,429
Act.

47
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,806
It's your chosen profession.

48
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,727
When I act, I'm madly in love.

49
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:35,563
You hear? Madly.

50
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:41,360
At the final curtain,
the audience leaves with my love.

51
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,445
Understand?

52
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:45,948
I make the audience
a gift of my love.

53
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,450
The audience is gratified,

54
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,826
and so am I.

55
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,162
Then I become sensible,

56
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,289
calm and free again,

57
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,083
silent as Baptiste.

58
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
Not that again.

59
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,336
That's all I hear.

60
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,670
"Have you seen Baptiste?"

61
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,506
Even Theophile Gautier:

62
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,258
"Don't miss Baptiste in The Ragman.

63
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,094
A masterpiece."

64
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,346
Calling a pantomime a "masterpiece."

65
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,348
Theophile's gone too far.

66
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,517
Don't touch.

67
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,018
It's a souvenir.

68
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,603
It pricks.

69
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:20,024
"Viper of memory, stab of regret,

70
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,276
red light of oblivion."

71
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:26,197
it's all nonsense, fantasy, hot air.

72
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,367
What I like is reality.

73
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,994
Only two acts, but well made.

74
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,329
Compliments to the authors.

75
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,124
What vulgarity, really.

76
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,543
You think it's funny.

77
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,003
Well, I don't, you hear?

78
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:45,174
That's it. We've quarreled.

79
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,386
Are you angry with me?

80
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,562
Excuse me.

81
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,980
What is it?

82
00:07:59,147 --> 00:07:59,856
Nothing.

83
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,234
Just some people waiting for you.

84
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:04,902
Poor authors.

85
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,238
Not them.

86
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,116
They started rehearsals
without us ages ago.

87
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,410
Admirers, no doubt?

88
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,203
That's it... "admirers."

89
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,246
I'm coming.

90
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,540
Back in a moment, my sweet.

91
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:21,085
Tidy up after you finish
snooping around.

92
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,716
Poor costume. As bad as mine.

93
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:30,136
The manager wants you.

94
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,596
So, where are our knaves?

95
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:35,099
- You make debts, you pay them.
- The cad.

96
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,767
Box his ears.

97
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,687
Jealous husbands, angry creditors.

98
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:40,605
As usual.

99
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,898
Grumblers and malcontents.

100
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,900
A fog of men.

101
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:44,692
You go first.

102
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,278
We'll plunge into the fog once more.

103
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,367
Gentlemen?

104
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,285
Swindler.

105
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,244
My money.

106
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,078
My bills.

107
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,288
You ham.

108
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,458
Help.

109
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,501
They're striking Robert Macaire.

110
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,086
Call out the Cossacks.

111
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,923
They're killing Frederick the Great.

112
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,430
So I run out of the inn
when I hear the shot.

113
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,475
You rush over to the body.

114
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,477
Where the body should be,

115
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,604
as Mr. Lemaitre isn't here.

116
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:22,897
Fine.

117
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,273
Shall we?

118
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,575
The hour of justice strikes.

119
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,994
You won't escape punishment.

120
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,412
Bang!

121
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:42,166
Alas, you have killed him.

122
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,336
O woe.

123
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,338
He was a wicked man,

124
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,131
but he was my husband.

125
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,678
Excuse me. I got carried away.

126
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,890
However, I would like
just a bit more...

127
00:09:58,683 --> 00:09:59,350
A touch more...

128
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,352
A touch more feeling.

129
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,105
Yes, that's right. Feeling.

130
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:08,567
Feeling, feeling, and more feeling.

131
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,448
Dare I hope, gentlemen,
my costume is to your taste?

132
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,784
Not bad. It has something.

133
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,495
This must be some kind...

134
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,371
Of a joke.

135
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,708
Robert Macaire and his evil sidekick

136
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,209
haven't been to their tailor's,

137
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,003
but in a penal colony.

138
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,171
They're bandits, not dandies.

139
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,881
But that eye patch.

140
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,133
It's hideous.

141
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,011
The eye behind it
is even more hideous.

142
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,472
Gentlemen, let's not argue again.

143
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,350
He's here, so let's rehearse Act ll,

144
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,810
scene 9.

145
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,479
On with it.

146
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,065
I'd rather do the scene
with the gendarmes.

147
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,525
It's funnier.

148
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,737
We are not here to amuse the gallery.

149
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,322
A pity.

150
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,074
Oh, well, if you insist.

151
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,744
Come on, Latour, old girl. Scene 9.

152
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,083
My son.

153
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,627
You give me the courage to face

154
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,756
the wretch behind our misfortune.

155
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,095
Egad, my wife.

156
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,517
Yes, your wife and victim.

157
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,103
Woeful Marie.

158
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,064
She does look glum.

159
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,691
Spare us your asides.

160
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,527
On with it.

161
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,113
I am found out.

162
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:39,617
You betrayed me, Marie.

163
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,202
To save my son.

164
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,620
To save your son,

165
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,455
you betray his father.

166
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:45,748
Alas.

167
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,669
I shall feign to be moved.

168
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,547
Marie.

169
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,801
My poor Marie.

170
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,679
Robert. My poor Robert.

171
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,725
Could you really have committed
all those crimes?

172
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,811
What can I say, Marie?

173
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,145
No one's perfect.

174
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,063
Stop!

175
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,023
That's not in the play.

176
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,441
So?

177
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,818
Your play's empty-

178
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,152
It needs some padding.

179
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,445
Outrageous!

180
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,738
That's right.

181
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,990
Your wretched "inn" is empty.

182
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,160
Think the audience
will bring their supper?

183
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,288
They'll bring tomatoes.

184
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,082
You call this a drama?

185
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,083
Some drama.

186
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,709
And in three acts.

187
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,087
One each. So no one feels cheated.

188
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:34,296
Three acts.

189
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,257
I call them actionable.

190
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,134
Don't play with words.

191
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,970
What can I play with? Your ideas?

192
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:41,804
You have none.

193
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,305
Come now, Frederick.

194
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:48,060
We can't be insulted by someone
who got his start in pantomimes...

195
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,103
On his hands.

196
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:50,980
Why not?

197
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,690
You wrote a play with your feet.

198
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,191
Monsieur!

199
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,404
You force us
to take drastic measures.

200
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,198
Monsieur, you signed a contract

201
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,825
and have received...

202
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,535
And spent.

203
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,495
...a generous advance.

204
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,957
Are you prepared to honor
your obligations?

205
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,710
Are you prepared to perform our play?

206
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,880
Why, certainly, gentlemen.

207
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,341
Provided it plays along.

208
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,479
Enough.

209
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,898
We have a description of the culprit.

210
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,858
Don't try to escape.

211
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,818
You're surrounded.

212
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,155
One of them calls himself Remond,

213
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,365
but we know his real name.

214
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,160
It's Robert Macaire.

215
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,328
And Robert Macaire...

216
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,996
ls you.

217
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,082
Prove you're not him, if you can.

218
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,710
He's in a bind. it's not in the play.

219
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,884
By the time he thinks of a line,

220
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,720
I'll have escaped again.

221
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,264
Come on, Rover, let's be off.

222
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:11,435
The drama isn't played out yet.

223
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,488
Frederick, please, come back.

224
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,371
Stop them.

225
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,873
They'll get away.

226
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,466
Don't move, you're surrounded.

227
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,928
Just when I get a chance
to see the play.

228
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,429
Enough speeches.

229
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,430
Surrender.

230
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,267
To whom? You clever boy.

231
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,601
Come now.

232
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,604
You've been unmasked.

233
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,314
We know you're Robert Macaire.

234
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,153
If you're not Macaire,

235
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,655
the escaped convict,

236
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,074
answer me this:

237
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,867
Who are you?

238
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,245
I am Frederick Lemaitre.

239
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,125
Liar.
You're under arrest.

240
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,501
Not again.

241
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,336
Shall We kill him?

242
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,298
Killing gendarmes never hurt anybody.

243
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,884
Fall down, you fool.

244
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,678
You're dead.

245
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,105
Alas, you've killed him.

246
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,691
O woe.

247
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,903
He was a wicked man,

248
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,488
but he was my husband.

249
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,782
Don't worry, dear widow,

250
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,367
it was a false alarm.

251
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,454
Dry your tears.

252
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,039
Your little hubby lives.

253
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,541
Not for long.

254
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,921
It had to end like this.

255
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,798
I die.

256
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,176
Farewell, Marie.

257
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:08,969
Forgive me.

258
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,555
I wasn't a bad man.

259
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,807
It was the company I kept.

260
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,977
I was but the arm that executes,

261
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,854
the hand that strikes,

262
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,648
the foot that leaves its mark

263
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,733
in the dust of crime.

264
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,737
But the true criminals,

265
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,491
those who plotted in the shadows...

266
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,995
I point out to Divine Justice.

267
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,415
The true authors of this crime
are there.

268
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,239
A triumph.

269
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,240
A disgrace...

270
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,283
...without precedent.

271
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,948
So, gentlemen,
I trust you're satisfied.

272
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,285
Monsieur, you've insulted us.

273
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,828
Only your ignorance

274
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,789
prevents you from seeing
that by insulting us,

275
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,126
you have deeply insulted
the Dramatic Arts.

276
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,380
You have sacked and trampled
our oeuvre,

277
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,424
debased our prose.

278
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:11,717
It's good luck.

279
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,761
Vulgarian.

280
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,053
We demand satisfaction.

281
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,598
As you like. Tomorrow morning?

282
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,516
Not a duel.

283
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,520
The Holy Trinity feels offended,

284
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,689
so we have to cross swords.

285
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,274
Arrange it.

286
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,193
Let them draw straws.

287
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,861
I'll fight the winner.

288
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,614
You may have the choice of arms.

289
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,075
I'll be at the chestnut grove
at dawn...

290
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,827
with my seconds.

291
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,384
A wise precaution.

292
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,767
What are you doing here?

293
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,649
How did you get in?

294
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,527
Hands off. it's a souvenir.

295
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,570
It might be one for me, as well.

296
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,738
Who knows?

297
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,490
And who are you?

298
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,408
My name will mean nothing.

299
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,495
As you're famous enough for two,
let's forgo introductions

300
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,747
and get to the purpose of my call.

301
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,124
I'll be brief. I need money.

302
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,919
Everyone does.

303
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,462
More or less.

304
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:35,467
Maybe, but I'd like to know
why you come to me.

305
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,426
I don't even know you.

306
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,970
No matter.

307
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,930
I know you.

308
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,682
All Paris knows you.

309
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,768
You're too kind.

310
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,437
But let's not get carried away.

311
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,982
Yes, you are already famous,

312
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,150
and no doubt rich enough

313
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,029
for a man at bay
to appeal to you, quite simply.

314
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:57,823
At bay?

315
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,992
It's a matter of life and death.

316
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,119
Seriously?

317
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,538
Do I look like I'm joking?

318
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,667
I'm not rich,

319
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,005
but perhaps Fate sent you.

320
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,465
I won at the lottery last week.

321
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,884
I haven't spent it all.

322
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,968
You're in luck.

323
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,054
I'd give it all
to a friend or brother.

324
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,725
But as I haven't the honor
of knowing you...

325
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,685
all I can say is:

326
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,353
Let's share it.

327
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,231
If this little amount can help,

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,525
it's all yours.

329
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,485
"Quite simply."

330
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,033
You amaze me.
Actors are said to be misers.

331
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,160
Great ones, especially.

332
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,995
Fine, then.

333
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,706
There's still progress to be made.

334
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,834
You practice a peculiar craft.

335
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,169
The finest.

336
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,171
No doubt.

337
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,257
But you make hearts beat

338
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,051
every night at the same hour.

339
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,637
You don't understand.

340
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,430
That's the beauty of it.

341
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,973
It's dazzling.

342
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,268
To feel and hear your heart

343
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,937
and the heart of the audience

344
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,521
beat at the same time.

345
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,650
How promiscuous.

346
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,197
If my heart starts to beat loudly,

347
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,242
I take special delight
in being the only one to hear it.

348
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:30,707
May I ask what the owner
of such a heart does in life?

349
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,919
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

350
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,130
I write plays in my spare time.

351
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,010
You're an author.

352
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,346
An neglected author, no doubt.

353
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,223
Yes, neglected.

354
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,934
But I have no regrets.

355
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,560
I write light pieces,

356
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,398
but nowadays people prefer tragedies.

357
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,359
I'm fond of one of my plays, though.

358
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,696
A short piece full of joy and sorrow.

359
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:04,408
Two lovers are parted, reunited,

360
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,951
then parted again.

361
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,912
The setting, all in soft green:

362
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,707
a garden, a fountain.

363
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,625
Interesting.

364
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,086
But tell me...

365
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,171
now that we're acquainted...

366
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,965
was this money business

367
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,093
really a matter of life and death?

368
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,594
Yes.

369
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:25,595
For you.

370
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,514
For me?

371
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,309
Had you been so foolhardy
as to refuse...

372
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,274
I can assure you the blade
doesn't retract into the handle.

373
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,277
You don't think Frederick
would resist?

374
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,612
I didn't come here alone.

375
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,041
Incredible.

376
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,376
Like a scene from the play.

377
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,420
Happy now?

378
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,756
I sure am.

379
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,301
This imbecile is
a great admirer of yours.

380
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,802
The thought of...

381
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,179
I felt sick.

382
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,722
No, really?

383
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:09,973
How nice.

384
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,852
So there are decent folks
in every trade.

385
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,354
So, did you enjoy the play?

386
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,190
Don't ask.

387
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,692
The boy is shy about his feelings.

388
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,652
But you were there tonight?

389
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:23,695
Well?

390
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,113
Interesting.

391
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,782
I wouldn't criticize...

392
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,824
Please do.

393
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,412
It's not every day
you come across a specialist.

394
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,331
A connoisseur.

395
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,666
This is marvelous.

396
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,461
Do me the honor of supping with me.

397
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,671
I had it prepared for the authors.

398
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,548
But I doubt...

399
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,342
But I doubt...

400
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,386
it's most kind of you,
but we don't wish to intrude.

401
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,097
And you must be tired.

402
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,932
Not at all.

403
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,933
Just famished.

404
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,684
No formalities. Let's eat.

405
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,686
If you insist.

406
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,147
I have to regain my strength.

407
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,775
I have a duel at dawn.

408
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,197
It must be unpleasant
to die on an empty stomach.

409
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,116
A duel?

410
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,951
With whom?

411
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,452
With some fool.

412
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,579
You'll kill him, I hope?

413
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,289
If we had to kill every fool...

414
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,791
Indeed.

415
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,628
Yet it would make life
so much easier.

416
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,148
And with success at our doorstep.

417
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,943
You're killing the goose
that lays the golden egg.

418
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,070
The goose might...

419
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,155
Kill us.

420
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,739
Gentlemen, please.

421
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,159
I'm the only one dueling.

422
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,994
Because you're the only one...

423
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,912
...who can use a pistol.

424
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,915
A pistol.

425
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:03,753
Here he comes.

426
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,507
And for once, he's on time.

427
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,778
He's drunk.

428
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,826
Gentlemen, my apologies.

429
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,953
No time to change into black.

430
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,580
We talked all night.

431
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,832
The time flew by.

432
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,335
True, we're not here
to exchange pleasantries,

433
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,878
but lead.

434
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,963
Let me introduce my seconds,

435
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,800
who, for political reasons,

436
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,385
shall remain nameless.

437
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,639
You can't be serious.

438
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,140
You're not your usual self.

439
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,059
My usual self? What's that?

440
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:02,062
You can't even walk straight.

441
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,063
No matter.

442
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,314
I'm not going far.

443
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,399
Besides, in such ceremonies,

444
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:12,489
the line of sight is the shortest
distance between two points.

445
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,497
NO PERFORMANCE

446
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,727
it's sold out, I tell you.

447
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:43,853
And tomorrow?

448
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,689
Not a seat left.

449
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,606
Unheard of.

450
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,192
A ticket seller without tickets.

451
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,285
Oh, Mr. Frederick.

452
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,411
You're hurt?

453
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,121
From a pigeon shoot.

454
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,622
A peck in the arm.

455
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,374
I bet the pigeon's worse off.

456
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,959
Is that why you're closed?

457
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,004
I heard your play
was a hit last night.

458
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,047
The talk of the Boulevard.

459
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,091
It's like with Baptiste.

460
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,426
Things were slow,

461
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,885
and then all of a sudden...

462
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,554
it's incredible.

463
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,557
The whole town's fighting for seats.

464
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,101
But you'll find me one.

465
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,770
That won't be easy.

466
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,482
I've got an idea. Come on.

467
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,907
A young society woman
comes every night,

468
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,411
all alone, incognito,
to see Baptiste.

469
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,413
Lucky Baptiste. Is she pretty?

470
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,289
I don't know.

471
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,790
She wears a veil

472
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,501
and leaves without saying a word.

473
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,092
Excuse me, Madame, just this once.

474
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,680
A seat for an injured gentlemen.

475
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,269
It's all right.

476
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,286
Garance!

477
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,458
Frederick!
What brings you here, sir?

478
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,339
"Paris is so small
for such great lovers as we."

479
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,134
Why the sir; Garance?

480
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,220
Don't be angry.

481
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,639
I'm like that with everyone now.

482
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,518
O Desdemona. Perfidious creature.

483
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,728
To walk off like that, saying,

484
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,313
"See you later,"

485
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,816
and then vanish for years.

486
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,318
And when she decides to return,
she asks innocently,

487
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,904
"What brings you here, sir?"

488
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,656
I never left.

489
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,199
I knew you'd be back.

490
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,368
I waited in this chair.

491
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,244
For years.

492
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,454
You haven't changed.

493
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,333
Neither have you, Madame.

494
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,377
But, in fact, you have.

495
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,671
You have changed.

496
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:18,216
You're more desirable than ever.

497
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,343
And I don't know...

498
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,261
you're.

499
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,681
More distinguished?

500
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,394
You're hurt?

501
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,439
It's nothing. it's already healed.

502
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,025
There are other wounds
that take longer to heal.

503
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,403
Wounded pride, perhaps,

504
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,947
but a wound all the same.

505
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,408
So it was that man,

506
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,244
Desdemona,

507
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:51,040
that man with the flowers
you left with?

508
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,626
Where did you go?

509
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,211
Where did he take you?

510
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,588
That nabob.

511
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,840
To India?

512
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,092
I did go to India.

513
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,553
But not for long.

514
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,055
I lived in England most of the time.

515
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,390
And Scotland.

516
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,934
Is Scotland beautiful?

517
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,979
Yes...

518
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,482
But it's so far away.

519
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,942
I love only Paris.

520
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,196
Paris and its memories.

521
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,114
Baptiste, for example.

522
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,201
Baptiste,
whom you watch every night.

523
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,538
As if you didn't know
that Frederick Lemaitre

524
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,249
also performs nightly.

525
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,518
Listen to the Gods.

526
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,273
I used to laugh like that once.

527
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:41,651
I'd burst out laughing,
just like that, without thinking.

528
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,152
But nowadays...

529
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,737
You're sad.

530
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,074
No, but I'm not cheerful either.

531
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,703
A spring broke in the music box.

532
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,038
The tune is the same

533
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,000
but it's in a different key.

534
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,436
He's marvelous.

535
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,127
He's gentleness itself.

536
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,504
How does he manage to look so cruel?

537
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,868
So you love him?

538
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,412
Since I left,

539
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,832
not a day goes by
that I don't think of him.

540
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,821
He knows you come every night
to see him?

541
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,366
No. He has his life, I have mine.

542
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,327
What would be the point?

543
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,373
This can't be happening to me.

544
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,877
This is absurd.

545
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,838
What is it?

546
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,382
I think I'm jealous.

547
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,843
I don't know.

548
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,845
I've never felt anything like this.

549
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:41,224
It's insidious, unpleasant.

550
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,184
It infects your heart.

551
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,852
You try to reason,

552
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,230
but your reason fails you.

553
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,567
Do you realize, Garance?

554
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,736
Just now,

555
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,405
because of you, because of Baptiste,

556
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,199
I felt jealous.

557
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,743
Me, jealous.

558
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,913
And full of regrets.

559
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,414
That man,

560
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,084
that traveler taking you away,

561
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:10,419
and me letting you go.

562
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,881
And to make things worse,

563
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,760
there's Baptiste
performing like a god.

564
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:21,472
It's not that I want him to be awful,

565
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,140
but maybe just...

566
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,560
Yes, just a bit bad.

567
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,603
Not bad.

568
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,897
But mediocre...

569
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,024
I'd have liked that.

570
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:36,070
At least,
when I talk about it, it stops.

571
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,614
You see? It wasn't so serious.

572
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,617
A slight attack.
You're already recovered.

573
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,120
Recovered?

574
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,957
Why should I recover so fast?

575
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,585
What if I enjoyed it?

576
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,629
What if jealousy was helpful to me?

577
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,924
Useful, even necessary.

578
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:58,467
Thank you, Garance.

579
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,929
Thanks to all of you,

580
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,141
I can at last play Othello.

581
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,436
I didn't feel the character.

582
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:09,979
He was alien to me.

583
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,398
Now he's a friend, a brother.

584
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:13,816
I've found him.

585
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,944
Othello, my heart's desire.

586
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,113
After you, Desdemona.

587
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,783
I'll go embrace Baptiste.

588
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,493
I owe him that much.

589
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,665
Shall I take a message?

590
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,417
Really, Frederick.

591
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,002
I mean it.

592
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,880
True, I may be jealous,
but I understand.

593
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,841
And he has a wife and child.

594
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:40,968
That makes me feel better.

595
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,347
Whereas that other man...

596
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,143
Well, Garance?

597
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,854
You might mention me.

598
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,024
And if he seems to care,

599
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,360
say I'm passing through Paris,

600
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,528
that I'm leaving soon,

601
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,489
and that I'd be happy,

602
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,491
so very happy,

603
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,534
if he came to say hello.

604
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,556
So it's you, ingrate.

605
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:28,891
After all these years.

606
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,186
But the prodigal son returns.

607
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:36,357
Don't forget Alexis's fine
for being drunk, brawling,

608
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,566
and breaking a vase.

609
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,068
Five francs.

610
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:40,569
The fine's gone up?

611
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:41,737
<i>Noblesse oblige</i>

612
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,280
The price of success.

613
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:46,492
You're not doing so badly yourself.

614
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,828
I'm glad. Bravo.

615
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,630
You've come.

616
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,259
And I took the first step.

617
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,593
On one hand.

618
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,928
Hardly.

619
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,930
I've been to see you several times.

620
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:09,598
And no hello?

621
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,100
I didn't dare.

622
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,936
Besides, I was so moved.

623
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,730
You're a great actor now.

624
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:16,647
The greatest.

625
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,524
Really, no.

626
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,568
What you do is sublime.

627
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,236
No, it's you,

628
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,904
There are many great actors.

629
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,448
A few, anyway.

630
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:30,453
But great mimes...
before you there was no one.

631
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:31,871
You're unique.

632
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:32,997
You invented it all.

633
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,124
I'm glad you like my work.

634
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,627
It's Nathalie.

635
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,965
You're a real beauty now.

636
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,760
I'm not beautiful, Frederick.

637
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,970
Just happy-

638
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,640
Beauty and happiness go together.

639
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,977
This little fellow's yours?

640
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,479
What's your name?

641
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:57,563
Baptiste.

642
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:58,981
Like his father.

643
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,027
Quite a family, is it not?

644
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,487
Greetings, Frederick.

645
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,990
It's truly a great day

646
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:11,368
when the greatest actor
in Europe and beyond

647
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:16,957
at last calls on the world's
undisputed masters of pantomime.

648
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,584
And there we are.

649
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:21,170
Greetings, all.

650
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,339
This is Jericho,

651
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,508
alias Wild Boar,

652
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,134
Lone Sleeper.

653
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:32,056
I can't stand his repulsive looks
and distasteful voice.

654
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,393
Here you are, bandit, body snatcher.

655
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,062
Don't start.

656
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,480
Shame on you.

657
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,691
You stole my looks, my identity.

658
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,861
You're not the only ragman in Paris.

659
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,364
Besides, you supplied the costume.

660
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:50,866
I didn't realize what it was for.

661
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:55,204
Every night, Baptiste kills
a poor old man like me...

662
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,540
as entertainment.

663
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,874
What an example.

664
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,877
Enough, friend.
You're drunk and babbling.

665
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,712
Go home to bed.

666
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,548
I may be drunk,

667
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,717
but I've still got principles.

668
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:20,187
Why don't you ever say hello
to OI' Papa Joshua?

669
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,772
You're just like your father.

670
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:25,109
You despise and shun me.

671
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,446
What's Baptiste got against me?

672
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:30,990
Nothing.

673
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,033
Only that you don't mind
your own business.

674
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:36,120
Is it his business
what is or isn't mine?

675
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,247
I've always lived all alone.

676
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,666
So I take an interest in others.

677
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,084
Always alone.

678
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,794
That's no life.

679
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,754
No one to love me.

680
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,048
Nothing, zero, naught.

681
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,926
If I were a widower,
at least I'd have memories.

682
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,053
But no woman would have me.

683
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,225
They preferred
little fly-by-nights and libertines.

684
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,811
Listen, Nathalie.

685
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,147
Let me tell you something.

686
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,774
Sure, it's none of my business,

687
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,610
but it's for your own good.

688
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,111
Spare me your gossip.

689
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,780
Just listen. This won't take long.

690
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,950
Garance is back.

691
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,953
She's here, in Box 7,

692
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,955
and she's waiting for Baptiste.

693
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,291
Garance!

694
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,127
Like the flower.

695
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:33,594
Box 7. Don't forget.

696
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:43,604
Mama.

697
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:44,772
Listen.

698
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,316
It's true, you know.

699
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:50,319
I often miss the Funambules.

700
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:55,324
Do you also have good memories
of our work together?

701
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,160
Yes, good memories.

702
00:42:58,869 --> 00:42:59,870
You're not angry with me?

703
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,456
Why should I be angry?

704
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,750
Garance.

705
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,754
Let bygones be bygones.

706
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,798
It's all behind us now.

707
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:14,343
Come in.

708
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,223
Hello, Madame.

709
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,766
I have a message for you.

710
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:26,522
I came to say we're happy together,

711
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:27,982
Mama, Papa and me.

712
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,693
Did your father send you?

713
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,195
No, Mama did.

714
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:35,531
But Mama, Papa or me...
it's the same.

715
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,034
Mama was right.

716
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:40,703
About what?

717
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:43,580
You're beautiful.

718
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,834
When I grow up,
I'll get married

719
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,212
to someone like you.

720
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,214
Or like Mama, if I can.

721
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,467
You're a darling boy.

722
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,887
Are you married?

723
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,057
You don't have a little boy?

724
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,229
I don't have a little boy.

725
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,356
Then you're all alone?

726
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,276
Yes.

727
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,362
I'm all alone.

728
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,913
Weren't you curious about this woman

729
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,416
who comes to see you every night?

730
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,502
Perhaps you're used to it.

731
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,305
You're on, Baptiste.

732
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:48,645
Listen, Baptiste.

733
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,190
I should have told you sooner.

734
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,443
That woman is Garance.

735
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:58,864
She's back, but not for long.

736
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,619
She'd like to see you,
you understand?

737
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,021
What's wrong?

738
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,195
Good evening, my angel.

739
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,072
Pierre-Frangois.

740
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,532
Who?

741
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:25,701
Ah, yes, Pierre-Frangois.

742
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:29,663
Forgive me. I lose track
of all the names I use.

743
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:33,041
A childish precaution.
The police are so inept.

744
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,376
Unlike me.

745
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:36,295
I am well informed.

746
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,006
For example,
I knew about your return at once.

747
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,883
I learned where you were living,

748
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,676
and with whom.

749
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,220
Nothing escapes you.

750
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,516
And I know they've put
my angel in a gilded cage.

751
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:50,767
I'm not throwing stones.

752
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:53,395
I've been in prison myself lately,

753
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,397
and in the provinces.

754
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,108
Not even a hint of a smile?

755
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,444
I used to amuse you.

756
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,196
Have you lost your gaiety,

757
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:05,240
or is it so unpleasant to see me?

758
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,576
On the contrary,

759
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,411
I'm glad to see you.

760
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,246
Yes, it reminds me of...

761
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,706
An entire era.

762
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,918
Yes, the easy years,

763
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,879
the happy days, the good life.

764
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:22,424
Never look back at the past,
my angel.

765
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,760
It leaps at your throat
like a mad dog.

766
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,012
I was lucky enough to be happy.

767
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:28,013
Despite all.

768
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:28,931
Back then.

769
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,557
Don't be silly.

770
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,768
Then as now.

771
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:34,603
Time has nothing to do
with happiness.

772
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:35,938
Really?

773
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,439
And the man in white?

774
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:40,776
Do you think your friend,
the mime, is happy?

775
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,279
To think I had
the absurd notion of killing him.

776
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:46,281
Comical, no?

777
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:50,244
One might as well stab
at a breeze or a moonbeam.

778
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:53,121
And the other one: Frederick.

779
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,831
I considered him too.

780
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,418
I even called on him
on an amusing pretext.

781
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,586
Which was?

782
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,798
To ask this complete stranger
for money.

783
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:03,840
He'd refuse and...

784
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,425
And he gave it to you?

785
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,594
A large sum. Amazing.

786
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,138
Unselfish people still exist.

787
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:11,974
People.

788
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:13,725
Actors aren't people.

789
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,311
They're every man and no man.

790
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,648
People of high society:
Those are people.

791
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,483
Like Count de Montray,

792
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,069
one of France's richest notables.

793
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,115
- You've changed.
- Have I?

794
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:31,660
You used to speak of yourself,
rarely of others.

795
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,455
But what's become of you?

796
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,833
I've become famous.

797
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,127
A few sensational crimes.

798
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:43,547
The name Lacenaire has been
in the crime columns.

799
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,300
Hunted by police in the provinces,

800
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:50,512
while he is here in Paris
with his guardian angel.

801
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,098
You're a celebrity.

802
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,433
I'm becoming one.

803
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:58,562
But upon reflection,
I'd have preferred literary success.

804
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:00,689
Never satisfied.

805
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:05,360
They say the count
is a generous patron of the arts.

806
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,113
I'd enjoy meeting him.

807
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:09,906
Do you really need to?

808
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,700
Don't worry.

809
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,995
I'd like to meet the man
who laid the icy hand of wealth

810
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:17,456
on the pale shoulder of my angel.

811
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,586
There were no strings attached.

812
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,213
I'm still free.

813
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,673
Perhaps.

814
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,050
That's what bothers me.

815
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,014
It's so painful to see you again,

816
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:36,058
and find you unchanged.

817
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:39,394
I'd prefer to find you
ravaged, submissive,

818
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,938
rendered stupid by wealth.

819
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,734
Then I could have lived
with an easy conscience,

820
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:48,612
and my fine idea of mankind.

821
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,822
My poor Pierre-Frangois.

822
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:53,742
You think I'm a monster, don't you?

823
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,578
Possibly,

824
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,246
but you're not the only one.

825
00:49:58,413 --> 00:49:59,581
Alas.

826
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:32,739
Edouard de Montray, I presume?

827
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,116
Himself.

828
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,243
I was so anxious to meet you.

829
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,620
And now I have. I'm delighted.

830
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:39,788
How amusing.

831
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,790
Amusing and unexpected.

832
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,458
And to whom...

833
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,961
No one. it's of no importance.

834
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:51,133
You do realize that I find
your manner most distasteful.

835
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,218
Who are you, Monsieur?

836
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,097
Is it not absurd to ask people
who they are?

837
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:57,806
Excuse me?

838
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,976
That's why they're so evasive.

839
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,771
They give you the easy reply:
a name, a title.

840
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:08,942
But who they are really,

841
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,487
who they are deep down,
they conceal with great care.

842
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,656
You speak for yourself.

843
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:17,993
No, everyone. You as well.

844
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:20,662
I find your ways quite indiscreet.

845
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:23,498
You don't know me,
yet you ask who I am.

846
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:24,332
The nerve.

847
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,960
Enough.
Where can my seconds...

848
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:30,505
Pointless. I'm not a man who duels.

849
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,007
Absolutely not.

850
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,634
That explains things in part.

851
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,929
Or if I do,
the choice of arms is always mine.

852
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,516
I choose one, just one,

853
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:45,479
and I keep one for me, on me,

854
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:48,190
and I kill when I'm sure,
when it pleases me.

855
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,859
Of course, it's more expeditious.

856
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,861
To each his own method.

857
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:54,863
Quite.

858
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,991
I presume
you have nothing more to say.

859
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,534
Valentin.

860
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:03,038
I warn you I am not a man
one throws out.

861
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:05,415
I would regret
having to kill a servant.

862
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:06,374
Have no fear.

863
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,377
Valentin is an old retainer
to whom I'm very attached.

864
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:13,215
Will you show the gentleman out?

865
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,319
Good evening.

866
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,905
Good evening, my friend.

867
00:53:21,783 --> 00:53:22,868
How strange.

868
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,995
When I'm not home you sing,

869
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,914
but when I come in, you fall silent.

870
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,292
You only like serious music.

871
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,294
Sadly, our tastes differ.

872
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:36,006
May I ask where you spent
the evening?

873
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,674
At the Funambules.

874
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,009
Again.

875
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:43,221
And you,
at those ghastly animal fights.

876
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,931
"Ghastly" is too strong a word.

877
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:48,768
They threw a mangy bear
to three mastiffs like a bone.

878
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:51,104
It wasn't sport, but butchery.

879
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,273
A most dreary evening.

880
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,233
And the Funambules?

881
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,612
I won't be going back again.

882
00:53:58,778 --> 00:53:59,988
I'm delighted.

883
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:02,782
Don't belittle the Funambules.

884
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:04,826
You forget we met there.

885
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,829
Which no doubt explains

886
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,790
your pious nightly pilgrimage?

887
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,334
No, my friend.

888
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:14,336
The contrary would surprise me.

889
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,797
May I know the name of that man
who just left?

890
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:22,177
Were you at the Funambules
with him?

891
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:23,678
That man?

892
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:25,722
I see.

893
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:28,391
An old acquaintance.
He came to say hello.

894
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,019
A most peculiar individual.

895
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,646
What does he do?

896
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:33,939
He writes.

897
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:35,982
To be perfectly honest,
when I knew him,

898
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,651
he was also a thief,

899
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,653
and something of a murderer.

900
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:43,740
I hope there was nothing

901
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,867
between you and this individual.

902
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,702
I trust you entirely.

903
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,663
No merit in that.

904
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,998
I've never had a chance
to lie to you.

905
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:53,291
True enough.

906
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,712
Oblige me by seeing such people
as seldom as possible.

907
00:54:57,879 --> 00:54:59,881
Actors, perhaps,

908
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,675
but thieves, murderers...

909
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:03,718
isn't that rather shocking?

910
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:09,057
Remember the young Scot you
challenged to a duel in Edinburgh?

911
00:55:09,224 --> 00:55:11,393
I remember quite well. Why?

912
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,646
He wasn't nearly
as good a shot as you.

913
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:16,231
Of course.

914
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:17,899
Everyone knew it.

915
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,776
But you killed him anyway.

916
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,904
Feelings, Garance,
in an affair of honor...

917
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,240
All because I smiled at him.

918
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:25,991
Yes.

919
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,702
In public, and frequently.

920
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:32,372
But I told you
I was thinking of another.

921
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,712
Please understand
how much I want your love.

922
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:39,671
For yourself.

923
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:41,798
Don't torment me.

924
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:45,802
You know what I'd do for you,
because of you.

925
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:47,053
Because of me.

926
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,930
I love you as no man...

927
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:50,765
Could ever love me.

928
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:52,267
So why complain?

929
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,061
I want you to love me.

930
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,773
I do love you, my friend.

931
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,360
You're charming, rich, witty.

932
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,904
Friends admire you, others fear you.

933
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,573
You appeal to women.

934
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,908
Everyone loves you.

935
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,453
How could I not do the same?

936
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:12,829
Stop it.

937
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:15,123
You know what I desire,
what I want.

938
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:17,125
You're incredible.

939
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:19,627
Not only are you rich,

940
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:22,505
but you want to be loved
as if you were poor.

941
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,466
But what about the poor?

942
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:28,178
Be reasonable.
Don't deprive them of everything.

943
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:29,971
Understand me...

944
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:32,057
I do.

945
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:35,185
And I'll continue to do
my best to please you.

946
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,437
But don't ask the impossible.

947
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,273
However, if you like,

948
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,067
if it makes you happy,

949
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:45,987
tomorrow all Paris will know
I'm mad about you.

950
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:48,740
Yes, mad.

951
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:51,826
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

952
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,996
But to you, privately, my friend,

953
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:56,831
I say this:

954
00:56:57,207 --> 00:57:00,335
I loved a man,
and I still love him.

955
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:03,505
I came back to Paris to see him.

956
00:57:04,214 --> 00:57:06,674
He let me know he'd forgotten me.

957
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,094
All I can think of now

958
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:12,764
is to leave once again, to get away.

959
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:30,240
NO PERFORMANCE

960
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:41,209
Come in.

961
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,338
Your dinner, Mr. Baptiste.

962
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:48,716
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

963
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,386
You're being unreasonable.

964
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,930
True, I'm unreasonable.

965
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:58,268
Shutting yourself up like a monk.

966
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:00,562
Monks pray.

967
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:02,897
I sleep, I dream.

968
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:04,732
Everyone's looking for you.

969
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,359
Hardly everyone.

970
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:09,404
The Funambules is closed.

971
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:11,948
Your wife, your son, your father,

972
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:13,283
the whole troupe...

973
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:17,036
you can't just forget them like that.

974
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,376
But I couldn't go on living
like an idiot in an asylum,

975
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,045
with everyone around me whispering,

976
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,256
"What's wrong? Is he ill?"

977
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:32,260
I even saw a doctor
to make them happy.

978
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:33,720
What did he say?

979
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,097
That I was fit as a fiddle.

980
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:40,101
"Mild depression, overwork.
It's nothing."

981
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:41,936
And his prescription?

982
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,438
"Go see Baptiste.

983
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,565
That will cheer you up."

984
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:48,776
What if I don't want to cheer up?

985
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,446
What's today?

986
00:58:51,613 --> 00:58:52,906
Thursday.

987
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:58,661
Tonight's the premiere
of Othello, with Mr. Frederick.

988
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,787
You should go.

989
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,206
It will cheer you up.

990
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,790
Oh, sorry.

991
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,961
Othello would make
a nice pantomime.

992
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,423
A man kills his beloved

993
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:13,009
and it kills him, poor man.

994
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:18,640
A sad, absurd tale,
like so many others.

995
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,768
Like mine or yours, Madame Hermine.

996
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:24,979
You spend your empty days
in your empty rooms

997
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,775
with your poor empty heart.

998
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:33,154
It's all so absurd and sad.

999
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,781
Like me.

1000
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:39,118
Years ago, I stood here by this bed,

1001
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,704
in this very room.

1002
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:48,336
And she stood there, smiling, happy,

1003
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,005
so lovely in the fresh night air.

1004
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,465
And she said,

1005
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,009
"Love is so simple."

1006
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:58,680
And I didn't listen.

1007
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,516
I didn't take her in my arms.

1008
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:03,184
I set conditions:

1009
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,727
"Love me as I love you."

1010
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:06,688
And I shut the door,

1011
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,066
forever, between my love and me.

1012
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:14,362
What are you doing here?

1013
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,698
I'm talking to myself.
Not to you.

1014
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:20,368
Forgive me.

1015
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,537
I didn't mean to be unpleasant.

1016
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,165
You've helped me
and been so discreet.

1017
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,543
It's only natural.

1018
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,011
I can't...

1019
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:40,221
I can't stay here any longer.

1020
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:42,557
All alone.

1021
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,395
I have to get out. I have to walk.

1022
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:58,906
Did he eat?

1023
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,199
He Will.

1024
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:01,409
Good.

1025
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:03,786
Thank you for telling me.

1026
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:05,330
I was so anxious.

1027
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:08,207
It's only natural, between women.

1028
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,918
He needs to be alone.

1029
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:13,046
We mustn't disturb him.

1030
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,048
He's not like other men.

1031
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:16,758
Of course not.

1032
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,552
He's like a sleepwalker on a roof.

1033
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:22,347
If you call him, he falls.

1034
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:24,098
That's Baptiste.

1035
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,225
We mustn't call him.

1036
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:28,144
We have to leave him,

1037
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:30,271
wait until he's calm

1038
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,065
and wakes on his own.

1039
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,609
When he wakes,

1040
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,945
he'll come back.

1041
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:58,508
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.

1042
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:02,136
I'll not expostulate with her

1043
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:05,765
lest her body and beauty

1044
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,143
unprovide my mind again.

1045
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,312
Do it not with poison.

1046
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:12,647
Strangle her in her bed,

1047
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:16,109
even the bed she hath contaminated.

1048
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:19,821
Let her rot

1049
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:22,323
and perish

1050
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,119
and be damned tonight,

1051
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,666
for she shall not live.

1052
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,964
Such savagery
and lack of decorum.

1053
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:40,550
I can't say I like
this Mr. Shakespeare.

1054
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,011
True, one goes to the theatre today
not for the play,

1055
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,431
but for the actors.

1056
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:50,143
Don't forget, my friend,
you insisted on coming.

1057
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,687
No doubt I had my reasons.

1058
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,523
Hang her.

1059
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:59,026
I do but say what she is.

1060
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:02,155
The pity of it, Iago.

1061
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,491
The pity of it.

1062
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,050
May I?

1063
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,719
Of course.

1064
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,057
"Desdemona came tonight.

1065
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:34,395
Othello is no longer jealous
He is cured. Thank you."

1066
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,564
You see?

1067
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,233
I assure you, you're wrong.

1068
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,069
Naturally, I'm wrong

1069
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,571
and you're innocent.

1070
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,907
Othello, too.

1071
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:47,825
Please tell me the truth.

1072
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,076
Is it him?

1073
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,496
No, my friend, it's not him.

1074
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:22,443
That handkerchief which
I so loved and gave thee

1075
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:24,779
thou gavest to Cassio.

1076
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:26,614
No, by my life and soul.

1077
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:29,242
Send for the man and ask him.

1078
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:31,202
Sweet soul,

1079
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:33,955
take heed.

1080
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:36,290
Take heed of perjury:

1081
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,584
Thou art on thy deathbed.

1082
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,294
Dying: easily said,

1083
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,421
and just as easily done.

1084
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:44,799
WW do you laugh?

1085
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,093
Because if we duel in the morning

1086
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,430
he won't be here to talk of death
in the evening.

1087
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,224
You're mad.

1088
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:54,809
Why should you care,

1089
01:04:54,976 --> 01:04:57,478
if it's not him you love?

1090
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:01,148
Kill me tomorrow:
Let me live tonight.

1091
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:03,651
Nay, if you strive...

1092
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,570
But half an hour.

1093
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,488
Being done, there is no pause.

1094
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:09,574
But while I say one prayer.

1095
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,826
It is too late.

1096
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:43,482
The play's not over.

1097
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,985
We're just going to the foyer.

1098
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:52,325
I really must congratulate
this remarkable actor.

1099
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,828
If you do, I'll never see you again.

1100
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:58,289
Nor him either, for that matter.

1101
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,390
Come.

1102
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:18,225
Where?

1103
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,354
I don't know. Anywhere.

1104
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:43,417
Monsieur, you play
the bloodthirsty brute so naturally.

1105
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,212
You're too kind.

1106
01:06:46,379 --> 01:06:50,549
I merely played him
as Shakespeare wrote him,

1107
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:53,094
as naturally as possible.

1108
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:56,097
A peculiar fellow,
this Mr. Shakespeare.

1109
01:06:56,764 --> 01:07:01,102
I hear he made his literary debut
as a butcher's apprentice.

1110
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,269
Why not?

1111
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:06,399
Which would explain
the bestial nature of his plays,

1112
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:10,111
and his popularity among
dockers and carters.

1113
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,278
And kings.

1114
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:16,409
I see why I found this play
so distasteful and shocking.

1115
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,161
I'll buy my coachman a seat.

1116
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,372
It's worth trying.

1117
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:25,042
Then allow me to offer you a box

1118
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,293
for your horses.

1119
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,630
"It's worth trying."

1120
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,134
I thought you'd forgotten me.

1121
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,803
I thought I'd lost you forever.

1122
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,472
I've never forgotten you.

1123
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:42,143
You were even in my dreams.

1124
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,438
You saved me from growing old,

1125
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,815
dull and used up.

1126
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,152
My life was so empty.

1127
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,320
I felt so alone.

1128
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:56,157
I kept thinking
I had no right to be sad

1129
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,659
because someone loved me.

1130
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,828
But I still love you.

1131
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:02,121
I always have.

1132
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:03,998
And do you love...

1133
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,293
Don't answer.

1134
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,003
I won't ask for anything.

1135
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,464
You're here.
That's all that matters.

1136
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:15,217
Here, alive in my arms,

1137
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:17,428
like the first time.

1138
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,764
I ask for nothing.

1139
01:08:20,473 --> 01:08:21,849
Only...

1140
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,895
the warmth of your body against mine,

1141
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:30,232
that mouth of yours.

1142
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:33,194
Those eyes of yours.

1143
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:20,282
My compliments.

1144
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:22,284
You were superb.

1145
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,495
May I introduce...

1146
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,579
No need.

1147
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,499
We met once before.
One time too often.

1148
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,251
Amusing.

1149
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:33,921
These gentlemen seek a quarrel
with me,

1150
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,257
all very politely, I admit.

1151
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,592
We all must kill time in some way.

1152
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:43,389
Gentlemen, you're wrong
about my friend here.

1153
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:45,224
I haven't known him long,

1154
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,935
but in his way,

1155
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:50,604
he's a remarkable fellow,

1156
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,107
and not lacking in talent.

1157
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:55,651
All kinds of talents, no doubt.

1158
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,945
It takes all kinds to make a world,

1159
01:09:58,112 --> 01:09:58,946
or unmake it.

1160
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:00,281
Amusing.

1161
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,241
An amusing pleasantry.

1162
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:03,200
Quite.

1163
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:06,579
You really find him amusing?

1164
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,290
Then let us amuse ourselves.

1165
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:11,917
Besides, we run no risk.

1166
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,128
The gentleman doesn't duel.

1167
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,422
Absolutely not.

1168
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:21,427
How do you exercise your talents
these days?

1169
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:23,762
Since you ask,

1170
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:26,015
I'm putting the finishing touches

1171
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:30,352
to something
that will cause a sensation.

1172
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,647
A tragedy, no doubt.

1173
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:36,150
A comedy, a farce.

1174
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:38,944
Or a tragedy, if you prefer.

1175
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:40,362
It's all the same.

1176
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:42,156
There's no difference.

1177
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:43,324
Or so little.

1178
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:45,993
For example, if a king is deceived,

1179
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,622
it's a tragedy of infidelity.

1180
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,373
He's deceived not by his wife...

1181
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:52,791
But by Fate.

1182
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,501
Yes, Fate.

1183
01:10:55,336 --> 01:10:56,712
But if it's a poor devil

1184
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:59,173
like you or me,
Monsieur de Montray...

1185
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,009
and I use "me"
as a figure of speech...

1186
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:05,012
it's no longer a tragedy,

1187
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:06,847
but mere buffoonery,

1188
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:10,643
a sorry tale of cuckolds.

1189
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,812
Yet it's the same wood
under the pauper's cap

1190
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,856
or the king's crown.

1191
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:17,733
The dead wood of love

1192
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:21,320
rotting in the heads of the unloved.

1193
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,697
Always the same matter,

1194
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:25,991
the same stories, the same tears.

1195
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:29,286
So the genre is nothing.

1196
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,829
My play need only amuse.

1197
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:33,040
Starting with the author.

1198
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,211
- If it's performed.
- Don't worry, gentlemen.

1199
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:38,629
It will be.

1200
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:40,631
It's in progress as we speak.

1201
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:42,216
If you'd like a role...

1202
01:11:42,383 --> 01:11:43,050
Very funny.

1203
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,719
It is very funny.

1204
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,555
But, I warn you, there are murders,

1205
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:50,891
and at the final curtain,

1206
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:53,352
the dead won't rise for a bow.

1207
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:55,980
This man is a bore.

1208
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:57,314
Shall we throw him out?

1209
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,190
Good idea.

1210
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,567
Don't try to humiliate me.

1211
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,988
I'm not some character
out of a farce.

1212
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:05,572
But you are.

1213
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,075
And I'll prove it.

1214
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,711
What have you done?

1215
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:21,088
It doesn't concern you.

1216
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:28,387
Gentlemen, I've just savored
a most exquisite moment.

1217
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:32,224
Too bad for you.

1218
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:36,270
I said I wasn't a man
to be thrown out with impunity.

1219
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,285
Again, this doesn't concern you.

1220
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:53,120
How do you know?

1221
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,373
Jealousy belongs to all
if a woman belongs to none.

1222
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,250
They're going to duel.

1223
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,960
Because of us?

1224
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:02,588
Because of me.

1225
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,299
But not before tomorrow.

1226
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:06,508
So?

1227
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,802
We have the night before us,

1228
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,971
with us,

1229
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:13,140
for us.

1230
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,186
If I'm not at home,
I'll be at the baths,

1231
01:13:17,478 --> 01:13:19,646
where I'll be expecting...

1232
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,482
My seconds.

1233
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:25,402
You do me a great honor

1234
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,488
sending to the next world

1235
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:30,908
a man who is not part of yours.

1236
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:58,977
You see here a man who's been ousted,
unceremoniously.

1237
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,773
But the mere thought of them

1238
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,984
killing one another over a woman,

1239
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:07,402
because of me,

1240
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,196
comforts me.

1241
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,365
So we'll be seconds again?

1242
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:13,659
I doubt we'll be asked this time.

1243
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:15,953
Too bad. I like duels.

1244
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,746
That can be arranged.

1245
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,665
If not a duel,

1246
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:23,377
you may be witness to something else.

1247
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:26,088
Because in this affair of honor

1248
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:28,966
I, Lacenaire, am the offended party.

1249
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:32,010
Offended, insulted, even humiliated,

1250
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,763
because they threw me out,
ignominiously.

1251
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,998
How lovely the moonlight is.

1252
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:03,000
Look.

1253
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:06,336
It's shining for us,
like that first night.

1254
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:11,008
And like that first night,

1255
01:15:11,175 --> 01:15:13,343
the window is wide open.

1256
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:19,474
It's wonderful.

1257
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,185
Everything is the same.

1258
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:23,270
Nothing has changed.

1259
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:27,482
The table in the same place.

1260
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:37,701
The bed I slept in.

1261
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:45,459
You haven't changed either.

1262
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:48,128
The same gentleness in your voice.

1263
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,964
The same light in your eyes.

1264
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,092
A little glimmer.

1265
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:09,524
Your heart beating against my hand.

1266
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,820
You were right.

1267
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,281
Love is so simple.

1268
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:32,798
Carnival time.

1269
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:34,258
Life is beautiful.

1270
01:17:02,244 --> 01:17:03,287
A bath, gentlemen?

1271
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:06,373
We merely wish to see
Count de Montray.

1272
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:08,417
At this hour? He's resting.

1273
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,335
He's expecting us.

1274
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,170
In that case,

1275
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,840
please follow me.

1276
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,541
What is it?

1277
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,834
Two gentlemen.

1278
01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:52,836
They say you're expecting them.

1279
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:54,379
Two gentlemen.

1280
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:57,215
Show them in.

1281
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,895
My poor Avril.

1282
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,855
The play is over.

1283
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,941
You can go now.

1284
01:18:56,566 --> 01:19:00,320
You'd be wise to go
to the country for a while.

1285
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:04,032
What about you?

1286
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:07,369
Me. I'm staying here.

1287
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:11,623
I won't risk losing my head
to a country executioner.

1288
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,083
Absolutely not.

1289
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:28,825
It was a wonderful night.
But I must go.

1290
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:32,454
I can't let Frederick die
because of me.

1291
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:33,622
What will you do?

1292
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,707
Find Edouard.

1293
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,251
Tell him I lost my head.

1294
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,045
I'll beg him not to duel.

1295
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:41,505
Will he listen?

1296
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:42,881
Yes.

1297
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:46,009
If I say I love him,
and him alone.

1298
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,637
You're incapable of lying.
He won't believe you.

1299
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,723
He doesn't care if it's not true.

1300
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,099
I know him.

1301
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:56,394
All he really wants
is to hear me say it.

1302
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:58,897
What matters is not that I love him,

1303
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,691
but that I love no one else.

1304
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,736
That's love to him.

1305
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:07,239
What if he asks you
to leave with him?

1306
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:08,990
I'll go.

1307
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:11,451
Perhaps I'll come back.

1308
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,162
I'd have to leave someday.

1309
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:15,914
Why?

1310
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:18,625
You know why.

1311
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:22,963
You have a sweet little boy.

1312
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:24,422
Stop it.

1313
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:27,551
You love your little boy,

1314
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,929
and you love your work.

1315
01:21:32,347 --> 01:21:33,598
And Nathalie.

1316
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:36,851
It's you I love.

1317
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:45,402
- Wait here and be good.
- Will you be long?

1318
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:47,320
No, I'll come back for you.

1319
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:48,280
What for?

1320
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:50,740
It's a surprise.

1321
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,091
Don't leave me.

1322
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:09,509
I can't bear it.

1323
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:11,970
What about me? I have only you.

1324
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,408
Excuse me.

1325
01:22:34,284 --> 01:22:35,702
I came by...

1326
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,163
I thought you'd be alone.

1327
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,540
All alone.

1328
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:46,504
You see, it's carnival today.

1329
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,174
Our son was so happy.

1330
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:51,760
So I came by...

1331
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:55,805
He's dressed as a hussar.

1332
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,642
A lovely hussar uniform.

1333
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:05,899
Please don't let me
stand here like this.

1334
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,525
It's awful.

1335
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:09,611
Talk to me at least.

1336
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,781
Answer me. Say something.

1337
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,449
Anything.

1338
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:17,661
Tell me to go away, laugh in my face.

1339
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,999
Is that all you can say?

1340
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:32,384
I really must go.

1341
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,052
Again.

1342
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:36,763
How easy it must be.

1343
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:39,140
How easy what must be?

1344
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:43,019
Easy to go, then come back.

1345
01:23:43,395 --> 01:23:45,188
You go. You're missed.

1346
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:47,023
Time works for you.

1347
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:49,484
Then you come back,

1348
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:50,735
embellished by memory.

1349
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:55,490
That must be easy.

1350
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:59,577
But to stay and live with someone,

1351
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,747
share his everyday life...

1352
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,083
that's something else.

1353
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,378
You can't fight that.

1354
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:11,756
I've lived with him for six years.

1355
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:13,842
So have I.

1356
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:17,679
You, too?

1357
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:20,098
Me, too.

1358
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:22,851
Anywhere, everywhere, every day.

1359
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:25,228
And every night.

1360
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:28,606
All those nights
spent at another's side,

1361
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:30,233
I was with him.

1362
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,486
Let her finish.

1363
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,114
I want to know everything
about you two,

1364
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:38,324
know what's left for me.

1365
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:41,202
If there's enough to live on.

1366
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,956
What do I care if you love him?

1367
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,751
You don't count.
You don't exist for me.

1368
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:52,464
Listen to me.

1369
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,965
Answer me.

1370
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:56,926
I'm not afraid to suffer.

1371
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:58,720
Everybody suffers.

1372
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:00,638
But I must know.

1373
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:02,682
Tell me now.

1374
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:04,809
Without thinking about it.

1375
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:06,603
Look at me.

1376
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:10,231
Were you always thinking of her
while living with me?

1377
01:25:13,485 --> 01:25:16,070
You don't dare answer.

1378
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:19,991
But your silence tells me
a lot of things,

1379
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,035
things I do understand.

1380
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:27,499
Answer me.

1381
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:30,251
Were you always thinking of her?

1382
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:33,046
Answer me. Even at night?

1383
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,261
What about me?

1384
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,305
What about me?

1385
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:28,810
The game's up. Time to go home.

1386
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:29,811
Let me go.

1387
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:30,770
For shame.

1388
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:33,815
As sure as I'm called Old Maid,

1389
01:26:33,982 --> 01:26:36,901
Wise Counsel, Prim and Proper,

1390
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:39,320
for my sense of morality.

1391
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,072
Let go. You make me sick.

1392
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:28,912
Out of my way.

1393
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,042
