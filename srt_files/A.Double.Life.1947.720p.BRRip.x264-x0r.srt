2
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,105
He looks just like he did
in the other play.

3
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,108
Remember?

4
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,110
Isn't he gorgeous?

5
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,112
Adorable.

6
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,644
Hiya, fellas.

7
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,146
Looking sharp, boy.
Looking sharp.

8
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,148
New hat.

9
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,651
Oh, fine.

10
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,654
Who done it for you,
Lily Dache?

11
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,156
I done it myself.

12
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,659
What a great guy.

13
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,662
You can say that again,
son.

14
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,172
The meeting will come to order.

15
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,174
Hello, Barry.

16
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,177
How are you,
Mr. John?

17
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,179
Dirty heel.

18
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,181
Everybody says.

19
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:42,684
He's a good actor.

20
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,687
Yeah, but he's no good.

21
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,692
Tony!

22
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,196
Oh, hello, Ellen.

23
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,199
Hello!

24
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,204
I haven't seen you
since, um...

25
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:57,612
Sands point.

26
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,710
Yes, that's right.

27
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,212
I lost your number.

28
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:01,715
I knew it was that.

29
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:03,718
What are you geniuses up to?

30
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,220
We're in the Freedley musical.

31
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:06,723
How does it look?

32
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:07,725
Chaotic.

33
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,227
Well, good luck.

34
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:10,228
Thanks. Good-bye.

35
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,731
Ill be seeing you.

36
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:12,733
Good-bye, Tony.

37
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,235
What a darling.

38
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,740
Stinker.

39
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,142
What?
What?

40
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:27,390
Hello, mr. John.

41
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,892
Hello, Anna.
Hello, Max.

42
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,896
Enter Anthony John -
tall, handsome, charming.

43
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,400
Shakes hands with his
dearest friend and mentor

44
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,402
and sits.

45
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:36,405
How did it go last night?

46
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,407
Fine, fine.

47
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,410
"A riot. A veritable funfest."

48
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,912
This play agrees with you.

49
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,915
Ah, good old Anna -
never forgets.

50
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,418
If it were possible,

51
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,423
I'd have you only in
comedy always, so help me.

52
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:48,925
Well, why isn't it?

53
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,929
Every morning after I get up,
I read a play,

54
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,433
every night before I go to bed,

55
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,437
365 days a year,
730 plays,

56
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:56,939
and out of the lot,

57
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,443
if one turns up
that can be produced

58
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,448
and that's got a part
for you, I'm lucky.

59
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,952
Listen. Do me a favor.
Don't forget one thing -

60
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:06,455
you're an actor.

61
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:07,957
You don't say.

62
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,460
A great actor.

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,461
I bow.

64
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,963
You got a responsibility.

65
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,466
You can't stop. You
can't limit yourself.

66
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,469
All right.
Don't get so excited.

67
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:16,971
Well,
I'm an excitable fellow.

68
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,474
Come on.
Let's have it.

69
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:21,980
What is all this?

70
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,981
Othello.

71
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,488
Oh! Ho ho! No!

72
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,489
I was looking over

73
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,492
that old Othello
scheme of yours.

74
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:30,494
You don't know
how good that is.

75
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:34,501
Yes, we did have some
good notions, all right.

76
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,003
Good?

77
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,006
Do you remember that thing

78
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,509
you figured out
for the ending?

79
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,511
Yes.

80
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,014
Where you strangle
Desdemona with a kiss?

81
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,524
Yes. Oh, it sounds
ridiculous now.

82
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,026
You're wrong.

83
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,529
It's brilliant,
and it's believable,

84
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,031
isn't it, Victor?

85
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,032
Isn't what?

86
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,034
Isn't it brilliant?

87
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,036
Also believable.

88
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:57,539
The Othello thing.

89
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,540
How are you, Tony?

90
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,545
Blooming -
blooming in spite of Max.

91
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,550
He's been giving me
a scream-by-scream description

92
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,052
of my own idea.

93
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:10,059
Want to do it, Tony?

94
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:12,563
Do you want to direct it?

95
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,065
I asked you first.

96
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:15,568
I don't know.

97
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:22,078
I don't know. I

98
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:24,583
I know some parts
give me the willies,

99
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,085
on the stage and off.

100
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,087
Where's your ambition?

101
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,591
All used up, Max.
Well, almost all used up.

102
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,963
Well, Ive come
a long way with it.

103
00:06:32,963 --> 00:06:35,968
Remember when I was
that handsome juvenile

104
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:39,474
dashing on with white flannels
and a tennis racket?

105
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,477
"I say, tennis anyone?

106
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:44,482
Right-o. Let's have
another go at it."

107
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:45,985
Yes, and before that,

108
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,988
the chorus of the student prince.

109
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:50,993
I tell you, I was
a happy hambone then.

110
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,497
Vocabulary of 7 words.

111
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,001
Funny, I remember
my father even then,

112
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,005
coming backstage for a touch.

113
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:02,011
And telling me
to get the best of it.

114
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,515
"Get the best of it, boy-boy.

115
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:07,019
I never made it, see,
but you can do it, kid.

116
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,023
You can do it
For the two of us."

117
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:12,528
So I'd slip him a fin,
and he'd mosey off.

118
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,531
I never listened to him.

119
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:17,036
I never listened
to anyone but Brita.

120
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,539
That's when I got
ambition, my boy

121
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,042
When I married Brita.

122
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,544
That's when I wanted

123
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,049
to be something better
than I was,

124
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:28,554
to be an actor, a real actor.

125
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:32,060
I had to teach myself
to talk, do you know it?

126
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,065
And move and think.

127
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,069
I had to tear myself apart

128
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,074
and put myself together
again and again.

129
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,077
The leftover pieces
are all scattered

130
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,082
somewhere between here
and a thousand one-night stands.

131
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:48,087
Oh, sure, I lost plenty

132
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:52,093
Fun and rest and friends
and privacy,

133
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,595
and in that cockeyed way

134
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,599
things have of working out,

135
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,103
it's even cost me Brita.

136
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,609
Would you like to hear
the story of my life?

137
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:04,113
He was a good actor,
your old man.

138
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,615
Oh, thank you, Max,

139
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,620
but you and I both know
he died a doorman.

140
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,623
Look, I wish you'd drop in

141
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,126
and see the show tonight.

142
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,630
It's all right,
but it's not bouncing along

143
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,632
the way it used to.

144
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,135
Who's letting down?

145
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,138
All of us except Brita,
of course.

146
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:20,139
Of course.

147
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,646
She's always wonderful.

148
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:26,149
There's something
interests me, Tony,

149
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,153
because it's none
of my business.

150
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,655
You and Brita,

151
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,658
you've been divorced now,
how long is it, 2 years?

152
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,661
And 4 months.
All right.

153
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:36,666
And you're both
still in love, aren't you?

154
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,669
So?

155
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,172
Why don't we marry again?

156
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:41,174
Yeah.

157
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,179
We love each other
too much for that.

158
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,181
I see.

159
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,683
See you later, friends.

160
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:49,187
Now, what about
The Othello thing?

161
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:50,189
Uh, look,

162
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,694
don't count on me
too much for this, Max.

163
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,697
Ive got a feeling it
isn't the sort of thing

164
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:58,702
I ought to do,

165
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,205
great or no.

166
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,213
Think it over.
We'll talk about it later.

167
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:05,714
All right.

168
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:13,227
We ought to think
about it, too.

169
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,228
Why?

170
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,232
A sensation.

171
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,735
For someone
who's been exposed to it

172
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:19,737
as much as you have,

173
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,740
it's a wonder you don't
know more about acting.

174
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,742
What is there to know?

175
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,747
It's a talent.
Some got it, some ain't.

176
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:26,748
No, no.

177
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,752
When you do it
like Tony does,

178
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,255
it's much more.

179
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,256
The way he has

180
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,760
of becoming someone else
every night,

181
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,268
for just a few hours,
so completely...

182
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,770
No, don't tell me

183
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,773
that his whole system
isn't affected by it.

184
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,776
I swear I never
saw such a thing.

185
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,279
Here I bring up
a great proposition,

186
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,286
and everybody's as gloomy
as closing in New Haven.

187
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:50,288
I don't like trouble.

188
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,790
We'll see.

189
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,294
Yeah, all right.
We'll see.

190
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,814
Hello, Bill.

191
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,816
Max.

192
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,319
Victor here?

193
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,320
Yeah.
Right over there.

194
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,325
I just got the proofs
of Brita's new pictures

195
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:14,827
for the sunday edition.

196
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,332
Fine. Wait till you hear
the next publicity campaign

197
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:19,335
you're gonna do...
knock you on your ear.

198
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,337
Something new?

199
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:21,839
New, old.
Tell you tomorrow.

200
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:25,345
Excuse me, mr. Lasler.

201
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,847
I'm going to marry

202
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,852
the most wonderful man
in the world Martin.

203
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:30,854
My valet?

204
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:31,855
Coffee, miss?

205
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,358
Thank you, Martin.

206
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,867
Just when did all this
happen, Martin?

207
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,370
Miss Cole did me the honor

208
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,872
of accepting my
proposal of marriage

209
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,875
on may 14th last,
sir.

210
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,378
On may 15th,
a fortnight ago...

211
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,380
Thank you.

212
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,381
Not at all, sir.

213
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,883
I gave you my 2-weeks notice

214
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,887
and informed you that I
was going to be married.

215
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:53,391
You didn't say it was to
my girl.

216
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,895
It didn't seem proper
to do so, sir.

217
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,281
Proper!

218
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:03,658
What cheek.

219
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,161
But what charm.

220
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,663
It's no surprise
to me. After all,

221
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,166
he's a gentleman's
gentleman.

222
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Beginning now,

223
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,169
he's a lady's
gentleman.

224
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,176
I'm not going to cry.

225
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,181
Ah, ducky.

226
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:18,182
Honey.

227
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:19,184
Martin!

228
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:20,686
But my dear sir,

229
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,189
my time was up when
the clock struck.

230
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:24,192
I hope Ive given
complete satisfaction.

231
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:25,694
Good-bye.

232
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:28,199
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

233
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,702
Mother!

234
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:01,886
Was I a bit over tonight?

235
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,391
Oh, Max, Ive been
looking for you.

236
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,893
Hello,
mr. Lasler.

237
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,396
Drop over the office.

238
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:12,404
Hello, Victor, dear.

239
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:14,908
That's you, sweetheart!

240
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,411
Oh, Tony!

241
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:17,412
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

242
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:18,914
Yes. Oh, a little later.

243
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,417
Max, are you
going to the party?

244
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,419
No. Ill be...

245
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:28,430
One more.

246
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,434
Oh, leave 'em hungry,
is what I say.

247
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,936
What do you think?
How did it go?

248
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:32,937
Oh, it impressed me.

249
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:33,939
There were a couple spots

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,942
I wanted to talk to you about.

251
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,947
Oh, look who's here
Shakespeare's agent, eh?

252
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,202
Yes?

253
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:42,203
Hello,
Brita.

254
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:43,205
Bill, come on in.

255
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,207
Is it all right?

256
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:45,208
If you don't stay too long.

257
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,210
Hi, Gladys.

258
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,212
Your new pictures.

259
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:48,213
Oh, good.

260
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,216
Oh, I better look them over
in the morning.

261
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,218
Tony and I are going

262
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,720
I know.
I'm going, too.

263
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,722
Can I hitch a ride with you?

264
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,225
Of course.

265
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:56,727
Hey, what's all this
about a new play,

266
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:57,728
something for you and Tony?

267
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:58,730
Play?

268
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,233
Sounded pretty definite,

269
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,235
the way Max talked about it.

270
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,238
I...
I thought you knew.

271
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,741
No, I didn't.

272
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,246
Well, I hope
it's a comedy,

273
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,249
if they want me in it.

274
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,753
Why? You've just
had a year of one.

275
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,756
You know Tony.

276
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:17,261
When he's doing something
gay like this,

277
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,264
it's wonderful
to be with him,

278
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,768
but when he gets going on one
of those deep numbers...

279
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,769
It sounds as if you're
trying to talk yourself

280
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,272
out of marrying him again?

281
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,276
Think so?

282
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,778
Listen, we were engaged
doing Oscar Wilde,

283
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:29,281
broke it off doing O'Neill.

284
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,284
We married doing
Kaufman and Hart,

285
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,287
and divorced doing Chekhov.

286
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,291
Would you advise me to
go through all that again?

287
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,294
Would you take my advice?

288
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,797
Mr. Friend, would you
take my advice

289
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:40,799
and clear out?

290
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,302
She's got to get dressed.

291
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:43,304
Sure. Sorry.
Ill be waiting.

292
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,674
All right.

293
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,176
It seems to me like
I spend half my life

294
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,179
trying to keep people
from not going crazy.

295
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,183
And not succeeding.

296
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,184
Brita: ready, dear?

297
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:54,188
Oh, come on in,
darling.

298
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:55,189
Well, I guess
not many women would

299
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,193
climb all the way
up here to see you.

300
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,194
You think not, eh?

301
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:01,199
Ha ha.
You'd be surprised.

302
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,201
Oh, look.

303
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,203
Oh, lovely.
Beautiful.

304
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,705
Honest, it's like
they were married.

305
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:05,707
It's like
they were engaged,

306
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,211
which is better
than married.

307
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:09,212
Tony, look that over

308
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:10,214
tonight, will you?

309
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,717
Try. Ive got to go up
to Gilbert's for a while.

310
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,219
And talk to Brita about it.

311
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,221
Aw, sure.

312
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,222
See you.
Good night.

313
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,224
Good-bye.

314
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,226
Bye.

315
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:21,232
Talk to Brita about what?

316
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,738
Othello.

317
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,745
Oh, dear.
Is that on again?

318
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,249
Well, just thinking.

319
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,252
What about a holiday, Tony?

320
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,755
Ill take one before I do this,

321
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:35,756
if I do it at all.

322
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:38,260
Oh, sure,
I know those holidays.

323
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,263
Ive shared them with you.

324
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,268
You keep remembering
the rehearsal date,

325
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,272
rushing up to meet you.

326
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:46,775
You think about your part.

327
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:47,776
You worry.

328
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,780
You wake up
and pace the floor all night,

329
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,285
and you go silent for
long stretches all day.

330
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,789
And those
disappearances of yours.

331
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,794
It's a living nightmare,
not a holiday.

332
00:14:58,794 --> 00:14:59,796
That's right,
that's right.

333
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,298
But then what?

334
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:02,801
It's not worth it, Tony.

335
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,305
This past year,
it's been fun, you know?

336
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,807
There have been times
when I almost thought

337
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,811
we'd make it together
again if we tried.

338
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,313
Yeah?

339
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:12,817
I know if we ever got mixed up
in an Othello kind of thing

340
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,821
it would be the end.

341
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,323
Oh, but why, baby?

342
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,826
You know why?

343
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:20,329
Because you won't learn
to leave it at midnight.

344
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,334
I used to and never got past
playing bits in stock,

345
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:24,837
and you're the one
that did that to me.

346
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:25,839
Let's not forget that.

347
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,840
Did what?

348
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,844
Inspired me,
or whatever you call it.

349
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,352
Oh, we'll talk about it
some other time.

350
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,356
You're tired now.

351
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:38,359
Come along.
Let's go to the party

352
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,862
and have a good, gay time,

353
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:40,863
tell yokes to all
the private peoples.

354
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:41,865
Yokes.

355
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:44,369
Jokes. And have
a gorgeous supper.

356
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:45,370
How about that?
Are you ready?

357
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,372
Ah, just about.

358
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:47,875
Oh, yes, that's right.
Bill is coming, too.

359
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,377
I said we'd give him a lift.

360
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,380
Fine.

361
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,883
Look, darling, um...

362
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:53,885
Yes?

363
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,388
Would you mind
going ahead with Bill

364
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,891
and let me come later?

365
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:00,896
Why?

366
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:01,898
Oh, I don't know.

367
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,901
I'd like to prowl around a bit

368
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:07,407
and think this thing over.

369
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:07,908
Tony.

370
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,415
Run along, darling,
will you?

371
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,918
Ill come by later.

372
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,923
Yes. Good night, Tony.

373
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:17,924
Uh, good-bye, dear,

374
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,929
And give my love to society.

375
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,939
Matinee tomorrow, sir.

376
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,441
We're almost out of gargle.

377
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,444
Ill get some.
Fine.

378
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:31,947
Same kind all right?

379
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,449
Yeah. Delicious.

380
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,453
Good night,
Mr. John.

381
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:35,954
Good night.

382
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:42,598
Oh, beware, my lord,
of jealousy.

383
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:46,103
It is the green-eyed monster.

384
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:49,108
All my fond love
thus do I blow to heaven.

385
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,110
'Tis gone.

386
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,616
Arise, black vengeance!

387
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:04,634
Haply, for I am black...

388
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,641
And have not those soft
parts of conversation

389
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,644
that chamberers have.

390
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,878
[speaking italian]

391
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,446
How's the chicken
Cacciatore?

392
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:05,951
It's your stomach.

393
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:06,952
Coffee?

394
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:09,456
Coffee.

395
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:15,967
You all right?

396
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:16,969
Fine.

397
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:17,970
If you
want some good wine,

398
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,472
ask me, the boss.
Some talk, ok.

399
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:20,474
Nice girl to dance with,

400
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:21,977
Ill see what I can do.

401
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,980
No, grazie.
Meglio solo.

402
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,982
Parli italiano.

403
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:25,984
Poco. Poco.

404
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:26,985
Always glad

405
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:28,487
to take care of a new customer.

406
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:29,990
Thank you.
Enjoy yourself.

407
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,993
Take good care of him, Pat.

408
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,499
You from out of town?

409
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:36,500
Why?

410
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,005
I don't know.

411
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,507
You sound like Boston.

412
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,509
I do?

413
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,512
Mm-hmm.
I was in Boston.

414
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,015
That's why I thought.

415
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,517
Pretty quiet up there.

416
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,522
Oh, not the parts
I was in.

417
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:50,523
What parts?

418
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,527
Oh, around.

419
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,532
I had a pretty good
job up there, too.

420
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:57,035
I'm a masseuse.

421
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,536
You don't say.

422
00:19:58,536 --> 00:19:59,538
Sure.

423
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,540
You don't believe me?

424
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,043
I can show you a certificate.

425
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:03,545
I took a course in it.

426
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,048
Masseusing?

427
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:06,550
Sure.

428
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,058
I been out on the coast, too.

429
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:12,560
California?

430
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,564
Sure. I was in Diego,
Pedro, L.A all over,

431
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:18,569
but, uh, I came back east
this last month.

432
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,072
Like it better here?

433
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,576
Soon as I make a few connections

434
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:24,079
Ill like it better.

435
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,584
Um, I may try the modeling game.

436
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,592
All you need is
a few connections.

437
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:33,594
That's right.

438
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,109
You want to know my name?

439
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,611
All right.

440
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,614
Pat.

441
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,120
Pat Kroll.

442
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,632
That we can call these
delicate creatures ours

443
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,635
but not their appetites.

444
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:01,640
I had rather be a toad

445
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,145
and live upon the vapor
of a dungeon

446
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,648
than keep a corner
in the thing I love.

447
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,151
You talking to me?

448
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,153
No.

449
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:11,156
I thought you said something.

450
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:14,161
Well, yes, I did,
but it wasn't anything.

451
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,189
You wanna know somethin'?

452
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,691
What?

453
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,693
You're cute.

454
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:43,209
Ill be, uh, through here

455
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,713
in three-quarters
of an hour.

456
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,216
We could, uh,

457
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,717
tell each other
our troubles,

458
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:50,220
if you want to.

459
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,225
Oh, sure.

460
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,122
It's open.

461
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,128
I couldn't find it.

462
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:48,132
Been walking round and round.

463
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,634
I was wondering.

464
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,137
Can I help you?

465
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,639
Oh, no, thanks.

466
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,640
Coffee all right for you?

467
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:54,642
Fine.

468
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,147
Or would you like a beer?

469
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,150
Uh, coffee will do.

470
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,163
Sit down!

471
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,685
I like to make new contacts.

472
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,698
I like you, you know it?

473
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,701
Now I do.

474
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,706
You gonna say you like me?

475
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:35,709
Later.

476
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:37,212
Oh, thanks.

477
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:41,219
You gonna tell me your name?

478
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,723
Soon as I know it myself, yes.

479
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:45,226
Oh, don't give me that.

480
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,728
Give you what?

481
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,732
Ive handled lines
all my life.

482
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:53,739
So have I.

483
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,245
Hey, what's so funny?

484
00:23:57,245 --> 00:24:00,250
It's a private joke
between me and me.

485
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:04,757
Come on, what's your name?

486
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,260
Which one?

487
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,762
Your real name,

488
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,265
the one you were
born with. I mean,

489
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,268
they give you one
when you were born.

490
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,272
That's not my real name.

491
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:14,774
What is it?

492
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:22,286
I don't know.

493
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:23,788
All right, calm down.

494
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,792
You don't have to tell me.

495
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,296
Look, if I could find out
who I am,

496
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:30,300
I'd be a happy man,
you know it?

497
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,301
Most people know
who they are,

498
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,803
or think they do,
wich is the same thing.

499
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:33,805
Simple for them.

500
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,311
Want to know my name?

501
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,313
Martin.

502
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,314
Thank you.

503
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:40,816
Also Ernest and Paul,

504
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:42,820
Hamlet and Joe

505
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,326
and maybe...
Othello.

506
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,329
Yes, and I'm French
and Russian

507
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,831
and English
and Norwegian.

508
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,334
I got mixed blood, too.

509
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,336
All right, darling,

510
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:56,342
and brave and cowardly

511
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:58,346
and in love and not

512
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:01,351
and trusting
and jealous?

513
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:02,853
Are you?

514
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,359
What am I mixed up with here,

515
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,861
some kind of nut?

516
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,872
The bawdy wind
that kisses all it meets

517
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,877
is hushed within
the hollow mine of earth

518
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:19,881
and will not hear it.

519
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,384
What committed?

520
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:23,887
Impudent strumpet!

521
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,390
What's the matter,
fella?

522
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,894
[Brita's voice]
By heaven, you do me wrong.

523
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:30,899
What?

524
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,402
Nothing. I just said,

525
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:33,904
"What's the matter,
fella?"

526
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,418
You're talking so funny,
like you're...

527
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:43,920
somebody else almost.

528
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,922
I was.

529
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:46,925
Are you feeling all right?

530
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:48,428
Oh, sure.

531
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:50,932
Don't talk funny no more.

532
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:58,945
All right.

533
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,948
In fact...

534
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:02,451
Don't talk at all.

535
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:07,960
All right.

536
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,716
Why shouldn't Max
want you to play it?

537
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:14,221
All he'll have to do is to
pace back and forth outside,

538
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,222
like an expectant father.

539
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:18,227
Tony: well, what do you
want him to do, play Iago?

540
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:21,732
I just that I hate to see you
getting pressured into anything.

541
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:24,237
Maybe you're not sure
I can play Othello.

542
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,739
Now, Tony.

543
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,742
I may not believe in myself,

544
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:30,247
but I expect others
to believe in me.

545
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:31,749
Does that make sense?

546
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:33,252
Oh, of course.

547
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,265
What's this for?

548
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,767
That is for nothing.

549
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,277
Thank you, darling.

550
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:50,280
You'd be a smashing Desdemona.

551
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,281
You know it?

552
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:53,785
It's funny. No one has
even bothered to ask me

553
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,288
if I want to play it or not

554
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:56,290
Not you, not anyone.

555
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,291
Oh, Brita

556
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,295
It's all right.
It's all right, darling.

557
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:00,296
I'm used to it.

558
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,798
I... used to what?

559
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:02,800
To running after you

560
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,805
while you chase the moon.

561
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:07,808
Well, if you do go ahead,

562
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,311
it means some hard work

563
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,813
on my blankety-blank
accent.

564
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:12,816
You will be
able to manage it, I'm sure.

565
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:17,324
[speaking swedish]

566
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:18,326
Translation, please.

567
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:19,828
Oh, no.

568
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:20,829
Eh, I can imagine.

569
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:21,831
Right.

570
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:26,339
What is it?

571
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,841
It's nothing.

572
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:30,346
The tricks
your mind can play.

573
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:31,848
You know,
somewhere in the future

574
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:34,853
I can see it all finished.

575
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,357
I can see the whole
magical production

576
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,362
Opened, praised.

577
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:43,867
It feels fine to have
done something worthy,

578
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,871
and then I think
of all the things

579
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,375
that have to be done
between now and then

580
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,379
The terrifying thought
of that first rehearsal.

581
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:57,390
The actors nervous
and frightened...

582
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,393
Though in the trade of war
I have slain men...

583
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,397
Tony: your inner self
telling you every instant

584
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:04,402
you're making a mistake
to try this,

585
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,905
knowing all the time
you're caught

586
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:09,410
and it's too late
to change your mind.

587
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,913
'Tis better
as it is.

588
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:12,915
Oh, no.

589
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,418
Yes, Tony, it's fine.

590
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:17,423
Trying to make someone
else's words your own,

591
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:18,925
thoughts your own...

592
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:20,428
"Thou cunning'st
pattern."

593
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:23,933
Over and over and over.

594
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,438
Thou cunning'st pattern
of excelling nature.

595
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,945
You whip your imagination
into a frenzy.

596
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,948
The key to the character

597
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:33,950
Jealousy,

598
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,955
and you dig for it
within yourself.

599
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:38,958
What does it feel like

600
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,461
Real jealousy?

601
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:41,963
Try to remember

602
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,966
jealous moments
in your own past.

603
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,469
Jealousy.

604
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:46,971
Jealousy.

605
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:48,974
Find it, hold it,
live it!

606
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:49,976
Jealousy!

607
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,479
And the hours

608
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,983
when you worry about
nothing but shoes

609
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,485
and props

610
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,987
and make-up

611
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,490
and the costume fittings...

612
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,992
That's perfect.

613
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:01,495
That's wonderful.
Really.

614
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:03,499
And then the dress rehearsals

615
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,001
The heartening moments

616
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,505
when it seems
to be going right...

617
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,007
Nay, but he prated.

618
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,515
Hey, look out!

619
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:15,518
The inevitable things
that go wrong...

620
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,032
Nerves,

621
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:25,535
arguments,

622
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:27,538
changes...

623
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:30,042
Far, far into the night.

624
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:32,546
Pills to help you
stay awake...

625
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:36,553
And pills to help you sleep.

626
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:39,558
The part begins to seep
into your life,

627
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,060
and the battle begins

628
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,564
Imagination against reality.

629
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,568
Keep each in its place

630
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:48,573
That's the job if you can do it.

631
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:51,578
And all at once...

632
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:53,080
It's opening night.

633
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:05,601
And you look out
at the audience,

634
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,606
a terrifying monster
with a thousand heads.

635
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,619
You're in a kind of trance,

636
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,121
only vaguely aware

637
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,624
that the curtain
is about to go up.

638
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:20,625
Man: places, please.

639
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,381
Then, somehow,
the next thing you know,

640
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,384
the play is almost over.

641
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:29,389
The last scene is about to begin.

642
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,541
But you remember
that you're on a stage

643
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,544
in a theater,

644
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:45,549
an audience in front of you...

645
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,056
And suddenly

646
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,561
Suddenly you're startled by
the sound of your own voice.

647
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:56,568
Yet Ill not shed her blood,

648
00:30:56,568 --> 00:31:00,574
nor scar that whiter
skin of hers than snow

649
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:04,581
and smooth as
monumental alabaster.

650
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:06,584
Yet she must die,

651
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,088
else she'll betray
more men.

652
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:13,595
You try to hang on
desperately.

653
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,097
You're 2 men now,

654
00:31:15,097 --> 00:31:17,101
grappling for control

655
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,604
You...

656
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:20,607
And Othello.

657
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:34,129
Put out the light,

658
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:36,132
and then...

659
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,637
Put out the light.

660
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:44,643
If  I quench thee, thou flaming
minister, I  can again

661
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:46,148
thy former light restore
should I repent me.

662
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:52,158
But once put out
thy light...

663
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,167
Thou cunning'st pattern
of excelling nature,

664
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:01,173
I know not where is
that Promethean heat

665
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:03,678
that can thy light relume.

666
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,185
I must weep...

667
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:17,199
But they are cruel tears
this sorrow's heavenly.

668
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,204
It strikes where it doth love.

669
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,714
She wakes.

670
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,721
Who's there?

671
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,229
Othello.

672
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:37,232
Ay, Desdemona.

673
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:39,236
Will you come
to bed, milord?

674
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,241
Have you prayed
tonight, Desdemona?

675
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,242
Ay, milord.

676
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:45,747
If you bethink yourself
of any crime

677
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,250
unreconciled as yet
to heaven and grace,

678
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,755
solicit for it straight.

679
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:51,757
Alas, milord,

680
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:53,760
what may you mean by that?

681
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,763
Well, do it, and be brief.

682
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:57,265
I will walk by.

683
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,272
I would not kill
thy unprepared spirit.

684
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:02,775
No, heaven forfend,

685
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:04,277
I would not kill thy soul.

686
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,280
Talk you of...
Killing?

687
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,283
Ay, I do.

688
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,907
Alas! Why gnaw you so
your nether lip?

689
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,912
Some bloody passion
shakes your very frame.

690
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,415
You all right,
Mr. Friend?

691
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,419
Opening-night jitters.

692
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,925
Look, if mr. Donlan
or mr. Lasler ask for me,

693
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:25,428
tell 'em I'm in the bar
across the street.

694
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,933
They've been there
since the second act.

695
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,437
Brita: I hope they
do not point on me.

696
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:31,438
Tony: cease and be still!

697
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:32,440
Brita: I will so.

698
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,946
Oh... what's the matter?

699
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,949
That handkerchief
which I so loved

700
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,451
and gave thee

701
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,954
thou gav'st to Cassio!

702
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,458
No, by my life and soul.

703
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,961
Send for the man
and ask him.

704
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:46,964
Sweet soul, take heed.
take heed of perjury.

705
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:48,466
Thou art
on thy deathbed!

706
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:49,468
Ay, but not yet to die.

707
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:50,971
Yes, presently!

708
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,976
Therefore confess thee
freely of thy sin,

709
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:56,981
for to deny
each article with oath

710
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:58,984
cannot remove nor choke

711
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:01,488
the strong conception
that I do groan withal.

712
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:02,991
Thou art to die!

713
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,994
Milord,
have mercy on me.

714
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:06,496
I say, Amen.

715
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:09,001
And have you mercy, too.

716
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,004
I never did offend you
in my life,

717
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:13,007
never loved Cassio.

718
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:15,511
But with such general
warranty of heaven

719
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,014
as I might love,

720
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,015
I never gave him token.

721
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:19,017
By heaven,

722
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,519
I saw my handkerchief
in his hand.

723
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,522
Oh, perjured woman,

724
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,526
thou dost stone my heart

725
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:27,030
and mak'st me call
what I intend to do a murder,

726
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,532
which I thought a sacrifice.

727
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,035
I saw the handkerchief!

728
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,038
He found it, then.
I never gave it him.

729
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,540
Send for him hither.

730
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,542
Let him confess a truth.

731
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,545
He has confessed.

732
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,048
What, milord?

733
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:39,550
That he hath used thee.

734
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,053
How, unlawfully?

735
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:42,055
Ay.

736
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:43,557
He will not say so.

737
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,061
No. His mouth is stopped.

738
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:49,066
Honest Iago has
taken order for it.

739
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,568
Oh, my fear interprets.

740
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,071
What, is he dead?

741
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:55,076
Had all his hairs
been lives,

742
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:58,581
my great revenge
had stomach for them all.

743
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,586
He is betrayed,

744
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:03,590
and I undone!

745
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,593
Out, strumpet!

746
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:07,596
Weep'st thou for him
to my face?

747
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:09,600
Oh, banish me, milord,
but kill me not.

748
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,601
Down, strumpet!

749
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:17,613
Kill me tomorrow.
let me live tonight.

750
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:19,116
Nay. If you strive...

751
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,618
But half an hour!

752
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,122
Being done,
there is no pause.

753
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,624
While I say one prayer!

754
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,628
It is too late.

755
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,191
Milord!

756
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:07,695
Milord!

757
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,205
Oh, good milord!

758
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,209
Milord!

759
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,711
Milord!

760
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:23,221
Milord...

761
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:24,723
Milord!

762
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,236
What ho!

763
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:33,738
Oh, good milord,

764
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,242
I would speak
a word with you.

765
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:52,152
It's almost over,
Mr. Lasler.

766
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:54,155
Well, you told me
to tell you

767
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:56,158
when it was the last scene.

768
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,663
Oh, sure. Thanks.

769
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:01,166
Last scene.

770
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:09,180
What play?

771
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,183
Our play.

772
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:13,687
It's good.

773
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,690
There's a murder in it.

774
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,194
You don't say.

775
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,696
Who to who?

776
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,700
What?

777
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,703
Who murders to who?

778
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:24,705
Tony.

779
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:26,708
Tony murders this girl.

780
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:29,213
Kills her dead...

781
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,714
With a kiss.

782
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,718
Ridiculous.

783
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,221
Unbelievable.

784
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:36,224
Tonight, he murders this girl.

785
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:40,731
Tomorrow, they'll
probably murder him.

786
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:41,733
Oh, no.

787
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,746
How came you, Cassio,

788
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:52,751
by that handkerchief
that was my wife's?

789
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:54,754
I found it in my chamber,

790
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:56,257
and he himself
confessed even now

791
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:57,759
that there he'd dropped it

792
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,761
for a special purpose

793
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,764
which wrought to his desire.

794
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:04,270
Fool...

795
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,275
Fool! Fool!

796
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,282
You must forsake this room

797
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:12,784
and go with us.

798
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,402
Your power
and your command

799
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:14,904
is taken off,

800
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:16,907
and Cassio
rules in Cyprus.

801
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:18,911
You shall close
prisoner rest

802
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:21,415
till that the nature
of your fault

803
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,919
be known to the Venetian state.

804
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,423
Come, bring away.

805
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,948
Soft you.

806
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:44,953
A word or 2
before you go.

807
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,463
I have done the state
some service,

808
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:51,965
and they know it.

809
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:54,469
No more of that.

810
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:58,476
I pray you, in your letters,

811
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:01,981
when you shall these
unlucky deeds relate...

812
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,988
Speak of me as I am,

813
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:07,491
nothing extenuate,

814
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:09,994
nor set down aught in malice.

815
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,999
Then must you speak of one

816
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:17,006
that loved not wisely

817
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:19,009
but too well,

818
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:21,013
of one not easily jealous,

819
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:23,517
but being wrought,

820
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:26,021
perplexed in the extreme,

821
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,024
of one whose hand,

822
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:30,529
like the base Judean,

823
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,532
threw a pearl away

824
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:36,539
richer than all of his tribe.

825
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,547
One whose subdued eyes,

826
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,050
albeit unused
to the melting mood,

827
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,057
drop tears... as fast
as the Arabian trees

828
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:50,562
their medicinable gum.

829
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:55,570
Set you down this...

830
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,073
And say besides,
that in Aleppo once,

831
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:01,078
where a malignant
and a turban'd Turk

832
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:04,083
beat a Venetian
and traduced the state,

833
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:08,090
I took by the throat
the circumcised dog

834
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,095
and smote him, thus!

835
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:17,606
Oh, bloody period.

836
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:21,111
All that's spoke is marred.

837
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:27,121
I kissed thee ere I killed thee.

838
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:35,134
No way but this,

839
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:37,639
killing myself...

840
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,644
To die upon a kiss.

841
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,650
This did I fear,

842
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,655
but thought he had no weapon.

843
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,159
For he was great of heart.

844
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,164
O Spartan dog,

845
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:57,171
more fell than anguish,
hunger, or the sea!

846
00:40:57,171 --> 00:41:00,677
Look on the tragic loading
of this bed.

847
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:02,680
This is thy work.

848
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,184
The object poisons sight.

849
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:08,189
Let it be hid.

850
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:10,192
Myself will straight aboard,

851
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:12,195
and to the state,

852
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:16,703
this heavy act
with heavy heart relate.

853
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,767
Bravo!

854
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,700
Bravo, Tony!

855
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,713
Bravo!

856
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:33,863
Bravo!
Bravo!

857
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:35,866
Bravo!

858
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:56,901
All right, boys!

859
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,404
Ok, house lights.

860
00:42:58,404 --> 00:42:59,906
That does it.

861
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,678
That's it, boys.

862
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,182
Thank you.

863
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:19,688
You were wonderful,
Tony.

864
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:24,195
Woman: congratulations,
darling.

865
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:26,700
Man: perfectly marvelous
performance.

866
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,702
Second man: it really was.

867
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:28,703
Third man: Tony,

868
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:30,205
it's the best thing
you've ever done.

869
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,715
For heaven's sake,
Tony.

870
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:37,718
Stop walking around
and relax.

871
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,222
What ho, milord?

872
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:51,991
Tony, if you'd never
played anything else,

873
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:52,993
my dear,

874
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:54,996
this is...

875
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:56,499
Brilliant.

876
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:58,502
Or if you never play
anything again.

877
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,504
Well, I hope so.

878
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:00,506
Now, now, Tony,
I don't want you

879
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:02,008
to monopolize Dolly
all evening.

880
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,511
Congratulations.

881
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:04,512
Thank you.

882
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:06,516
Thank you.

883
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,519
Are you all right,
dear?

884
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,021
You ask me that
every 6 minutes.

885
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:12,024
I care every 6 minutes.

886
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,026
Here.

887
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,896
I don't deserve you,
Brita.

888
00:44:15,396 --> 00:44:17,400
Maybe that's why
you haven't got me.

889
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,403
There isn't much
justice on earth,

890
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:20,906
but there is some.

891
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:23,911
If I burst out crying,

892
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,414
it's going to be
your fault.

893
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,924
What's the matter?

894
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:33,927
It's nothing.

895
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:35,429
Brita, if you don't
give me a hand

896
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:36,932
With the Hollywood
contingent Ill

897
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:38,935
Sure. Sure, Bill.

898
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:40,437
I'm all right.
Run along hither.

899
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:02,357
Man: farewell,
old friend of mine.

900
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:03,859
Second man:
farewell, old friend.

901
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:05,863
Farewell, the tranquil mind.

902
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:07,365
Farewell, content.

903
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:08,868
Uh, yes.

904
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:09,869
Thank you.

905
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:10,871
Thank you.

906
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,889
Oh, beware, milord,
of jealousy.

907
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,393
It is the green-eyed monster

908
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:27,398
which doth mock
the meat it feeds on.

909
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:40,920
Tony: out, strumpet!

910
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,922
Brita!

911
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:42,924
Man: didst thou not
see her paddle

912
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,426
with the palm of his hand?

913
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:45,929
but that was but courtesy.

914
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:47,431
Lechery, by his hand.

915
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:48,934
They met so near
with their lips

916
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:50,937
that their breaths
embraced together.

917
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:52,940
In sleep I heard him say,

918
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,444
"Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary.

919
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,447
Let us hide our loves."

920
00:45:57,447 --> 00:46:05,961
Let us hide our loves.

921
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:16,478
Let us hide our loves!

922
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:47,029
It was like the riot of 1820.

923
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:49,032
Were you there?

924
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:51,536
Brita...
Get me home, Brita.

925
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:53,539
Please get me home.

926
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:05,926
Oh, darling.

927
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,429
Happy birthday,
old lady.

928
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:08,931
Oh, I...

929
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:10,934
Oh, Tony, Tony.

930
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:12,437
Thank you for this.

931
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:13,939
Oh, it's nothing.

932
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:15,442
It cost
3 weeks' salary.

933
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:16,444
And worth it. Thank you.

934
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:18,447
Look at me.
I'm a Christmas tree.

935
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:19,949
Here. From Max.

936
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:20,951
Lovely.

937
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:21,952
From Victor.

938
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:22,954
My, my.

939
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:24,457
From Main and Douglas.

940
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:25,459
Ooh-hoo.
Never seen better.

941
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:27,462
And here, look
A locket from Bill.

942
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:28,964
Isn't that sweet?

943
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:31,469
Yeah. Yeah.

944
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:33,472
Yours is my favorite,
Tony.

945
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:34,974
Would you like
to go to a party

946
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:35,976
Look, darling,
I'm a little bit late.

947
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:38,480
Do you mind?
You'd better hurry.

948
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,984
Yes, that's right.
I better.

949
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,987
Thank you.
Thank you again.

950
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,265
This is a trick to
put me from my suit.

951
00:47:59,265 --> 00:48:02,269
Pray you, let Cassio
be received again.

952
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:03,771
Fetch me the handkerchief.

953
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:05,274
My mind misgives.

954
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:06,276
Come, come.

955
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:07,778
You'll never meet
a more sufficient man.

956
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:08,780
The handkerchief.

957
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,283
Pray you,
talk we of Cassio.

958
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:11,785
The handkerchief!

959
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:13,288
A man that all his time

960
00:48:13,288 --> 00:48:15,791
hath founded his good
fortunes on your love,

961
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,294
shared dangers with you.

962
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,296
The handkerchief!

963
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,299
I'sooth, you are to blame.

964
00:48:24,306 --> 00:48:25,307
Zounds!

965
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:26,809
Noises offstage,
clumsy fools.

966
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,312
Next time that happens,

967
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:29,814
Ill crack him over the head

968
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:30,816
with a stage brace.

969
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:31,817
Tony, he didn't mean to.

970
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,320
I don't care whether
he meant to or not.

971
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,822
All right, Tony.
All right.

972
00:48:35,324 --> 00:48:37,827
If anyone doesn't like it
or you don't like it

973
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,330
Let's hear about it,
that's all.

974
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,332
I'm only trying to find a way

975
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:41,334
To make everybody happy.

976
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:42,836
Ok, mr. John.

977
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,837
Don't fuss, man.

978
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:45,841
Man: ready, mr. John.

979
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:50,849
M'noble lord,

980
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:53,353
if I give my wife
a handkerchief...

981
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,373
Send for him hither.

982
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:06,875
Let him confess a truth.

983
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,378
He hath confessed.

984
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,380
What, Milord?

985
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,383
That he hath used thee.

986
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,885
How? Unlawfully?

987
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:13,887
Ay...

988
00:49:14,888 --> 00:49:16,892
He will not say so.

989
00:49:16,892 --> 00:49:19,396
No, his mouth is stopped.

990
00:49:19,396 --> 00:49:22,401
Honest Iago hath
taken order for it.

991
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,406
My fear interprets.

992
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:26,908
What, is he dead?

993
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:30,915
Had all his hairs
been lives...

994
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:32,918
My great revenge

995
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:35,422
had stomach for them all.

996
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:36,924
A-alas...

997
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:38,928
Alas, he is betrayed,
and I undone.

998
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:39,929
Out, strumpet!

999
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:40,931
Oh, Tony!

1000
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,934
Weep thou for him
to my face?

1001
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:45,439
Oh, banish me, milord,
but kill me not!

1002
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:47,442
Yeah, banish you, down...

1003
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,946
Down, strumpet!

1004
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,449
Kill me tomorrow.
Let me live tonight.

1005
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:53,452
Nay, if you strive

1006
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,454
Brita, whispering:
Tony

1007
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:55,956
But half an hour.

1008
00:49:55,956 --> 00:49:56,957
Down.

1009
00:49:56,957 --> 00:49:58,460
Tony Tony, please.

1010
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:00,464
Being done, there is no pause.

1011
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,967
But while I say
one prayer.

1012
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,720
It is too late.

1013
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:15,237
Please, Tony. Tony

1014
00:50:15,237 --> 00:50:16,740
Tony...

1015
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:20,245
Tony, please,
you're hurting me.

1016
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:21,247
What's going on?

1017
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:23,250
What's the matter with him?

1018
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:24,753
Woman, whispering:
mr. John mr. John,

1019
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:25,755
be careful, please.

1020
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:27,758
Man, whispering:
what is he doing?

1021
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:30,763
Woman: mr. John.

1022
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:32,265
Please stop him.

1023
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:33,267
Man: do something.

1024
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:35,270
Man: your cue.
Mr. John.

1025
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,273
For heaven's sake,
knock.

1026
00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:40,278
Milord!

1027
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,783
Milord! Milord!

1028
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:45,788
Oh, good milord.

1029
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:48,291
I would speak a word with you.

1030
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:03,316
There is not!
There is no excuse!

1031
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:04,819
Good evening, doctor.

1032
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:05,821
Good evening,
fellas.

1033
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:07,824
If you'd only leave her alone
for a few minutes, mr. John

1034
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:08,826
And you keep out of this.

1035
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:11,831
Now, I'm warning you.
Who's there?!!

1036
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:13,333
Well, what's the trouble?

1037
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,836
Well, what the

1038
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:15,837
Hello, Tony.

1039
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,339
Who sent for you?

1040
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,341
I did.

1041
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,342
Holy jumping

1042
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,346
Now this is a production.

1043
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:23,349
It's nothing.
Just a little accident.

1044
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,854
My delicate leading lady
can't be kissed

1045
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:27,356
without sending for her doctor.

1046
00:51:27,857 --> 00:51:28,859
I'm afraid we overdid it a bit.

1047
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,862
Right at the top of the scene.

1048
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:32,364
Advice! Direction!
Yelling it out!

1049
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:33,867
I'm sorry, Tony.
I'm sorry.

1050
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:35,870
Who'd you think
we were playing to,

1051
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:36,872
an audience of deaf-mutes?

1052
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:38,374
Tony, shut up!

1053
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:42,380
Brita...

1054
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,883
I'm sorry.

1055
00:51:46,387 --> 00:51:46,888
Tony...

1056
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:49,392
I'm sorry, darling.

1057
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:51,896
You know I'd die
before I'd hurt you.

1058
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:53,398
You know that, don't you?

1059
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,903
Yes, I know it.
I know it.

1060
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:58,908
All forgiven, Tony.
All forgiven.

1061
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:02,413
Gently.

1062
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,420
What a business,
for heaven's sake.

1063
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:07,923
What a business.

1064
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:15,819
Close your eyes,
Tony.

1065
00:52:18,323 --> 00:52:19,825
Surprise coming.
Close your eyes.

1066
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:29,592
All right. Now.

1067
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:33,598
Well.

1068
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,602
Good?

1069
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:38,607
Well, strike me pink.

1070
00:52:40,108 --> 00:52:41,611
Thank you.

1071
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:44,616
Well, I never.

1072
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:46,118
Oh, stop it, Tony.

1073
00:52:46,118 --> 00:52:47,120
Stop what?

1074
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,623
Making fun of me.

1075
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,625
Was I?

1076
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,628
Oh, let's eat it.

1077
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,130
I'm sorry.

1078
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,133
It's all right.
It's all right.

1079
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,636
I'd like to have risen
to the occasion.

1080
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:57,638
I'm tired.

1081
00:52:57,638 --> 00:52:59,140
I don't know what's
the matter with me.

1082
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,145
I mean, I do know what's
the matter with me.

1083
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,148
Sorry, Brita.
Beautiful cake.

1084
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:05,651
It's a beautiful idea.

1085
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:07,153
It's a beautiful thing
you have done.

1086
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:09,658
Let's not go too far, huh?

1087
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,163
Do I get to eat myself?

1088
00:53:13,163 --> 00:53:16,168
No novelty in that,
is there?

1089
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:18,672
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

1090
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:20,174
et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

1091
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:21,677
It's from Henri's.

1092
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:23,179
What is?

1093
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,181
The cake.

1094
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:31,192
Restful here, isn't it?

1095
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:33,697
So far.

1096
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,700
Sort of sentimental.

1097
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,705
I'm as sentimental
as the next fellow.

1098
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,709
By the way,
what about him?

1099
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:41,710
Who?

1100
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,212
The next fellow.

1101
00:53:43,212 --> 00:53:44,715
Well, I don't know.

1102
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:45,717
Oh, he's a good enough
press agent,

1103
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:47,720
but do you think...
Tony!

1104
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,722
What?
New subject.

1105
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:49,723
Why?

1106
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:51,727
I don't like this one,
and it's my party.

1107
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:52,728
Are you gonna marry him?

1108
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:53,730
No.

1109
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,732
Do you love him?
No.

1110
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,733
Do you love anyone?
No.

1111
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,735
No?
Oh, Tony!

1112
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:58,237
Leave me alone!

1113
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:20,273
You haven't
Finished your cake.

1114
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,776
I don't want it.

1115
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:25,281
You can't have your cake
and eat it...

1116
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:27,285
And not want it.

1117
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:33,796
Oh, you fool.

1118
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:36,801
Oh, Tony.

1119
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,806
New subject.
Good.

1120
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:42,309
What do you think you
might like to do next?

1121
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:43,311
What play?

1122
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:44,313
Yeah.

1123
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,316
Max says we'll do
another year in this.

1124
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,819
Oh, not with me.

1125
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,822
No.

1126
00:54:49,822 --> 00:54:51,324
Tired of it?

1127
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,829
No. Sick of it.

1128
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,832
Sick.

1129
00:54:55,832 --> 00:54:57,835
Perhaps you
should stop then.

1130
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:58,837
Yeah, perhaps.

1131
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,339
But, you see

1132
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,842
What?

1133
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:04,345
I don't know which is worse,

1134
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:06,349
with a part or without.

1135
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:08,352
Without one, I'm alone

1136
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:10,355
Bad for me.

1137
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:12,359
Don't like myself
very much.

1138
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,862
Don't say that.

1139
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:16,365
Well, it's true.

1140
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:18,368
The only answer was you.

1141
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:20,372
Tony.

1142
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:22,375
And nothing
but failure there.

1143
00:55:26,382 --> 00:55:27,885
Not all your fault.

1144
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:29,387
All mine.

1145
00:55:58,434 --> 00:56:00,438
Whose fault was that?

1146
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:01,439
Fault?

1147
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,942
Oh, we're both responsible

1148
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,947
for all our good things
and all our bad.

1149
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,952
You don't really
believe that, do you?

1150
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:09,954
No.

1151
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:11,957
Mostly me.

1152
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:13,960
Yes.

1153
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,962
Always?

1154
00:56:14,962 --> 00:56:16,464
Mostly.

1155
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,470
Then I don't suppose
you would want

1156
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,474
to marry me again,
would you?

1157
00:56:24,978 --> 00:56:26,982
No, I wouldn't,
darling.

1158
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:27,983
Why not?

1159
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:30,487
Because if at first
you don't succeed,

1160
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:31,990
don't try again.

1161
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,993
Isn't that how it goes?

1162
00:56:33,993 --> 00:56:34,995
No.

1163
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:40,503
Brita...

1164
00:56:40,503 --> 00:56:43,008
You're my only friend.

1165
00:56:43,008 --> 00:56:44,510
Help me.

1166
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,515
Anything
Anything, Tony,

1167
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:51,021
but let's not try
marrying again.

1168
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:53,024
You're stuck on the guy...

1169
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:55,028
Oh, don't be idiotic.
Why, Bill is

1170
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:56,029
Don't call him that!

1171
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:57,031
That's his name.

1172
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:58,033
I don't care!

1173
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,536
Oh, Tony
Get away!

1174
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:03,041
Is he smooth?

1175
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:06,046
Is he charming?

1176
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:08,549
Does he speak gently?

1177
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:10,553
Does he write
Lovely stories about you?

1178
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,556
Does he dance well?

1179
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:13,558
I don't.

1180
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,062
Remember? Do you?

1181
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:17,064
Does he listen?

1182
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:18,566
Does he sympathize?

1183
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:20,569
And what else
Does he do? Does he

1184
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,074
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it, Tony.

1185
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:24,576
You want me to go, huh?

1186
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:26,079
Yes.

1187
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,080
All right, I will.

1188
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,582
Now, Tony, listen

1189
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:29,584
I don't want to see him

1190
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:30,586
and his silly, lovesick face

1191
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:31,587
around the theater.

1192
00:57:31,587 --> 00:57:32,589
Now, you tell him,
or I will!

1193
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:33,591
Oh, Tony.

1194
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:35,094
Meet him anywhere you like.

1195
00:57:35,594 --> 00:57:37,097
Meet him here or at his place

1196
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:38,599
or in a rowboat
in central park!

1197
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,602
Go away, Tony!
Go away! Go now!

1198
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:44,108
No.

1199
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,162
No.

1200
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:09,667
No.

1201
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:14,675
Don't hurt Brita.

1202
00:58:16,678 --> 00:58:18,682
Tony, as Othello:
yet she must die

1203
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:21,186
lest she betray more men.

1204
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:24,692
No...

1205
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:26,194
Get out.

1206
00:58:26,194 --> 00:58:27,696
Out.

1207
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:35,209
You know
I'd die before I'd hurt you.

1208
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:50,734
Careful.

1209
00:58:50,734 --> 00:58:51,736
No control.

1210
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,738
Go home.

1211
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,242
"Go," she said. "Go now."

1212
00:58:55,242 --> 00:58:57,746
Brita and Bill.

1213
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:59,249
Bill and Brita.

1214
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:03,255
Heaven truly knows that
thou art false as hell!

1215
00:59:03,255 --> 00:59:05,759
Brita, Bill.
Brita, Bill.

1216
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,762
Brita, Bill.
Brita, Bill.

1217
00:59:07,762 --> 00:59:09,766
Brita, Bill.
Brita, Bill.

1218
00:59:10,267 --> 00:59:12,270
Brita, Bill.
Brita, Bill.

1219
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,272
Brita, Bill.

1220
00:59:13,272 --> 00:59:14,273
Wait.

1221
00:59:15,275 --> 00:59:16,277
Go back.

1222
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:17,278
I am.

1223
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:19,282
I am going back.

1224
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:29,298
Hello, Pat.
Surprised to see me?

1225
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:31,802
Pat...
Pat...

1226
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:33,305
Help me, Pat.

1227
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,308
Where is it?
Where is she?

1228
00:59:35,808 --> 00:59:36,310
Desdemona!

1229
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,311
No, Brita.

1230
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:46,326
Go now forever,

1231
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:48,329
farewell the tranquil mind.

1232
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:49,831
Farewell content.

1233
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:53,838
Help me.

1234
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,846
Find her.

1235
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,352
Brita!

1236
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:04,856
No...

1237
01:00:05,357 --> 01:00:06,359
Pat.

1238
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:18,879
Pat.

1239
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:22,886
Pat.

1240
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,402
Pat.

1241
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:50,799
Who is it?

1242
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:51,800
Me.

1243
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,302
Who's me?

1244
01:00:53,302 --> 01:00:54,304
Open up.

1245
01:00:54,304 --> 01:00:55,807
Who is it?

1246
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:56,809
Me! Me!

1247
01:00:59,312 --> 01:01:00,314
Hello, Pat.

1248
01:01:00,314 --> 01:01:02,317
Surprised to see me?

1249
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:03,820
I sure am.

1250
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:08,828
You got your nerve.

1251
01:01:08,828 --> 01:01:09,830
Yes.

1252
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,332
You waked me up.

1253
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:13,837
What do you take me for?

1254
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:23,352
You look different.

1255
01:01:26,357 --> 01:01:26,858
I do?

1256
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:29,863
What's the idea
the middle of the night?

1257
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:31,866
I had to see you.
Important.

1258
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:34,370
Where you been lately
and all that?

1259
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:35,873
Ive been away.

1260
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:37,375
Like out of town?

1261
01:01:38,878 --> 01:01:39,879
How come no postcard?

1262
01:01:41,381 --> 01:01:44,386
You could at least
send me a postcard.

1263
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:46,389
Oh, didn't have any.

1264
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:49,394
Who?

1265
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,899
Where I was.

1266
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:54,403
Where?

1267
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,406
Venice.

1268
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:00,914
Glad to see me?

1269
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:02,917
Sure I am.

1270
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,419
I'm always glad.

1271
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,922
Thank you.

1272
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,927
One thing,
I always tell the truth.

1273
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:11,932
Maybe that's how come
I got no steady.

1274
01:02:12,432 --> 01:02:13,434
You do all right though.

1275
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:14,937
What do you mean?

1276
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:17,440
How many fellas
you got, Pat?

1277
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,943
Hmm, a few.

1278
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,945
How many?

1279
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,950
I don't know
what you mean by fella.

1280
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,952
Like me.

1281
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,962
None like you.

1282
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:31,464
Any press agents?

1283
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:33,467
What are you
gassin' about?

1284
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:34,970
Any named Bill?

1285
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:35,971
No.

1286
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,975
Bill.

1287
01:02:38,976 --> 01:02:41,480
Bill.

1288
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,983
Bill.

1289
01:02:47,991 --> 01:02:49,493
Coffee's ready.

1290
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:59,009
Even if you wake me up,
I'm glad you dropped over.

1291
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00,511
Why?

1292
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,014
I don't know.

1293
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:04,018
I got the jitters lately.

1294
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:07,523
About yesterday it was,
Vito down at the place

1295
01:03:07,523 --> 01:03:10,027
He dropped a tray
of glasses.

1296
01:03:10,027 --> 01:03:12,031
I must've jumped
9 feet.

1297
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:13,533
You need a rest.

1298
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:16,538
No. It's just...

1299
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:18,541
I don't know.

1300
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,546
Ha! It's like
I'm scared all the time

1301
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:25,052
I'm gonna get run over
by a truck,

1302
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,554
stuff like that.

1303
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:28,057
Or you eat a bad oyster

1304
01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:30,060
and you got to get
the stomach pump.

1305
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,564
Hey, how do you figure it?

1306
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:33,566
What?

1307
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:36,570
Maybe being alone so much

1308
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,073
does it a little.

1309
01:03:38,073 --> 01:03:39,075
I may move in with Emily.

1310
01:03:39,075 --> 01:03:40,077
You know her.
Emily?

1311
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,080
No.

1312
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,082
The cashier.

1313
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:44,584
No.

1314
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:47,589
You want to put out
the light?

1315
01:04:03,615 --> 01:04:05,618
Put out the light.

1316
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,628
And then put out
the light.

1317
01:04:13,131 --> 01:04:17,638
If I quench thee,
thou flaming minister,

1318
01:04:17,638 --> 01:04:20,643
I can again
thy former light restore,

1319
01:04:20,643 --> 01:04:22,146
should I repent me

1320
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:23,648
What?

1321
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:26,152
But once put out
thy light,

1322
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:28,656
thou cunning'st pattern
of excelling nature,

1323
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,661
I know not where
is that Promethean heat

1324
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:33,664
that can thy light relume.

1325
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:36,669
Listen, I think
you better go.

1326
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:38,673
Seen Bill lately?

1327
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:40,175
Who?

1328
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,687
Had all his hairs
been lives,

1329
01:04:48,189 --> 01:04:51,194
my great revenge

1330
01:04:51,194 --> 01:04:53,697
had stomach for them all.

1331
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:56,702
Uh, I think
you must be drunk.

1332
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:59,207
Brita, as Desdemona: he
is betrayed, and I undone.

1333
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:00,208
Out, strumpet!

1334
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:03,213
Weep'st thou for him
to my face?!

1335
01:05:03,213 --> 01:05:04,715
Listen, I think you'd better go.

1336
01:05:04,715 --> 01:05:06,719
Brita: banish me not!
Kill me not!

1337
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:07,720
Down, strumpet!

1338
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,223
What's the matter
with you?

1339
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:11,226
Brita: tomorrow
Let me live tonight.

1340
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:15,733
Nay, if you strive...

1341
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:37,770
Emilia: m'lord!

1342
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,773
M'lord!

1343
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,776
Yes. 'Tis Emilia.

1344
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:45,282
Let me the curtains draw.

1345
01:05:45,282 --> 01:05:46,284
What ho!

1346
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:47,286
M'lord!

1347
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,789
Where art thou?

1348
01:07:00,906 --> 01:07:02,409
Tony?

1349
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:06,416
Tony?

1350
01:07:24,445 --> 01:07:25,447
Man: did you or anyone else
touch the body?

1351
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:27,951
Landlady: I wouldn't
touch a dead body.

1352
01:07:27,951 --> 01:07:28,952
Ready for me?

1353
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:30,455
One more shot,
doc.

1354
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:32,959
How did you happen to
come into the apartment?

1355
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:34,962
They phoned from
the cafe she was working.

1356
01:07:35,463 --> 01:07:36,465
What's the name of the cafe?

1357
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:37,467
The Valencia.

1358
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,970
Would you repeat
that name, please?

1359
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,974
Some eye-talian place.
I don't know.

1360
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:42,975
Oh, come on now.

1361
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:44,478
You know the name
of the cafe.

1362
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,482
They're picking on me, Joe.

1363
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:48,985
What was the name
of the cafe?

1364
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,488
He don't know his elbow
from a hot mug.

1365
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:51,990
So I says, talk to
the dark room, not me.

1366
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,493
I know what my exposure was.

1367
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:55,496
Know what he is?
A chowderhead,

1368
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:56,498
a pure chowderhead.

1369
01:07:56,498 --> 01:07:57,500
I'm tellin' you.

1370
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,002
Whatever happened
to Schofield,

1371
01:07:59,002 --> 01:08:00,003
remember him,

1372
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:01,506
big tall guy, didn't smoke?

1373
01:08:01,506 --> 01:08:03,509
I don't know.
I heard Dallas.

1374
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:06,013
Yeah. Some girl
he had down there.

1375
01:08:06,013 --> 01:08:07,015
Hi, Al.

1376
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:08,016
Couldn't find the joint.

1377
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:09,018
No kidding.

1378
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,020
You're good and late.

1379
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,021
That desk.
Ill murder 'im.

1380
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:12,023
Look at the address
he give me.

1381
01:08:12,524 --> 01:08:13,025
No excuse.

1382
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:14,026
Next time bring a note

1383
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:15,028
from your mother.

1384
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:16,030
What's the deal?

1385
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:17,533
Here.
Thanks.

1386
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:19,035
I got time for a cup
of coffee, ya think?

1387
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:20,036
Who's the medic?

1388
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:22,541
Stauffer. You got time
for a 10-course dinner.

1389
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:23,542
Ray Bonner's
on it, too, though.

1390
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:24,544
He'll bounce 'im along.

1391
01:08:25,044 --> 01:08:27,549
What did I tell you?

1392
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:29,051
Ok, Ray?

1393
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:30,554
5 minutes,
that's all.

1394
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:31,556
Get in close,
Bunny.

1395
01:08:32,056 --> 01:08:33,058
Kirk wants some heads.

1396
01:08:33,058 --> 01:08:35,061
All right, here we go.
I'm gonna say it slow now,

1397
01:08:35,562 --> 01:08:36,564
but I'm not gonna
say it twice.

1398
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:38,567
I got no time. You ready?

1399
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:41,071
Pat K-r-o-l-l,

1400
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:43,074
this address,
age close to 30,

1401
01:08:43,575 --> 01:08:44,076
dead on arrival

1402
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:45,579
As long as
you're guessin', Ray,

1403
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,081
you mind makin' it
close to 20-something?

1404
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,082
All right. 26.

1405
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,084
Attaboy.

1406
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:50,086
Dead on arrival.

1407
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:52,590
Apparently strangled
sometime between midnight

1408
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:53,592
and 5 a.m.

1409
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,595
No robbery.
No liquor.

1410
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:57,097
Employed as a waitress.
Venezia cafe.

1411
01:08:57,598 --> 01:08:58,099
Look up the address.

1412
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,100
Beautiful?

1413
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:00,102
Hard to tell right now.

1414
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:01,104
I guess fair.

1415
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:02,607
Attractive waitress.

1416
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:04,109
Several important leads.

1417
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,110
That's all for now.

1418
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,112
We'll try to have
the official aut,

1419
01:09:06,112 --> 01:09:07,113
the mimeo by 5:00.

1420
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:09,117
You got anything, doc?

1421
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:11,120
Uh, well, um...

1422
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,122
It's an unusual one.

1423
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,125
Unusual.

1424
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,630
Neck, throat,
unbruised.

1425
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,133
Trachea, larynx,
windpipe, intact.

1426
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:20,636
Small pressure markings

1427
01:09:21,137 --> 01:09:24,643
above and below
lips indicate, uh...

1428
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:28,649
An unusual crime
of passion.

1429
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:29,651
Unusual.

1430
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:30,653
Hot dog!

1431
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:32,155
Don't get too circusy now.

1432
01:09:32,656 --> 01:09:33,658
One look, Ray?

1433
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,160
All right, but fast.

1434
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:40,669
Come here, doc.

1435
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:42,672
Yes?

1436
01:09:43,173 --> 01:09:45,176
Uh, you want a good quote?

1437
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:47,179
How do you mean?

1438
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:49,183
Kiss of death.

1439
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:50,686
What?

1440
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:52,689
"This young woman,"

1441
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,692
said medical examiner
Roland f. Stauffer,

1442
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,695
"May have been the victim

1443
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:58,699
of a kiss of death."

1444
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,702
Well, no, no.
I don't know.

1445
01:10:01,202 --> 01:10:03,206
Makes you
a very salty talker,

1446
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:04,207
a colorful character.

1447
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:05,710
Well, uh

1448
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:08,715
Don't you want to be
a colorful character?

1449
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:10,217
Well...

1450
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,722
All right.

1451
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:15,727
Kiss of death.

1452
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:16,728
Good.

1453
01:10:52,788 --> 01:10:54,290
Stop! Stop!

1454
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,293
Oh, please, stop!

1455
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:05,809
Good morning.

1456
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:10,316
Guy out there

1457
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:12,820
got his auto horn stuck but good.

1458
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,324
Would you like
a couple of eggs?

1459
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,829
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

1460
01:11:17,829 --> 01:11:18,830
What?

1461
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:19,832
Eggs?

1462
01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:21,334
No. No, thank you.

1463
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:23,839
She'll be right down, she said.

1464
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:24,840
Thank you.

1465
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,342
If they don't
fix that horn soon,

1466
01:11:26,342 --> 01:11:27,344
Ill give a scream.

1467
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,373
Tony?

1468
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:49,380
Morning.

1469
01:11:57,393 --> 01:11:58,896
Sleep terribly?

1470
01:11:58,896 --> 01:12:00,899
Yes, thank you,
and you?

1471
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,401
Quite terribly,
thank you.

1472
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,405
Oh, Tony, Tony, I...

1473
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:06,909
I had such a bad dream.

1474
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:10,916
My part any good?

1475
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,420
It's wonderful
to be awake again.

1476
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,923
Yeah. Yes, it is.

1477
01:12:14,923 --> 01:12:17,927
Whatever the terrors
of the waking hours,

1478
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:20,431
at least you can fight them.

1479
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:23,436
The other kind,
you're...

1480
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:24,939
Helpless.

1481
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:25,941
Yes.

1482
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:26,942
Helpless.

1483
01:12:30,448 --> 01:12:31,950
What is it?

1484
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:32,952
It's nothing.

1485
01:12:32,952 --> 01:12:34,454
I... ohh...

1486
01:12:34,454 --> 01:12:35,957
Is it that noise?

1487
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:37,459
I love it.

1488
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,964
Joys of the city.

1489
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:44,972
Oh, thank you.

1490
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:45,974
Here.

1491
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:47,475
They're no good today.

1492
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:48,477
Have you noticed

1493
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:49,980
how nothing happens lately?

1494
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:50,982
No, I haven't.

1495
01:12:50,982 --> 01:12:51,983
I have. I have.

1496
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:52,985
You said it.

1497
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:56,992
I always agree.
It saves so much time.

1498
01:12:56,992 --> 01:12:58,995
Ill see you tonight.

1499
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,503
Wait a minute.

1500
01:13:04,503 --> 01:13:07,508
Be a good friend
and stay a while.

1501
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,013
I'm afraid
I can't do either.

1502
01:13:10,013 --> 01:13:13,018
I'm sorry. I have
to get home anyway.

1503
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,020
Why?

1504
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,023
You must know. I
never have to tell you:

1505
01:13:16,023 --> 01:13:17,525
I need a shave.

1506
01:13:18,526 --> 01:13:20,029
And thank you for the use

1507
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:23,535
of, um, whatever
it is I used.

1508
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:25,038
See you tonight.

1509
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:34,553
Do you want to see
mr. Cooley?

1510
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:35,554
Cooley?

1511
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:37,057
Yeah. Al Cooley.

1512
01:13:37,057 --> 01:13:38,059
Al.

1513
01:13:38,059 --> 01:13:39,061
Hiya, man.

1514
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:40,062
Come on in.

1515
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:41,564
Relax a little, kid.

1516
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:42,566
It's a pleasure.

1517
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:44,069
What brings you here?

1518
01:13:44,069 --> 01:13:46,072
You know me.
A fast buck.

1519
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:48,576
I got quite
a proposition here.

1520
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:49,577
Go ahead.

1521
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:51,080
First, I ask you,

1522
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,085
are you interested
in getting a lot of space

1523
01:13:54,085 --> 01:13:55,587
for your Othello show?

1524
01:13:55,587 --> 01:13:57,090
The answer's yes.
Next thing:

1525
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:59,094
it's worth more off
the theater page, right?

1526
01:13:59,594 --> 01:14:00,095
Right.

1527
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:01,597
Front page
is even better, huh?

1528
01:14:02,099 --> 01:14:03,100
You know, if this
is some kind of gag,

1529
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,602
I'm, uh, very busy.

1530
01:14:04,602 --> 01:14:06,605
I can see your tongue
hangin' out, Buster,

1531
01:14:06,605 --> 01:14:07,607
way out.

1532
01:14:07,607 --> 01:14:09,110
Come on. Come on.

1533
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,612
Well, look,
I'm on this job, see,

1534
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,615
a very routine knock-off.

1535
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,619
A girl waitress
or something, strangled.

1536
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:16,122
So we're listening to
the hand-out,

1537
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:17,123
and it's no good, sordid.

1538
01:14:17,123 --> 01:14:19,127
You know, they're no good
when they're sordid.

1539
01:14:19,127 --> 01:14:21,630
So then a medical examiner
Stauffer you know him?

1540
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,632
No.

1541
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:25,136
Dr. Roland F. Stauffer,
a pinhead.

1542
01:14:25,136 --> 01:14:28,141
He drops something,
and I catch an angle.

1543
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:29,143
Like what?

1544
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:34,151
Like he says, it could be

1545
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:38,158
she was the victim
of a kiss of death.

1546
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:39,660
He said that?

1547
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,163
He said that.

1548
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:43,666
A very salty talker,
a colorful character.

1549
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,169
I'm way ahead of you.

1550
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:46,671
You go for it?

1551
01:14:46,671 --> 01:14:48,174
Me? Yes. I love space,

1552
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:49,176
but on something
as big as this,

1553
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:51,680
I'd have to talk to Tony John.

1554
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,681
Why?

1555
01:14:52,681 --> 01:14:53,683
He's a big man for dignity.

1556
01:14:53,683 --> 01:14:55,186
This is dignity.

1557
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:56,688
It depends on how you handle it.

1558
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:58,191
With dignity, naturally.

1559
01:14:58,191 --> 01:14:59,693
Dr. Roland F. Stauffer,

1560
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:01,196
The department's
medical examiner,

1561
01:15:01,696 --> 01:15:03,199
said the attractive,
young waitress

1562
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,204
was a victim of what
he termed a kiss of death.

1563
01:15:06,204 --> 01:15:07,206
He likened the crime

1564
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:08,707
to the murder of Desdemona

1565
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:11,212
in a current Broadway
production of Othello.

1566
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:12,714
That's not dignity?

1567
01:15:12,714 --> 01:15:14,217
That's all right.

1568
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:15,219
What's it worth?

1569
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,721
And don't tell me 2 tickets.

1570
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:17,722
I would like some dough,

1571
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,227
and Ill buy my own tickets.

1572
01:15:20,227 --> 01:15:21,229
Name it.

1573
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:23,732
All right. With a little help,

1574
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:27,238
I can keep you hot
for 9 or 10 days.

1575
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:29,242
Make it 100 a day for as long

1576
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:30,744
as I can keep you
riding high,

1577
01:15:30,744 --> 01:15:32,747
and you can be the judge
of when that is. Fair?

1578
01:15:33,248 --> 01:15:34,250
Fair.

1579
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,752
If I get killed for this

1580
01:15:35,752 --> 01:15:37,255
If you get killed,
I don't get paid.

1581
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:39,258
Watch yourself.
I better be movin'.

1582
01:15:39,258 --> 01:15:40,760
Can I have a look
at your stills?

1583
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:41,762
Yeah, sure.

1584
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:54,283
Tony.

1585
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,285
I looked for you
at the office.

1586
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:56,286
I'm sorry.

1587
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:57,788
This doggone sinus
got me down today and

1588
01:15:57,788 --> 01:15:59,291
Have you seen this?

1589
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,793
Why, yes.

1590
01:16:00,793 --> 01:16:03,298
Why didn't you show it to me?

1591
01:16:03,298 --> 01:16:04,800
Tony, Tony, please.

1592
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,801
Why didn't you?

1593
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:06,803
Bill, please,

1594
01:16:07,304 --> 01:16:09,308
this makes me look such a fool.

1595
01:16:09,308 --> 01:16:12,312
Isn't there something
you can do to get this

1596
01:16:12,312 --> 01:16:14,316
I don't own the papers,
Tony, after all.

1597
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,321
Did you have anything
to do with this?

1598
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:18,322
Not exactly.

1599
01:16:18,322 --> 01:16:19,824
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

1600
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:22,329
It was some other guy's idea,
but I ok'd it.

1601
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:23,331
I see.

1602
01:16:23,331 --> 01:16:25,334
What are you
trying to do to me?!

1603
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:26,836
Aw, nothing, Tony.
you're makin' a thing of it.

1604
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:27,837
You heel!

1605
01:16:28,339 --> 01:16:29,340
Now, wait a second.

1606
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,342
You dirty heel!

1607
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:31,844
You're through.
Ill see to that.

1608
01:16:31,844 --> 01:16:33,347
Well, fine with me.

1609
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:35,851
You get this stuff
killed, or Ill

1610
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:36,852
Or what?

1611
01:16:36,852 --> 01:16:38,355
You'll do it!

1612
01:16:39,857 --> 01:16:41,360
Do it!

1613
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,362
Wait a minute.

1614
01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:43,363
Come here.

1615
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:54,382
Come on, Tony.

1616
01:16:54,382 --> 01:16:55,884
You

1617
01:16:56,885 --> 01:16:57,887
Tony!

1618
01:16:58,888 --> 01:17:01,393
Tony, in the name of...

1619
01:17:01,393 --> 01:17:02,395
Tony!

1620
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:09,907
Tony.

1621
01:17:09,907 --> 01:17:12,912
Been lives,

1622
01:17:12,912 --> 01:17:15,416
my stomach...

1623
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:19,423
Being done, there is no pause.

1624
01:17:19,423 --> 01:17:20,925
Tony.

1625
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,933
Get out of here.

1626
01:17:28,938 --> 01:17:30,941
Get out of here, you...

1627
01:17:30,941 --> 01:17:32,444
It was a dream.

1628
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:33,446
You maniac.

1629
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:34,948
Only a bad dream.

1630
01:17:34,948 --> 01:17:37,452
You're part of a bad dream.

1631
01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:11,141
Come in.

1632
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:15,648
Be right with you.

1633
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:18,653
Yes, sir?

1634
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:21,658
I'm a friend of Al Cooley's.

1635
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:22,659
Yeah.

1636
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:26,166
I'm Max Lasker's
press agent.

1637
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:28,669
He's a theatrical producer.

1638
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:30,172
Yes, Ive heard of him.

1639
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,174
Sit down.

1640
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:34,679
Bill Friend.
That's my name.

1641
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:36,182
Heard of you, too.

1642
01:18:36,182 --> 01:18:39,687
If you want me in a show,
I'm pretty busy.

1643
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:40,689
Well, no.

1644
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:43,694
It's just that Ive got an angle

1645
01:18:44,195 --> 01:18:45,697
about this Pat Kroll thing.

1646
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:48,702
What do you mean
exactly angle?

1647
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:52,209
I think I may know

1648
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:53,710
who you're looking for,

1649
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:56,215
or, anyway, it's a hunch.

1650
01:18:56,715 --> 01:18:57,717
You're a little late.

1651
01:18:58,218 --> 01:18:59,220
It's all over.

1652
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,222
It is?

1653
01:19:00,722 --> 01:19:01,724
Cracked just after lunch.

1654
01:19:01,724 --> 01:19:03,227
Well, who? Who?

1655
01:19:03,227 --> 01:19:04,729
Can you tell me?

1656
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:05,730
Sure. Joe!

1657
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:06,732
Some poor slob.

1658
01:19:06,732 --> 01:19:09,236
Joe, see this gets
down to the inspector.

1659
01:19:09,236 --> 01:19:12,241
Some poor slob lives right
across the hall from her.

1660
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:13,743
Claims he was drunk

1661
01:19:14,245 --> 01:19:15,246
and doesn't
remember the details,

1662
01:19:15,246 --> 01:19:17,250
but we remember the details,
so that's all right.

1663
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:20,755
Everybody wants
to be a detective.

1664
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:24,261
I think it's all
these radio serials.

1665
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:26,765
What was your hunch?

1666
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:28,768
What's the difference?

1667
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:31,273
That actor in your show?

1668
01:19:32,274 --> 01:19:34,778
Well, yes.

1669
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:36,281
Say, you guys'll do anything

1670
01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:37,783
to get in the papers.

1671
01:19:37,783 --> 01:19:38,785
No. No, really, I...

1672
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:40,287
We checked your man.

1673
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,289
You did?

1674
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:42,791
Yes. Looked good,
too, for a minute.

1675
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:45,296
Turned out he'd been out
all night that night.

1676
01:19:45,296 --> 01:19:46,297
Yes?

1677
01:19:46,297 --> 01:19:48,301
With his leading lady.

1678
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:49,302
His wife.

1679
01:19:49,302 --> 01:19:50,804
Used to be.

1680
01:19:50,804 --> 01:19:52,808
I know. We checked
the whole deal

1681
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:54,811
with her maid.

1682
01:19:54,811 --> 01:19:56,314
Well, that's that.

1683
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:58,817
Why don't I mind
my own business?

1684
01:19:58,817 --> 01:20:00,821
Sorry to have troubled you.

1685
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:02,324
No trouble.

1686
01:20:02,324 --> 01:20:03,325
Sugar? Cream?

1687
01:20:03,325 --> 01:20:04,827
Neat.

1688
01:20:04,827 --> 01:20:07,332
Nothing seems
to improve it any.

1689
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:09,335
Would you rather
have something else?

1690
01:20:09,335 --> 01:20:11,839
No. This is fine,
thank you.

1691
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:14,343
All right. How long
will you be gone?

1692
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:15,845
Uh, I don't know.

1693
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:18,350
Poor Max is in a tough spot.

1694
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:21,355
Tony wants him to fire me, but

1695
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:23,358
Well, Ill take a vacation.

1696
01:20:23,358 --> 01:20:24,860
Maybe it'll all
blow over in a little while.

1697
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,363
We'll miss you.

1698
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:29,868
Speak for yourself,
Lady.

1699
01:20:31,872 --> 01:20:34,376
All right, then.
Ill miss you.

1700
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:36,380
Thank you.

1701
01:20:38,883 --> 01:20:39,885
Bill.

1702
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:40,887
Yes?

1703
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:50,403
Oh, Bill, I won't try
to explain Tony to you.

1704
01:20:50,403 --> 01:20:52,406
It's too long, too complex,

1705
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:54,910
but try to understand.

1706
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:59,417
There is a kind of
an emotional illness

1707
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:02,422
that comes over him
sometimes like this.

1708
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:04,426
He's a good man, really.

1709
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:05,427
I know.

1710
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,931
When he acts for
a long stretch of time

1711
01:21:07,931 --> 01:21:10,936
You know how he probes
and probes, and...

1712
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:14,942
He seems to release
feelings and imaginings

1713
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:16,946
that aren't his own at all,

1714
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:18,949
like this sick jealousy.

1715
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:20,952
It isn't like him.

1716
01:21:20,952 --> 01:21:21,954
No.

1717
01:21:21,954 --> 01:21:22,956
But why on earth

1718
01:21:22,956 --> 01:21:24,959
he should suspect you?

1719
01:21:24,959 --> 01:21:26,462
One reason.

1720
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:29,467
What?

1721
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,970
Because he knows what I feel.

1722
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:37,980
Bill.

1723
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,483
Yes?

1724
01:21:39,483 --> 01:21:40,985
Bill, have you ever

1725
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:42,488
No.

1726
01:21:42,488 --> 01:21:45,493
Never a word to him or from him

1727
01:21:45,493 --> 01:21:46,995
But he knows, Brita.

1728
01:21:46,995 --> 01:21:48,498
The same instinct that
makes him a great actor

1729
01:21:48,498 --> 01:21:51,002
makes him know, makes him...

1730
01:21:51,002 --> 01:21:57,012
feel, somehow, my love for you

1731
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,515
in the surrounding air.

1732
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:04,524
It's time you knew anyway.

1733
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:09,031
I don't know what to say.

1734
01:22:09,031 --> 01:22:11,035
Well, think of something

1735
01:22:11,035 --> 01:22:14,040
in a few weeks. Ill
Ill be back in a few weeks.

1736
01:22:29,566 --> 01:22:30,567
Forgive me.

1737
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:32,571
I don't know what I'm doing.

1738
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:35,074
All this tea, I guess.
Good-bye, Brita.

1739
01:22:35,074 --> 01:22:36,076
Oh, Bill.

1740
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:39,198
Yes?

1741
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:44,840
Oh...Bill.

1742
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,844
I know what to expect.

1743
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:49,347
I know how it is
with you and him.

1744
01:22:49,849 --> 01:22:50,850
Oh, no, you don't.

1745
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,352
We hardly know ourselves.

1746
01:22:52,352 --> 01:22:54,857
Whenever we meet,
we row.

1747
01:22:54,857 --> 01:22:56,359
The other night, for instance,

1748
01:22:56,359 --> 01:22:58,863
I tried so hard to make friends.

1749
01:22:58,863 --> 01:23:00,867
It ended with a door slam.

1750
01:23:00,867 --> 01:23:02,870
Yet in the morning,
I found him here.

1751
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,374
He had come back somehow.

1752
01:23:05,374 --> 01:23:06,877
Not the first time.

1753
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:10,382
He's always wandering off
in his lonely way.

1754
01:23:10,382 --> 01:23:12,886
He needs someone,

1755
01:23:12,886 --> 01:23:15,157
but I'm sure
I'm not the one.

1756
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,659
Sure.

1757
01:23:18,162 --> 01:23:19,164
Bill?

1758
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:23,670
Thank you.

1759
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,674
Thank you for standing by.

1760
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:26,675
Good-bye, Brita.

1761
01:23:26,675 --> 01:23:27,177
Good-bye.

1762
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:39,447
Draw two, John.

1763
01:23:48,962 --> 01:23:50,465
Good.

1764
01:23:50,465 --> 01:23:52,968
Good.

1765
01:23:52,968 --> 01:23:54,471
Good.

1766
01:23:54,471 --> 01:23:56,475
You speaking to me?

1767
01:23:56,475 --> 01:23:59,980
No, but thanks a million.

1768
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,483
Had a few, huh?

1769
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:02,484
Mind your business.

1770
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:04,488
Everybody's always yapping
at everybody.

1771
01:24:04,488 --> 01:24:05,489
What a world!

1772
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:13,252
Nate?

1773
01:24:13,753 --> 01:24:14,754
Bill.

1774
01:24:15,256 --> 01:24:18,761
Listen, I, uh,
I need a girl for a job.

1775
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:20,264
Very special.

1776
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:24,270
Must be about 5'4",
blond, buxom,

1777
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,272
blue-eyed.

1778
01:24:25,772 --> 01:24:26,774
You got that?

1779
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:27,776
Fine.

1780
01:24:28,277 --> 01:24:29,779
All right, now, Oscar Bernard's

1781
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,784
Yeah. You know, the wig place.

1782
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:34,287
It'll be ready Saturday.

1783
01:24:34,287 --> 01:24:35,789
Well, what's the job?

1784
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:39,795
Well, I want to get
one of these girls

1785
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:41,799
to look like this.

1786
01:24:47,308 --> 01:24:48,810
Oh, excuse me.

1787
01:25:05,838 --> 01:25:06,840
Excuse me.

1788
01:25:08,343 --> 01:25:09,845
All right, girls,
sit down.

1789
01:25:17,358 --> 01:25:20,863
Uh, I could get it
any color you want.

1790
01:25:20,863 --> 01:25:25,371
Hmm, look at these eyebrows,
Oscar.

1791
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:26,873
Yeah. Heavylike,

1792
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,376
makes her look hard and tough.

1793
01:25:28,876 --> 01:25:30,879
Now, I don't know,
it may be the photo.

1794
01:25:30,879 --> 01:25:31,881
Take this one

1795
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:35,387
Now, here she looks
kinda soft and sweet,

1796
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:36,889
ingenue type.

1797
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:39,894
Oh, well, I understudied
inclaudia.

1798
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:43,901
No. You're letting
the blond hair throw you.

1799
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:46,405
You can tell better
by the mouth, see?

1800
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:48,409
Sensuous, sexy.

1801
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,912
Did you see me
in the rugged path?

1802
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:51,914
Hmm? No.

1803
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,417
The sister-in-law?

1804
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:54,919
Oh, yes.

1805
01:25:55,921 --> 01:25:58,425
Would you come in now, dear?

1806
01:25:58,425 --> 01:26:00,929
Just have a seat
out there, honey.

1807
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:05,437
Sandra Michaelson.

1808
01:26:05,437 --> 01:26:06,438
Fine.

1809
01:26:06,438 --> 01:26:08,942
I I do imitations.

1810
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:09,944
Ill bet.

1811
01:26:09,944 --> 01:26:13,450
Now, if she had eyes
like the other one

1812
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:15,453
Oh, I understudied
inclaudia.

1813
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:16,955
Fine.

1814
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:19,960
Let me play around
and see what I can do.

1815
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,465
You think you can
work something out?

1816
01:26:22,465 --> 01:26:23,967
Oh, sure.
This is nothing.

1817
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:25,970
Phone in the back?

1818
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:27,473
Help yourself.

1819
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,481
Why?

1820
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:34,484
It makes me bilious, that's why.

1821
01:26:34,484 --> 01:26:36,988
Because you drink it
with cream, that's why.

1822
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:37,990
With milk.

1823
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,494
That's why
it makes you bilious.

1824
01:26:40,494 --> 01:26:41,496
Milk.

1825
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:42,998
Hello, Tony.

1826
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:44,000
Bill.

1827
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,003
Man: can I borrow
your scissors?

1828
01:26:46,003 --> 01:26:47,004
Fine.

1829
01:26:47,004 --> 01:26:50,511
Oh. Oh, Tony,
Forget it.

1830
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:52,013
Well, no, it's just that

1831
01:26:52,013 --> 01:26:53,516
I'm leaving town tomorrow,

1832
01:26:53,516 --> 01:26:56,019
and there are a few loose ends

1833
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:58,524
I'd like to
straighten out with you.

1834
01:26:58,524 --> 01:27:01,529
Well, like the drama
league broadcast,

1835
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:04,534
and, uh, that postpiece.

1836
01:27:04,534 --> 01:27:05,535
Yes.

1837
01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:10,042
How about around 5:00?

1838
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:13,047
Frank's bar all right?

1839
01:27:13,047 --> 01:27:14,049
Fine.

1840
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:17,054
See you then.

1841
01:27:17,054 --> 01:27:18,055
Fine.

1842
01:27:23,064 --> 01:27:25,067
Without anything,
it's too bitter,

1843
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:26,069
like medicine.

1844
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:28,072
In the highest-class
places,

1845
01:27:28,072 --> 01:27:30,577
you'll see them drinking it
without anything.

1846
01:27:30,577 --> 01:27:31,578
Plain black.

1847
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:33,581
So how do you know
it don't make them bilious?

1848
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,585
I didn't say it didn't.

1849
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:37,588
It's a question of habit.

1850
01:27:37,588 --> 01:27:38,590
Captain Bonner, please.

1851
01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:41,343
These are the earrings.

1852
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:42,345
Fine.

1853
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:45,851
Say, honey...

1854
01:27:46,352 --> 01:27:48,355
Would you ask
that new girl back there

1855
01:27:49,858 --> 01:27:53,363
sure, and one of these days,
don't forget me.

1856
01:27:53,363 --> 01:27:54,866
I don't get up to this part
of town very often.

1857
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:56,368
It's lively.

1858
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:58,873
It may be even livelier
in a few minutes.

1859
01:27:59,373 --> 01:28:01,376
What do you got against the guy?

1860
01:28:01,878 --> 01:28:03,380
Nothing.
Believe me, not a thing.

1861
01:28:03,881 --> 01:28:04,883
I just think he's dangerous.

1862
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:06,385
I saw him once.

1863
01:28:06,886 --> 01:28:07,888
It was something
about coal mines.

1864
01:28:07,888 --> 01:28:08,889
Wasn't he in that?

1865
01:28:08,889 --> 01:28:10,391
The earth below.
Yes.

1866
01:28:10,391 --> 01:28:13,897
Yeah, that was it.
He was fine.

1867
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,399
Here we go.

1868
01:28:26,418 --> 01:28:27,419
Hello, Tony.

1869
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:39,439
What'll you have?

1870
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,441
Oh, nothing, thanks.

1871
01:28:40,942 --> 01:28:41,442
Coffee?

1872
01:28:41,944 --> 01:28:42,945
Yeah, all right.

1873
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:03,362
Your order been taken?

1874
01:29:03,362 --> 01:29:04,364
No, miss.

1875
01:29:04,364 --> 01:29:05,366
2 coffees.

1876
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,886
Sugar. No cream.

1877
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,662
Man: great little
juggling act you got there.

1878
01:29:33,662 --> 01:29:35,164
All right.
All right.

1879
01:29:35,164 --> 01:29:36,667
The noise around this joint.

1880
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:37,668
Look, Bill,

1881
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:39,170
Ill talk to you later

1882
01:29:39,672 --> 01:29:40,673
at the theater.

1883
01:29:45,682 --> 01:29:46,683
Well?

1884
01:29:47,184 --> 01:29:48,185
You got something there,

1885
01:29:48,185 --> 01:29:49,688
but Ill be doggoned
if I know what it is.

1886
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:50,690
That isn't enough?

1887
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:52,192
We can't seem to link it.

1888
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:53,695
It's a long way from here
to Mulberry street.

1889
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:55,197
A nickel on the subway.

1890
01:29:55,698 --> 01:29:57,200
Let's go down.

1891
01:30:28,502 --> 01:30:30,004
Soon be over,
Tony boy.

1892
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:31,507
Soon be over.

1893
01:30:33,009 --> 01:30:34,011
Amen.

1894
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,016
Tired?

1895
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:43,026
You don't suppose
they'd go home now,

1896
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:44,027
do you,

1897
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,530
if we asked them nicely?

1898
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:46,532
No.

1899
01:30:46,532 --> 01:30:48,034
They'd want their money back.

1900
01:30:48,034 --> 01:30:49,035
They're welcome.

1901
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,543
I just can't face it tonight.

1902
01:30:54,044 --> 01:30:55,045
There's nothing left.

1903
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:56,047
Oh, Tony.

1904
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,052
Tony.

1905
01:30:59,553 --> 01:31:01,055
Oh, you.

1906
01:31:05,563 --> 01:31:07,065
Tony?

1907
01:31:07,065 --> 01:31:08,067
Come on.

1908
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,072
There you are.

1909
01:31:11,573 --> 01:31:12,575
Take a deep breath.

1910
01:31:14,077 --> 01:31:15,078
That's good.

1911
01:31:27,098 --> 01:31:27,599
All right.

1912
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:30,604
Ive reached the nightmare stage.

1913
01:31:32,607 --> 01:31:34,611
I had one the other night.

1914
01:31:35,111 --> 01:31:36,614
It was about this very scene.

1915
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:38,617
Tony.

1916
01:31:38,617 --> 01:31:40,119
It was awful!

1917
01:31:42,123 --> 01:31:43,124
Come on.

1918
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:44,126
Man: places, please.

1919
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:53,642
Come on, now.

1920
01:31:53,642 --> 01:31:55,144
That's it.

1921
01:31:56,146 --> 01:31:58,650
Don't be surprised
if I don't come on.

1922
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:00,152
You'll come on all right.

1923
01:32:07,164 --> 01:32:07,665
That's it.

1924
01:32:13,675 --> 01:32:14,677
Peekaboo.

1925
01:32:20,185 --> 01:32:21,688
Man: curtain going up.

1926
01:32:25,695 --> 01:32:26,696
Come on.

1927
01:32:26,696 --> 01:32:29,701
One for the money,
2 for the show...

1928
01:32:29,701 --> 01:32:31,203
3 to get ready...

1929
01:32:32,706 --> 01:32:34,208
4 to go.

1930
01:32:51,737 --> 01:32:52,739
I'm more interested

1931
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,241
in what her friends
look like,

1932
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:56,244
if you know what I mean.

1933
01:32:56,244 --> 01:32:58,749
Well, uh, was just 2 I seen.

1934
01:32:58,749 --> 01:33:00,251
One was small but chunky.

1935
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:02,756
She said he was
a fine dancer, but

1936
01:33:02,756 --> 01:33:03,757
How tall?

1937
01:33:03,757 --> 01:33:05,761
5 foot nothing.
No more.

1938
01:33:05,761 --> 01:33:06,762
Who else?

1939
01:33:06,762 --> 01:33:09,266
Well, that old guy
with the little beard

1940
01:33:09,266 --> 01:33:10,769
I told you about.

1941
01:33:10,769 --> 01:33:13,272
He must've been
a relative, I think.

1942
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:14,775
No, that's not him either.

1943
01:33:14,775 --> 01:33:16,277
Wait a minute.
Make-up.

1944
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:19,282
Well, he might've
fixed himself up.

1945
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:23,289
What'd he look like,
the beard guy?

1946
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:24,290
Oh, skinny,

1947
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:26,294
big eyes with glasses,

1948
01:33:26,294 --> 01:33:28,297
never no haircut.

1949
01:33:28,297 --> 01:33:29,800
How old?

1950
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,802
66...

1951
01:33:30,802 --> 01:33:32,304
7...

1952
01:33:32,304 --> 01:33:33,305
70.

1953
01:33:33,305 --> 01:33:34,808
This...

1954
01:33:34,808 --> 01:33:36,310
This this anything like it?

1955
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,813
No, nothing like that.

1956
01:33:38,815 --> 01:33:40,317
What's the matter?

1957
01:33:40,317 --> 01:33:42,821
I don't know this guy, but I got a feeling

1958
01:33:42,821 --> 01:33:44,825
I seen him somewhere before.

1959
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,327
Around the eyes, something.

1960
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:47,830
What about this?

1961
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:50,835
I don't know.

1962
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:51,836
Think.

1963
01:33:52,838 --> 01:33:54,841
Wait a second.

1964
01:33:54,841 --> 01:33:56,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I seen him.

1965
01:33:56,844 --> 01:33:58,346
He came in once.
Just once, late,

1966
01:33:58,346 --> 01:33:59,348
made a date with Pat.

1967
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:00,350
I found out the next day.

1968
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:02,353
I remember because I got sore.

1969
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:03,856
Yeah.

1970
01:34:03,856 --> 01:34:05,358
I'm sure that's the guy.

1971
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:06,861
We're getting close
now, boy.

1972
01:34:06,861 --> 01:34:08,363
I'm afraid so.

1973
01:34:08,363 --> 01:34:09,365
Let's go.

1974
01:34:09,365 --> 01:34:11,869
Ok. Ill get my hat and coat.

1975
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:15,374
Iago: demand me nothing.
What you know, you know.

1976
01:34:15,374 --> 01:34:18,881
From this time forward,
I never will speak word.

1977
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:21,886
Cassio: most heathenish
and most gross!

1978
01:34:21,886 --> 01:34:25,391
Tony, as Othello:
O thou pernicious caitiff!

1979
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:27,394
How came you, Cassio,
by that handkerchief

1980
01:34:27,394 --> 01:34:28,897
that was my wife's?

1981
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,401
I found it in my chamber,

1982
01:34:31,401 --> 01:34:33,905
and he himself confessed even now

1983
01:34:33,905 --> 01:34:36,409
that there he dropped it
for a special purpose

1984
01:34:36,409 --> 01:34:37,912
which wrought to his desire.

1985
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:45,424
Fool, fool, fool.

1986
01:34:45,424 --> 01:34:47,427
You must forsake this room

1987
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:48,930
and go with us.

1988
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:49,932
Your power and your command

1989
01:34:50,432 --> 01:34:51,434
is taken off,

1990
01:34:51,434 --> 01:34:53,437
and Cassio rules in Cyprus.

1991
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:54,940
For this slave,

1992
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,943
if there be any cunning cruelty

1993
01:34:56,943 --> 01:34:57,945
that can torment him much

1994
01:34:57,945 --> 01:35:00,950
and hold him long,
it shall be his.

1995
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,452
You shall close prisoner...

1996
01:35:03,955 --> 01:35:04,956
Rest.

1997
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,963
You shall close prisoner rest.

1998
01:35:10,465 --> 01:35:11,467
Shall...

1999
01:35:11,968 --> 01:35:13,971
Until that the nature
of your fault be known

2000
01:35:14,471 --> 01:35:15,974
to the Venetian state.

2001
01:35:15,974 --> 01:35:16,976
Come.

2002
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:19,981
Bring him away.

2003
01:35:27,994 --> 01:35:29,496
Soft you.

2004
01:35:29,496 --> 01:35:32,501
A word or two before you go.

2005
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:45,022
I have done the state
some service...

2006
01:35:46,524 --> 01:35:48,027
And they know it.

2007
01:35:53,035 --> 01:35:54,537
No more of that.

2008
01:35:57,042 --> 01:35:58,044
I pray you...

2009
01:36:00,047 --> 01:36:01,549
In your letters...

2010
01:36:01,549 --> 01:36:03,552
That when you shall

2011
01:36:03,552 --> 01:36:06,057
these unlucky deeds relate...

2012
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:10,564
Speak of me as I am,

2013
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,067
nothing extenuate...

2014
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:16,573
Nor set down aught in malice.

2015
01:36:19,078 --> 01:36:22,583
Then must you speak
of one that loved...

2016
01:36:30,597 --> 01:36:33,601
Then must you speak
of one that loved,

2017
01:36:33,601 --> 01:36:35,605
Not wisely,
but too well.

2018
01:36:40,113 --> 01:36:42,616
Of one, not easily jealous,

2019
01:36:42,616 --> 01:36:44,620
but being wrought,

2020
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,623
perplexed in the extreme.

2021
01:37:22,682 --> 01:37:23,183
Tony.

2022
01:37:41,213 --> 01:37:42,715
Of one whose hand...

2023
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:44,718
Like the base Judean

2024
01:37:44,718 --> 01:37:46,722
who threw a pearl away

2025
01:37:46,722 --> 01:37:49,727
richer than all his tribe.

2026
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:51,229
One whose...

2027
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:54,852
Subdued eyes...

2028
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:02,364
albeit unused
to the melting mood...

2029
01:38:02,865 --> 01:38:03,867
their medicinal gum,

2030
01:38:04,367 --> 01:38:05,369
set you down this.

2031
01:38:07,873 --> 01:38:10,878
Where a malignant
and a turbaned Turk

2032
01:38:10,878 --> 01:38:12,379
beat...

2033
01:38:14,885 --> 01:38:16,888
I took by the throat

2034
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:18,891
the circumcised dog...

2035
01:38:18,891 --> 01:38:21,395
And smote him...

2036
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:21,896
Thus!

2037
01:38:27,405 --> 01:38:29,408
Bloody periods.

2038
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:34,416
I kissed thee ere
I killed thee.

2039
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,919
No way this...

2040
01:38:38,924 --> 01:38:40,426
This life here.

2041
01:38:40,426 --> 01:38:41,929
Cassio: this did I fear,

2042
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:43,932
but thought he had no weapon.

2043
01:38:43,932 --> 01:38:46,436
The object poisons sight.

2044
01:38:46,436 --> 01:38:47,939
Let it be hid.

2045
01:38:48,941 --> 01:38:49,942
Tony.

2046
01:38:49,942 --> 01:38:51,444
Gratiano, keep the house...

2047
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:52,446
Tony.

2048
01:38:54,951 --> 01:38:55,952
What is it?

2049
01:38:56,452 --> 01:38:56,954
Tony.

2050
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:20,492
Tony...

2051
01:39:20,492 --> 01:39:21,494
Brita.

2052
01:39:21,494 --> 01:39:22,997
Brita, we're on.

2053
01:39:22,997 --> 01:39:23,998
Come, Brita.

2054
01:39:23,998 --> 01:39:25,500
No.

2055
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,502
Tony.

2056
01:39:29,641 --> 01:39:30,258
What's up?

2057
01:39:30,258 --> 01:39:32,262
A little accident,
Steve. That's all.

2058
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:34,766
Don't take him upstairs.
Bring him over here.

2059
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:38,773
Rex, call dr. Mervin,
will ya? Quick.

2060
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:39,774
Easy, easy.

2061
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:41,276
Tony, what is it?

2062
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:42,779
Let me see.

2063
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:44,281
Tony, Tony, are you

2064
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:45,784
It's all right, Max.

2065
01:39:45,784 --> 01:39:47,286
We've sent for the doctor.

2066
01:39:47,286 --> 01:39:48,789
For the love of
Why?

2067
01:39:48,789 --> 01:39:49,791
Why?

2068
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:51,293
Max, this is
captain Bonner.

2069
01:39:51,293 --> 01:39:53,296
He'll tell you.

2070
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:03,313
The the call.

2071
01:40:03,313 --> 01:40:04,816
I'm late for the call.

2072
01:40:04,816 --> 01:40:06,318
Take it easy, boy.

2073
01:40:06,318 --> 01:40:07,319
Rest.

2074
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:07,820
Tony.

2075
01:40:09,322 --> 01:40:10,324
I'm...

2076
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:13,830
I'm...

2077
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,332
All right.

2078
01:40:15,332 --> 01:40:17,336
Never better.

2079
01:40:17,336 --> 01:40:18,839
So are you...

2080
01:40:19,339 --> 01:40:20,842
Now...

2081
01:40:20,842 --> 01:40:22,845
And Bill.

2082
01:40:22,845 --> 01:40:24,848
We're all...

2083
01:40:24,848 --> 01:40:26,350
All right.

2084
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,853
Man: your call,
miss Kaurin.

2085
01:40:27,853 --> 01:40:28,855
No.

2086
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,860
Go on, Brita.

2087
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:34,364
Ill be here.
Go on.

2088
01:40:39,372 --> 01:40:41,876
Funny the things
You think about,

2089
01:40:41,876 --> 01:40:42,878
You know?

2090
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,383
Bill...

2091
01:40:46,383 --> 01:40:47,385
You know, way back?

2092
01:40:49,388 --> 01:40:51,392
Yes.

2093
01:40:51,392 --> 01:40:52,393
This, uh...

2094
01:40:52,393 --> 01:40:53,896
An actor once,

2095
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:56,400
old-time actor, name of Kirby,

2096
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,403
way, way back...

2097
01:40:58,403 --> 01:40:59,906
Famous for death scenes

2098
01:40:59,906 --> 01:41:01,408
Don't talk, Tony.

2099
01:41:01,408 --> 01:41:02,410
Wait.

2100
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,913
Th-this Kirby,

2101
01:41:03,913 --> 01:41:04,914
he'd finish,

2102
01:41:04,914 --> 01:41:08,420
they'd shout,

2103
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:10,423
"Die again, Kirby.

2104
01:41:10,423 --> 01:41:11,424
Die again."

2105
01:41:11,424 --> 01:41:12,927
And he'd...

2106
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:15,431
He'd get up and bow and...

2107
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:16,433
Die again.

2108
01:41:19,438 --> 01:41:20,941
Ever hear of him?

2109
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:21,942
Kirby?

2110
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:23,946
No.

2111
01:41:23,946 --> 01:41:24,947
Oh, well,

2112
01:41:24,947 --> 01:41:25,949
tonight...

2113
01:41:27,451 --> 01:41:29,955
The things that go through
one's head.

2114
01:41:29,955 --> 01:41:31,457
Suddenly I thought,

2115
01:41:31,457 --> 01:41:36,466
I hope no one shouts,
"Die again,"

2116
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:37,467
'cause...

2117
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:39,972
I couldn't have.

2118
01:41:42,977 --> 01:41:43,978
Rest, Tony.

2119
01:41:43,978 --> 01:41:44,980
Rest.

2120
01:41:46,983 --> 01:41:49,988
The things that go through
one's head.

2121
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:52,993
Rex: he's on his way
Dr. Mervin.

2122
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:53,995
No, no.

2123
01:41:53,995 --> 01:41:55,998
It doesn't feel bad now.

2124
01:41:55,998 --> 01:41:58,001
Peaceful, really.

2125
01:42:00,005 --> 01:42:03,010
It's in my mind
I feel bad.

2126
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:03,510
Pat.

2127
01:42:05,013 --> 01:42:07,517
That unfortunate Pat.

2128
01:42:10,021 --> 01:42:12,025
Ill apologize
to her up there.

2129
01:42:13,526 --> 01:42:15,029
Or down there.

2130
01:42:18,034 --> 01:42:19,036
Yeah, down there.

2131
01:42:19,536 --> 01:42:20,038
You bet.

2132
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,043
Bill...

2133
01:42:23,543 --> 01:42:25,046
Yes, Tony?

2134
01:42:25,546 --> 01:42:29,052
Look out for the papers.

2135
01:42:29,052 --> 01:42:31,056
Don't let them say I...

2136
01:42:31,056 --> 01:42:33,059
Was a bad actor, huh?

2137
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,202
Brita...

2138
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:43,209
Yes.

2139
01:42:48,217 --> 01:42:49,218
Brita...

2140
01:42:57,733 --> 01:42:59,235
Brita, you...

2141
01:43:02,237 --> 01:43:06,239
