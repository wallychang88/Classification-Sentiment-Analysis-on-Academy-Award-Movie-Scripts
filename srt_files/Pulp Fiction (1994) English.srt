Forget it. It's too risky.

I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,223
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,976
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:40,478
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,480
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:43,982
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,234
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,653
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:50,780
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,824
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:54,784
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,577
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,870
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,288

gonna do it again.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,373
After tonight.

17
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:02,625
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

HONEYBUNNY:
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,092
You're welcome.

21
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,886
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:16,889
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,933
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

Why should they give a fuck?

He walks into a bank

30
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,654
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:33,197
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,698
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,200
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,868
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,412

That's what I'm talking about!

Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,924
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,343
The point isn't the girl.
The point is...

43
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:57,179
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,847
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,056
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,684
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47

No more liquor stores?

48

What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:08,481
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,191
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:42,910
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.

171
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,578
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

172
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,246
Yuck.

173
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:51,668
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

174
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:57,757
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

175
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,801
That's counting our guy?

176
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,511
I'm not sure.

177
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:04,014
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

178
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,849
It's possible.

179
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,976
We should have fucking shotguns.

180
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,145
- VINCENT: What's her name?
- JULES: Mia.

181
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:13,147
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

182
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,401
I don't know.
However people meet people.

183
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,069
She used to be an actress.

184
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,530
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

185
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:23,491
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

186
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,992
Pilot? What's a pilot?

187
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,203
Well, you know the shows on TV?

188
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,704
I don't watch TV.

189
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,540
Yeah, but you are aware...

190
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,291
that there's an invention
called television...

191
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,543
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

192
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:35,670
Yeah.

193
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:38,672
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

194
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:40,174
That show's called a pilot.

195
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,510
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

196
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:44,053
and on the strength
of that one show...

197
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,888
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

198
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,557
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

199
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:51,226
Some don't, become nothing.

200
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:54,146
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

201
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:58,400
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

202
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,652
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

203
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,321
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

204
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,198
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

205
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,699
I mean, he got a weight problem.

206
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,200
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

207
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,328
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

208
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,580
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

209
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,081
Word around the campfire is...

210
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,375
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

[Elevator motor engages]

213
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,593
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

214
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:28,013
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

215
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,681
Well, then, what, then?

216
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:31,558
Gave her a foot massage.

217
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:38,231
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,483
Then what did Marsellus do?

219
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,276
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

220
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:45,488
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

221
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,573
Nigger fell four stories.

222
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:49,492
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

223
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,744
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

224
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,038
Nigger fell through that.

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,124
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

226
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,086
That's a damn shame.

[Residents chattering

229
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,551
But still, I have to say...

230
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:09,345
you play with matches,
you get burned.

231
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:10,554
What do you mean?

232
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,723
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

233
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,099
a foot massage.

234
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,768
You don't think he overreacted?

235
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,187
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

236
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:21,732
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

237
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,942
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

238
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,527
I give my mother a foot massage.

239
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,613
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

240
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,323
on Marsellus' new wife.

241
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,992
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

242
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:34,328
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

243
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

244
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,998
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

245
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,499
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

246
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,209
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

247
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,253
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

248
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:46,423
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

249
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:48,216
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

250
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:50,010
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

251
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,679
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

252
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:54,264
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

253
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:56,558
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

254

Have you ever given
a foot massage?

about foot massages.

- Shit, yeah.

I don't be tickling or nothing.

Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

261
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,367
Fuck you.

You know, I'm kind of tired.

I could use
a foot massage myself.

Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

a little pissed here.

- There it is.

No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

272
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,819
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

273
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,029
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

274
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,405
to throw Antwan
off a building...

275

into a glass
motherfucking house...

276
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,492
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

277

he better paralyze my ass...

278
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,371
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,373
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

280
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,250
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

281
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,835
and I'm saying it does.

282
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,713
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

283
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:11,381
and they all meant something.

284
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,425
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

285
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,301
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

287
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,849
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

288

Fucking Marsellus knew it...

289
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:25,770

better known better.

that's his fucking wife, man.

of humor about this shit.

in big man's wife?

Well, he's going out of town,

of her while he's gone.

- No, man. Just take her out.

- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,660
I thought so.

caught you boys at breakfast.

- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

of any nutritious breakfast.

327
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:27,473

328
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,517
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

329
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,019
JULES: No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

330
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,521
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

331
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,857
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

332
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,776
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

333
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,903
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

334
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:44,031
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

335
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,616
They're good.

You mind if I try one of yours?

- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

509
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:56,422
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.

510
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:04,263
AL GREEN SINGING:
You'd never do that to me

511
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:07,517
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

512
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:09,352
MARSELLUS:
Don't worry about it.

513
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,230
PAUL: Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

514
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:15,983
And some matches.

515
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,986
AL GREEN SINGING:
Here's what I want to do

516
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:22,323
Hey

517
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,949
We ought to stay together

518
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,534
WOMAN: It's as if it turns...

519
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:28,496
every part of your body
into the tip of a penis.

520
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:29,997
Wow.

521
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,624
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

522
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:33,542
SECOND WOMAN: Well, you see
how they use that gun...

523
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,044
to pierce your ears?

524
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:37,004
They don't use that to pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

525
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:38,213
Forget that gun.

526
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,841
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

527
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,760
WOMAN: All my piercing,
eighteen places on my body...

528
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,096
every one of 'em
done with a needle.

529
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,349
Five in each ear. One through
the nipple of my left breast.

530
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,561
WOMAN: Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

531
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:55,355
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

532
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,691
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

533
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,067
VINCENT: Excuse me.

534
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:02,571
I was just curious, but, um...

535
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:05,073
why would you wear a stud
in your tongue?

536
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:08,576
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

537
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:12,664
Vincenzo. Step into my office.

538
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:19,546
[Door closes]

539
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:21,130
LANCE: This is Panda,
from Mexico.

540
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,633
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.

541
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:25,385
Different, but equally good.

542
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,930
And that is Choco, from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

543
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,723
Now, the first two
are the same...

544
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,893
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

545
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,479
But this one
is a little more expensive.

546
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,982
LANCE: This is 500 a gram,
but when you shoot it...

547
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,193
you will know
where that extra money went.

548
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:43,736
Now, there's nothing wrong
with these two.

549
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:46,405
This is real, real,
real good shit.

550
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:50,075
But this one
is a fucking madman.

551
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:52,578
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.

552
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,288
[Chuckles] Am I a nigger?

553
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,625
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.

554
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,418
Now, white people
who know the difference...

555
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,504
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

556
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:04,631
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...

557
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,718
with that Amsterdam shit
any old day of the fucking week.

558
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,386
That's a bold statement.

559
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:11,305
[Chuckles]
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

560
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:13,265
This is a seller's market.

561
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:17,311
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

562
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:20,355
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

563
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:25,485
All right,
give me three grams of madman.

564
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:27,404
If it's as good
as you say it is...

565
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:29,072
I'll come back
and buy another thousand.

566
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:32,075
Well, I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

567
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:36,579
But... I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

568
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,498
That is what a nice guy I am.

569
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,627
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

570
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:44,128
Yeah, that's cool.

571
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,922
All right.
I'll just get one for you.

572
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:48,967
Honey,
will you get me some baggies...

573
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,885
and, uh,
twistix from the kitchen?

574

WOMAN: OK.

575
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,972
Hey, uh,
what do you think about Trudi?

576
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:56,474
She ain't got a boyfriend.

577
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:58,601
You want to, uh,
hang out, get high?

578
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,144
Which one is Trudi?

579
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:02,146
The one with all the shit
in her face.

580
00:29:02,188 --> 00:29:06,651
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

[Chuckles] No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.

584
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,409
All right. No problemo.

585
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:17,203

591
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:38,348
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days...

592
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,143

fucked with it.

LANCE: They should be
fucking killed, man.

VINCENT: Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.

596
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,485
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

597
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,404
VINCENT: It'a been worth him
doing it...

598
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,030
just so I could've caught him
doing it.

599
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,199

601
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:00,036
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

602
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:02,372
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

What do you think?

701
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:47,644
I think it's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

702
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:49,604
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.

How do you want that cooked?

706
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:02,742
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

715

Mm-hmm.

716
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,272
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

- That's $5.00?

You don't put bourbon in it
or nothin'?

roll me one of those, cowboy?

725
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:58,005
You can have this one, cowgirl.

MIA: So... Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

732
00:38:17,524 --> 00:38:20,151
- Sure did.
- MIA: How long were you there?

733
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:23,238
[Sniffs] Just over three years.

734
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:28,660
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

735
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:32,372
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

736
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:35,375
Why would you?

737
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:42,048
I heard you did a pilot.

738
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:45,384
That was my fifteen minutes.

739
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,011
What was it?

740
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:49,889
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

741
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:51,766
called "Fox Force Five."

742
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,435
- What?
- MIA: "Fox Force Five."

743
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:56,896
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

744
00:38:56,937 --> 00:38:59,440
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

745
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,276
And Five, as in there's one,
two, three, four, five of us.

746
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:04,820
MIA: There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

747
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:06,322
She was the leader.

748
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:09,158
The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

749
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,078
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

750
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,290
French Fox's specialty was sex.

751
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:17,916
What was your specialty?

752
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,711
Knives.

753
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,588
MIA: Character I played,
Raven McCoy...

754
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:26,800
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

755
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:28,301
According to the show...

756
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:31,096
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

757
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,974
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

758
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:37,936
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

759
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:40,063
And if we would've
got picked up...

760
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:42,565
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show...

761
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:45,485
I would've told another joke.

762
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,489
You know any of them old jokes?

763
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,949
Well, I only got the chance
to say one...

764
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,284
'cause we only did one show.

765

Tell me.

767
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:01,125

and I'd be embarrassed.

VINCENT: You'd be em...

769

and you can't tell me?

VINCENT:
I promise I won't laugh.

771
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,635
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

772
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,012
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

773

Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you...

774

built up too much.

Mmm. Yummy.

I could have a sip of that?

781
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:46,712
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like.

You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,301
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

All right.

Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

787
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,191
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00...

788
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,734
but it was pretty fucking good.

789
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:46,020
Don't you hate that?

00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:47,688
Hate what?

it's necessary...

793
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:56,655
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

794
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:01,535
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

795
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:05,455
That's when you know you've
found somebody really special...

796
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,916
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute...

and comfortably share a silence.

Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet...

We just met each other.

I'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

802
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:25,642
You sit here
and think of something to say.

803
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:27,852
I'll do that.

804
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,108

waiting for you?

We're lucky
we got anything at all.

816
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:26,285
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

817
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:28,787
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

818
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:30,330
Would you like some coffee?

819
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,832
Which one? There's two Monroes.

VINCENT: No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.

821
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:39,631
That is Mamie Van Doren.

Jayne Mansfield.

823

- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.

of somethin' to say?

Actually, I did.

a really nice person...

have somethin' to say.

VINCENT: Well, well, I do.
I do.

834
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,667
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

835

MIA: No! No, no, no.

836
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:20,505
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

837

I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me...

838
00:44:22,048 --> 00:44:24,175
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me...

839
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:27,261
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

840
00:44:27,303 --> 00:44:28,763
Then,
through no fault of my own...

841

- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.

That's an impossibility.

Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this...

844
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:36,604

in futility.

00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:49,950
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

850
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:51,118
Who's Antwan?

851
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,453
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

852
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,038
He fell out of a window.

853
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:58,542
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

854
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,253
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

855
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:04,756
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

856
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:06,800
and yet even another way
is to say...

857
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:09,970
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

858
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,472
Is that a fact?

859
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:14,432
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

860
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:17,394
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

861
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:19,312
VINCENT: They.

862
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:21,147
They talk a lot, don't they?

863
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:23,274
[Chuckles]

864
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:26,069
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

865
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,071
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

866
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:30,949
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

867
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,117
MIA:
Did it involve the "F" word?

868
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,619
No. No, no, no.

869
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:37,163
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

870
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,376
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

871
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:47,798
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

872
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,092
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

873
00:45:50,134 --> 00:45:52,845
- VINCENT: Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

874
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:55,181
[Chuckles] Well, I mean...

875
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,475
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

876
00:45:57,516 --> 00:46:00,352
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

877
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:03,063
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

878
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:04,565
No, it seemed excessive...

879
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,526
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

880
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:10,029
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

881
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,283
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

882
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:16,160
A husband
almost killing another man...

883
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,537
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

884
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,455
But did it happen?

885
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:22,249
MIA: Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

886
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:27,170
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

887
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,630
Really?

888
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:30,632
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

889
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:32,217
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

890
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,469
except Marsellus and Tony.

891
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:36,555
But when you little scamps
get together...

892
00:46:36,596 --> 00:46:38,181
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

893
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:40,517

Ladies and gentlemen...

00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:03,081
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

900
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:04,582
Right here!

901
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:07,001

MIA: No, no, no, no, no, no.

904
00:47:10,671 --> 00:47:13,424
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

905
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:16,218
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

906
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,888
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

907
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:21,849
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

908
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:23,350
All right. You asked for it.

909
00:47:23,392 --> 00:47:24,935
Let's hear it

All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

CHUCK BERRY SINGING:
It was a teenage wedding

921
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:11,564
And the old folks
wished 'em well

922
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:15,068
You could see that Pierre

923
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,654
Did truly love the mademoiselle

924
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:21,866
And now the young
monsieur and Madame

925
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:23,868
Have rung the chapel bell

926
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,663
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

927
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,957
It goes to show
you never can tell

928
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,544
They furnished off
an apartment

929
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:36,255
With a two-room Roebuck sale

930
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:39,592
The coolerator was crammed

931
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:42,219
With TV dinners and ginger ale

932
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,514
But when Pierre found work

933
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,850
The little money comin'
worked out well

934
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:51,979
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

935
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:54,440
It goes to show
you never can tell

936
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:58,110
They had a hi-fi phono

937
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,320
Boy, did they let it blast

938
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:04,199
700 little records

939
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,660
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

940
00:49:08,537 --> 00:49:09,997
But when the sun went down

941
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,582
The rapid tempo
of the music fell

942
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:16,503
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

943
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,755
It goes to show

Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

952
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:36,707
I don't know what you call that.

more information...

three times. Just once.

her breastplate into her heart.

1201
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,032
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

1202
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:52,369

by your great-grandfather...

1264
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,324
during the First World War.

1265
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:23,659
It was bought
in a little general store...

1266
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:26,036
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1267
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:29,748
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1268
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,960
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1269
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:36,297
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

1270
01:05:36,338 --> 01:05:38,924
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

1271
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:41,135
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

1272
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:43,720
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1273
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:46,098
and when he'd done his duty...

1274
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,392
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

1275
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:49,726
took the watch off...

1276
01:05:49,768 --> 01:05:51,728
put it in an old coffee can...

1277
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,105
and in that can it stayed...

1278
01:05:53,146 --> 01:05:55,857

Dane Coolidge...

1279
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:57,442
was called upon
by his country...

1280
01:05:57,484 --> 01:06:01,404
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1281
01:06:01,446 --> 01:06:05,075

World War II.

1282

Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

1283
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:10,163
to your granddad for good luck.

1284
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:13,249
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1285
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,877
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

1286
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:19,798
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

1287

had any illusions...

1290
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:29,390
about ever leaving
that island alive...

1291
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:32,518
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

1292
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,646
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

1293
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:38,107

1294
01:06:38,149 --> 01:06:40,651
a man he had never met
before in his life...

1295
01:06:40,693 --> 01:06:43,946
to deliver to his infant son...

1296
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:46,073
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

1297
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:48,659

1298
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,828
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

1299
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,872
but Winocki kept his word.

After the war was over...

1301
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:57,334

1305

was on your daddy's wrist...

1306
01:07:11,765 --> 01:07:14,851
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1307
01:07:14,893 --> 01:07:18,397
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1308
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:22,526
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1309
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:23,985
they'd confiscate it...

1310
01:07:24,027 --> 01:07:25,278
take it away.

1311
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,866
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1312
01:07:29,908 --> 01:07:32,619
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1313
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:34,913
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

1314
01:07:34,913 --> 01:07:37,874
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

1315
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:41,461
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1316
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:45,590
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

1317
01:07:45,632 --> 01:07:49,385
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:21,826
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

1364
01:10:21,868 --> 01:10:23,953
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1365
01:10:23,995 --> 01:10:26,790
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1366
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:29,334
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

1367
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:32,086
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1368
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:33,838
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1369
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,381
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1370
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:38,259
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1371
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:40,261
I will take care of it.

1372
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:42,597
[Car driving]

1373
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,522
[Colombian accent]
Mister?

1374
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:56,902
ESMARELDA: Hey, mister?

1375
01:10:56,944 --> 01:10:57,945
What?

1376
01:10:57,945 --> 01:10:59,780
You were in that fight.

1377
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,783
ESMARELDA:
The fight on the radio.

1378
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,285
You're the fighter?

1379
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,287
Now, what gave you that idea?

1380
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,873
No, ho, come on.

1381
01:11:09,915 --> 01:11:11,125
You're him.

1382
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,711
ESMARELDA:
I know you're him.

1383
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,297
Tell me you're him.

1384
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:20,092
I'm him.

1385
01:11:20,134 --> 01:11:22,719
ESMARELDA: You killed
the other boxing man.

1386
01:11:26,598 --> 01:11:28,600
He's dead?

1387
01:11:28,642 --> 01:11:30,977
ESMARELDA:
The radio said he was dead.

1388
01:11:32,145 --> 01:11:33,980
[Sighs, sniffs]

1389
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,066
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1390
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:37,442
[Butch sniffs]

1391
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:38,944
What does it feel like?

1392
01:11:38,985 --> 01:11:41,154
What does what feel like?

1393
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,156
Killing a man.

1394
01:11:45,575 --> 01:11:50,288
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1395
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,956
Are you a weirdo?

1396
01:11:51,998 --> 01:11:53,583
[Chuckles]
No.

1397
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,169
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1398
01:11:58,004 --> 01:12:00,924
You are the first person
I've met...

1399
01:12:00,965 --> 01:12:02,717
who has killed somebody.

1400
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:07,263
So...

1401
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:10,266
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1402
01:12:10,308 --> 01:12:12,268
[Sniffs, exhales]
I'll tell you what.

1403
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:15,187
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1404
01:12:15,229 --> 01:12:17,064
and I'll tell you all about it.

1405
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:35,708
[Butch sighs]

1406
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:37,501
BUTCH: So...

1407
01:12:37,543 --> 01:12:40,212
Esmarelda...

1408
01:12:40,254 --> 01:12:42,506
Villalobos.

1409
01:12:42,548 --> 01:12:43,674
Is that Mexican?

1410
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:47,010
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1411
01:12:47,052 --> 01:12:48,679
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1412
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,681
Thank you.

1413
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:52,349
And what is your name?

1414
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:54,142
Butch.

1415
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:56,603
Butch.

1416
01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:58,063
What does it mean?

1417
01:12:58,105 --> 01:13:01,983
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1418
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:06,488
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1419
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:08,573
What is it you wanna know?

1420
01:13:08,615 --> 01:13:11,993
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1421
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:13,536
BUTCH:
I couldn't tell ya.

1422
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:23,713
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1423
01:13:23,755 --> 01:13:25,715
Now that I know he's dead...

1424
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:28,718
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1425
01:13:32,472 --> 01:13:35,475
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1426
01:13:41,147 --> 01:13:43,149
[Speech inaudible]

1427
01:13:46,652 --> 01:13:48,738
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1428
01:13:48,738 --> 01:13:51,157
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1429
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:53,159
the odds went through the roof.

1430
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,869
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1431
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:56,370
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1432
01:13:56,412 --> 01:13:58,706
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1433
01:13:58,747 --> 01:13:59,957
He never laced up his gloves...

1434
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,709
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1435
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,669
he'd still be alive.

1436
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:05,003
[Spits]

1437
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:06,964
Yeah, well...

1438
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:09,091
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1439
01:14:09,132 --> 01:14:11,760
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1440
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:14,596
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1441
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:18,684
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1442
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:20,185
All eight?

1443
01:14:20,227 --> 01:14:22,229
How long to collect?

1444
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:25,106
[Sniffs] So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1445
01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:27,484
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1446
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:29,277
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1447
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:31,529
that is great news, man.

1448
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,114
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1449
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:35,867
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1450
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:39,079
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1451
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,830
OK, my brother.

1452
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:42,290
[Chuckles]

1453
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:45,543
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1454
01:14:45,585 --> 01:14:46,669
All right, Scotty.

1455
01:14:46,711 --> 01:14:49,130
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1456
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:50,590
Be cool, brother.

1457
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:02,268
[Tires squeal]

1458
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:04,312
[Engine running]

1459
01:15:06,522 --> 01:15:08,649
45.60.

1460
01:15:13,028 --> 01:15:16,740
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1461
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:17,950
Now...

1462
01:15:17,992 --> 01:15:20,828
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1463
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:21,996
what are you gonna say?

1464
01:15:21,996 --> 01:15:23,372
The truth.

1465
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:27,209
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1466
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,839
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1467
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,341
Buenas noches, Butch.

1468
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:47,479
[Sighs]

1469
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:50,774
FABIENNE: [French accent]
Keep the light off.

1470
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:52,817
BUTCH: Is that better,
sugar pop?

1471
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:53,818
Oui.

1472
01:15:58,406 --> 01:16:00,200
FABIENNE:
Hard day at the office?

1473
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:02,160
Pretty hard.

1474
01:16:02,202 --> 01:16:04,537
I got in a fight.

1475
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:06,915
Poor baby.

1476
01:16:06,956 --> 01:16:08,708
Can we make spoons?

1477
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,377
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1478
01:16:11,419 --> 01:16:13,129
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1479
01:16:13,171 --> 01:16:16,591
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1480
01:16:16,632 --> 01:16:18,551
Let me take this jacket off.

1481
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:23,389
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1482
01:16:23,431 --> 01:16:24,765
Uh-huh.

1483
01:16:24,807 --> 01:16:27,310
I wish I had a pot.

1484
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:29,687
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1485
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:31,439
and you wish you had some pot?

1486
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,441
A pot.

1487
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:35,484
A pot belly.

1488
01:16:35,526 --> 01:16:37,695
Pot bellies are sexy.

1489
01:16:37,736 --> 01:16:40,656
Well, you should be happy...

1490
01:16:40,698 --> 01:16:42,199
'cause you have one.

1491
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:43,576
[Chuckling]
Shut up, fatso!

1492
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:45,661
I don't have a pot.

1493
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:47,454
I have a bit of a tummy...

1494
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:49,415
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1495
01:16:49,456 --> 01:16:50,916
It's not the same thing.

1496
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,751
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1497
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:54,753
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1498
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:57,381
The difference is huge.

1499
01:16:57,422 --> 01:16:58,715
[Kisses]

1500
01:16:58,757 --> 01:17:01,009
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1501
01:17:01,051 --> 01:17:03,929
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1502
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:06,723
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1503
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:10,769
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1504
01:17:10,811 --> 01:17:12,145
The rest of you is normal.

1505
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:16,524
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1506
01:17:16,566 --> 01:17:20,862
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1507
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:23,323
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1508
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:24,991
to accentuate it.

1509
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:27,994
You think men
would find that attractive?

1510
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:30,997
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1511
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,499
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1512
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:37,795
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1513
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:39,630
[Sighs]

1514
01:17:39,672 --> 01:17:41,632
If you had a pot belly...

1515
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:43,634
I would punch you in it.

1516
01:17:43,676 --> 01:17:46,179
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1517
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,264
Ah! I'd smother you.

1518
01:17:48,306 --> 01:17:51,767
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1519
01:17:51,809 --> 01:17:52,810
[Butch laughing]

1520
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:53,811
You'd do that?

1521
01:17:53,853 --> 01:17:55,396
Yes. Yes.

1522
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:56,605
[Moans]

1523
01:17:56,647 --> 01:17:59,150
[Moaning]

1524
01:18:01,986 --> 01:18:05,030
[Both moan, both laugh]

1525
01:18:10,744 --> 01:18:12,121
Did you get everything?

1526
01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:13,706
Yes, I did.

1527
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:15,916
BUTCH: Good job, sugar pop.

1528
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,167
Did everything go as planned?

1529
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:19,336
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1530
01:18:19,378 --> 01:18:20,754
[Fabienne chuckles]

1531
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:21,964
You didn't listen to the radio?

1532
01:18:22,005 --> 01:18:24,007
I never listen to your fights.

1533
01:18:24,049 --> 01:18:25,342
Were you the winner?

1534
01:18:25,342 --> 01:18:27,719
I won, all right.

1535
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:29,388
FABIENNE:
Are you still retiring?

1536
01:18:29,429 --> 01:18:30,722

If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

Do you still want me

"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

"and the finder
of lost children.

Uhh!

2080
01:52:46,445 --> 01:52:48,614
Aah!

2081
01:52:51,909 --> 01:52:54,578
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

2082
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,830
VINCENT:
Is he a friend of yours?

2083
01:52:56,872 --> 01:52:59,750
JULES: Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

2084
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:00,960
VINCENT: Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

2085
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:02,461
He's getting on my nerves.

2086
01:53:02,503 --> 01:53:04,755
JULES: Marvin. Marvin!

2087
01:53:04,797 --> 01:53:06,632
I'd knock that shit off
if I was you.

2088
01:53:06,673 --> 01:53:07,633
[Door opens]

2089
01:53:07,674 --> 01:53:10,802
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

2090
01:53:10,844 --> 01:53:13,180
[Gun clicking]

2091
01:53:39,164 --> 01:53:42,333
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

2092
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:43,793
Slip your mind?

2093
01:53:43,835 --> 01:53:47,380
You forget someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-cannon?

2094
01:53:47,422 --> 01:53:49,424
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

2095
01:53:49,465 --> 01:53:51,968
It was bigger than him.

2096
01:53:56,347 --> 01:53:58,975
We should be fucking dead, man.

2097
01:53:59,016 --> 01:54:00,977
VINCENT:
I know. We was lucky.

2098
01:54:00,977 --> 01:54:04,063
JULES: No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

2099
01:54:04,146 --> 01:54:05,481
Yeah, maybe.

2100
01:54:05,523 --> 01:54:08,401
This was divine intervention.

2101
01:54:08,442 --> 01:54:10,403
You know what
divine intervention is?

2102
01:54:16,867 --> 01:54:18,702
I think so.

2103
01:54:18,744 --> 01:54:20,162
That means that God
came down from Heaven...

2104
01:54:20,204 --> 01:54:21,622
and stopped the bullets.

2105
01:54:21,622 --> 01:54:24,166
JULES: That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

2106
01:54:24,208 --> 01:54:25,459
God came down from Heaven...

2107
01:54:25,459 --> 01:54:27,252
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets.

2108
01:54:28,462 --> 01:54:30,422
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

2109
01:54:30,506 --> 01:54:32,883
Don't do that. Don't
fucking blow this shit off.

2110
01:54:32,925 --> 01:54:35,135
JULES: What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

2111
01:54:35,177 --> 01:54:36,929
VINCENT: Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.

2112
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:39,806
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

2113
01:54:39,848 --> 01:54:41,975
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion...

2114
01:54:42,017 --> 01:54:45,645
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

2115
01:54:45,687 --> 01:54:47,522
We should be fucking dead,
my friend.

2116
01:54:47,564 --> 01:54:50,484
JULES: What happened here
was a miracle...

2117
01:54:50,525 --> 01:54:52,819
and I want you to fucking
acknowledge it.

2118
01:54:52,819 --> 01:54:56,031
All right, it was a miracle.

2119
01:54:56,072 --> 01:54:57,616
Can we go now?

2120
01:55:04,748 --> 01:55:06,416
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

2121
01:55:06,458 --> 01:55:07,959
Shit.

2122
01:55:10,879 --> 01:55:12,338
VINCENT: You ever seen
that show "Cops"?

2123
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,507
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on...

2124
01:55:14,549 --> 01:55:16,300
and he was talking
about this gunfight...

2125
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:18,302
he had in a hallway
with this guy, right?

2126
01:55:18,386 --> 01:55:20,346
And he just unloaded
on this guy...

2127
01:55:20,388 --> 01:55:22,181
and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.

2128
01:55:22,223 --> 01:55:24,767
OK? It was just him
and this guy.

2129
01:55:24,809 --> 01:55:26,477
I mean, you know...

2130
01:55:26,519 --> 01:55:28,604
it's freaky, but it happens.

2131
01:55:28,646 --> 01:55:31,148
You want to play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

2132
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:33,609
but me, my eyes
are wide fucking open.

2133
01:55:33,651 --> 01:55:35,403
What the fuck does that mean?

2134
01:55:35,444 --> 01:55:37,196
It means that's it for me.

2135
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:39,365
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

2136
01:55:39,406 --> 01:55:41,283
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

2137
01:55:41,325 --> 01:55:43,118
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.

2138
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,745
Why are you fucking
freaking out on us?

2139
01:55:44,787 --> 01:55:46,747
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.

2140
01:55:46,747 --> 01:55:47,873
I'm through.

2141
01:55:47,915 --> 01:55:49,500
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

2142
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:50,793
Don't worry. I will.

2143
01:55:50,834 --> 01:55:52,044
VINCENT: Yeah,
and I'll bet you $10,000...

2144
01:55:52,086 --> 01:55:53,212
he laughs his ass off.

2145
01:55:53,253 --> 01:55:54,963
I don't give a damn
if he does.

2146
01:55:55,005 --> 01:55:58,926
Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

2147
01:55:58,926 --> 01:56:00,636
MARVIN: Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

2148
01:56:00,677 --> 01:56:02,304
You got to have an opinion.

2149
01:56:02,346 --> 01:56:04,931
Do you think that God came down
from Heaven and stopped...

2150
01:56:04,973 --> 01:56:06,099
[Gunshot]

2151
01:56:06,141 --> 01:56:09,144
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!

2152
01:56:09,186 --> 01:56:10,604
VINCENT: Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.

2153
01:56:10,645 --> 01:56:11,938
Why the fuck did you do that?

2154
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:13,398
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

2155
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,526
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time...

2156
01:56:16,568 --> 01:56:17,986
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

2157
01:56:18,028 --> 01:56:19,738
You probably... You went over
a bump or something.

2158
01:56:19,779 --> 01:56:21,489
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

2159
01:56:21,531 --> 01:56:24,075
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

2160
01:56:24,117 --> 01:56:25,535
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

2161
01:56:25,577 --> 01:56:27,036
Well, look at
this fucking mess, man!

2162
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:28,663
We're on a city street
in broad daylight.

2163
01:56:28,705 --> 01:56:29,664
I can't believe it, man.

2164
01:56:29,706 --> 01:56:30,915
Well, believe it now,
motherfucker.

2165
01:56:30,957 --> 01:56:32,167
We got to get this car
off the road.

2166
01:56:32,208 --> 01:56:33,585
You know,
cops tend to notice shit...

2167
01:56:33,626 --> 01:56:35,712
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

2168
01:56:35,753 --> 01:56:37,255
Just take it
to a friendly place, that's all.

2169
01:56:37,297 --> 01:56:38,548
This is the Valley, Vincent.

2170
01:56:38,589 --> 01:56:39,882
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

2171
01:56:39,924 --> 01:56:42,093
Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

2172
01:56:42,135 --> 01:56:44,720
- Shit!
- What you doing?

2173
01:56:44,762 --> 01:56:46,097
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

2174
01:56:46,139 --> 01:56:47,640
Where's Toluca Lake?

2175
01:56:47,682 --> 01:56:49,600
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank Studios.

2176
01:56:49,642 --> 01:56:51,310
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...

2177
01:56:51,352 --> 01:56:52,853
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man...

2178
01:56:52,895 --> 01:56:55,898
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

2179
01:56:55,982 --> 01:56:57,274
Jimmie, yo,
how you doing, man?

2180
01:56:57,316 --> 01:56:59,777
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.

2181
01:56:59,777 --> 01:57:01,779
Me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit, man.

2182
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:03,739
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

2183
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:05,908
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

2184
01:57:07,326 --> 01:57:08,911
JULES: We got to be
real fucking delicate...

2185
01:57:08,953 --> 01:57:10,412
with this Jimmie situation.

2186
01:57:10,496 --> 01:57:12,873
He's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door.

2187
01:57:12,915 --> 01:57:14,041
VINCENT:
If he does, what do we do?

2188
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:16,710
JULES: We ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls...

2189
01:57:16,752 --> 01:57:18,295
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

2190
01:57:18,337 --> 01:57:19,379
Jimmie's a friend.

2191
01:57:19,421 --> 01:57:20,547
You don't come
into your friend's house...

2192
01:57:20,589 --> 01:57:22,049
and start telling him
what's what.

2193
01:57:22,090 --> 01:57:24,051
VINCENT: Just tell him not
to be abusive, that's all.

2194
01:57:24,092 --> 01:57:27,095
He kind of freaked out
back there when he saw Marvin.

2195
01:57:27,137 --> 01:57:28,305
JULES: Well, put yourself
in his position.

2196
01:57:28,305 --> 01:57:29,556
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2197
01:57:29,598 --> 01:57:31,975
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

2198
01:57:32,017 --> 01:57:34,895
Shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

2199
01:57:34,936 --> 01:57:36,813
VINCENT: If that favor means
that I got to take shit...

2200
01:57:36,855 --> 01:57:39,482
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass.

2201
01:57:39,524 --> 01:57:42,110
JULES: Nigger, what the fuck
did you just do to his towel?

2202
01:57:42,152 --> 01:57:43,278
VINCENT:
I was drying my hands.

2203
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,571
JULES: You're supposed
to wash them first.

2204
01:57:44,613 --> 01:57:45,739
You watched me wash them.

2205
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:47,240
I watched you get them wet.

2206
01:57:47,282 --> 01:57:49,826
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

2207
01:57:49,868 --> 01:57:51,828
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.

2208
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:53,329
I used the same
fucking soap you did...

2209
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:56,374
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

2210
01:57:56,374 --> 01:57:58,918
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

2211
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,129
It's shit like this
that'll bring this situation...

2212
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:03,131
to a head, man.

2213
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,967
Look...

2214
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:07,760
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

2215
01:58:07,802 --> 01:58:09,679
You know I respect you
and all...

2216
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,265
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

2217
01:58:12,306 --> 01:58:15,184
All right. Fine. Fine.

2218
01:58:15,226 --> 01:58:18,062
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

2219
01:58:18,104 --> 01:58:20,898
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

2220
01:58:22,817 --> 01:58:25,653
JULES: Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.

2221
01:58:25,694 --> 01:58:27,655
This is some
serious gourmet shit.

2222
01:58:27,696 --> 01:58:29,573
JULES: Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

2223
01:58:29,615 --> 01:58:32,576
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

2224
01:58:32,618 --> 01:58:36,372
Heh! And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

2225
01:58:36,413 --> 01:58:37,498
What flavor is this?

2226
01:58:37,539 --> 01:58:38,832
Knock it off, Julie.

2227
01:58:38,874 --> 01:58:40,209
What?

2228
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:43,086
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is.

2229
01:58:43,128 --> 01:58:45,297
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

2230
01:58:45,339 --> 01:58:47,507
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

2231
01:58:47,549 --> 01:58:49,217
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff...

2232
01:58:49,259 --> 01:58:51,345
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

2233
01:58:51,386 --> 01:58:53,013
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

2234
01:58:53,055 --> 01:58:55,307
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

2235
01:58:55,349 --> 01:58:57,434
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

2236
01:58:57,476 --> 01:58:59,227
Oh, Jimmie,
don't even worry about it.

2237
01:58:59,269 --> 01:59:01,646
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

2238
01:59:01,688 --> 01:59:03,148
When you came pulling in here...

2239
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,649
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house...

2240
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:06,234
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2241
01:59:06,234 --> 01:59:08,028
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

2242
01:59:08,069 --> 01:59:09,863
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house...

2243
01:59:09,904 --> 01:59:11,740
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2244
01:59:11,781 --> 01:59:14,951
No. I didn't.

2245
01:59:14,993 --> 01:59:16,327
JIMMIE: You know why
you didn't see that sign?

2246
01:59:16,369 --> 01:59:17,537
Why?

2247
01:59:17,579 --> 01:59:18,997
'Cause it ain't there...

2248
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:22,125
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

2249
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,585
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker.

2250
01:59:23,585 --> 01:59:27,046
Don't you fucking realize, man,
that if Bonnie comes home...

2251
01:59:27,088 --> 01:59:29,716
and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?

2252
01:59:29,799 --> 01:59:31,426
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

2253
01:59:31,467 --> 01:59:33,553
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, OK?

2254
01:59:33,594 --> 01:59:36,389
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

2255
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:39,058
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you...

2256
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:41,435
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

2257
01:59:41,477 --> 01:59:43,604
Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

2258
01:59:43,646 --> 01:59:45,690
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!

2259
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:48,067
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.

2260
01:59:48,109 --> 01:59:50,444
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget...

2261
01:59:50,486 --> 01:59:52,696
that I love my wife, is there?

2262
01:59:54,782 --> 01:59:56,075
Look, you know...

2263
01:59:56,116 --> 01:59:59,745
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

2264
01:59:59,828 --> 02:00:02,206
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

2265
02:00:02,247 --> 02:00:04,333
You got to make
some phone calls?

2266
02:00:04,374 --> 02:00:06,043
You got to call some people?

2267
02:00:06,085 --> 02:00:08,378
Well, then do it, and get
the fuck out of my house...

2268
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:10,297
before she gets here.

2269
02:00:10,339 --> 02:00:11,423
That's Kool and the Gang.

2270
02:00:11,465 --> 02:00:12,841
We don't want
to fuck your shit up.

2271
02:00:12,883 --> 02:00:15,802
I want to call my people,
get them to bring us in.

2272
02:00:15,802 --> 02:00:18,805
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

2273
02:00:18,847 --> 02:00:21,725
You'll fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

2274
02:00:21,767 --> 02:00:23,268
So just do me that favor,
all right?

2275
02:00:23,351 --> 02:00:25,520
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

2276
02:00:25,562 --> 02:00:28,773
Well, say she comes home.

2277
02:00:28,815 --> 02:00:32,569
What do you think she'll do?

2278
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:35,071
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

2279
02:00:35,113 --> 02:00:37,198
That ain't no kind of answer.

2280
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,533
I mean, you know, I don't.

2281
02:00:38,575 --> 02:00:40,368
How much?
A lot or a little?

2282
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:43,621
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

2283
02:00:43,663 --> 02:00:45,331
this Bonnie situation is.

2284
02:00:45,331 --> 02:00:47,625
JULES: I mean, if she comes
home from a hard day's work...

2285
02:00:47,667 --> 02:00:49,127
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen...

2286
02:00:49,168 --> 02:00:51,170
doing a bunch
of gangster shit...

2287
02:00:51,212 --> 02:00:54,674
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

2288
02:00:54,674 --> 02:00:56,551
[Gasps]

2289
02:00:56,592 --> 02:00:59,220
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

2290
02:00:59,262 --> 02:01:01,222
All I'm doing
is contemplating the "ifs."

2291
02:01:01,264 --> 02:01:03,599
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking "ifs."

2292
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:05,059
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

2293
02:01:05,101 --> 02:01:07,853
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

2294
02:01:07,895 --> 02:01:09,355
"Go back in there,
chill them niggers out...

2295
02:01:09,355 --> 02:01:12,483
"and wait for the cavalry,
which will be coming directly."

2296
02:01:12,525 --> 02:01:15,861
MARSELLUS: You ain't
got no problem, Jules.

2297
02:01:15,903 --> 02:01:18,030
I'm on the motherfucker.

2298
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:20,658
Go back in there
and chill them niggers out...

2299
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:23,077
and wait for The Wolf,
who should be coming directly.

2300
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:25,537
You're sending The Wolf?

2301
02:01:25,579 --> 02:01:27,831
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

2302
02:01:27,873 --> 02:01:33,378
Shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

2303
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:36,757
WOLF:
Is she the hysterical type?

2304
02:01:36,798 --> 02:01:38,800
When is she due?

2305
02:01:40,135 --> 02:01:42,054
Mm-hmm.

2306
02:01:42,054 --> 02:01:45,057
Give me the principals'
names again.

2307
02:01:47,058 --> 02:01:49,436
Jules.

2308
02:01:49,478 --> 02:01:50,520
Mm-hmm.

2309
02:01:50,562 --> 02:01:53,398
Vincent.

2310
02:01:57,277 --> 02:01:58,987
Jimmie.

2311
02:02:00,697 --> 02:02:02,574
Bonnie.

2312
02:02:02,615 --> 02:02:03,616
Mm-hmm.

2313
02:02:07,954 --> 02:02:09,205
It's thirty minutes away.

2314
02:02:09,247 --> 02:02:10,999
I'll be there in ten.

2315
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:26,055
[Doorbell rings]

2316
02:02:28,057 --> 02:02:30,935
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

2317
02:02:30,977 --> 02:02:31,936
JIMMIE: Sure is.

2318
02:02:31,977 --> 02:02:34,688
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

2319
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:35,898
JIMMIE: Good. We got one.

2320
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,399
So I heard. May I come in?

2321
02:02:37,441 --> 02:02:39,568
JIMMIE: Yeah, please do.

2322
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:41,612
WOLF: You must be Jules...

2323
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,447
which would make you Vincent.

2324
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:45,449
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

2325
02:02:45,491 --> 02:02:46,825
If I was informed correctly...

2326
02:02:46,867 --> 02:02:47,826
the clock is ticking,
is that right, Jimmie?

2327
02:02:47,868 --> 02:02:49,787
JIMMIE: 100%

2328
02:02:49,828 --> 02:02:51,538
WOLF: Your wife Bonnie...

2329
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,373
comes home at 9:30 in the a.m.,
is that correct?

2330
02:02:53,415 --> 02:02:54,750
JIMMIE: Uh-huh.

2331
02:02:54,792 --> 02:02:57,586
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here...

2332
02:02:57,628 --> 02:02:59,379
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

2333
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:00,881
JIMMIE:
She wouldn't at that.

2334
02:03:00,923 --> 02:03:03,759
That gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of Dodge...

2335
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:06,970
which, if you do what I say
when I say it, should be plenty.

2336
02:03:07,012 --> 02:03:09,389
Now, you got a corpse
in a car...

2337
02:03:09,431 --> 02:03:11,683
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

2338
02:03:16,062 --> 02:03:18,064
[Sighs]

2339
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:21,735
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.

2340
02:03:21,776 --> 02:03:23,153
Do me a favor, will you?

2341
02:03:23,194 --> 02:03:24,487
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

2342
02:03:24,529 --> 02:03:26,823
Would you make me a cup?

2343
02:03:26,865 --> 02:03:28,450
JIMMIE: Yeah, sure.

2344
02:03:30,368 --> 02:03:32,829
JIMMIE:
Oh, how do you take it?

2345
02:03:32,829 --> 02:03:35,832
WOLF: Lots of cream,
lots of sugar.

2346
02:03:38,084 --> 02:03:39,544
About the car... is there
anything I need to know?

2347
02:03:39,585 --> 02:03:41,921
Does it stall, smoke,
make a lot of noise?

2348
02:03:41,963 --> 02:03:43,589
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

2349
02:03:43,631 --> 02:03:46,467
JULES: Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

2350
02:03:46,509 --> 02:03:48,427
WOLF: Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road...

2351
02:03:48,469 --> 02:03:50,137
I find out
the brake lights don't work.

2352
02:03:50,179 --> 02:03:53,766
JULES: Man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tiptop.

2353
02:03:53,808 --> 02:03:55,726
WOLF: Good enough.

2354
02:03:55,768 --> 02:03:57,645
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2355
02:04:01,148 --> 02:04:03,317
[Sighs]

2356
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:04,527
JIMMIE:
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2357
02:04:04,568 --> 02:04:06,070
WOLF: Thank you, Jimmie.

2358
02:04:11,325 --> 02:04:12,826
Mmm.

2359
02:04:14,036 --> 02:04:15,704
WOLF: OK, first thing...

2360
02:04:15,746 --> 02:04:18,373
you two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2361
02:04:18,415 --> 02:04:21,210
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2362
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:22,628
That would lead me to believe
that in the garage...

2363
02:04:22,669 --> 02:04:25,005
or under the sink, you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit?

2364
02:04:25,047 --> 02:04:26,089
JIMMIE: Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

2365
02:04:26,131 --> 02:04:28,091
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do...

2366
02:04:28,133 --> 02:04:30,886
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car.

2367
02:04:30,927 --> 02:04:32,929
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2368
02:04:32,971 --> 02:04:34,389
Go in the back seat...

2369
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:37,726
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

2370
02:04:37,767 --> 02:04:39,769
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2371
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:42,105
Now, it don't need
to be spick-and-span.

2372
02:04:42,147 --> 02:04:45,233
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.

2373
02:04:45,275 --> 02:04:48,027
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2374
02:04:48,069 --> 02:04:49,571
The pools of blood
that have collected...

2375
02:04:49,571 --> 02:04:51,197
you got to soak that shit up.

2376
02:04:51,239 --> 02:04:54,409
Now, Jimmie, we need to raid
your linen closet.

2377
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:55,910
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

2378
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:57,912
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

2379
02:04:57,954 --> 02:04:59,539
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2380
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:01,499
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2381
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:03,793
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2382
02:05:03,835 --> 02:05:05,545
We're going to line
the front seat and back seat...

2383
02:05:05,586 --> 02:05:08,506
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets.

2384
02:05:08,548 --> 02:05:11,217
So if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car...

2385
02:05:11,259 --> 02:05:12,885
the subterfuge won't last...

2386
02:05:12,927 --> 02:05:15,805
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

2387
02:05:15,805 --> 02:05:17,890
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

2388
02:05:17,932 --> 02:05:21,060
VINCENT:
"Please" would be nice.

2389
02:05:21,102 --> 02:05:22,061
WOLF: Come again?

2390
02:05:22,103 --> 02:05:24,146
I said
a "please" would be nice.

2391
02:05:26,023 --> 02:05:28,275
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2392
02:05:28,317 --> 02:05:30,611
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2393
02:05:30,653 --> 02:05:33,489
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

2394
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:36,950
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

2395
02:05:36,992 --> 02:05:38,285
I'm here to help.

2396
02:05:38,327 --> 02:05:41,079
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2397
02:05:41,121 --> 02:05:42,623
JULES: No, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

2398
02:05:42,664 --> 02:05:43,749
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

2399
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:45,459
VINCENT: Mr. Wolf, listen.

2400
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,961
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.

2401
02:05:48,003 --> 02:05:50,339
I don't like people barking
orders at me, that's all.

2402
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,258
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2403
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,218
I think fast, I talk fast...

2404
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:58,388
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this...

2405
02:05:58,430 --> 02:06:00,307
so pretty please
with sugar on top...

2406
02:06:00,348 --> 02:06:02,350
clean the fucking car.

2407
02:06:06,313 --> 02:06:07,856
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2408
02:06:07,897 --> 02:06:10,400
I can feel your look.

2409
02:06:12,527 --> 02:06:14,988
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

2410
02:06:17,282 --> 02:06:18,783
Green.

2411
02:06:20,910 --> 02:06:23,913
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

2412
02:06:26,165 --> 02:06:28,334
Mmm, about twenty minutes.

2413
02:06:30,086 --> 02:06:32,088
Nobody who'll be missed.

2414
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:37,635
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

2415
02:06:37,677 --> 02:06:39,136
How we coming, Jimmie?

2416
02:06:39,178 --> 02:06:41,305
JIMMIE: Pretty good.
I got it all here...

2417
02:06:41,347 --> 02:06:43,557
but, uh...

2418
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:44,725
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

2419
02:06:44,767 --> 02:06:46,852
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.

2420
02:06:46,894 --> 02:06:50,523
JIMMIE: You got to understand
something now, Winston.

2421
02:06:50,564 --> 02:06:52,441
Uh, no, thank you.

2422
02:06:52,483 --> 02:06:55,694
This is our best linen here...

2423
02:06:55,736 --> 02:06:58,364
and it was a wedding present...

2424
02:06:58,405 --> 02:07:00,074
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny...

2425
02:07:00,115 --> 02:07:01,450
and they're not with us anymore.

2426
02:07:01,492 --> 02:07:02,951
I really want
to help you guys out...

2427
02:07:02,993 --> 02:07:05,579
WOLF: Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie...

2428
02:07:05,621 --> 02:07:06,580
if you don't mind.

2429
02:07:06,622 --> 02:07:10,167
JIMMIE:
No, please, go ahead.

2430
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:13,629
WOLF: Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny...

2431
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:15,922
were they millionaires?

2432
02:07:15,964 --> 02:07:17,674
JIMMIE: No.

2433
02:07:17,716 --> 02:07:20,594
WOLF: Well,
your Uncle Marsellus is...

2434
02:07:20,594 --> 02:07:24,014
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

2435
02:07:24,055 --> 02:07:26,683
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

2436
02:07:26,725 --> 02:07:31,104
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

2437
02:07:31,146 --> 02:07:35,150
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2438
02:07:38,153 --> 02:07:39,445
I like oak myself.

2439
02:07:39,487 --> 02:07:43,157
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

2440
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:46,369
How about you, Jimmie?

2441
02:07:46,411 --> 02:07:48,413
You an oak man?

2442
02:07:49,414 --> 02:07:50,873
Oak's nice.

2443
02:07:57,380 --> 02:07:58,756
JULES: Oh, man.

2444
02:07:58,756 --> 02:08:01,092
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

2445
02:08:01,133 --> 02:08:02,885
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

2446
02:08:02,927 --> 02:08:04,720
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy...

2447
02:08:04,762 --> 02:08:06,597
that once a man admits
that he is wrong...

2448
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:09,767
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2449
02:08:09,809 --> 02:08:12,019
JULES: Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

2450
02:08:12,061 --> 02:08:14,104
The motherfucker said that shit
never had to pick up...

2451
02:08:14,146 --> 02:08:16,482
itty-bitty pieces of skull
on account of your dumb ass.

2452
02:08:16,524 --> 02:08:17,900
VINCENT:
I got a threshold, Jules.

2453
02:08:17,942 --> 02:08:19,944
I got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take.

2454
02:08:19,985 --> 02:08:21,654
Right now, I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

2455
02:08:21,695 --> 02:08:22,988
And you got me in the red.

2456
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:25,574
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous...

2457
02:08:25,616 --> 02:08:27,618
to have a race car
in the fucking red, that's all.

2458
02:08:27,659 --> 02:08:29,536
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?

2459
02:08:29,578 --> 02:08:31,121
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2460
02:08:31,163 --> 02:08:34,249
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2461
02:08:34,291 --> 02:08:36,918
Every time my fingers touch
brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."

2462
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,254
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."

2463
02:08:39,296 --> 02:08:41,548
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2464
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:44,009
You the motherfucker
who should be on brain detail.

2465
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:46,011
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows...

2466
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,762
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

2467
02:08:57,897 --> 02:08:59,482
WOLF: Fine job, gentlemen.

2468
02:09:00,984 --> 02:09:02,819
We may get out of this yet.

2469
02:09:02,861 --> 02:09:05,488
JIMMIE: I can't believe
this is the same car.

2470
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:09,158
WOLF: Let's not start sucking
each other's dicks quite yet.

2471
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,660
Phase one is complete...
clean the car...

2472
02:09:10,702 --> 02:09:12,495
which moves us right
along to phase two...

2473
02:09:12,537 --> 02:09:14,038
clean you two.

2474
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,209
Strip.

2475
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,794
All the way?

2476
02:09:19,836 --> 02:09:22,046
WOLF: To your bare ass.

2477
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:23,714
Quickly, gentlemen.

2478
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:25,299
WOLF:
We got about fifteen minutes...

2479
02:09:25,341 --> 02:09:28,427
before Jimmie's better half
pulls into the driveway.

2480
02:09:28,469 --> 02:09:30,805
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2481
02:09:30,846 --> 02:09:32,807
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

2482
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:34,308
You know what you two
look like?

2483
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:35,851
VINCENT: What?

2484
02:09:35,893 --> 02:09:37,686
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

2485
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:42,274
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2486
02:09:46,528 --> 02:09:48,530
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2487
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:50,115
JULES:
Don't do nothing stupid...

2488
02:09:50,157 --> 02:09:52,367
like leaving this shit out front
for Otto the Garbageman...

2489
02:09:52,409 --> 02:09:53,410
you know what I'm saying?

2490
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:55,370
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

2491
02:09:55,412 --> 02:09:57,831
Jim, the soap.

2492
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:01,209
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen...

2493
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:03,712
you've both been
to County before I'm sure.

2494
02:10:03,754 --> 02:10:04,755
Here it comes.

2495
02:10:04,796 --> 02:10:07,340
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.

2496
02:10:07,382 --> 02:10:09,176
WOLF: Better you
than me, gentlemen.

2497
02:10:09,217 --> 02:10:11,469
Ha ha ha!

2498
02:10:11,511 --> 02:10:13,054
Don't be afraid
of the soap.

2499
02:10:13,096 --> 02:10:14,055
Spread it around.

2500
02:10:14,097 --> 02:10:15,015
Get him up there
a little bit.

2501
02:10:15,056 --> 02:10:17,225
JIMMIE: Vincent's hair.

2502
02:10:17,267 --> 02:10:19,019
JULES: Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!

2503
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:21,146
Uh, uh...

2504
02:10:21,187 --> 02:10:22,689
Towel 'em.

2505
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:36,869
WOLF: They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2506
02:10:36,911 --> 02:10:38,746
[Wolf laughs]

2507
02:10:38,788 --> 02:10:40,039
Perfect.

2508
02:10:40,081 --> 02:10:43,668
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2509
02:10:43,709 --> 02:10:46,045
You guys look like...

2510
02:10:46,087 --> 02:10:48,256
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2511
02:10:48,297 --> 02:10:49,340
Dorks.

2512
02:10:49,382 --> 02:10:50,466
[Laughs]

2513
02:10:50,508 --> 02:10:51,592
They look like
a couple of dorks.

2514

[Both laugh]

2515
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:55,262
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

2516
02:10:55,304 --> 02:10:56,472
Come on, gentlemen.

2517
02:10:56,514 --> 02:10:58,099
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

2518
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:00,100
Don't make me beg.

2519
02:11:03,229 --> 02:11:06,607
OK, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

2520
02:11:06,649 --> 02:11:09,109
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

2521
02:11:09,151 --> 02:11:11,737
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel...

2522
02:11:11,779 --> 02:11:13,238
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2523
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,365
The place is North Hollywood...

2524
02:11:15,407 --> 02:11:19,203
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

2525
02:11:19,244 --> 02:11:22,706
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

2526
02:11:24,166 --> 02:11:26,001
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

2527
02:11:26,043 --> 02:11:30,213
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

2528
02:11:30,255 --> 02:11:32,090
nobody does a fucking thing
till I do something.

2529
02:11:32,132 --> 02:11:33,216
- Right.
- What did I say?

2530
02:11:34,468 --> 02:11:36,094
Don't do shit unless...

2531
02:11:36,136 --> 02:11:38,513
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

2532
02:11:38,555 --> 02:11:40,974
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2533
02:11:41,016 --> 02:11:42,142
How about you, Lash La Rue?

2534
02:11:42,183 --> 02:11:44,686
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2535
02:11:44,686 --> 02:11:46,229
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

2536
02:11:46,271 --> 02:11:47,480
I don't why.

2537
02:11:47,522 --> 02:11:48,690
I'm cool. I promise you.

2538
02:11:48,731 --> 02:11:52,235
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fucking fast, so keep up.

2539
02:11:52,277 --> 02:11:54,487
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it...

2540
02:11:54,529 --> 02:11:57,282
Monster Joe's going to be
disposing of two bodies.

2541
02:11:57,323 --> 02:12:00,034
[Metal clatters]

2542
02:12:00,076 --> 02:12:02,829
Out of my way, Rex.

2543
02:12:04,414 --> 02:12:07,041
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

2544
02:12:07,083 --> 02:12:08,125
VINCENT: All right.

2545
02:12:08,167 --> 02:12:10,795
WOLF: Boys, this is Raquel.

2546
02:12:10,836 --> 02:12:13,714
Someday, all this will be hers.

2547
02:12:13,756 --> 02:12:16,300
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2548
02:12:16,342 --> 02:12:18,969
RAQUEL: You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

2549
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:21,138
[Wolf laughs]

2550
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:23,140
I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

2551
02:12:23,182 --> 02:12:25,142
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

2552
02:12:25,184 --> 02:12:26,560
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

2553
02:12:26,602 --> 02:12:29,063
It's... it's your future.

2554
02:12:29,104 --> 02:12:33,067
I... I see a... a cab ride.

2555

Move out of the sticks, fellas.

2556
02:12:35,069 --> 02:12:36,236
Say good night, Raquel.

2557

Good night, Raquel.

2558
02:12:37,571 --> 02:12:39,072
I'll see you guys around.

Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

2560
02:12:40,407 --> 02:12:42,784
Mr. Wolf,
I just want to tell you...

2561
02:12:42,826 --> 02:12:44,786
it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

2562
02:12:44,828 --> 02:12:48,874
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

[Car alarm chirps]

2566
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:57,466
Respect for one's elders
shows character.

2567
02:12:57,507 --> 02:12:59,551
I have character.

2568
02:12:59,593 --> 02:13:01,344
Because you are a character...

02:19:41,904 --> 02:19:43,739
PUMPKIN: That's it.
Get the fuck down.

2741
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,781
In the bag.

2742
02:19:44,823 --> 02:19:46,116
In the fucking bag!

2743
02:19:46,158 --> 02:19:49,244
CUSTOMER: I don't have
nothing on me, man.

2744
02:19:50,704 --> 02:19:52,497
PUMPKIN: What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

2745
02:19:52,539 --> 02:19:55,041
Laura? Laura, tips.

2746
02:19:55,083 --> 02:19:56,585
- In the bag.
- Yeah.

2747
02:19:56,626 --> 02:19:58,378
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

2748
02:19:58,420 --> 02:20:00,422
In the fucking bag.

2749
02:20:01,464 --> 02:20:02,924
Tidy up, tidy up.
That's it.

2750
02:20:02,966 --> 02:20:04,926
Now get the fuck
down on the floor.

2751
02:20:04,968 --> 02:20:06,636
In the bag.

2752
02:20:06,678 --> 02:20:08,179
In the bag.

2753
02:20:20,108 --> 02:20:21,484
In the bag.

2754
02:20:36,582 --> 02:20:37,875
What's in the case?

2755
02:20:37,917 --> 02:20:39,502
My boss's dirty laundry.

2756
02:20:39,543 --> 02:20:41,003
Your boss makes you
do his laundry?

2757
02:20:41,045 --> 02:20:42,046
JULES:
When he wants it clean.

2758
02:20:42,046 --> 02:20:43,130
Sounds like a shit job.

2759
02:20:43,172 --> 02:20:44,882
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

2760
02:20:44,924 --> 02:20:45,966
Open it.

2761
02:20:46,008 --> 02:20:47,927
Afraid I can't do that.

2762
02:20:49,553 --> 02:20:50,846
I didn't hear you.

2763
02:20:50,888 --> 02:20:52,306
Yes, you did.

2764
02:20:53,432 --> 02:20:54,683
HONEYBUNNY:
What's going on?

2765
02:20:54,725 --> 02:20:57,686
PUMPKIN: Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

2766
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:59,354
HONEYBUNNY:
Shoot him in the face.

2767
02:20:59,396 --> 02:21:01,482
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time...

2768
02:21:01,523 --> 02:21:03,025
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2769
02:21:03,066 --> 02:21:05,527
You don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2770
02:21:05,527 --> 02:21:07,696
MANAGER: Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2771
02:21:07,738 --> 02:21:09,364
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of there!

2772
02:21:09,406 --> 02:21:10,699
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2773
02:21:10,741 --> 02:21:12,034
This ain't none
of your goddamn business.

2774
02:21:14,077 --> 02:21:16,121
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.

2775
02:21:16,163 --> 02:21:18,165
It's no problem.
I got it under control.

2776
02:21:19,916 --> 02:21:21,751
Now I'm going to count to three.

2777
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:25,171
If you don't open that case...

2778
02:21:25,213 --> 02:21:29,384
I'm going to unload
in your fucking face.

2779
02:21:31,636 --> 02:21:33,179
We clear?

2780
02:21:36,683 --> 02:21:37,684
One...

2781
02:21:41,479 --> 02:21:42,605
two...

2782
02:21:43,898 --> 02:21:45,191
- three.
- OK, Ringo.

2783
02:21:45,233 --> 02:21:47,527
You win.

2784
02:21:47,568 --> 02:21:49,070
It's yours.

2785
02:21:54,325 --> 02:21:56,118
Open it.

2786
02:21:59,872 --> 02:22:02,208
HONEYBUNNY:
What is it?

2787
02:22:02,249 --> 02:22:04,585
What is it?

2788
02:22:04,627 --> 02:22:07,254
Is that what I think it is?

2789
02:22:07,296 --> 02:22:09,048
Mm-hmm.

2790
02:22:11,926 --> 02:22:13,302
It's beautiful.

2791
02:22:13,344 --> 02:22:16,388
HONEYBUNNY:
God damn it, what is it?

2792
02:22:18,098 --> 02:22:21,810
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2793
02:22:21,852 --> 02:22:23,812
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2794
02:22:23,854 --> 02:22:25,647
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2795
02:22:25,689 --> 02:22:27,191
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2796
02:22:27,232 --> 02:22:28,567
Tell that fuckin' bitch
to chill!

2797
02:22:28,609 --> 02:22:30,110
PUMPKIN:
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2798
02:22:30,152 --> 02:22:32,613
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2799
02:22:32,654 --> 02:22:34,448
- Let go of him!
- JULES: Chill!

2800
02:22:34,489 --> 02:22:35,657
Tell her it's
going to be all right.

2801
02:22:35,699 --> 02:22:36,700
It's going to be all right.

2802
02:22:36,742 --> 02:22:38,035
- Promise her!
- I promise!

2803
02:22:38,076 --> 02:22:39,828
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2804
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:41,329
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2805
02:22:41,371 --> 02:22:43,081
All right, now, Yolanda!

2806
02:22:43,123 --> 02:22:45,125
JULES: We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2807
02:22:45,125 --> 02:22:46,585
Don't you hurt him!

2808
02:22:46,626 --> 02:22:47,836
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2809
02:22:47,877 --> 02:22:50,338
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.

2810
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:52,298
And what's Fonzie like?

2811
02:22:52,298 --> 02:22:54,634
JULES: Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?!

2812
02:22:54,634 --> 02:22:55,760
He's cool?

2813
02:22:55,802 --> 02:22:57,220
- JULES: What?
- Cool.

2814
02:22:57,262 --> 02:22:58,596
Correctamundo!

2815
02:22:58,638 --> 02:23:02,141
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2816
02:23:02,183 --> 02:23:07,188
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2817
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:09,190
And when I count three...

2818
02:23:09,232 --> 02:23:11,567
I want you to let go
of your gun...

2819
02:23:11,609 --> 02:23:14,112
put your palms
flat on the table...

2820
02:23:14,195 --> 02:23:16,823
and sit your ass down.

2821
02:23:16,864 --> 02:23:21,160
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

2822
02:23:21,202 --> 02:23:22,370
You ready?

2823
02:23:23,788 --> 02:23:25,790
One...

2824
02:23:25,873 --> 02:23:27,958
two...

2825
02:23:28,042 --> 02:23:29,335
three.

2826
02:23:36,884 --> 02:23:39,345
OK, now you let him go!

2827
02:23:39,386 --> 02:23:41,597
JULES: Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

2828
02:23:41,639 --> 02:23:43,724
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2829
02:23:43,766 --> 02:23:45,893
JULES: And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

2830
02:23:45,934 --> 02:23:47,811
And when motherfuckers
get scared...

2831
02:23:47,853 --> 02:23:51,481
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2832
02:23:51,523 --> 02:23:55,068
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2833
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:58,697
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2834
02:23:58,739 --> 02:24:02,534
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that...

2835
02:24:02,534 --> 02:24:05,495
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2836
02:24:05,537 --> 02:24:07,497
So let's see what we can do.

2837
02:24:07,581 --> 02:24:09,833
JULES: Now...

2838
02:24:09,875 --> 02:24:13,586
here's the situation.

2839
02:24:13,628 --> 02:24:15,005
Normally both your asses...

2840
02:24:15,046 --> 02:24:17,048
would be dead
as fuckin' fried chicken...

2841
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:18,341
but you happened
to pull this shit...

2842
02:24:18,383 --> 02:24:19,718
while I'm in
a transitional period...

2843
02:24:19,718 --> 02:24:22,554
and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.

2844
02:24:22,595 --> 02:24:27,267
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2845
02:24:27,308 --> 02:24:30,603
Besides, I been through
too much shit over this case...

2846
02:24:30,645 --> 02:24:33,898
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2847
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,525
Vincent!

2848
02:24:35,566 --> 02:24:37,151
Be cool!

2849
02:24:37,193 --> 02:24:40,196
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

2850
02:24:40,238 --> 02:24:41,447
We still just talking!

2851
02:24:41,489 --> 02:24:43,115
Come on, point the gun at me!

2852
02:24:43,157 --> 02:24:45,076
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

2853
02:24:45,076 --> 02:24:49,747
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2854
02:24:49,789 --> 02:24:52,541
Tell her we're still cool.

2855
02:24:52,583 --> 02:24:54,043
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

2856
02:24:54,085 --> 02:24:56,128
How we doing, baby?

2857
02:24:56,170 --> 02:24:59,423
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.

2858
02:24:59,423 --> 02:25:01,008
JULES:
Just hang in there, baby.

2859
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:02,593
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

2860
02:25:02,593 --> 02:25:03,886
And Ringo's proud of you.

2861
02:25:03,927 --> 02:25:05,721
It's almost over.

2862
02:25:05,763 --> 02:25:07,723
Tell her you're proud of her.

2863
02:25:07,765 --> 02:25:09,058
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

2864
02:25:09,099 --> 02:25:10,893
I love you.

2865
02:25:10,934 --> 02:25:12,603
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

2866
02:25:12,603 --> 02:25:17,733
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2867
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:21,778
Which one is it?

2868
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:24,156
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2869
02:25:38,837 --> 02:25:40,505
JULES: That's it.

2870
02:25:40,547 --> 02:25:42,006
That's my Bad Motherfucker.

2871
02:25:42,048 --> 02:25:44,592
Open it up. Take out the money.

2872
02:25:50,306 --> 02:25:51,849
JULES: Count it.

2873
02:25:58,231 --> 02:26:00,691
How much is there?

2874
02:26:02,985 --> 02:26:04,487
About $1,500.

2875
02:26:04,529 --> 02:26:07,782
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2876
02:26:07,823 --> 02:26:10,743
With the rest of those wallets
and the register...

2877
02:26:10,785 --> 02:26:12,703
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

2878
02:26:12,745 --> 02:26:15,331
VINCENT: Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1,500...

2879
02:26:15,373 --> 02:26:17,166
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2880
02:26:17,208 --> 02:26:18,292
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2881
02:26:18,334 --> 02:26:20,461
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

2882
02:26:20,503 --> 02:26:22,171
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2883
02:26:22,213 --> 02:26:23,797
Shut up!

2884
02:26:23,881 --> 02:26:25,799
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

2885
02:26:25,841 --> 02:26:29,970
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.

2886
02:26:30,012 --> 02:26:31,805
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

2887
02:26:31,847 --> 02:26:35,350
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?

2888
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,477
What?

2889
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,686
Your life.

2890
02:26:37,728 --> 02:26:39,354
I'm givin' you that money...

2891
02:26:39,396 --> 02:26:42,232
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

2892
02:26:42,274 --> 02:26:45,110
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2893
02:26:45,152 --> 02:26:46,820
Not regularly, no.

2894
02:26:46,862 --> 02:26:49,281
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2895
02:26:49,322 --> 02:26:52,993
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

2896
02:26:53,034 --> 02:26:56,162
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2897
02:26:56,204 --> 02:26:57,998
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

2898
02:26:58,039 --> 02:26:59,833
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2899
02:26:59,874 --> 02:27:03,420
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

2900
02:27:03,461 --> 02:27:05,797
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

2901
02:27:05,839 --> 02:27:07,340
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

2902
02:27:07,382 --> 02:27:10,009
"and the finder
of lost children.

2903
02:27:10,051 --> 02:27:12,011
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

2904
02:27:12,053 --> 02:27:14,389
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2905
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:17,433
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2906
02:27:17,475 --> 02:27:20,520
"and you will know
I am the Lord...

2907
02:27:20,561 --> 02:27:24,190
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2908
02:27:24,232 --> 02:27:27,527
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

2909
02:27:27,568 --> 02:27:32,031
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2910
02:27:32,073 --> 02:27:33,908
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2911
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:35,576
I just thought
it was some cold-blooded shit...

2912
02:27:35,618 --> 02:27:39,246
to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.

2913
02:27:39,288 --> 02:27:42,958
But I saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice.

2914
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,127
See, now I'm thinkin'...

2915
02:27:45,169 --> 02:27:48,881
maybe it means
you're the evil man...

2916
02:27:48,923 --> 02:27:50,883
and I'm the righteous man...

2917
02:27:50,924 --> 02:27:53,010
and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...

2918
02:27:53,052 --> 02:27:54,970
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass...

2919
02:27:55,012 --> 02:27:57,598
in the Valley of Darkness.

2920
02:27:57,639 --> 02:27:59,600
Or it could mean...

2921
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:02,853
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

2922
02:28:02,895 --> 02:28:07,107
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2923
02:28:07,149 --> 02:28:09,443
Now, I'd like that.

2924
02:28:09,443 --> 02:28:12,362
But that shit ain't the truth.

2925
02:28:12,404 --> 02:28:14,156
The truth is...

2926
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:18,577
you're the weak...

2927
02:28:18,618 --> 02:28:22,038
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

2928
02:28:22,122 --> 02:28:26,292
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2929
02:28:26,334 --> 02:28:31,923
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2930
02:28:47,313 --> 02:28:48,564
JULES: Go on.

2931
02:29:05,581 --> 02:29:07,249
[Sighs]

2932
02:29:07,291 --> 02:29:09,960
I think we should
be leaving now.

2933
02:29:10,002 --> 02:29:12,046
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.
