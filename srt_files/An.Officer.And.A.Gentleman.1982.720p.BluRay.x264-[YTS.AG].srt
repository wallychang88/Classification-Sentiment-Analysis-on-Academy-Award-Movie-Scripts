1067
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,538
Listen, what if Foley was right?

1068
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:45,166
She got herself knocked up to trap you,
is it still your responsibility?

1069
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:51,089
That's not the point. No matter how it
happened, there'd be a child that is mine.

1070
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:53,842
I wouldn't know its name or nothing.

1071
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:57,637
Jesus Christ,
is everything your responsibility?

1072
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:05,311
Sit. Adjust. Pray. Attack.

1073
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,815
It's just like your brother getting killed.

1074
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:14,028
It's the same thing as your brother.
Him getting killed instead of you.

1075
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:16,489
Isn't that the reason you promised
to marry Susan?

1076
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:20,660
Isn't the reason to do everything
after some bullshit code of ethics?

1077
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:26,040
It may be bullshit to you, buddy,
but I wasn't raised that way.

1078
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,668
We got a responsibility
to the people in our lives.

1079
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:31,629
It's the only thing that separates us
from the animals.

1080
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:37,677
I'm not like you. I can't shit all over people
and just sleep like a baby.

1081
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:41,264
You got responsibility to yourself first.
If you can't handle that...

1082
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:44,100
...you got bigger problems
than making some girl pregnant!

1083
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:47,812

Your co-ordination will deteriorate, and even
childlike exercises will seem impossible.

Giddiness, shortness of breath, claustrophobia.

go back on oxygen.

It doesn't matter.
That's the purpose of this zoo.

I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.

But what'll we do? Where would we go?

1166
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:27,086
Oklahoma.

1167

I'm gonna get my old job back at J.C. Penney's.
In two years, I'll be floor manager.

You're gonna love Oklahoma.
And you and Mom are gonna get along great.

Money might be tight at first,
so we might have to live at home.

...and we've had some really great times,
but I thought you understood.

1185
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:44,557
I want to marry a pilot.
I want to live my life overseas.

I expect to lose half of you before I'm finished.

1359
01:59:37,546 --> 01:59:41,841
I'll use every means necessary,
fair and unfair to trip you up.

01:59:57,066 --> 02:00:00,610
Turn it, Bonnie.
No, back the other way.

1361
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:03,696
Keep going, keep going.

1362
02:01:11,473 --> 02:01:16,728
Way to go, Paula! Way to go!
