1
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:57,240
That was a bad shot,
or else he was impatient.

2
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,869
He must've aimed for my head,
but he got me in the back.

3
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:05,248
I was scared. I couldn't feel
anything from my waist down.

4
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:08,543
I thought I was dying.

5
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,341
It's funny.

6
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,344
It's very, very funny.

7
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:20,597
I was afraid I was gonna die.

8
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,558
Now I'm afraid I'm gonna live.

9
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,581
"Oh, you'll be walking again
in a couple of months,

10
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:29,982
Lieutenant Wilczek."

11
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:34,861
How many months?

12
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,572
I've lost count.

13
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:42,494
But let's keep it gay.
Soldier, repeat after me:

14
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:46,081
"The war's over now, and I'm
glad I'm still half alive.

15
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:49,126
I'm a lucky-".

16
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,174
- A fine way to treat a Silver Star.
- Turn the light out.

17
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,428
Good night.

18
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,564
You know how it is.

19
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,941
You read a lot of things.
You hear a lot of things.

20
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:59,279
You get a lot of misinformation
from people who oughta know better.

21
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,325
Okay, let's summarize
what we've learned.

22
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:07,954
Paraplegia is the result
of an injury to the spinal cord.

23
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:12,185
That break in the cord causes
immediate and lasting paralysis...

24
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,587
of motion and feeling
in the lower body.

25
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:20,467
In general, most paraplegic
patients will, at various times,

26
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,303
suffer all
of the following symptoms:

27
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:27,349
Pain, muscular spasms,
bed sores,

28
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,976
paralysis of the bladder
and bowels.

29
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,414
However, all of these
may and can be controlled...

30
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:37,692
by medical therapy, surgery,
proper nutrition,

31
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,612
physical rehabilitation
and self-care.

32
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:45,992
Lastly, the question of walking.

33
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:52,249
In almost every case, the word
"walk" must be forgotten.

34
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,377
It no longer exists.

35
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,485
In short, most paraplegics...

36
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,513
must content themselves
with life in a wheelchair.

37
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:10,142
Make yourselves accept that.

38
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,270
It'll make it
a lot easier for them.

39
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, I've talked a long time.

40
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:22,487
Perhaps there are some
questions you'd like to ask.

41
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:36,001
Doctor, my boy -
he's only 19.

42
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:37,979
I know.

43
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:41,006
But with proper care,
he may live to be 90.

44
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:45,677
Doctor-Brock, is it?

45
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,431
Well, this condition-
there must be some cure.

46
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,559
Paraplegia isn't
a death sentence any longer.

47
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,662
I'm happy to say
that in this hospital...

48
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:57,272
the mortality rate has been
less than three percent.

49
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:00,942
I didn't mean that.
I meant the spine injury.

50
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,445
Surely there must be
some way of healing it.

51
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,323
There must be
specialists somewhere.

52
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,534
Madam, there is no method
known to medical science...

53
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:13,079
for the regeneration
of spinal cord tissue.

54
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,915
None.

55
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,958
Doctor,

56
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,169
my husband and I,

57
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,338
we have a little girl.

58
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,007
We've always wanted
to have a large family,

59
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:28,136
but now if we could just have
at least one more for the child's sake.

60
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,597
Will it be possible?

61
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,849
Well, that's difficult to say.

62
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,893
In some cases, it is possible.

63
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,854
However, I can't discuss
your husband here.

64
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,857
I'll be happy to meet
with you whenever you say.

65
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:44,027
Dr. Brock, what about
the bladder and bowels?

66
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,112
How badly are they affected?

67
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:49,407
Most men find that they're capable
of retraining themselves...

68
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,535
and in time achieving
regularity in these functions.

69
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,040
Any more questions?

70
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,919
Dr. Brock.

71
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,755
We've been married nine years.

72
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:07,300
I thought my husband and I knew
each other as well as anyone could,

73
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:10,011
and I want to keep
our marriage going.

74
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:13,932
But... he's so changed.

75
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,686
He's different.

76
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,062
He isn't different.

77
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,898
He's the same man
with a spinal cord injury.

78
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:25,068
- But when I try...
- Oh, I know right now he's unhappy.

79
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:26,278
He's depressed.

80
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:29,572
He feels himself totally
dependent on others.

81
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,700
He says to himself,
"Iím not a man any longer.

82
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,910
I can't make a woman happy."

83
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:38,290
Is it any wonder he finds it difficult
to adjust to the situation?

84
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:41,835
But... how long will it take?

85
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,046
Face it
It's going to take time.

86
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,589
It's going to take patience.

87
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,842
For you and for him.

88
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:53,096
But... will we have
anything in common now?

89
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:56,558
No more, no less
than you had before.

90
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,854
Dr. Brock,

91
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:05,317
if you were a woman,
would you marry a paraplegic?

92
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,364
Might as well just ask me
if I want to get married, period.

93
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,742
And the answer to that is no.

94
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:17,495
However, this young lady here
is marrying one of our patients.

95
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,248
You might check with her.

96
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,585
Any other questions?

97
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:26,338
If not, suppose
we adjourn the meeting?

98
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,983
And please feel free
to consult with me whenever

99
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,508
you have any problems.

100
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,761
Because you will.
Good night.

101
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,473
Good night.
Good night.

102
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,517
Doctor?

103
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,729
- More questions?
- I'm afraid so.

104
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,148
You have a patient here
named Bud Wilczek.

105
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,108
Kenneth Wilczek.

106
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,861
We were engaged
before he went overseas.

107
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,032
Well, after he was hurt,
he wrote and said it was all off.

108
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,159
He's never even let me
come to see him.

109
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,995
Why don't you leave him alone?

110
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,498
Because he doesn't
really want it that way.

111
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,166
I know he doesn't.

112
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,378
I know why he's acting
like this. I'm no fool.

113
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,672
Besides, you made it
very clear just now.

114
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,050
Why don't you write to him?

115
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:15,637
I have, naturally.
He doesn't answer.

116
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:19,557
I was so sure you'd help me.

117
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:20,767
Don't you understand?

118
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,395
This is the third hospital
I've followed him to.

119
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,564
Yes, I understand.
What do you want to do?

120
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,442
- I want to marry him.
- Why?

121
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:32,654
Why? For the usual reasons.

122
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,322
Do you have parents?

123
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,533
- Yes.
- Do they feel as you do?

124
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,284
Why shouldn't they?

125
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,578
Anyway, they're not engaged
to him; I am.

126
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:43,289
Well, what do you want me to do?

127
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:45,834
You're his doctor.
You could talk to him.

128
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,420
I can't interfere
in his personal life.

129
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:52,424
Don't you think he needs me?
Don't you think I can help him?

130
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,716
I don't know.

131
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:57,679
It takes a pretty special kind
of woman in a lot of ways.

132
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:59,931
Maybe I'm special.

133
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,599
Maybe.

134
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,935
Give me a ring in a day or two.

135
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:05,979
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
I will.

136
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:26,749
Get up! Get up!
Here they come!

137
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:34,883
Good morning, gentlemen.

138
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,360
Good morning, Doctor.

139
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:38,237
- Hi, Doc.
- Good morning, Doc.

140
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,989
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
- Good morning, Doctor.

141
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,764
- How are you feeling?
- Okay, Doc.

142
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,767
- What's his residual?
- Nine out, one and a half left.

143
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:48,021
- Good! How did that happen?
- We just stood around him and prayed.

144
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,232
Well, that's nice, but
let's keep working on it.

145
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,378
The patient's balance
of bladder function is now good.

146
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:57,864
He may proceed with all
routine activity, including gym.

147
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:00,158
- How's the family?
- Fine.

148
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:03,161
- The little one's starting to talk.
- Time sure flies.

149
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:04,913
You said it.

150
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,415
How are you today,
Mr. Mullin?

151
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,542
- I'm still here.
- Oh, I see.

152
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:12,921
Well, let's take
a look at that closure.

153
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,425
This looks good.
I'm proud of you.

154
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,512
- Did you hear that?
- I heard it.

155
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:24,408
What are you reading there?
"Nature Girl Meets the Monster."

156
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:25,558
Oh, please!

157
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:29,020
Is that all you can find to do?
Read those junky comic books?

158
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,065
Do I tell you what to read?

159
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,069
Closure of the sacral decubitus
ulcer has been successful.

160
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:39,781
Patient may proceed
with routine mild activity.

161
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,451
Hopkins, what are you
doing here?

162
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:45,453
You aren't due back
for two weeks.

163
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,039
- I know.
- Well, what's wrong? What happened?

164
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,583
Nothing. I went home
and I came back.

165
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:54,212
But you didn't use up your month.
Come on. What's the score?

166
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:58,299
Oh, my mother. She means well.
They all do.

167
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,469
But they keep telling me I'll walk
again if I want to bad enough.

168
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:03,596
Didn't you explain it to them?

169
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:06,808
Sure. So they sit around
looking at me...

170
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,102
like I'm a freak on wheels.

171
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:11,688
At night I can hear
my old lady crying.

172
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,982
Gee, I gotta live too.

173
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:16,818
Look, it took you three years
to get where you are.

174
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,987
Can't you give them three weeks?

175
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,739
Will you try it again
in a month or two?

176
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:23,866
If you say so, Doc.

177
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:25,743
Yep.

178
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:32,125
Good morning, Mr. Fine.
You look just fine today.

179
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,812
All right.
So it's not funny.

180
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:37,130
I'm no Jack Benny.
I'm just a plumber.

181
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,882
- How's your bladder?
- Oh, about 10 and one.

182
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,009
Swell.

183
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,095
Still got that pain
in the mid-thoracic region.

184
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,264
- Where?
- In the mid-thoracic region.

185
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,391
He should be a doctor.

186
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:53,104
The patient's bladder is now
automatic and well-balanced.

187
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:56,250
A Taylor brace will correct
his back difficulties,

188
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,359
but it's suggested
that he go to the gym..

189
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,111
More frequently and regularly.

190
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,506
Have you decided what you're
gonna do when you leave?

191
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,490
Sure.
Sell shoelaces.

192
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,868
Fine, Mr. Fine.
Another Leo Doogan.

193
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:08,620
That's all we need.

194
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:10,848
I heard that, Dr. Brock!

195
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,750
Hey, Norm, remember
"Blood and Guts" Patton?

196
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,794
- "Bladder and Bowels" Brock.
- Yeah, the Bashful Butcher.

197
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,006
- You're going back to school.
- Why?

198
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,925
I got a picture of myself addressing
a jury from my kiddie car.

199
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:26,155
Why not? Don't be a fool.
You might win a lot of cases.

200
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,681
Education department.
Let's get on the ball here.

201
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,767
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

202
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,436
Good day, Dr. Fine.
You look terrible.

203
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,647
Same to you.

204
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,692
Mr. Baker, I see,
is out to lunch.

205
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,696
He was out late last night
celebrating his birthday.

206
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:47,200
- Where's Hamilton?
- Took off just before rounds.

207
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,303
Really?

208
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,679
Well, I want him in my office
this afternoon.

209
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:51,704
Yes, sir.

210
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,332
Peek-a-boo, Mr. Baker!

211
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,461
Well, I'm beginning to think
a survey of the discipline...

212
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,088
in this ward might be of value.

213
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,799
Don't tell me Newman had
a pressing engagement elsewhere too?

214
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,050
He's at school, Doctor.

215
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,427
You wanted him to get
his diploma, remember?

216
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:08,429
He can't be in two places at once.

217
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:11,057
All right, Miss Robbins.
Don't look so superior.

218
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,101
You're not so smart, either.

219
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,687
Hey, look!
Anderson's got his crutches!

220
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:16,854
You see that?

221
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,232
You wait long enough,
everything happens.

222
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,359
You're gonna have to
work hard, George,

223
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:23,712
but you got a low-level injury
and you can do it.

224
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,947
Has Bricker shown you
the ways you can ambulate?

225
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,365
Yeah. Looks pretty hard.

226
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,491
What do you mean?

227
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:31,244
The swing-through gait
should be pretty easy for you.

228
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,995
Watch.

229
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:44,090
It's slow,
but it gets you there.

230
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:45,341
You see that?

231
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:48,136
Why, you can get onto
it in no time at all.

232
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,889
- It still looks hard.
- What? With your build?

233
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,226
It's a cinch.
That's good news to me.

234
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:59,605
Arise, Mr. Gunderson.

235
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:02,608
"Hark, hark, the lark
at heaven's gate sings,

236
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,861
and Phoebus 'gins to-".

237
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,799
Sherman, Weaver, Robbins,
you know anything about this?

238
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:09,925
No, Doctor. I had no idea.

239
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,869
Did go down to the movies
the other night against orders.

240
00:17:12,952 --> 00:17:14,704
I didn't know about it
till afterward.

241
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,456
Mr. Gunderson, look at me.

242
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,624
- Listen, Doc, I couldn't help-
- You listen to me!

243
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,227
You know what you've done?

244
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:23,755
Does it matter to you that this was
a perfectly good bedsore closure?

245
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,840
Now it's completely broken down.
It's a mess.

246
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,110
- It's not my fault.
- Oh, I'm sure it's not!

247
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,386
It's Dr. Weaver's fault
or Miss Robbins's!

248
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,890
They should've tied you down to
your bed so you couldn't disobey orders!

249
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,519
What gives you the right to ruin
good surgery by sheer carelessness?

250
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,855
This patient
is grounded for a month.

251
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,608
All wheelchair privileges
are withdrawn,

252
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,502
and all therapeutic measures
will be clone in bed.

253
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,029
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- I have nothing more to say to you!

254
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,035
- How are you today, Walter?
- All right.

255
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,246
- How's the hand?
- I don't know. Better, I guess.

256
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,373
All right, let's see.

257
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:04,921
Now, let's see you try
to bend the fingers.

258
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:09,801
Good. Good!

259
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,553
Sherman, Weaver,
come here. Look at this.

260
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,517
Good, Walter.
That's very, very good.

261
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,144
Now let's bear down on
those resistive exercises.

262
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,896
Let's keep 'em going.

263
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,440
That a boy.

264
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,026
That's right, Max.

265
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,529
Twenty across the board.
And you're in big trouble.

266
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,781
Business as usual,
I see, Mr. Doolin.

267
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:33,407
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

268
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,784
What was your name, sir?

269
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:37,054
When are you gonna stop taking
advantage of the government?

270
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,765
What do you want me to do? Walk?
I had enough of that in the infantry.

271
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,791
- How is he?
- As usual.

272
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,918
He won't go to the gym
unless we drag him.

273
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,838
All right, drag him down there.
Here's my man.

274
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:50,091
- How's Tarzan today?
- Oh, fine, Doctor.

275
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,968
I saw your mother
at the auxiliary meeting.

276
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:53,469
I didn't see Dolores, though.

277
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:56,222
Ah, that's a cute kid.
Who asked for your opinion?

278
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,348
You big wolf.

279
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,951
Did you see the
man from the bank?

280
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:01,537
Those guys won't even talk to me
until I get discharged.

281
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, you'll have your house.

282
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,566
Ricky tells me you're working
a little too hard in the gym.

283
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,693
- Oh, I don't get tired, Doc.
- Take it easy.

284
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,362
You waited this long.
You can wait a little longer.

285
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,447
Yeah, I guess you're right.

286
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:15,491
Mr. Howard's been discharged.

287
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:19,579
Oh, yes. That brings us
to Mr. Fox In The Bush.

288
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:22,498
Any complaints today,
Mr. Butler?

289
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,750
Just a slight case of paralysis
in both legs.

290
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,478
Nothing serious, you understand.

291
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:27,587
Everybody's a comedian.

292
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,089
- Let's do a blood chemistry on him.
- What for?

293
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,842
It's my hobby.
Don't you want to be rehabilitated?

294
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:37,471
No, I don't want to be rehabilitated,
readjusted, reconditioned or anything.

295
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:40,600
If you don't mind, I don't want
to take my proper place in society.

296
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,768
Does that make my position clear?

297
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:44,872
Nevertheless, we'll do
a blood chemistry on him.

298
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:45,998
Thank you, Dr. Kildare.

299
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,375
Hey, Doc, come here
a minute, will you?

300
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,984
It's important.

301
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:56,032
Look through the little hole
and tell me what you see.

302
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,994
Some doll, eh?

303
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,872
You moron!
You're no good!

304
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:06,018
You're making more money now
than you ever made in your life,

305
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,752
and all you wanna do
is lie on your back,

306
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,379
smoke cigars and
look at naked women!

307
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:12,673
You're impossible!

308
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,136
Wonderful guy.

309
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,142
You haven't been much help,
but you're in pretty good shape.

310
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,645
Much better
than you deserve to be.

311
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,687
Thanks.

312
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,898
Your bedsores have
practically healed,

313
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,400
and your kidney condition
will improve if you exercise.

314
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:33,903
You're a well man.

315
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:36,030
When do I leave?

316
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:39,200
You could to it in a year,
maybe only six months.

317
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:40,409
It'll depend on you.

318
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:43,162
You mean in six months
I could work into a wheelchair.

319
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:46,832
That's what you mean, isn't it?
Well, that'd be wonderful.

320
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,962
You've been a paraplegic
for more than a year now.

321
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:53,798
Don't you think it's time
you accepted it?

322
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:56,968
I accept it. I'm just
a bad patient, that's all.

323
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,053
I'm sorry I'm spoilin'
your record.

324
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,222
What record?

325
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,933
You mean all this
is personal interest?

326
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,436
Well, Doctor, I'm really touched.
I'll get well real fast now.

327
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:09,605
What is it you want,
Mr. Wilczek?

328
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,857
You want to die?

329
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,235
It'd save the taxpayers
a lot of money.

330
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,821
That's very nice of you.

331
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:22,118
Oh, uh, I met someone
who knows you the other day.

332
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,746
A girl. She says her name
is Ellen something or other.

333
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:28,374
She says you're engaged.

334
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,562
Look, you keep her out of here.
You keep her away from me.

335
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,131
Why? Don't you
like her anymore?

336
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:38,009
Are you through with me?

337
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:39,760
All through.

338
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,888
You keep her out of here!
You keep her away from me!

339
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,724
I don't want to see her!
You hear me?

340
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,142
I hear you.

341
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:51,147
I think it's time we began to get
a little tough with Wilczek.

342
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:54,025
- Let's begin by taking him off drugs.
- He's got a lot of pain.

343
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,736
I know, but we've
got to start sometime.

344
00:21:56,902 --> 00:21:59,530
Also, he's strong enough
to be moved into a ward.

345
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:01,633
Let's put him in with Lopez
and those other boys.

346
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:02,634
Yes, sir.

347
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,011
Lopez oughta be good for him,

348
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:07,038
and those bench jockeys will
ride him till he's saddle sore.

349
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:09,123
Let's do that.

350
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,125
Where's Brock?

351
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:14,271
- I want to see Brock.
- He'll be around one of these days.

352
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,732
I wanna see him right now!

353
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:19,050
Who's going in?
Can you tell?

354
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,554
Oh, no! It can't be!
We're getting laughing boy.

355
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,265
King Bubbles
of the happy islands.

356
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,435
Good day, gentlemen.
I'm bringing you a playmate.

357
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,062
You're too good to us, Robbie.

358
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:34,190
If you wasn't so sexy,
you'd remind me of my mother.

359
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,754
There you are, handsome.

360
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,530
If there's anything
you want, just buzz.

361
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,574
You know how to buzz,
don't you?

362
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:46,202
If I do buzz,
will you send somebody else?

363
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:50,456
Be nice to Lt. Wilczek, boys.
He's not a well man.

364
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:53,709
Is that all you were, Mac?
Just a lieutenant?

365
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,313
How come the put him in here
with us generals?

366
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:58,172
Oh, lay off, Leo.

367
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:02,927
Hello, Wilczek. I'm Norm Butler.
Welcome to the country club.

368
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:11,352
I'm supposed to talk
to all new men about the P.V.A.,

369
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,187
Paralyzed Veterans of America.

370
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:15,314
We've got seven chapters now,
you know-

371
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:16,816
Sorry, I'm not a joiner.

372
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:20,319
Hey, don't talk to Norm that way.
He's a big wheel on the board.

373
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:21,987
You might need him someday.

374
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:24,448
- I'm not trying to sell you anything.
- Look, I told you!

375
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,119
I don't want to join any clubs!
Leave me alone, will ya?

376
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:31,247
Norm, can't you hear?
Leave the lieutenant alone.

377
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:34,375
Sure...
I'll leave him alone.

378
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,835
Certainly.

379
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,463
If a man wants to be left alone,
he's got a right to be left alone.

380
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,591
Hey, Angel, I'd like to introduce
you to the lieutenant,

381
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,468
but he wants
to be A-L-O-N-E.

382
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:47,638
Ah, Leo. Don't mind him.
He's a clown.

383
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:50,099
Yeah, I'm a clown.

384
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:56,397
Hey, Norm.

385
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,526
Did you ever see that picture,
The Smiling Lieutenant?

386
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:03,279
In person.
Hey, Lieutenant, sir!

387
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:04,655
Whose side were you on?

388
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,158
Don't, Leo.
He wants to be left alone.

389
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,243
Who's not leaving him alone?

390
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,763
The guy's a hero, ain't he?

391
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,789
"The hero is not fed on sweets.

392
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:15,916
Daily his own
heart he eats."

393
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,169
Oh, that's beautiful.
Who wrote that?

394
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:20,379
- Emerson.
- Fine man.

395
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:21,881
You know what, Norm?

396
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,799
I bet you the lieutenant
won the Silver Star.

397
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:25,402
With oak leaf clusters.

398
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:27,654
- And a good conduct medal.
- With oak leaf clusters.

399
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,990
Honest? You know,
he should be left alone.

400
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:32,409
The best his country can do
for him is none too good.

401
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:35,186
Yes, but you see,
he doesn't want to be a paraplegic.

402
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:37,062
He doesn't? That's funny.

403
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,899
I wouldn't have missed being
a paraplegic for anything.

404
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,318
Besides, sooner or later,
everybody walks.

405
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:44,320
I read it in the papers.

406
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,299
Why don't you give the guy a break?
He's got pain.

407
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:50,034
No foolin'?
Gee, that's tough.

408
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,536
You know, I never had any pain.
Did you, Norm?

409
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:54,163
Never.
Did you, Angel?

410
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:55,891
Why don't you
throw rocks at him?

411
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:59,335
You're too dumb to have pain.
Only smart people have pain.

412
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,048
Would you mind turning
your radio down?

413
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,093
All right, you're a funny guy.
Now turn it down!

414
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:11,722
The lieutenant would like you
to turn your radio down.

415
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:14,975
What's that? Turn it upside-down?
That's crazy, man!

416
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,686
Is that an order, Lieutenant, sir?
Your Highness, sir?

417
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:20,356
I don't think so.
He just thinks it's too loud.

418
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:24,318
I can't hear it. Besides,
I got big money riding on the fourth.

419
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:26,820
Turn it down!

420
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:29,698
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
You paralyzed or something?

421
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:32,451
Come on over here
and turn it down yourself!

422
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,964
I was a captain, Lieutenant,
and I'm ordering you to cool off.

423
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,856
Hello, Doctor.

424
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:05,150
- Soda?
- No, thanks.

425
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,027
How's Ken?

426
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,029
All right.

427
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:12,491
When I got your message,
I came right over.

428
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,511
- I was hoping-
- Yes, I know.

429
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:18,372
Tell me, how long did you know Ken
before he went into the army?

430
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,875
It wasn't a wartime romance,
if that's what you're driving at.

431
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:25,754
- We met in our first year at college.
- What was he like in those days?

432
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:29,300
- Naturally, I'm prejudiced.
- Naturally.

433
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:32,553
He was quite an athlete,
a very good football player.

434
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,180
I had a lot of competition.

435
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,684
Would you say he was self-centered?
A strong ego?

436
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:43,314
No. He was an orphan.
He'd been on his own a long time.

437
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:45,816
And the kids did
make a fuss over him.

438
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:47,568
With me, he'd always want
to be boss.

439
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:49,653
I let him think he was.

440
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:52,531
But he's very,
very nice, honestly.

441
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,202
Have you told him about me?

442
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,955
Yes. He doesn't
want to see you.

443
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,462
But you're going
to help me, aren't you?

444
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,715
I'm going to arrange
for you to see him.

445
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:13,093
But I'm not doing it
to help you.

446
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:15,804
I hope it'll help him.

447
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,599
That's fair enough.

448
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:22,561
You know, I have a feeling
you don't like me very much.

449
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:23,729
Why?

450
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:25,939
That isn't so.
I don't even know you.

451
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,233
You seem to be a very nice girl,

452
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,862
but you could turn out
to be very bad for him.

453
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,614
How?

454
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:37,368
Well, if you're going into
this because you're sorry for him-

455
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,596
Don't you think I'm the best judge
of my own emotions?

456
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,496
Possibly.

457
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,622
Hi, Doc.

458
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,100
You see, men like him...

459
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:46,251
with drive, ambition,
high hopes...

460
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,104
usually find it hard
to make an adjustment,

461
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:49,505
and he's no exception.

462
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:53,592
But I don't think you realize that
you've got an adjustment to make too.

463
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:55,594
Maybe I already have.

464
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:58,389
Have you?
I've got a hunch about you.

465
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:01,892
Iíve got a feeling that down deep
you're hoping for a miracle-

466
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:05,479
some piece of magic that'll restore
this man to you as he was.

467
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,231
Is it wrong to hope?

468
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:10,401
There's a motto on the wall
of my office.

469
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,528
It goes like this:

470
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:15,906
"Please, God, give us the strength
to do the impossible,

471
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,535
"but give us the courage to recognize
what is really impossible.

472
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:23,789
And, above all, give us the wisdom
to distinguish between them."

473
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,126
May I see him now?

474
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:31,004
No. Come to my office
tomorrow night about 8:00.

475
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:33,424
There's a wedding, and
he'll be alone in the ward.

476
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:35,384
Thank you.

477
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,440
Bud?

478
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:41,074
How did you get in here?

479
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,368
Dr. Brock arranged it.

480
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,996
Don't look at me!

481
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,936
What do you want?
What did you come here for?

482
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,004
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with you!

483
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:57,382
Can't you understand
English, you stupid idiot?

484
00:29:57,508 --> 00:29:58,735
Bud, darling, please.

485
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,220
"Bud, darling, please."
Start walking!

486
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:04,515
- No.
- I'll get you out of here.

487
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,393
Will you get out!

488
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,146
No.

489
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:15,984
All right, I'll give you
what you want.

490
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,654
You wanna see what it's
like? All right, look.

491
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,615
I said look at me!
Get a good look, Ellie.

492
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,619
Does it make you feel healthy?
Is that what you want?

493
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,792
Okay, you can go home now.

494
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:35,921
I'm not going home, Bud.
I'm staying with you.

495
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:38,257
Who asked you to pity me?
Why did you have to come?

496
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:40,008
Why didn't you listen?

497
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,552
I listened to you once.

498
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,680
I should've made you marry
me before you went away.

499
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,936
Ellie, go away, please.

500
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:54,273
What is it with you?
Don't you see it's all over?

501
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:01,321
How about some light in here?
Let's turn on those lights.

502
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:10,455
Come on, open it up!
Come on, hurry up!

503
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,969
Hey, that's not fair!

504
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:31,101
Everybody over to ward.

505
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,312
Ward.

506
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:39,109
Ward.

507
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,742
- Bud-
- No, Ellie, no.

508
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,619
Why not?
Why not us?

509
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:50,972
I told you.
I told you why not.

510
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,080
Oh, we could make it.

511
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:54,100
We still love each other.
That hasn't changed.

512
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:57,461
Ellen, you don't know pity from love,
and you don't owe me anything.

513
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:00,631
Well, you owe me something.
I've waited four years.

514
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:03,258
I've followed you
from one hospital to another.

515
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:06,386
Oh, Bud,
we could really make it.

516
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:08,889
I worked all through the war.
I'm working now.

517
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:12,392
I mean, what would I be doing?

518
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:15,479
I'd go back to school
on an athletic scholarship.

519
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,397
I'd get a job weaving baskets.

520
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:20,209
What do you wanna do,
wait on me hand and foot all your life?

521
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,461
I'm like a baby.

522
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,654
You could build yourself up.
Others do.

523
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:27,532
You could try. You might even
walk again if you tried.

524
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,911
There's no hope.
The wires are cut.

525
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,746
All right.

526
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:36,166
But you could get better.
You could do lots of things.

527
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:40,504
Oh, please, please try!

528
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:45,050
Don't you see?
I need you.

529
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,011
There'll never be anyone else.

530
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:51,056
Oh, darling!

531
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:53,934
Don't you want us to be happy?

532
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:57,938
Sure, I want us to be happy,
honey, but I don't know.

533
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:00,065
I don't know.

534
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:07,406
A very nice wedding.

535
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:08,782
Well, I'll tell you.

536
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:11,785
With her being a nurse and all,
I think they got a chance.

537
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:13,829
It ain't as if
she didn't know the score.

538
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,205
She's doing all right.

539
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,709
Instead of taking care of a whole
ward for 280 bucks a month,

540
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,961
she's got one patient for 360.

541
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,296
The government gives him
a transportation allowance,

542
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,548
so she's got a car.

543
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,218
The government pays for half a house,
so she's got a home.

544
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:29,469
That's not bad.

545
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:32,597
She's a nice girl. She didn't
marry him for his compensation.

546
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:35,809
- It's doomed.
- What do you mean, doomed?

547
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:41,189
Leo, my boy it's not in the nature
of the normal woman to love one of us.

548
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:43,442
This is sad but true,
and we should face it.

549
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,985
That's what I mean by doomed.

550
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,921
Don't you think it
depends on the people?

551
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:48,071
It's not in the cards.

552
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,240
Normal is normal
and crippled is crippled,

553
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,992
and never the twain shall meet.

554
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:54,578
- Who said that?
- I did.

555
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:57,998
The fact of the matter is we make
other people uncomfortable.

556
00:33:58,248 --> 00:33:59,392
You know why?

557
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,918
Because we remind them that
their own bodies can be broken...

558
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:03,020
just like that.

559
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:04,671
And they don't like it.

560
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,048
You were married once,
weren't you, Norm?

561
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,132
Yes.

562
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:10,135
Well, she's a nice girl
and pretty smart.

563
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:11,462
I think they've got a chance.

564
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:13,513
What are you arguin'
with him for?

565
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:16,641
What do you know, dumbhead?
Go to sleep.

566
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,827
Come on, slow motion.
Hit the linoleum!

567
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:37,078
Not me.

568
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:40,040
I dreamed I was running
after streetcars all night.

569
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:42,584
I gotta stay in bed and rest up.

570
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,711
Don't disturb him today.
He's readjusting.

571
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,964
He's been readjusting
for three years.

572
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,009
Hey!

573
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:44,020
Where'd you think
you were going?

574
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,124
Down to the cigar store.

575
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:49,609
You better start
with cigarettes.

576
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:29,065
Hey, Sergeant, one cigar.

577
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,658
Now I know why
they call you Tarzan.

578
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:10,226
What do you work so hard for?

579
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,229
I got to. I gotta get outta here.
I want to get a home.

580
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,983
- Why? You gettin' married?
- No. I'll never get married.

581
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:19,545
See, I got six little
brothers and sisters.

582
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:22,572
My mother's getting pretty old.
That makes me the papa now.

583
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:24,824
You don't need a house.
You need a hotel.

584
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:27,994
Yeah. See, where we live
now, it's not so good.

585
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,972
My kid sister, she's 16.

586
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:32,207
A girl like that, she's
got to have her own room.

587
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:35,376
A nice place where she can have
company, not be on the street.

588
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:38,213
- You know.
- Yeah, sure.

589
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:42,509
Well, let's go, Papa.

590
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:05,115
It's gotta mean only one thing:
He's got a girl.

591
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,160
No. It's just that summer's coming.
I used to do the same thing to my dog.

592
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,371
I'm telling you,
he's got a girl!

593
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,291
All right, gentlemen-
and I use the term loosely-

594
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,002
I'll satisfy this
vulgar craving for gossip.

595
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:21,798
Yes, I expect a visitor, a lady.
The subject is now closed.

596
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,510
I was the one who said it,
but I don't believe it.

597
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,430
Look, Donald Duck, I got
just one thing to say to you.

598
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,034
When she gets here, I don't
want any whistling, sighing,

599
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:34,435
ogling or anything else
that you consider wit and humor.

600
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:38,565
In other words, behave!
Because if you don't-

601
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:41,151
Norm, old boy,
this sounds serious.

602
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:42,193
Maybe it is.

603
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,696
But what about-
You said-

604
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,906
I said what?

605
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,200
Skip it.

606
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:02,088
Hiya!

607
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,846
- Hiya.
- Hi, partner.

608
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:11,472
Where were you headed for?

609
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,474
Well, I wanted to catch you
before you came in.

610
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,976
Why?

611
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:24,611
- Come here and sit down.
- I'm not sure I will.

612
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,946
I don't think I like your tone.

613
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:29,115
If you're not gonna sit down,
I'm not gonna tell you.

614
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,617
Tell me what?

615
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,493
Come on, sit.

616
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:37,248
Well?

617
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:41,127
Well, don't get excited or anything.
Who's excited?

618
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:45,882
Okay. I think I'm getting return.
I'm starting to feel things.

619
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:48,134
I think my legs are coming back.

620
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:51,137
- Are you sure?
- I'm pretty sure.

621
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,115
That's why I came out here.

622
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,475
I didn't want to tell you
in front of the others.

623
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:58,770
- Have you told anyone?
- Weaver. He's gonna tell Brock.

624
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:04,275
Oh, Bud, that's wonderful!
I knew it! I always knew it.

625
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:10,031
Well, if I'm right, there won't be
any more of these darned spasms.

626
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,285
I've gotta be right.

627
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:25,546
# Dolores, Dolores #

628
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,299
Aren't you gonna talk
to me today, Dolores?

629
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:29,676
- Hey, Angel.
- Yeah?

630
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,011
Ask your mother
if I can marry Dolores.

631
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:40,663
She said men who love horses
don't make good husbands.

632
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:43,314
I don't love 'em. I just take
a scientific interest in 'em.

633
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:47,819
She says you're a good boy, but
then she doesn't know you like I do.

634
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:50,422
Well, tell her you're the laziest
joker in the whole ward.

635
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:52,448
- He is not! You are!
- Ah!

636
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,659
What do you know, chicken?

637
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,837
- Hiya, Pop.
- Hello, Leo. How're ya feelin'?

638
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:08,214
Okay. How's Ma?

639
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:12,218
Not so good again.
That's why she couldn't come.

640
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,848
- How are they treating you, boy?
- Can't complain.

641
00:43:21,978 --> 00:43:23,688
Here you are, Pop.

642
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,981
Thanks, boy.

643
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:26,858
I'll get a little present
for your mother.

644
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,067
Yeah, do that.

645
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:30,361
You're getting along all right,
aren't you?

646
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,740
Look, Pop, you don't
have to hang around.

647
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:36,868
Well, I got a couple
of things to do.

648
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:39,120
- I gotta see a fellow about a deal.
- Yeah.

649
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:42,332
Lay off the long shots, Pop.
You haven't got the knack.

650
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,835
Take care of yourself, boy.

651
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:49,881
Thanks. So long, Pop.

652
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,363
Did Normie tell you
about last night?

653
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:58,514
Did he tell you how he
clean fell out of his chair?

654
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,642
Oh, was he a scream!
And did I have a head this morning!

655
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:02,852
Please!

656
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,772
Anyway, that's when I got him
to promise to get rid of the muff.

657
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:06,981
What's a beard?

658
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:08,876
If I could grow dollars
as fast as I grow hair,

659
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,362
- I'd be an international banker.
- Oh, Normie, you kill me!

660
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,906
You know, some of the kids
at the drive-in thought...

661
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,032
I was goofy at first.

662
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,784
But I said, "What's the difference?

663
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:18,886
He's cute.

664
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,621
"He's real educated.
And what a sense of humor!

665
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:24,415
And that car of his
is really something.

666
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:25,917
"Yeah, it's nice.

667
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,753
My, this sure is
a big hospital, isn't it?

668
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,173
You know, Normie took me
on the 20-cent tour.

669
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:35,426
Honestly, I've got corns
on my feet from walking.

670
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:38,054
- You're not tired, are you, hon?
- No, I'm fine.

671
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:40,014
You gotta take care
of yourself, hon.

672
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:41,182
Yeah, I know.

673
00:44:41,307 --> 00:44:43,810
She watches over me
like a probationary nurse.

674
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,187
Say, what time is it anyway?

675
00:44:46,312 --> 00:44:48,564
Oh, my! I've got to get back
to the drive-in.

676
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,942
- I'd better go now, Normie.
- I'll take you to the gate.

677
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:54,445
Okeydokey. Gee, I'm glad
we got to know each other.

678
00:44:54,654 --> 00:44:55,905
We got a lot in common.

679
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:57,407
Yes, we have.

680
00:44:57,657 --> 00:44:59,927
Well, good-bye, you all.

681
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:01,953
Nice to have met you.

682
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:08,167
Laverne-
It's a pretty name.

683
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,462
Well-

684
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:29,564
Hey, what's the matter?

685
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:39,991
Hey, jughead,
what's the matter?

686
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,494
I'm sick.
Sick to my stomach.

687
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,590
See that neck?
See how rigid?

688
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:58,485
- His temperature's 103 now.
- All the classic signs.

689
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,094
Get him into a private room
right away.

690
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:01,637
Get ready for a spinal tap.

691
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,473
Call neurosurgery.

692
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:19,113
Well?

693
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:21,157
You can see for yourself.

694
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,534
Shall we try another transfusion?

695
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,286
Try-

696
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:29,499
Out of nowhere.

697
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,419
Out of a clear sky.

698
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,075
Are you sure?

699
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,826
Yes.

700
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:18,047
I liked that boy.

701
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,340
You oughta get some rest.

702
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:21,300
You have grand rounds
in exactly three hours.

703
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:23,302
Yes, I know.

704
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:50,830
He had a shell fragment
in soft tissue near his spine.

705
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:54,000
It never bothered him. There
was no point in messing with it.

706
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,753
It started to abscess, and
it breached his spinal canal.

707
00:47:58,379 --> 00:47:59,755
Meningitis.

708
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:01,340
It's nobody's fault.

709
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,885
It just happened.
We did everything.

710
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,273
- Anything new?
- No, sir.

711
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:27,658
Good morning.

712
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,161
Dr. Weaver tells me you think
you're getting return.

713
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,414
Let it go, Doc.
Some other time.

714
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:36,167
No. Pin, please.

715
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:44,300
Now, tell me what you feel-
the point or the round end.

716
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,929
Say sharp or dull.

717
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:53,309
Sharp.

718
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:57,271
Dull.

719
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:04,028
Sharp.

720
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:09,075
Sharp.

721
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,294
Sharp.

722
00:49:24,215 --> 00:49:26,217
Look here, Ken.

723
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,595
I just jabbed that pin
into your calf.

724
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,847
You didn't feel it, did you?

725
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,483
Look, Ken, the legs are gone.

726
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:44,985
Now the head has to take over.

727
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:46,737
I know what it means to you.

728
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,197
Forget it.

729
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:52,743
Before you can change the world,
you have to accept it as it really is.

730
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:54,370
Without illusions.

731
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,372
You understand that, don't you?

732
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,251
You've been doing fine.

733
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,378
Good reports from the gym.

734
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:03,587
Keep it UP-

735
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:07,383
And go out more often.
Be with people.

736
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:18,018
You remember we discussed trying
another pudendal block on Mr. Butler.

737
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:20,479
- Seems like a good idea.
- Why bother?

738
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:23,524
- There's no need for insolence.
- Oh, come now, Doctor.

739
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:26,402
Precisely.
I am the doctor here,

740
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,779
and I'm sick and tired
of this attitude of doing me...

741
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:31,282
a favor by allowing
me to keep you alive!

742
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,372
What do you men think this is,
a country club?

743
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:39,725
It's a hospital!

744
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:42,168
We're not magicians here!
We're only doctors!

745
00:50:42,293 --> 00:50:44,128
We do the best we can!

746
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,922
And you can either develop
a sense of responsibility...

747
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:49,425
or you can get out,
all of you!

748
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:12,573
# ls not just for today, dear #

749
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,202
# Love like ours #

750
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:21,332
# ls for evermore #

751
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,919
I have a table for you.
This way, please.

752
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:27,671
- We'll wait our turn, thank you.
- But I have a table, sir.

753
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,924
Just follow me.

754
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:35,071
# Like you always will be #

755
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:40,702
# Whenever your hand #

756
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:43,729
# Touches mine #

757
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,858
Just take it away.

758
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,741
Thank you.

759
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:57,743
# Men like you #

760
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:03,457
# Make my love worthwhile #

761
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,103
What did we
have to come here for?

762
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,755
Why didn't we go to the Pump
Room where people know us?

763
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,758
We can't always go
where people know us.

764
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,770
Look at them.
Look at them staring at us.

765
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:30,359
- Come on. Let's skip out of here.
- All right.

766
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,909
You better take me
back to the hospital.

767
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:41,287
I'm not very good
company tonight.

768
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,540
No, you're not,
but it's all right.

769
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,625
I know you've got
Angel on your mind.

770
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:48,878
I got him on my mind,
all right.

771
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:52,798
He was a wonderful boy,
but brooding won't help.

772
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,259
No, nothing helps.

773
00:52:56,635 --> 00:53:00,180
He was the best patient in the ward.
He worked harder than anybody.

774
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,183
He wanted a house so bad.

775
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,561
It wasn't anyone's fault, Bud.

776
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:09,440
That's right. But if he was normal,
he'd have had a chance.

777
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,276
You try and you try, and you're
still behind the eight ball.

778
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,699
Take Norm-
He's a brilliant guy.

779
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:21,785
He graduated with every
honor they had around,

780
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:25,080
and he kids himself
into thinking that cheap-

781
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:27,333
Oh, Well.

782
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,338
You've talked about
everybody but us.

783
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:36,967
I know it. I've been trying
to work up to it.

784
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:45,559
I've been kidding myself
about getting return.

785
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,228
Brock set me straight
this morning.

786
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,080
All right.
I counted on it too.

787
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,248
But it doesn't change anything.

788
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,335
Doesn't it?
I think it does for you.

789
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:14,463
If you can live with it,
it's not that important to me.

790
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:18,509
- Ellie-
- No, Bud, I won't listen.

791
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:20,487
You don't have
to play it this way, Ellie.

792
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:21,887
You've done enough for me.

793
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:24,473
Then how about doing
something for me?

794
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:27,393
You've taken up
six years of my life.

795
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:32,356
When are you gonna make
an honest woman of me?

796
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:34,650
Very funny.

797
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:37,653
Yes, isn't it?

798
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,281
You worry about
not being fair to me.

799
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,410
I wish you'd quit worrying
and start being fair.

800
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,663
All right, we've
had a disappointment.

801
00:54:47,997 --> 00:54:49,915
I say we go ahead
and set a date...

802
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,293
and get married on that date
the way other people do.

803
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,421
We're not the same
as other people.

804
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:59,675
Only in your mind.
I'm not marrying a wheelchair.

805
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,635
I'm marrying a man.

806
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:05,806
Are you going to marry me
or aren't you?

807
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:09,435
Because if you are, I've got
an awful lot of things to do.

808
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:12,497
Clothes to buy. We'll have
to get you a car you can drive.

809
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,565
We'll need a house,
furniture, dishes.

810
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,152
I've got to get home and tell my folks
and be with them a while.

811
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,698
You make it sound real-

812
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:28,328
Oh, Bud, you haven't told me you
love me in an awful long time.

813
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:33,333
I miss it. It doesn't
embarrass me to say it.

814
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,336
I love you.

815
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:51,977
Where have you been
all this time?

816
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,813
I had a date with Laverne.

817
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:58,233
The corporal's getting married.

818
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,735
Getting married.

819
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,362
Well, that's nice.

820
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,824
Did you know I've been planning
on getting married too?

821
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,372
Did I tell you I had a date
with Laverne tonight?

822
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,624
I did.

823
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,001
Only she didn't show up.

824
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:18,480
Maybe you got
your wires crossed.

825
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,507
Yeah, I got 'em
crossed, all right.

826
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:25,219
Of all people, me-
the wise guy,

827
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:27,971
the spectator
on the scene of life.

828
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:31,642
How stupid can you be
and still be alive?

829
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,269
Don't you think you're going
off half-cocked 'cause...

830
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:35,771
she didn't show up once?

831
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:40,275
Oh, a very good question!
Very good indeed.

832
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,361
I like your style, young man.

833
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,905
What's more,
I'll give you the answer.

834
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,908
You know why Vernie
didn't show up tonight?

835
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,536
Because she's in Canada.

836
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,746
Do you know how much
she took me for?

837
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:55,290
Nine hundred bucks!

838
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,253
Well, don't you
think that's kind of funny?

839
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,507
- Go to sleep, Norm.
- "Go to sleep, Norm."

840
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,554
To sleep.

841
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:11,807
"To sleep...

842
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:17,646
"and by a sleep to say we end...

843
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,940
"the heartache...

844
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,443
"and a thousand
natural shocks...

845
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,821
"that flesh is heir to,

846
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:29,199
"'tis a consummation...

847
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,827
"devoutly to be wished.

848
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:36,957
"To die, to sleep;

849
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,837
"To sleep, perchance to dream.

850
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,841
Ay, there's the rub."

851
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:51,680
That's by William Shakespeare.
A very nice man.

852
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:09,114
Well, Ellie, I wish you luck.

853
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,242
- We both do, of course.
- Oh, yes, dear.

854
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:15,996
You don't sound very happy
about it, either of you.

855
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,624
You don't like the idea, do you?

856
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:21,210
- We haven't said so.
- No. But it's pretty obvious.

857
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,754
Even if that's true,
it's not important.

858
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,882
It's your life, El.
You're not a baby anymore.

859
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:29,134
No, I'm not a baby.

860
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:30,844
It's My Life.

861
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,223
But I'm disappointed in you,
both of you.

862
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:37,643
You're taking it like just anyone
would, as if you didn't understand.

863
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:39,871
You think I'm a silly young girl...

864
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:42,731
who doesn't know the difference
between pity and love.

865
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,900
You could at least
be honest about it.

866
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,528
If honesty is what you want,
I think you're making a big mistake.

867
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:51,156
Is that what you think too?

868
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:59,289
What you mean is, that I ought to be
very cold and practical about this.

869
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,917
That even though Bud
and I love each other,

870
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,127
I ought to break it off
and find a-

871
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:08,423
That's one way of putting it,
not necessarily the fair way.

872
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:10,902
Look, Ellie.
I like Bud.

873
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:13,553
I like him a lot.
I always have.

874
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,931
I'd be proud to have him for a son.

875
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:17,766
I mean that.

876
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:21,061
But the point is,
things are different now.

877
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:24,189
Yes, I know,
through no fault of his.

878
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,400
But he's different too.

879
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,194
He's not the same man.

880
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,446
To me, he is!

881
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:34,700
I love him!
You love him.

882
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:36,827
Love can be very fragile, El.

883
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:40,706
Even healthy people can't always hold
on to it or take it for granted.

884
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:43,709
I'm telling you this for his good
as well as yours.

885
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,919
How long do you think
that love is going to last...

886
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,963
after you realize
you've signed a contract...

887
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,590
to be his nurse
the rest of your life?

888
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:53,552
It won't work.
You're a young, healthy girl.

889
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:56,722
It doesn't have to be that way.
There's hope.

890
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,725
So, you're going
to live on hope.

891
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,729
Oh, I'm not blaming you.
I know you love him.

892
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:07,065
I'd probably be ashamed of you
if you felt any other way.

893
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,944
But actually I blame Bud.
Yes, I do!

894
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:13,488
He knows the score
better than any of us.

895
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,741
He ought to let you go.

896
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,328
If he loved you
as much as you love him,

897
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,955
he'd make you go.

898
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:25,834
You're being so clever,
so logical.

899
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:29,254
I never knew you could
handle words so well.

900
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,340
That's not an answer, El.

901
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,759
You weren't quite so logical
a few years ago,

902
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:36,261
when we needed some boys to
go out and get killed...

903
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,388
- or paralyzed!
- That's enough, Ellie.

904
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:41,141
I can't let you talk
to your father like that.

905
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:44,770
It's not fair, because
he's not cold or selfish.

906
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:46,730
He's done more
for army boys in trouble-

907
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:47,749
Harriet, please.

908
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,500
- Well, you have!
- That's not the point.

909
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,903
I don't care. I can't allow Ellie
to talk to you like that.

910
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:58,408
Ellie, I haven't said anything
because it's so hard.

911
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:01,495
But you're all we have.

912
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:06,917
Baby, is it so wrong for us
to want a grandchild?

913
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:13,799
I'm going to marry Bud.

914
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:21,640
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I just don't know.

915
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:23,809
Well, why don't you know?

916
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,811
You're his doctor.
Who else is there?

917
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:27,187
We're still learning.

918
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,022
I've told you that before.

919
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:31,691
Would you like to see
our research in fertility?

920
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,443
I'd save your time.

921
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,822
Some paraplegics are capable
of having children, others aren't.

922
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:39,825
We don't always know why.
In Ken's case-

923
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,952
In his case?

924
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:47,332
It isn't very probable, but it is
within the realm of possibility.

925
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,835
I don't think-

926
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:53,213
I'd rather say,
"I don't know."

927
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:59,594
It's pretty late in the day
for this sort of thing.

928
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:02,931
No it isn't.

929
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:05,851
Because it really doesn't matter.

930
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:07,978
Thank you, Doctor.

931
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,855
Good-bye.

932
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:20,490
What are you tryin' to do,
walk outta here?

933
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,075
Yeah.

934
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,995
And I'm going to be
married standing up.

935
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,509
"Do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

936
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:46,886
"to have and to hold
from this day forward,

937
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,389
"for better, for worse,

938
01:04:49,514 --> 01:04:51,516
for richer, for poorer-".

939
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:53,476
You sure you want
to go through with this?

940
01:04:53,518 --> 01:04:54,519
Come on!

941
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:34,267
Dearly Beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God...

942
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,436
and in the presence
of this company...

943
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,315
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony,

944
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:43,419
an honorable estate,
and therefore...

945
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:46,196
not to be entered into
unadvisedly or lightly.

946
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,950
Into this holy estate come now
these two persons present...

947
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,535
to be joined together.

948
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:55,080
If any man
can show just cause...

949
01:05:55,705 --> 01:05:57,683
why they may not
be joined together,

950
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:02,462
let him speak now or else,
hereafter, forever hold his peace.

951
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:06,549
The bride and groom
will join hands.

952
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:47,757
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's nice.

953
01:06:51,636 --> 01:06:56,641
I'm not completely happy with the
drapes, but the material's good.

954
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:05,525
- Do you like the lamps?
- Sure.

955
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:07,777
Yep.

956
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:11,239
I got the biggest
ashtrays I could find.

957
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,159
I hate those little things
that are always tipping ov-

958
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,753
I gotta oil these darn
wheels tomorrow.

959
01:07:25,044 --> 01:07:26,421
Yes.

960
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:31,301
Well, what have we got,
a family album already?

961
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,638
They say no home's complete
without one.

962
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,183
BOY-

963
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:46,691
Hey-Hey, Why'd you
put these in here for?

964
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:50,195
Mm, those are all those pictures
I've had for years, I thought-

965
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:52,655
Iím sorry. It was stupid.
I didn't think-

966
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,049
No, that's all right.

967
01:07:54,073 --> 01:07:56,951
- I'll take them out tomorrow.
- It's all right!

968
01:07:58,536 --> 01:07:59,829
I mean, forget it, honey.

969
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:03,082
It doesn't bother me.
I was just surprised, that's all.

970
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:08,296
Leo sent us a bottle of champagne.
Shall we open it now?

971
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:11,424
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- I'll get it.

972
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,198
- Get the glasses.
- Yes, I know.

973
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:56,946
It's such a big bottle.
We'll never finish it.

974
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,305
Maybe we should call Leo.

975
01:08:59,597 --> 01:09:02,600
Yeah, he probably had that in mind.

976
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:06,479
I don't know how they expect
you to open these things.

977
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:10,191
Darn wires go every which way.
Let me have it.

978
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,865
My Carpet!

979
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:19,826
Oh. I hope it won't stain.

980
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:21,870
I heard somewhere that
cold water would.

981
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,504
What's the matter?

982
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:33,756
Nothing. I'll get some water.

983
01:09:36,342 --> 01:09:39,596
What are you lookin' at?
You've seen this before.

984
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:41,973
I'm sorry.

985
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:46,644
I don't like the way
you're lookin' at me, Ellie.

986
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:48,646
I said I was sorry!

987
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:52,025
Yeah, I know, but what
are you sorry for?

988
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:54,777
I don't know.

989
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:57,989
Stop putting me on trial!

990
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,408
You pick at me so I can't think!

991
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:04,162
Wait a minute.
What are you thinking?

992
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:07,665
Are you thinkin' you made
a mistake, is that it?

993
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:10,793
You're sorry, aren't you?

994
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:13,671
You're sorry, aren't ya?

995
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:16,007
What do you want me to say?

996
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:18,301
All right, I am!

997
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:27,060
Why did ya have to wait
till we were married?

998
01:11:03,346 --> 01:11:06,349
They come out slowly,
both boys feeling the pace.

999
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:10,436
It's been a very fast fight so far.
Very even as far as I can see.

1000
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:13,106
Matt comes in fast now
with a left to the head.

1001
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:15,692
Glances off.
Didn't do very much damage.

1002
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,612
Jenkins jabs with the left
and brings over a right cross.

1003
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:23,116
And a fast left and right by Jenkins.
I think Pyle was hurt.

1004
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:26,494
He's holding on now.
Jenkins is trying to measure him.

1005
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:28,472
Pyle throws a left that
goes wild of the mark,

1006
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:30,248
but he scores with a right
under the heart.

1007
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:32,834
Well, what are you lookin' at?

1008
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:59,402
It kinda depends on what you
like best-people, the horses.

1009
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:01,237
With me, it's horses.

1010
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:03,990
Someday I'm gonna have
a whole stable full of 'em.

1011
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,868
You boys are vets,
I take it.

1012
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:11,247
No, we're just up from Atlantic City,
and we brought our chairs along.

1013
01:12:11,622 --> 01:12:13,875
No, you're not! Hey!

1014
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,252
That's a great little sense
of humor you got there.

1015
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:19,881
You know, that's a great characteristic
of the American soldier-

1016
01:12:20,173 --> 01:12:22,175
God bless 'em-
is a sense of humor.

1017
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:25,303
I'm a vet myself.
The other war, of course.

1018
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:26,905
What other war?

1019
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:30,683
- You know, the first one, 1918.
- Oh, the big one.

1020
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:33,895
Well-

1021
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:36,189
You're quite a kidder, aren't ya?

1022
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:39,067
But seriously, boys,
I wanna tell ya somethin'.

1023
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:42,070
I admire ya.
I admire the both of you.

1024
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,697
Boys like you, after what
you've been through,

1025
01:12:44,947 --> 01:12:47,051
I say the best
is none too good for you.

1026
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,677
- Is that what you say?
- Yes, sir.

1027
01:12:48,701 --> 01:12:51,079
- That's what he says.
- You say it all the time?

1028
01:12:51,829 --> 01:12:53,206
Well, sure!

1029
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:54,707
God bless you, mister.

1030
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,293
Oh, I mean it. You boys
have made a great sacrifice.

1031
01:12:57,335 --> 01:12:58,961
Tell me somethin'.

1032
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:02,423
Uh, could I marry your daughter?

1033
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,300
I haven't got a daughter.

1034
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:06,219
Well, then, could I marry her?

1035
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:09,097
All right. Keep her.
Who wants the old crow.

1036
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,601
Okay, boys.
I can take a hint.

1037
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:16,979
These days, every punk that got run
over in a blackout's a big hero.

1038
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:18,731
But that's okay.

1039
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:20,691
No hard feelin's. Here.

1040
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:24,237
Buy yourselves a drink.

1041
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,115
Hey, buddy.

1042
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:30,368
Buddy, come here a minute,
will ya?

1043
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:37,750
Look, uh, I want
to apologize to you.

1044
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:44,882
Hey, what's the matter, boys?

1045
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:46,509
Okay, we're leavin'.
We're leavin'.

1046
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:48,344
Come on, slugger.

1047
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:04,026
Hey, champ, come in
for a landing, will ya?

1048
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:06,863
- What's the matter, you worried?
- Me?

1049
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:10,032
No, I just bruise easy,
that's all.

1050
01:14:13,494 --> 01:14:15,496
Hey! Look out!

1051
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,424
Congratulations.

1052
01:14:27,633 --> 01:14:30,803
Very nice for the hospital,
of course - wonderful publicity.

1053
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:33,556
I know. I don't like it
any more than you do.

1054
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:35,409
Look, Gene. It isn't
a matter of liking it.

1055
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,911
I'm the one who's gonna have
Washington breathing down his neck.

1056
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:39,770
I know.
How am I going to explain it?

1057
01:14:39,937 --> 01:14:42,166
Here's a man that's been nothing
but trouble since he's been back.

1058
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,025
Consequently, he's restricted
to the post.

1059
01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:46,569
He sneaks out,
gets fighting drunk and-

1060
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:49,447
Question: What kind of
a hospital am I running here?

1061
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:51,532
It isn't very pleasant for you.

1062
01:14:51,657 --> 01:14:53,326
What is he doing here anyway?

1063
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:55,286
He's married, isn't he?
He's got a home.

1064
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:57,955
He isn't sick.
He's had maximum physical benefits.

1065
01:14:58,206 --> 01:15:01,417
Medically, yes. Psychologically,
he could use some help.

1066
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,586
Gene, let's be realistic.

1067
01:15:03,794 --> 01:15:06,589
How many normal people
are there in the world?

1068
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:08,591
I want you to discharge him.

1069
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:11,219
I can't do that,
Dr. Kameran.

1070
01:15:11,552 --> 01:15:13,554
What do you mean,
you can't do that?

1071
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,057
He's going up before the P.V.A.
disciplinary board.

1072
01:15:16,098 --> 01:15:18,351
- I don't intend to intervene.
- That's nonsense.

1073
01:15:18,434 --> 01:15:20,954
This has nothing to do with the
Paralyzed Veterans Association.

1074
01:15:20,978 --> 01:15:23,356
- This is a hospital matter.
- I don't quite agree with you.

1075
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:24,958
Oh, Gene, let's be sensible.

1076
01:15:24,982 --> 01:15:26,734
You've done wonderful work
with those men.

1077
01:15:26,817 --> 01:15:29,487
But he's one of them. They'll be
easy with him, you know that.

1078
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,614
I can't agree with that either.

1079
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,575
This is too important to let
the men decide for themselves.

1080
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:37,095
Doctor, you admit that
they've done a good job,

1081
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:39,121
that they've been
practically self-governing.

1082
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,831
And just because it is important,

1083
01:15:40,873 --> 01:15:43,334
I can't very well take it
out of their hands.

1084
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:46,504
Just as I can't go over their
heads whatever they decide.

1085
01:15:46,712 --> 01:15:48,839
You see that, don't you?

1086
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:52,718
This thing gets out of hand,
I may not be able to protect you.

1087
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:56,138
I hope you're prepared
to take the consequences.

1088
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:58,099
I am.

1089
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:01,495
So I said to her, "Hey, Robbie,

1090
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:03,121
when are you going
to marry Brock?"

1091
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:04,248
And she hits me.

1092
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:06,399
Boy, did she give me a crack.
Gin.

1093
01:16:09,777 --> 01:16:11,028
Twenty-six.

1094
01:16:11,153 --> 01:16:13,531
He can't play the game.
He just talks ya out of it.

1095
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,908
- That's game.
- Next player.

1096
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,792
Hello.

1097
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:27,503
Hi. I thought
you went home.

1098
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:30,798
No, I've been around.

1099
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:32,925
L-I read about you in the paper.

1100
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:34,885
I thought maybe you
were hurt or something.

1101
01:16:34,927 --> 01:16:36,804
No, I'm all right.

1102
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,393
- I'd like to talk to you, Bud.
- Okay.

1103
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:46,439
No, stick around.
Ellie and I don't have any secrets.

1104
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:48,399
What's on your mind, El?

1105
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:53,279
- All right, Bud.
- We'd better be going, huh?

1106
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,697
Stay!

1107
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:58,159
These are my friends, Ellie.
They know all about us.

1108
01:16:59,452 --> 01:17:02,079
I came here to tell you
I'm sorry.

1109
01:17:02,955 --> 01:17:05,708
You see, at first,
I was very sure of myself.

1110
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:08,419
Then I started getting
confused and afraid and...

1111
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:10,421
that night the way everything-
Forget it!

1112
01:17:10,588 --> 01:17:13,799
- It doesn't matter anymore.
- But it does matter, Bud.

1113
01:17:14,842 --> 01:17:18,846
I've had a chance to see things
the way they really are.

1114
01:17:19,347 --> 01:17:22,350
The important thing is to know
what you're willing to settle for,

1115
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,685
to be really sure.

1116
01:17:25,353 --> 01:17:27,813
I'm sure now.

1117
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:31,484
I want you.
I want you to come home.

1118
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,821
I'm home. This is my home.
This is where I belong.

1119
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:38,949
Oh, please!
You go home!

1120
01:17:39,241 --> 01:17:40,427
Go far away from me.

1121
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:43,579
Pretend it never happened,
and we'll both be better off.

1122
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,711
Let's go to chow.
And don't feel bad.

1123
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:53,881
You won't even have any scars.

1124
01:17:59,887 --> 01:18:02,598
Well, we can restrict him
to the hospital for 60 days,

1125
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,600
or we can vote for discharge.

1126
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:05,744
It's up to us.

1127
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,978
What I hear is, this guy's
been trouble right along.

1128
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:10,481
- I say kick him out!
- For what? For being AWOL?

1129
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,125
Sixty days' restriction is plenty.

1130
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:14,086
We're not responsible for
what the guy does outside.

1131
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:15,837
- That's what I say!
- Suppose he kills someone?

1132
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,863
- But he didn't.
- Look. That's up to the cops.

1133
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,591
They didn't put him
in jail and we can't.

1134
01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:21,534
We can only try him
for breaking hospital rules.

1135
01:18:21,617 --> 01:18:24,036
For being AWOL-that's all
we know about officially.

1136
01:18:24,161 --> 01:18:26,789
- "Officially," my eye!
- We're not the police department.

1137
01:18:27,289 --> 01:18:30,292
Listen. The cops brought him in here
so the hospital could handle it.

1138
01:18:30,418 --> 01:18:32,920
And that means us. Otherwise,
he'd be in jail right now.

1139
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,731
- So, he's lucky!
- All right, he's lucky!

1140
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:36,650
But we're supposed
to be a disciplinary board!

1141
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:39,885
And I know if we go easy on him,
we're not kidding anybody but ourselves!

1142
01:18:40,052 --> 01:18:43,556
Listen. People always
remember these wheelchairs.

1143
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:46,183
Don't ever forget that.

1144
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:48,519
Guys like him just make it
tough on the rest of us.

1145
01:18:48,644 --> 01:18:51,039
What's he doing here anyway?
He's well, isn't he?

1146
01:18:51,063 --> 01:18:51,916
He's married.

1147
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,150
He's got himself a home.
Why isn't he living in it?

1148
01:18:54,316 --> 01:18:56,318
- Maybe he's had trouble.
- Let him patch it up.

1149
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,329
Anybody that's married
is gonna have trouble.

1150
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:00,086
- You know, huh?
- You can say that again.

1151
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:03,284
But if he's got things on his mind, are
we gonna help him by kicking him out?

1152
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:06,078
You're not helping him
by being easy on him.

1153
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:08,914
He'll make more trouble for
himself and everybody else.

1154
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,083
I still think 60 days
is tough enough.

1155
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,585
Well-

1156
01:19:13,294 --> 01:19:15,045
Let's vote on it.

1157
01:19:15,421 --> 01:19:18,424
All in favor of discharge,
raise your hands.

1158
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:22,928
All against?

1159
01:19:24,722 --> 01:19:25,973
Norm?

1160
01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:28,434
Discharge.

1161
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,853
You voted to kick me out?

1162
01:19:31,103 --> 01:19:33,230
Well, you're a nice bunch of fellas.

1163
01:19:33,355 --> 01:19:36,066
Who do you think you are?
What makes you think you can do it?

1164
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:39,212
This is a veteran's hospital,
and you're nobody, you're nothin'.

1165
01:19:39,236 --> 01:19:40,213
You see?

1166
01:19:40,237 --> 01:19:42,490
And we'll just see what
Brock has to say about it.

1167
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,376
Ken!

1168
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:00,382
Before you go in there,
I want you to know something.

1169
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:02,468
I want you to know
I voted for discharge.

1170
01:20:03,135 --> 01:20:04,011
Thanks.

1171
01:20:04,094 --> 01:20:06,639
- I want you to know why.
- Don't bother, friend.

1172
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:12,895
Thank you.
Thank you for calling.

1173
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:17,858
- Well, they kicked me out.
- Yes, I know.

1174
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:22,154
- Well-Well, that's crazy, isn't it?
- Do you think so?

1175
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:26,534
What's the matter with everybody around
here? What do you mean do I think so?

1176
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:29,513
Listen. You're my doctor,
and you're gonna keep me here.

1177
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:31,539
I'm not going to overrule
the board.

1178
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:35,376
Oh, I get it. It's easier
for you that way, isn't it?

1179
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:37,795
Yes.
But it's better for you.

1180
01:20:37,878 --> 01:20:39,004
You're well, Ken.

1181
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,382
Wh-What am I gonna do?
Where am I gonna go?

1182
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:46,136
- Into the world.
- I can't go out there anymore.

1183
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:51,016
- You still can't accept it, can you?
- No.

1184
01:20:51,517 --> 01:20:54,311
What did I do?
Why'd it have to be me?

1185
01:20:54,436 --> 01:20:56,438
Is there an answer?
I haven't got it.

1186
01:20:56,689 --> 01:20:58,649
Somebody always gets hurt
in a war.

1187
01:21:00,067 --> 01:21:03,571
Look, Ken. You're a married man.
You've got a home.

1188
01:21:03,696 --> 01:21:06,657
- That's where you ought to be.
- I haven't got anything.

1189
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:09,326
What happened?
Why did you run away?

1190
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,953
Nothin' happened.

1191
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,790
She couldn't take it,
that's why.

1192
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,959
Sh-She looked at me
like I was a bug.

1193
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,464
You want what everyone wants-
peace of mind.

1194
01:21:22,798 --> 01:21:26,218
It's pretty hard sometimes
to accept the truth instead,

1195
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:29,346
even though that's where
real peace of mind lies.

1196
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:31,932
And the truth is
that you are what you are.

1197
01:21:32,099 --> 01:21:35,811
The truth is that your wife is
a human being with all the weakness...

1198
01:21:36,103 --> 01:21:38,188
and all the strength
that human beings have.

1199
01:21:38,355 --> 01:21:41,233
- Yeah, it's easy for you to talk.
- Oh, yes. I know.

1200
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:42,735
It's easy for me to talk.

1201
01:21:42,943 --> 01:21:45,487
I know, I can walk outta here
when the day is over,

1202
01:21:45,571 --> 01:21:47,990
and I've got a good job.

1203
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:51,118
Only I can never see a patient
walk outta here, never.

1204
01:21:51,577 --> 01:21:55,706
I can keep a man alive, but,
in his heart, he feels I've failed him.

1205
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:58,626
You feel that way, don't you?

1206
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,588
Took me a long time
to get used to that.

1207
01:22:03,839 --> 01:22:05,633
Peace of mind.

1208
01:22:05,841 --> 01:22:07,718
Why didn't she leave me
alone in the beginning?

1209
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,521
Why'd she have to come around here
and make me think we could make it?

1210
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,848
Suppose it were
just the opposite.

1211
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:15,392
Suppose you were on your feet,
and she were in the chair.

1212
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:18,270
Would you have come around?

1213
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:21,899
- Well, I don't know.
- Shall I tell you something?

1214
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:24,360
I was married once.

1215
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,779
On our third anniversary,

1216
01:22:27,404 --> 01:22:29,990
we-
we were in an accident.

1217
01:22:30,532 --> 01:22:33,494
Paraplegia was a new field then.

1218
01:22:33,786 --> 01:22:36,121
At least, she didn't
have to suffer too long.

1219
01:22:38,415 --> 01:22:40,417
That was 18 years ago.

1220
01:22:41,543 --> 01:22:43,796
And I'd give anything
I've got to know...

1221
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:47,424
that when I go home that I'd
find her there waiting for me...

1222
01:22:47,925 --> 01:22:49,802
in a wheelchair.

1223
01:22:54,431 --> 01:22:56,141
I'm due at a meeting.

1224
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:59,770
I think you ought to go back
to your wife, Ken,

1225
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:01,915
if she'll take you.

1226
01:23:01,939 --> 01:23:04,650
I can't guarantee that she won't
ever look at you like that again.

1227
01:23:04,692 --> 01:23:07,045
But, if she loves you,
and if you behave,

1228
01:23:07,069 --> 01:23:09,196
the chances are she won't.

1229
01:23:09,655 --> 01:23:12,533
Anyway, you've got a lot
of living ahead of you.

1230
01:23:12,574 --> 01:23:15,953
And nobody can do it
for you but you.

1231
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,794
Ellie.

1232
01:25:27,584 --> 01:25:29,586
Hello, Ellie.

1233
01:25:30,295 --> 01:25:33,966
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

1234
01:25:35,592 --> 01:25:39,346
- Had a flat tire. Fixed it myself.
- Good for you.

1235
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:44,726
- Are you doin' anything tonight?
- No.

1236
01:25:47,604 --> 01:25:51,108
Would you like to go to a movie
or something or... talk?

1237
01:25:52,609 --> 01:25:54,486
Yes, I would.

1238
01:25:57,614 --> 01:26:00,325
Do you want me to help you
off the steps?

1239
01:26:01,493 --> 01:26:03,078
Please.

1240
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:32,774
# Love like ours is not just
for today, dear #

1241
01:26:32,983 --> 01:26:37,988
# Love like ours is for evermore #
