Let us suppose that your story
proves to be false on its face.

167
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,988
This story's true.
If papers printed nothing but truth,

168
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,575
they'd never employ attorneys,
and I should be out of work.

I'm not interested
in the facts.

171
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,748
The question is not whether
your story is true,

172
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:57,085
the question is: What protection
do we have if it proves to be false?

173
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,005
Now, then, Mr. Gallagher
is not a public official,

174
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,425

Is he a public figure?
He's not going to sue, for God's sake.

176
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,433
So, what does it take
to make him a public figure?

They never tell us till it's too late.

If he talks to us,
we'll include his denials,

If he declines,
we can hardly be responsible

for errors
which he refuses to correct.

of your story is irrelevant.

the story is false, therefore,
we're absent malice.

Michael Gallagher is innocent.

Michael's girlfriend.

he's innocent.

No, I know he's innocent.

Well, because I was
with him at the time.

1183
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:44,702
Well, now, let the record show
that I'm James J. Wells,

1184
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,289
assistant attorney general
for the Organized Crime Division

1185
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:52,042
of the United States
Department of Justice.
With me here are...

1186
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,838
Hell, Angie, you know
who these folks are,
just write them in.

1187
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:58,215
I've had no conversation
with anyone here

1188
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,592
prior to the beginning
of this record.

1189
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,430
I'd like to inform all present
they have the right to remain silent

1190
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,515
and the right to retain counsel.

1191
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:11,395
I inform them further that
anything they say during
the course of this... Uh... Uh...

1192
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,355
What the hell is this?

1193
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:17,318
- This inquiry may be taken down
and used against them.

1194
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,069
Anybody here
want a lawyer?

1195
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,238
No.
No.

1196
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,408
Ms. Carter,
you brought your own.

1197
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:27,077
Mr. Gallagher,
do you want a lawyer, sir?

1198
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:28,412
No.
WELLS: Good.

1199
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,749
No more room in here anyway.
Anybody wanna read the paper?

1200
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,756
You got a story in here that says,
"Strike force investigating a DA,

1201
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,090
suspecting bribes."

1202
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,887
It's the damnedest story
you ever read.

1203
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,848
Nobody in this department
ever read a story like that.

1204
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,100
Tell you what we're gonna do.

1205
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,895
We're gonna sit right here
and talk about it.

1206
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,316
Now, if you get tired of talking here,
Mr. Marshall Elving Patrick

1207
01:34:57,484 --> 01:35:00,277
will hand you
one of them subpoenas he's got

1208
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,946
and we'll go talk
in front of the grand jury.

1209
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,574
We'll talk all day if you want to.

1210
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:11,705
But come sundown, there's gonna be
two things true that ain't true now.

1211
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:15,709
One is that the United States
Department of Justice

1212
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:18,253
is gonna know
what in the good Christ...

1213
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:21,465
Excuse me, Angie.
- Is going on around here.

1214
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:27,471
And the other is I'm gonna have
somebody's ass in my briefcase.

1215
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:30,391
Elliott?

1216
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:34,395
Jim?

1217
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:39,983
Fine. All right, Elving,
hand whichever of these fellas
you like a subpoena.

1218
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,486
We'll go and talk
in front of the grand jury.

1219
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,156
Gallagher's a government witness.
A wonderful thing, subpoena.

1220
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,617
He's working on Diaz,
reporting to me.

1221
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,578
Your arrangements include
campaign contributions?

1222
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,790
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about $9000.

1223
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,835
Cashier's checks. It's all in the file.
What file?

1224
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,712
This file.
Rosen's investigation file.

1225
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,590
You can't have an investigation
without a file, Jim.

1226
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,634
Let me see.
I'll save you looking.

1227
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:09,012
It says you met with Gallagher
and didn't report it.

1228
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,058
It says Gallagher gave money to
some committee thinks you're pretty.

1229
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,270
I got phone taps, not legal,
mind you.

1230
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:19,940
I got phone taps of you talking
on Gallagher's answering machine.

1231
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,859
You son of a bitch.

1232
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,278
WELLS:
He don't think much
of your investigation.

1233
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,364
Jim, why didn't you report
that meeting?

1234
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:30,659
That was Gallagher.
Those were his rules.

1235
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,036
He said he wanted
to deal only with me.

1236
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,789
We had had a leak.
WELLS: You'd had a leak?

1237
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:39,710
You call what's going on
around here a leak?

1238
01:36:40,462 --> 01:36:44,339
Boy, the last time
there was a leak like this,
Noah built himself a boat.

1239
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:48,177
But look, I don't know anything
about any cashier's checks.

1240
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,598
Now, Gallagher said that he would
listen for us if we quit hassling him.

1241
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,975
He wanted a public statement.
He got it.

1242
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:03,233
Robert, where'd you get
the authority to run those taps?

1243
01:37:04,194 --> 01:37:06,236
No place. I just did it.

1244
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,823
You wanna tell me why you'd go
and do a fool thing like that?

1245
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:14,912
You see, we had reason to believe...
He was acting on my instructions.

1246
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,498
WELLS:
He don't get paid
to act on your instructions.

1247
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:21,043
He gets paid to abide by
and to enforce the law.

1248
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:28,509
Elliott, how come
you're investigating the DA
without telling the department?

1249
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,094
It was preliminary.
We had cause but no case.

1250
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,223
Do you think you have
a case now?

1251
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,099
Think so.
Make it.

1252
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,770
Here? In front of them?

1253
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:43,106
WELLS:
Do you know something
that ain't all over the newspapers?

1254
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:47,110
Go ahead and make your case.
It'll be good practice for you.

1255
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:04,127
Mr. Gallagher, you know Mr. Quinn?
Yeah.

1256
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:05,754
ROSEN:
How do you know him?

1257
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:10,133
He asked me if I would help him
find out what happened to Joey Diaz.

1258
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:16,640
I show you photostats
of two cashier's checks

1259
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,976
drawn on
the Flagship National Bank,

1260
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,979
made payable to the
Committee for a Better Miami.

1261
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:24,898
Have you seen them before?

1262
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,401
Yeah, they're mine.

1263
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,822
For what purpose
did you make these checks?

1264
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:34,992
To contribute
to the committee.

1265
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,620
Well, why was that?
Because they do good work.

1266
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:45,419
You aware the committee
is interested in the political
career of Mr. Quinn?

1267
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:47,671
So?
That's okay with me.

1268
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,392
Let me point out
that these checks were drawn

1269
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,646
immediately before
and immediately after
your meeting with Mr. Quinn.

1270
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:06,148
What do you make of that?

1271
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:08,483
What do you make of it?
Come on, now.

1272
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:12,070
You're trying to say
that you just got
an urge to contribute

1273
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,033
to his committee
before you met him, then
you got another urge after?

1274
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,328
Yeah. I came into
some extra money
a couple days later.

1275
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:23,457
All right.
You made these contributions
anonymously. Why?

1276
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:27,294
I wanted them to be anonymous.
ROSEN: I'll bet. Tell us why.

1277
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:30,213
I didn't want other people
asking for contributions.

1278
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:33,634
The reason is
that you were paying off.

1279
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,302
Prove it.

1280
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:41,391
Mr. Gallagher,

1281
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:45,812
if you in fact told Mr. Quinn
that you would act as
a government informant...

1282
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,733
No, wait a minute.
I said that I'd see
what I could find out.

1283
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:52,486
ROSEN: What are you finding out?
Nothing.

1284
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,237
Nobody wants to talk about it.

1285
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,115
You son of a bitch.
You're trying to frame me.

1286
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,202
He set me up.
He arranged the meetings.

1287
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:02,663
He is the one who got me
on his machine.

1288
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,707
He's got the cancelled checks.
He's trying to frame me!

1289
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,377
What's his motive?
To get even, you dummy!

1290
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:11,922
You guys ought to get married.

1291
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,682
Mr. Gallagher, are you that smart?

1292
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:24,267
QUINN:
You're damn right he is.

1293
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,152
Ms. Carter,

1294
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:37,572
you seem to know a lot
about what's going on.

1295
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,325
I'd like to ask you
where these stories came from.

1296
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,077
Objection.
My client is not...

1297
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:45,539
You save your objections, counselor.
This ain't a courtroom.

1298
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:51,712
Now, Ms. Carter, this story
about Mr. Gallagher, the first one.

1299
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:56,800
I had reason to believe
the strike force was
investigating Mr. Gallagher.

1300
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,928
I confirmed it. I wrote the story.
WELLS: How did you confirm?

1301
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:03,306
Objection. You are asking...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1302
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:07,602
I wanna answer this.

1303
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,647
I read the file.
WELLS: Did you, now?

1304
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:14,443
How did you come
to read the file?

1305
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:20,073
I was talking with Mr. Rosen.
It was lying on his desk.

1306
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,117
When he left his office,
I read it.

1307
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:26,079
Did you ask Mr. Rosen what
in the name of Christ he was doing

1308
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,999
leaving the file on his desk
for you to read it?

1309
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,793
He intended me to read it.
WELLS: Why would that be?

1310
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:36,006
So I would write a story
that made Mr. Gallagher look bad.

1311
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,345
This story.

1312
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:45,182
Did Mr. Rosen give you
that one too?

1313
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,854
No.

1314
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,523
Go ahead, Ms. Carter.

1315
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:56,985
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

1316
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:03,700
I think I know
where we're headed here.

1317
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,704
Before we get there,
I wanna say something to you.

1318
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:13,710
You know and I know
that we can't tell you
what to print or what not to.

1319
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,463
We hope people in the press
will act responsibly.

1320
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,674
When you don't, there ain't a lot
anybody can do about it.

1321
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:24,513
But we can't have people go around
leaking stuff for their own reasons.

1322
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,389
It ain't legal.

1323
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:29,518
And worse than that,
by God, it ain't right.

1324
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:32,521
I can't stop you,
but I can damn well stop them.

1325
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,815
I wanna know
where them stories come from.

1326
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:38,401
Under the First Amendment,
my client is not required to reveal...

1327
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,986
That's all horsepucky.

1328
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,865
The First Amendment don't say that,
and the privilege don't exist.

1329
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,952
Now, do you understand
I can ask you these questions

1330
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,704
in front of a grand jury?
Yes.

1331
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:52,958
And if you don't answer,
you can go to jail?

1332
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,710
I know it's possible, yes.

1333
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,256
Oh, it's more than possible,
Ms. Carter, it's damned likely.

1334
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,384
I ain't anxious
to be locking up reporters.

1335
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,887
But I'm gonna tell you something.
I don't like what's going on.

1336
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:09,099
May I say something, please?
Yes.

1337
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,727
I don't wanna go to jail,

1338
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:17,107
but this has got to stop
someplace.

1339
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,986
A lot of damage has been done.

1340
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:24,739
I'm responsible for a lot of it.
I know that.

1341
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,787
I don't know. I keep thinking
there must be some rules

1342
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:34,291
to tell me
what I'm supposed to do now.

1343
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,378
But maybe not.

1344
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,675
The person who told me

1345
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:47,429
about the investigation of Mr. Quinn,
they were not leaking it.

1346
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:51,016
They did not intend
for it to be printed.
I did that on my own.

1347
01:43:51,851 --> 01:43:55,478
I'm scared to death of going to jail,
but if I tell you who it was,

1348
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:59,357
you'll have to do something about it,
and someone else will be hurt.

1349
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:02,819
So it's really very simple.
I can hurt someone

1350
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,946
or not hurt someone.

1351
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:06,907
No rules.

1352
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:08,992
Just...

1353
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,620
me.

1354
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:18,293
I can't tell you.

1355
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:29,763
Mr. Gallagher.

1356
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:38,313
I seem to wanna ask
if you set all this up.

1357
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:42,692
If I do, you ain't gonna tell me,
are you?

1358
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:45,612
No.

1359
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:50,700
I'll tell you something.
You're a smart fellow.

1360
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,788
Don't get too smart.

1361
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:56,623
I'm pretty smart myself.

1362
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:02,045
Everybody in the room is smart.

1363
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,632
And everybody's
just doing their job.

1364
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,844
And Teresa Perrone's dead.

1365
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,975
Who do I see about that?

1366
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,312
Ain't nobody to see.

1367
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,150
I wish there was.

1368
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,904
You're excused now, sir.

1369
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:41,167
Ms. Carter, you can go too.

1370
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:45,922
Later today I'll have
a statement for the media.

1371
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,258
You ain't gonna like it.

1372
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:53,596
It's gonna say Mr. Quinn here
may not be the smartest DA
we've ever had,

1373
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,808
but there's no evidence
suspecting him of anything.

1374
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:00,228
And it's gonna say you were
suckered by Mr. Rosen here

1375
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,356
who has some peculiar ideas
on how to do his job.

1376
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:07,777
It's gonna say it was premature
and real wrong

1377
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,615
that these investigations
ever got reported in the first place.

1378
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:18,455
You don't have to print it, of course,
but it's gonna wind up in the paper.

1379
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:24,461
Angeline,
you and Elving go on ahead.

1380
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:28,006
Robert, you can go too.
I'll be along in a minute.

1381
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:41,311
Jim, you're in a bad place,
boy.

1382
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:47,150
I could talk myself blue
clearing you, but wouldn't
nobody believe me.

1383
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,656
You got a hell of
a publicity problem.

1384
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:57,869
I could sue.
Who?

1385
01:46:58,079 --> 01:46:59,996
You can't win.

1386
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:02,290
Absent malice,
what can you prove?

1387
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,544
Saying I should resign?
The president appointed you.

1388
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:10,173
I ain't the one to be kicking you out.
But I'd suggest it.

1389
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,263
I'll talk to you later.

1390
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:31,528
That's really too bad. I'm sorry.
Yeah.

1391
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:36,032
He's a nice guy.
He just forgot about the rules.

1392
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:42,038
What did you figure you'd do
after government service?

1393
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:43,540
I'm not quitting.

1394
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,960
You ain't no presidential appointee,
Elliott.

1395
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,879
The one that hired you was me.

You got 30 days.

1397

Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

1398
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,233
Well...

01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:15,155

You got yourselves.

How'd you know I'd get the story?
I knew somebody would.

1402
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:25,165
I'm sorry it was you.

1403
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,922
How'd you know I'd print it?

1404
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:35,592
It's news, isn't it?

1405
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:49,189
Remember,
nothing's done yet.
Make sure that this is...

1406
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,725
Davidek filled me in on it.

1407
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:29,771
We're not gonna retract
anything, but we've got
a lot of explaining to do.

1408
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,441

We'll handle it the best way we can.

That's true, isn't it?

No.

Not so hot, really.

1420
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:21,632
I went by your house.
There's a "for sale" sign out.

1421
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,844
Yeah, it's sold.
Got a good price.

1422
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:33,353
You got some sun.
Yeah, I've been sitting on the beach.

1423
01:51:35,356 --> 01:51:38,608
We were pretty famous for a week.
Did you read the story?

01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,610
Nope.

Sure.

I don't know.

1429
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:07,637
I guess I got a couple
of moves left in me.

1430
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:09,722
But you don't know where?

1431
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:12,266
Not sure.

1432
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:17,980
People are going south and west,
but, uh, I think I'll go north and east.

1433
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:20,691
You can go clear
to the Hudson River.

1434
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:24,654
I mean, clear to Canada,
on the inland waterway.

1435
01:52:27,324 --> 01:52:30,493
The Northeast.
I was raised in the Northeast.

1436
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:36,249
I had my first job there
the summer when I was 16
on the Berkshire Eagle.

1437
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:39,001
I wonder if they'd have me back.

1438
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:41,003
Feeling sorry for yourself?

1439
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:53,015
I know you think
what I do for a living...

1440
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:57,061
is nothing.

1441
01:52:57,229 --> 01:53:01,149
But it really isn't nothing.
I just did it badly.

1442
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:09,615

northeast has something
to do with your daughter.

"Could I write?"
