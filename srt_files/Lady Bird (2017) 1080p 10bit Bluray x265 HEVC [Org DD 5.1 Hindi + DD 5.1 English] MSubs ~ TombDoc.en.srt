1
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,611
<i>Do you think
I look like I'm from Sacramento?</i>

2
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,860
You are from Sacramento.

3
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,862
You don't have to do that.

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,613
Well, it's nice to make things
neat and clean.

5
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,410
- You ready to go home?
- Ready.

6
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,665
<i>Her hand moved
behind his head and supported it.</i>

7
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,460
<i>Her fingers moved gently in his hair.</i>

8
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,180
<i>She looked up and across the barn,</i>

9
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,971
<i>and her lips came together
and smiled mysteriously.</i>

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,516
<i>You've been listening to...</i>

11
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,021
...The Grapes of Wrath,

12
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>by John Steinbeck. If you...</i>

13
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,027
Our college trip took 21 hours
and five minutes.

14
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,620
Hey, wait. Let's just sit
with what we heard.

15
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,666
- Are you serious?
- Well, we don't have to constantly

16
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,466
be entertaining ourselves, do we?

17
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,094
I wish I could live through something.

18
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,143
- Aren't you?
- Nope.

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,936
The only exciting thing
about 2002 is that it's a palindrome.

20
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,272
Okay, fine. Well, yours is
the worst life of all, so you win.

21
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,777
- Oh, so now you're mad...
- No, it's just...

22
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,233
- because I wanted to listen to music?
- you're being ridiculous,

23
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,535
- because you have a great life.
- I'm sorry I'm not perfect.

24
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,284
No one's asking you to be perfect.
Just considerate would do.

25
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,616
I don't even want to go to school
in this state anyway.

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,748
I hate California.
I want to go to the East Coast.

27
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,626
Your dad and I will barely
be able to afford in-state tuition.

28
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,878
- There are loans, scholarships.
- Your very smart brother...

29
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,802
- he can't even find a job.
- He and Shelly work. They have jobs.

30
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,174
They bag at the grocery store.
That is not a career.

31
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,097
And they went to Berkeley.

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,345
Your father's company
is laying off people right and left.

33
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,802
Did you even know that?
No, of course you don't,

34
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,932
because you don't think
about anybody but yourself.

35
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,443
And Immaculate Heart is already a luxury.

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,270
Immaculate Fart. You wanted that, not me.

37
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,698
Miguel saw someone knifed
in front of him at Sac High.

38
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,946
Is that what you want?
So, you're telling me

39
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,654
that you want to see somebody
knifed right in front of you?

40
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,707
He barely saw that.
I wanna go where culture is,

41
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,159
- like New York, or at least Connecticut...
- How in the world did I raise such a snob?

42
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,245
...or New Hampshire,
where writers live in the woods.

43
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,796
You couldn't get
into those schools, anyway.

44
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,669
- Mom!
- You can't even pass your driver's test.

45
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,466
Because you wouldn't
let me practice enough!

46
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,919
The way that you work...
or the way that you don't work...

47
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,970
you're not even worth
state tuition, Christine.

48
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,800
- My name is Lady Bird.
- Well, actually, it's not,

49
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,134
- and it's ridiculous...
- Call me Lady Bird,

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,843
- because your name is Christine.
- like you said you would.

51
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,054
You should just go to city college.
You know, with your work ethic,

52
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,357
just go to city college, and then to jail,
and then back to city college,

53
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,357
and then maybe you'd learn to pull
yourself up and not expect everybody to...

54
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,234
In the name of the Father,

55
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,486
and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

56
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,737
Amen.

57
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,740
- Let the Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

58
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:10,119
I want to welcome all of you back
to the start of the new school year,

59
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,327
all the Xavier boys
and Immaculate Heart girls.

60
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,913
Hail Mary, full of grace.

61
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,998
The Lord is with thee.

62
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,550
Blessed art thou amongst women...

63
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,628
Glory to you, O Lord.

64
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,680
<i>I pledge allegiance to the Flag</i>

65
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,349
<i>of the United States of America,</i>

66
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,848
and to the Republic for which it stands,

67
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,649
one Nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

68
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,648
A vote for Amanda is a vote for boys,
boys and healthy vending machines,

69
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,196
because no one wants a muffin
with that many calories.

70
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,523
Whoo!

71
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:48,070
Do not ask me, "Mr. Bruno,
is this gonna be on the finals,"

72
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,825
or, "Mr. Bruno, is this
gonna be on the midterm?"

73
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,578
Because I'm not gonna tell you.
That is none of your business.

74
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,455
Those aren't the rules. This is my house.

75
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,959
"A reading from a letter of St. John."

76
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,421
We're afraid
that we will never escape our past,

77
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,131
and we're afraid
of what the future will bring.

78
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,215
<i>We're afraid that we will not
get into the college of our choice.</i>

79
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,971
<i>We're afraid we won't be loved,</i>

80
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,178
<i>we won't be liked, we won't succeed.</i>

81
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,349
<i>Here are the classics...
St. Augustine, of course,</i>

82
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,776
Aquinas, my favorite, Kierkegaard...

83
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,401
Oh, wait until you hear his love story.

84
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,029
It will make you swoon.

85
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,955
<i>And the coming
of our Savior, Jesus Christ.</i>

86
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:38,169
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours, now and forever.

87
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,837
Amen.

88
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,257
Some of the students
were disturbed by your posters.

89
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,054
It's just a bird head
on a lady body, or vice versa.

90
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,756
I think it's a little upsetting.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,933
It's my tradition to run for office.

92
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,851
Don't worry. I won't win.

93
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,929
That's not what I'm worried about.

94
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,766
This won't mess
with my scholarship, will it?

95
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,851
No. You're okay there.

96
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,063
You have a performative streak, I think.

97
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,444
Yeah, I think that too.

98
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,526
Maybe you would enjoy theater arts.

99
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,579
They're having auditions
for the fall musical.

100
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,075
Do we have that here?

101
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,408
It's a collaborative effort
with the men at Xavier.

102
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,710
How am I a senior
and not know we have that?

103
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,289
Perhaps you haven't always been
an active part of this community.

104
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,678
They do a fall musical and a spring play,
and from what I hear, it's a real blast.

105
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,806
What I'd really like
is to be on Math Olympiad.

106
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,384
But math isn't something
you're terribly strong in.

107
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,520
That we know of yet.

108
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,567
- There you go.
- Thanks.

109
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,775
"Julie" doesn't need to be in quotes.

110
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,615
- But it's not my real name.
- It's not the same thing.

111
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,197
I'm not sure you're right.

112
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,376
I love this neighborhood.

113
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,620
Yeah, it's so beautiful.

114
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,131
If I lived here, I would
definitely have my wedding

115
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,880
in the backyard.

116
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,384
I'd have friends over all the time
to study and eat snacks.

117
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,808
I'd be like, "Mom, we're taking
the snacks upstairs to the TV room."

118
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,136
I'd have my own bathroom.

119
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,681
I can't stop you dicks
from hanging out here,

120
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,266
but quit wrinkling all the magazines!

121
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,192
When I'm in this store,
I'm not your sister.

122
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,942
I'm a customer, Miguel. I'm always right.

123
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,775
Ever since she moved in, your brother
and Shelly are becoming the same person.

124
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,110
No way.

125
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,071
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

126
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,157
See, why don't I look like that?

127
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,085
Yeah. Just once, I'd like to have the song
"New York Groove" playing

128
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,786
and feel like it
really applies to my life.

129
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,088
You've never even been to New York.

130
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,756
That's why I'm applying
to New York colleges.

131
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,256
Do you know if Sarah Lawrence
is actually in the city?

132
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,713
- Your parents would pay for that?
- Scholarships, financial aid...

133
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,926
I'll figure it out. My mom thinks I can't
get in, but she is sorely mistaken.

134
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,515
- What about terrorism?
- Don't be a Republican.

135
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,599
Probably just gonna go to city college.

136
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,150
Put the magazine back!

137
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,273
Shit!

138
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,856
- You doing okay, mama?
- Oh, yeah, that was terrifying, wasn't it?

139
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,114
Thank God you were there.
So I guess we can't have pencils anymore.

140
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,820
Yeah, just gotta go back
to quill tipped markers. Crayola.

141
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,749
Right. Thank you. It's for you.
I got it for the baby.

142
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,201
- I couldn't resist it.
- She loves pink.

143
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,287
It's more for you and Andrea
than it is for the baby.

144
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,087
I'm sorry I didn't have time to wrap it.

145
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,461
- No, it's perfect.
- Okay. Good.

146
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,964
I'll see you tomorrow. Or, I mean, later.

147
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,670
- Thank you.
- Okay.

148
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,952
<i>Did you know toothpaste
is basically ineffective.</i>

149
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,131
- It's like sucking on a mint.
- Mike Kelly died.

150
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,550
I didn't even know he was sick again.

151
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,834
How old was he?

152
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,924
Only 56.

153
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,131
- Can Shelly and I get in there?
- In a minute, honey.

154
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,683
- Dad and I are still in here.
- That's too young.

155
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,637
- Lady Bird, you better be dressed.
- I am dressed.

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,017
Yeah. I'm gonna send them a note.

157
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,069
Do you think that Shelly and Miguel
have sex on the pullout couch?

158
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,440
Oh, yeah.

159
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,447
- Why can't I just make the eggs?
- Because you take too long,

160
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,824
you make a big mess,
and I have to clean the whole thing up.

161
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,200
Eggs aren't good
for the environment anyways.

162
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,622
- What?
- You heard her.

163
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,950
Eat quickly, please.

164
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,877
<i>Look at all these pictures.
Every newspaper looks like USA Today.</i>

165
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,455
Shelly and I are trying to be vegan,
hence the soy milk.

166
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,790
You wear leather jackets.

167
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,590
But they're vintage,
so they don't support the industry.

168
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,134
They aren't done. There's white stuff.

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,336
You know how much you love Brambles?

170
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,671
Pigs are smarter than him even.

171
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,926
I never thought Brambles
was a genius, okay?

172
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,805
- Mom, the eggs are not done.
- Fine. Make your own fucking eggs.

173
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,806
I wanted to. You won't let me.

174
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,603
- Your sister doesn't like me.
- I'm hungry!

175
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,603
- She does.
- You had your chance. Going to bed.

176
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,979
Did you know that Alanis Morissette

177
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,189
wrote this song in only ten minutes?

178
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,821
I believe it.

179
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,325
So, I'm applying
to a couple East Coast schools.

180
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,704
I need you to help me with the financial
aid applications, but Mom can't know.

181
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,786
We... Aren't they quite expensive?

182
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,714
First, yes. That's why financial aid.

183
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,665
Second, I have to get in first.

184
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,672
Mom won't be happy about it.

185
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,345
Which is why I don't
want to fight about it before I have to.

186
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,548
- Just pull over here.
- Are you sure?

187
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,680
- I can drive you to the front.
- No. This is fine. I like to walk.

188
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,017
Well, I love you.

189
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,565
So, what do you think about college?

190
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,064
- See what I can do.
- Thanks, Dad.

191
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,270
I love you too. Have a good day at work.

192
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:01,114
Hey, I'm like Keith Richards.
I'm just happy to be anywhere.

193
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,826
Hey.

194
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,082
- Hey.
- All right, girls.

195
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,334
- Hope you like pickles.
- Thanks, Uncle Matt.

196
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,383
- Sweet.
- He's not your uncle.

197
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,631
Just something I'm trying out. Bye, Mom.

198
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,586
- Bye.
- Love you.

199
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,841
Bye. I love you.

200
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,223
- Your mom really likes you.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,097
- I just keep getting fatter.
- Me too.

202
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,020
- Matt's awesome.
- Yeah.

203
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,349
I hope he marries my mom.
That would be so nice.

204
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,855
He promised me his old car when I turn 18.

205
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,108
Ugh! That car should be illegal.

206
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,440
Jenna Walton's not doing any off-roading.

207
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,150
She just goes to Pavilions.

208
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,453
I heard Jenna Walton
has a tanning bed in her house.

209
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,531
She is so pretty.

210
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,037
Her skin is luminous.

211
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,917
Maybe we should try tanning.

212
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,288
Yeah.

213
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,208
...in the tub...

214
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,635
I scoot myself under,
just like now, like this,

215
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,429
and then the water just... whoop.

216
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,385
Schwoop.

217
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,094
Ooh, you're so gross!

218
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,389
I think I figured it out
when I was, like, three or something.

219
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,978
I take the showerhead...

220
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,312
Oh, my God...

221
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,443
Embarrassing, I use that.

222
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,775
I don't know if mine
is the right kind though.

223
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,029
Maybe it's different
when you actually have a penis in there.

224
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,035
Like, it's more intense.

225
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,833
Mine was pretty intense, I think.

226
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,581
You're not supposed to eat the wafers.

227
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,587
They're not consecrated.

228
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:47,845
<i>Being alive</i>

229
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,846
Okay. Christine.

230
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,394
- Lady Bird.
- Is that your given name?

231
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,143
- Yeah.
- Why is it in quotes?

232
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,101
Well, I gave it to myself.
It's given to me, by me.

233
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,154
Okay. Take it away, Lady Bird.

234
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,280
<i>Everybody says don't,
everybody says don't</i>

235
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,528
<i>Everybody says don't, it isn't right</i>

236
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,327
<i>Don't, it isn't nice</i>

237
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,120
<i>Everybody says don't,
everybody says don't</i>

238
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,039
<i>Everybody says don't walk on the grass</i>

239
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,664
<i>Rolling along</i>

240
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,918
<i>Rolling along</i>

241
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,967
<i>Make me a channel of your peace</i>

242
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,927
<i>Where there is despair in life
Let me bring hope</i>

243
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,977
<i>Where there is darkness, only light</i>

244
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:38,024
<i>And where there's sadness, everjoy</i>

245
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,736
<i>There are giants in the sky</i>

246
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,326
<i>There are big, tall,
terrible giants in the sky</i>

247
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,655
<i>When you're way up high
And you look below</i>

248
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,490
<i>At the world you left

249
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,450
<i>Little more than a glance
Is enough to show you</i>

250
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,160
<i>Just how small you are</i>

251
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,751
I see light on in your room.
Go to bed.

252
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,009
- Congratulations.
- You too. We both got in.

253
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,837
Everyone who auditioned got in.

254
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,218
The part I got was basically
not getting in.

255
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,470
I don't even know
how I got cast in my part.

256
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,849
Me neither. I was the one
who had a dress and prepared a song.

257
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,147
- I know.
- Now you're gonna be all romantic

258
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,223
with Danny on stage.

259
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,934
It's probably my only shot at that,
you know?

260
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,941
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,254
- Mom.
- We don't need to buy that.

262
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,083
It's only three dollars.
I'm having a hard week.

263
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,384
Well, if you wanna read it,
we can go down to the public library.

264
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,928
- I wanna read it in bed.
- That's something that rich people do.

265
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,096
We're not rich people.

266
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,511
Stop.

267
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,936
Stop it. Stop it.

268
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,558
Listen, stop.

269
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,892
Hey.

270
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,022
Hi.

271
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,229
Come here often?

272
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,439
Excuse me?

273
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,990
I'm Lady Bird.
We're gonna be in the musical together.

274
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh, yeah. I remember you.
You were wearing that dress.

275
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,118
Well, I just wanted to say, "What's up,"
and I'll see you in rehearsal.

276
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,995
Thanks. I'm super excited.
You... You live in the neighborhood?

277
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,577
No. I'm from the wrong side of the tracks.

278
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,379
- Wh-What?
- Is that your family?

279
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,377
Yeah.

280
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,667
Wow. There's so many of you.

281
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,879
Irish Catholic. It's hard to find a girl
to date that's not my cousin.

282
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,841
Well, okay.
You're gonna make a great Franklin.

283
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,393
Oh, thanks. I want my hair...
or his hair... to be curly, though.

284
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,721
- Yeah.
- Like, um...

285
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,521
Like Jim Morrison. Very '70s.

286
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,066
- Like Jim Morrison. Exactly.
- Yeah.

287
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,609
- Danny!
- Oh, I gotta go.

288
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,062
Bye.

289
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,692
Who is Jim Morrison again?

290
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,869
He was in a rock band, moron. The Doors.

291
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,071
- I knew that.
- This is with your employee discount?

292
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,202
Yeah. It's already included.

293
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,329
Oh, my... Okay.

294
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,081
<i>- Ma.
- Ma.</i>

295
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,254
- Mana.
- Mana.

296
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,831
- Manala.
- Manala.

297
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,293
Because it's not important
to be right. It's only important to be...

298
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,548
- True.
- Exactly!

299
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,675
Purple.

300
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,472
Two.

301
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,639
Two.

302
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,809
Two.

303
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,768
<i>Yesterday is done</i>

304
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,821
<i>See the pretty countryside</i>

305
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,241
To get our emotions going,
we're going to play

306
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,286
first one to cry wins

307
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,911
Starting... now.

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,366
I'm playing too.

309
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,376
So is Miss Patty.

310
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,479
Oh...

311
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,563
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,984
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,655
<i>I heard that before
he became a priest, he was married,</i>

314
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,204
and had a son named Etienne,
who died at 17 of a drug overdose,

315
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,782
which maybe was a suicide.

316
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,085
But my mom says same difference,
if you're that careless with your life.

317
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,334
Oh, that's her. Gotta go.

318
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,960
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

319
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,338
Oh, I almost forgot.

320
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,927
I brought you these hot rollers...
for your Jim Morrison hair.

321
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,888
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

322
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,065
- You'll have to show me how to use them.
- It would be my pleasure.

323
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,936
They look like sperms.

324
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,572
I ju... I just remembered,
I had a dream about you.

325
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,403
- Really?
- Yeah.

326
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,457
- What... What happened?
- Um, we were...

327
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,625
we were flying to Disneyland
on a giant carrot.

328
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,078
That's awesome.

329
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,414
- I love Disneyland.
- Yeah. Me too.

330
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,251
- I think it's kind of scary, but...
- Mm.

331
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,630
...I also love it.

332
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,762
So, everybody clear
on applying rules of exponents?

333
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,306
You guys with me? Don't leave me hanging.

334
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,976
Give me a nod. That's good.
Maybe even a verbal confirmation.

335
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,053
Yes.

336
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,139
Aha! Thank you.
That's what I like to hear.

337
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,442
All right. So I'm gonna be passing back
your graded quizzes.

338
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,487
I urge you to find the problems
where you went wrong and work them out.

339
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,564
Good job, Jules.

340
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,651
I can tell from your work
you even understood the ones you missed.

341
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,408
Suck a dick.

342
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,459
I like "Jules."

343
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,005
I just don't get why I'm not good at math.
My dad is really good in math.

344
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,378
Even Miguel has a math degree.

345
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,879
Maybe it's your mom's fault.

346
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,058
- You lose! Point Julie!
- No. Look.

347
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,688
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

348
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,945
Hey, wanna dance?

349
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,322
Hell, yeah.

350
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,162
Six inches for the Holy Spirit.

351
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,475
That's us.

352
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,057
- Oh, uh, no. My mom's coming.
- No, she's not.

353
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,188
- Yeah, she is.
- The plan was to sleep over at my house.

354
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,268
No. It's fine.

355
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,020
Okay. Bye.

356
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,484
Bye.

357
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,400
Hey, Matt.

358
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,666
Have you ever been out of the country?

359
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,123
- When I was little.
- Mm.

360
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,632
My... My dad had a job
that took him to Brazil.

361
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,459
I remember from the pictures.

362
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,510
My dream to...

363
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,806
- Oh. Sorry.
- No. No, you go.

364
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,884
I've never been out of the country.

365
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,685
It's, uh... It's my dream to go to Paris.

366
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,435
Ohh. Paris.

367
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,225
That's why I'm taking French.

368
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,608
My mom said French wasn't useful.

369
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,231
It is if you wanna go to Paris.

370
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,909
I still don't know how to use
those rollers that you gave me.

371
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,834
Oh... Oh, it's so easy.

372
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,005
- Um, so, after they heat up...
- Mm-hmm?

373
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,505
...you... you take your hair

374
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,964
and you twist the hair like this, and...

375
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,980
Larry, how long will this hold us?

376
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,908
- I don't know.
- Well, somebody's gotta know.

377
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,861
I'm not sure.

378
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,073
What happens if somebody
gets in an accident?

379
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,534
Uh, the severance package
expires all at once.

380
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,120
Not within the calendar year.

381
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,877
- Is she home?
- Maybe just leave it tonight.

382
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,710
No, she knows better.
She can't sneak around like this.

383
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,135
Marion.

384
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,053
- You can't leave your room like this.
- I didn't.

385
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,756
None of these things were put away right.

386
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,933
- They aren't nice. Christine, now.
- I put my clothes away.

387
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,429
- My name is Lady Bird.
- Don't lie to me.

388
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,228
This uniform...
This is gonna look like trash on Monday.

389
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,478
This isn't right.
We can't treat our clothes like this.

390
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,434
I don't know what
your wealthy friends do...

391
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,770
Why do you care what I do to my clothes?

392
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,484
Your father doesn't have a job.

393
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,535
He lost his job.

394
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,487
Do you need him to come in here
and explain that to you?

395
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,575
Of course, he probably wouldn't anyway.
He's Mr. Nice Guy,

396
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,580
- and I always have to be the bad guy.
- Can we please just talk...

397
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,911
- It can't look like a rag,
- ...about this tomorrow?

398
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,587
because that makes us look like rags.

399
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,665
You wanna know the truth?
Here's the truth.

400
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,842
Some of your friends' fathers
could employ your father,

401
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,091
and they're not gonna do it
if it looks like his family is trash.

402
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,137
You understand?

403
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,024
Didn't you ever go to sleep without
putting all your clothes away perfectly?

404
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,100
Like even once?

405
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,777
And don't you wish your mom
hadn't gotten angry?

406
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,157
My mother was an abusive alcoholic.

407
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,867
So, I understand you're not interested
in any Catholic colleges.

408
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,950
No way.

409
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,580
Sorry. But yes, no way.

410
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,586
Then you'll be applying to UCs
and state schools.

411
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:09,215
Yeah, but also those East Coast
liberal arts schools like Yale,

412
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,888
but not Yale,
because I probably couldn't get in.

413
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,473
You definitely couldn't get in.

414
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,389
Part of my job
is to help you be realistic.

415
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,440
Yeah. It seems like everyone's job.

416
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,486
Your SAT scores are strangely very good.

417
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:30,066
I had placed some calls to local alumni
of the schools you're interested in,

418
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,572
but unfortunately,
all the interviews are taken.

419
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,494
So what does that mean?

420
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,449
It means you'll have to get in
on how you look on paper.

421
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:44,922
<i>Dreams don't die,
so keep an eye on your dream</i>

422
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,920
<i>And before you know where you are,
there you are</i>

423
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,296
All right. Stop, stop, stop.

424
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,643
<i>Should we go home?</i>

425
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,440
<i>My mom is always mad.</i>

426
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,611
Doesn't matter if I get home late.
She'll be mad at me anyway.

427
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,566
- Your mom's hard on you.
- Yeah, well, she loves me a lot.

428
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:15,990
Pick a star for us.

429
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,203
That one. Right there.

430
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,206
Next to the bright one,
and then the dim one. You see it?

431
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:24,874
Yeah.

432
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,790
That's our star.

433
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,334
You know...

434
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,090
you can touch my boobs, right?

435
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:40,473
I know. It's just that
I respect you too much for that.

436
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,349
Cool. Awesome.

437
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,059
I totally get that. Thank you.

438
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,564
You're welcome.

439
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,567
If you had boobs,
I wouldn't touch them either.

440
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,694
I respect you so much...

441
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,740
because I love you.

442
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,161
I love you too.

443
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,502
- Let's name our star Claude.
- That's pretentious, don't you think?

444
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,255
It's French. What should we name it?

445
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,509
Bruce.

446
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,638
- I love you!
- I love you.

447
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,396
Bruce.

448
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,393
It's normal to not touch a penis.

449
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,394
I have to go to class.

450
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,148
- But I have free period.
- I need to pass history.

451
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,449
I think we're done with
the learning portion of high school.

452
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,992
- I'm gonna go.
- No.

453
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,615
- Mm-hmm.
- I hate being alone.

454
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,866
Bye! Love you!

455
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:19,781
Did Danny say whether his grandmother
has a formal Thanksgiving?

456
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,204
I don't know. There are a lot of kids,
but she lives in the Fab 40s.

457
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,124
Oh, well, your dad and I went to a dinner
party once in that neighborhood.

458
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,918
The CEO of ISC. That was pretty formal.

459
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,130
You're not going to a funeral.

460
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,209
Well, I don't know.
What says "rich people Thanksgiving"?

461
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,295
I just think it's such a shame that
you're spending your last Thanksgiving

462
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,346
with a family you've never met
instead of us, but...

463
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,720
I know. I guess you want it that way.

464
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,269
- Are you tired?
- No.

465
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,348
- Hey, Marion.
- Hey, Joyce. Hey, how's the baby?

466
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,276
- She's crawling.
- No! I wanna see a picture at checkout.

467
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,943
- Okay.
- Okay.

468
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,568
- 'Cause if you're tired, we can sit down.
- I'm not tired.

469
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,024
Oh, okay. I just couldn't tell
because you were dragging your feet.

470
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,117
Well, I just couldn't tell.

471
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,657
Why didn't you just say,
"Pick up your feet"?

472
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:04,738
I didn't know if you were tired.

473
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,414
- You were being passive-aggressive.
- No, I wasn't.

474
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,366
- You are so infuriating.
- Please stop yelling.

475
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,296
- I'm not yelling. Oh! Perfect!
- Honey, do you love it?

476
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,902
So, because my grade book has...
disappeared, here's what we're gonna do.

477
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,233
I'm gonna count on you
to reconstruct it, okay?

478
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,410
Now, I know you all know
your grades better than anybody.

479
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,331
I have a general idea, but this is
all about the honor code right now.

480
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,957
Hi. A-minus.

481
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,910
Pretty sure it was an A.

482
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,212
I'm not, but okay.

483
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,836
It was. Trust me,
I know talent when I see it.

484
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,251
You're welcome. Thank you.

485
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,223
Hey, I think B.

486
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:10,016
I thought it was more like B-minus,
maybe even C-plus territory?

487
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,393
No, because I did really well
on the last quiz.

488
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,566
Oh. I seem to remember you
doing only slightly better.

489
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,359
That brought my average up to a B.

490
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,692
Okay. B it is.

491
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,155
It's your honor.

492
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,615
Lady Bird, your lover awaits!

493
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,618
- Hello, Danny! The famous Danny!
- Hi.

494
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,415
- Aw!
- Oh-ho-ho!

495
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,789
Aren't you adorable?

496
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,916
- Larry, isn't he adorable?
- He's adorable.

497
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:39,374
You're driving her and everything. Wow.

498
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,460
Yeah, well, thank you
for letting Lady Bird come

499
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,637
to my grandmother's Thanksgiving,
Mrs. McPherson.

500
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,964
No. No more politeness. Call me Marion.

501
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,015
Oh. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson.

502
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,469
Please, call me Mr. Larry McPherson.

503
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,680
Larry. Sit down, Danny.

504
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,060
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

505
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:59,065
Hey, I'm Miguel, the brother. I think
Lady Bird wants to make an entrance.

506
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,896
She's mad
we don't have a spiral staircase.

507
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,236
- Shelly.
- What?

508
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,777
- Is my name.
- Oh. Hi.

509
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,033
Hi.

510
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,287
It's funny. On my way over here,
I went over the train tracks.

511
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,413
- Oh, you took H Street.
- Right. And so,

512
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,211
Lady Bird always says that she lives
on the wrong side of the tracks,

513
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,665
but I always thought
that was like a metaphor.

514
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,842
- Oh.
- But there are actual train tracks.

515
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,300
Oh, hi. You look amazing!

516
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,724
- What the hell is in the duffel bag?
- Don't worry about it. Jeez.

517
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,770
- My grandmother will love that dress.
- Okay.

518
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,440
Wait.

519
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,820
- This is your grandma's house?
- Yeah.

520
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:50,621
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Danny! You're late.

521
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,699
Oh, uh, well, thank you so much
for having us.

522
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,203
- This is Lady Bird.
- Hi.

523
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,082
Hi, honey. Been anxious to meet you.

524
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,879
Your house is my favorite

525
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,547
- in all East Sacramento.
- Oh, thank you.

526
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,092
Oh, my God!

527
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,591
- Is this a joke?
- No.

528
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,006
- Pull these out...
- Oh...

529
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,057
Almost done. Do you like it?

530
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:16,184
Lovely. I love it. Would you mind
doing the whole table for me?

531
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,889
Okay.

532
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,851
<i>Dreams that will explode</i>

533
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,271
<i>Waking up the countryside</i>

534
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,527
- How do you know when it's working?
- You'll know.

535
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,529
- It's not working.
- It's not?

536
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,485
- No.
- My sister said this was premium.

537
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,413
- I'm working.
- I'm... I'm working too.

538
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,956
No.

539
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,997
I can't feel my arms.

540
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,794
You're working.

541
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,207
<i>I'm no easy A</i>

542
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,290
<i>Quiet...</i>

543
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:48,049
If Danny and I get married,
and then his grandma died,

544
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,346
I'd inherit the dream house.

545
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,344
Wouldn't his parents get it?

546
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,175
Oh, yeah. We'd have to kill them,

547
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,102
and we'd have to kill
his older brothers too.

548
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,403
<i>Yeah</i>

549
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,409
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

550
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,584
Where's Mr. Bruno's wife?

551
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,806
- How's it going?
- Okay.

552
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,359
Mom, we...
we can't really talk right now.

553
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:53,198
Well, happy Thanksgiving.
We missed you, Lady Bird.

554
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,119
<i>Try to run, try to hide,
try to keep it inside</i>

555
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,658
- Bye.
- Bye, Birdy.

556
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,368
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Shelly.

557
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,507
Why does that cigarette look so weird?

558
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,175
Like, not like a cigarette?

559
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,299
'Cause it's a clove.

560
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,768
Lick your lips. That's why they're sweet.

561
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,064
Your mom was really sad you weren't here
tonight for Thanksgiving.

562
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,825
Yeah, well, she hates me.

563
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,828
She has a big heart, your mom.

564
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,576
She took me in
after my parents freaked out about...

565
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,209
whatever, premarital sex.

566
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,877
I admire her.

567
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,521
Pray for us!

568
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,026
Save Jesus in our heart!

569
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,233
Forever!

<i>Catching a dream</i>

573
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,502
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

574
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,673
Hey!

575
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>Hey, old friends</i>

576
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,389
<i>How do we stay old friends</i>

577
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:43,641
<i>It started out like a song</i>

578
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,901
<i>Me and you</i>

579
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,195
That's true. There she is.

580
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,777
- Hi.
- Jules. Wow.

581
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,407
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

582
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,159
I couldn't believe that.
This is my wife Becky.

583
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,162
Becky this is Jules.
She's one of my brightest students.

584
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,369
- It's so-so nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

585
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,500
- How we doing? Feeling a little better?
- A little tired.

586
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,206
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right, I gotta get her home.

587
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,542
We got the little one,
but that was really great, Jules.

588
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,625
Thank you.

589
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,798
Congratulations.

590
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,943
He didn't understand it.

591
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,332
How long do you think you all will pee?

592
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,829
I drank so much soda.

593
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,752
- Fuck you.
- I just got my period.

594
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,454
- Goddammit.
- Where're you going?

595
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,130
There's never a line in the men's room.

596
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,637
Uh, I...

597
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,885
Oh, my God.

598
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,767
They're really nice socks.

599
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,015
They're expensive, actually.

600
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,189
They wick moisture away from your feet.

601
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,141
My feet always have moisture.

602
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,851
Mom, I love them.

603
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,109
I'm sorry it's a small Christmas.
We wanted to...

604
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,565
It's just a little small this year.

605
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,649
These are nice.

606
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,322
- Do you like it?
- Look.

607
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,537
- That's good.
- That's great.

608
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,711
I had to get it. It makes me laugh.

609
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,129
Dad, come in.

610
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,305
How'd you know it was me?

611
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,602
Mom doesn't knock.

612
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,850
No, she doesn't.

613
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,149
Here they are.
Your completed financial aid applications.

614
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,729
Thank you!

615
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,315
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

616
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,068
Do you need money for the applications?

617
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,619
- I can help with that too.
- No. No.

618
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,821
I've got that.

619
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,655
Summer job's covered it.

620
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,491
This is why
we have computer shut off time.

621
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,792
- This is our room.
- Okay, okay.

622
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,666
Just can you drive me to the post office
on Jade? It should still be open.

623
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,170
Three, two, one.

624
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,342
Happy New Year!

625
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,175
Happy New Year!

626
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,262
So you pull the nozzle out. You tip it in.

627
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,653
Hey.

628
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,577
I- I like your band.

629
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,203
Uh, with Jonah Ruiz,

630
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,955
- Lenfance New?
- L'enfance Nue.

631
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:41,007
Uh, well, I-I saw your Thanksgiving show.

632
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,755
My name's Lady Bird.

633
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,051
That's weird. You shake hands.

634
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,298
Yeah.

635
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,934
I'm friends with Jenna and she's always
talking about how great your band is.

636
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,761
So I wanted to check it out.

637
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,972
- Yeah. Jenna's hella tight.
- Yeah.

638
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,812
Maybe I'll see you at the Deuce
or something, huh?

639
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,689
Sure. See you at the Deuce.

640
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,315
Hey.

641
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,613
I'm not paying you to flirt.

642
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,907
I wasn't flirting.

643
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,528
I wish you had been.

644
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,755
A reading from
the book of Genesis.

645
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,131
"The Lord took Abram outside and said,

646
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,963
'Look up at the sky
and count the stars if you can.'

647
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:31,300
Just so, he added,
'Shall your descendants be.'

648
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,844
Abram put his faith in the Lord.

649
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,395
Who credited to him
as an act of righteousness."

650
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,282
Okay, the first time we did it,
it was at his lake house last summer.

651
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,952
- It was so funny.
- Oh, here you go.

652
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,404
From Uncle Matt.

653
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,707
I think he and my mom are fighting
so enjoy the lunches while you can.

654
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,410
Oh, no thanks. I'm trying to lose weight.

655
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,540
Really?

656
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,748
Sex is not a big deal.
It's just my mom called me during it.

657
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,583
- Skirt check.
- Was on my cell phone.

658
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,134
The one she got me for emergencies.

659
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,210
Did you pick up?

660
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,260
Yeah. I was like,
"Um, Mom, I can't really talk right now."

661
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,726
What was the emergency?

662
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,313
- What?
- Uh, what was the emergency?

663
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,607
- Oh, my great aunt died.
- I'm so sorry.

664
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,605
She kinda did it to herself.

665
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,903
Yeah. I don't know why you'd do that
if you're already so old.

666
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,196
Ladies.

667
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,398
Skirts.

668
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,911
I'm going to write you a citation,
Miss Walton.

669
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,659
No more short skirts.

670
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,910
Sarah Joan is all up in my junk.

671
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,621
She's a cunt.

672
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,251
Birdy, you like her.

673
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,504
Yeah, but she's a cunt.

674
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,966
I have an idea
of how to get Sarah Joan back.

675
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,681
- How?
- You'll see this afternoon.

676
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,431
No, we have auditions this afternoon.

677
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:02,232
Oh, right. I mean, uh,
I don't think I want to do the play.

678
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,309
Meet me at the teacher's parking lot at 3.

679
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,735
- I'll have the materials.
- Okay.

680
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,604
Wait, what was your name?

681
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,314
Lady Bird.

682
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,862
- Weird.
- Ladies.

683
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,160
We have a decision to make.

684
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,659
Prom themes. Top options so far,

685
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,286
cities of the world,

686
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,584
eternal flame, and movies.

687
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,954
Oh, where is Father Leviatch?

688
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,085
All right, let's have everyone
take a knee. Huh?

689
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,132
- What?
- Cozy sit.

690
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,008
Now, I know you all miss Father Leviatch,

691
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,135
and I can tell you that
the brothers do too.

692
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,804
But I'm gonna give
this thing my best shot.

693
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,687
Uh, now, usually
I'm the JV football coach,

694
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,483
but from what I can see, a play is a play.

695
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,276
Where's Lady Bird?

696
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,945
She's with her new best friend.
She thinks she's too cool for theater.

697
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,897
If you can pull out your-your scripts,

698
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,154
I've assigned a number
to each of your roles.

699
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,611
And, uh, I'm gonna put the blocking
up here on the board,

700
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,699
and then if you guys can transcribe that
back in your play books, that'd be great.

701
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,124
Who's playing what part?

702
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,169
Uh, I had Miss Patty here assign roles,
since she knows you all.

703
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,087
So, uh, call them out, Miss Patty.

704
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,460
Okay, uh, Prospero. Danny.

705
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,543
Danny. Nice. That's role one.

706
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,380
Wait. Where do you live?

707
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,008
Oh, um, The 40s.

708
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,012
That's where our starter house was.

709
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,721
Which street?

710
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,931
Um, 44th.

711
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,392
It's the three-story blue one

712
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,977
with the white shutters
and the American flag in the front.

713
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,061
Yeah. I know that one.

714
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,068
Do you want to go over there right now
and eat?

715
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,783
I live in Granite Bay,
otherwise I'd say let's go there.

716
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,661
Actually, I was thinking maybe
we should go to the Deuce.

717
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,161
I was talking to Kyle about it,
and he was like,

718
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,038
"Whatever it's lame,
but maybe I'll see you there."

719
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,619
How do you know Kyle?

720
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,921
Oh, my mom made me get a job
at New Helvetia

721
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,294
to learn, like, "responsibility."

722
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,510
Anyway, we hang out there.

723
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,088
Yeah. Kyle's awesome.

724
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,593
Let's Deuce it up.

725
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,768
Okay, guys. Now, look. Role one, right?

726
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,891
You're gonna run, kind of,
a skinny post right up front.

727
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,064
I want you to look straight
at the audience, okay.

728
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,767
Don't be looking around and blabbing
at anybody if they walk by ya.

729
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,228
Eight, nine, ten.
You're coming in hard, right here.

730
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:13,608
'Cause these guys are gonna love it.

731
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,317
Don't talk amongst yourselves.
Now, coming in slow, we're singing.

732
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,695
This is singing. Wide lines are singing.

733
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,655
We're singing. We're singing.

734
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,786
Danny's not singing yet. He's all alone.

735
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,459
Singing. Eight, nine, ten...
You come in hot!

736
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,081
You come in hot!

737
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,883
- This is the Deuce?
- Yeah.

738
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,337
- It's a parking lot?
- Yeah.

739
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,887
We were in one parking lot
and we went to another parking lot?

740
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,436
Hey, Kyle. Lady Bird and I just decorated
the Nun-mobile.

741
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,559
Like, just married to Jesus.

742
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,856
That's hella tight.

743
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,197
What you do is very baller.

744
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,872
- You're very anarchist.
- Yeah.

745
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,075
Fuck 'em.

746
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,750
Don't worry, I'm not gonna snitch on you.

747
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,500
Well, I hope not
'cause I'd fuckin' kill your family.

748
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,423
- What?
- Sorry.

749
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,968
I... That-That was an exaggeration.

750
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,465
It's okay.

751
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,548
My dad has cancer, so

752
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,257
I guess God's doing that for us.

753
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,058
Oh, I'm sorry.

754
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,180
You work at New Helvetia, right?

755
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,560
Right.

756
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,984
Can I get your number? We were looking
to set up more gigs down there.

757
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,106
Definitely.

758
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,571
It's my parents number.

759
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,492
You don't have a cell phone?

760
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:43,865
- Nah.
- Good girl.

761
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,787
Government didn't have to
put tracking devices on us.

762
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,706
We bought them and put them on ourselves.

763
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,408
I don't own a tracking device.

764
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,210
No, no, no. The cell phones.

765
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,913
- You see?
- Wow.

766
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,123
Yeah. I know.

767
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,000
I mean, you'll have one eventually.
Everyone's gonna have one.

768
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,087
And then, it'll be a matter of time.

769
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,342
Before what?

770
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,094
Before they put them in our brains.

771
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,881
What do you want from me?

772
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,138
Yes?

773
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:48,263
My-My grandma wanted me to tell you that
she missed you at Christmas.

774
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,684
Yeah. Well, I couldn't have gone anyway.
My mom was pissed about Thanksgiving.

775
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,266
Your mom is crazy. I'm scared of her.

776
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,354
She's not crazy.
She's just, you know, she has a big heart.

777
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,437
She's very warm.

778
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,648
I don't find your mother warm.

779
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,778
- You don't?
- No. No, she's warm. Yeah.

780
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,702
- But she's also, kind of, scary.
- Well, you can't be scary and warm.

781
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,280
- I think you can. Your mom is.
- You're gay.

782
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,249
Fuck me.

783
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,577
Can you not tell anyone, please?

784
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,879
I'm so sorry about everything.

785
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:20,834
I'm so ashamed of all of it.

786
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,841
It's just... It's going to be bad
and I just need a little bit of time

787
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,765
to figure out how I'm going to tell
my mom and dad and...

788
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,513
Don't worry.

789
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,228
I won't tell.

790
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:40,894
It's okay.

791
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,572
It's okay.

792
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,336
And do you have a support system?

793
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,630
What do you mean?

794
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,836
Who do you turn to when you feel this way?

795
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,177
No one, I guess.

796
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,388
I'm sorry.

797
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,810
No, don't be sorry.

798
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,514
There's no wrong answer.

799
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,021
Please don't tell your daughter.

800
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,147
No. Of course not.

801
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,395
Of course not.

802
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,905
Remember that you are dust
and to dust you will return.

803
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,578
Remember that you are dust
and to dust you will return.

804
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:47,966
It's a new system. You just enter
your social security number and...

805
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,226
- Davis?
- Davis is good.

806
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,975
- Maybe you shoulda looked at it.
- It's only half an hour away.

807
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,773
- Less if you're driving fast.
- I went to graduate school there.

808
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,727
- Lots of smart people go to Davis.
- I thought Berkeley had to accept me.

809
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,812
You and Miguel went there. I'm a legacy.

810
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,522
Uh, not if we don't give money.

811
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,733
- And you get bad grades.
- And what do you know about it?

812
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,987
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

813
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,614
- No. What are you implying?
- Nothing!

814
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,491
You fucking racist!

815
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,415
- I didn't say anything!
- I didn't put down my race!

816
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:20,211
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure they had no idea, Miguel!

817
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,832
You're actually fucking evil.

818
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:25,340
- What is wrong with you?
- Go. Go to your room.

819
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,509
- I'm not five!
- I didn't raise you like this.

820
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,006
I don't have to go anywhere.

821
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:31,054
I'm not going to a fucking university

822
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,258
that's famous for
its fucking agricultural school!

823
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,934
And Miguel and Shelly, you'll never
get jobs with all that shit in your face.

824
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,156
Hi.

825
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,116
Um, help yourself to anything
in the fridge.

826
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,543
My parents are upstairs,
but they don't care if you drink.

827
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,710
Okay. Cool.

828
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,479
I hate that shit.

829
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,766
But you smoke.

830
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,567
I smoke hand-rolled cigarettes.

831
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,394
Never industrially produced.

832
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,649
Never cloves.

833
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,197
What's wrong with cloves?

834
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,945
Can't inhale cloves. What's the point?

835
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,151
Oh.

836
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,701
You're not supposed to.

837
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,121
Well, cloves were what I first smoked
when I was young.

838
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,790
So, you know, it's a force of habit.

839
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,210
It has fiberglass.

840
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:44,878
- Really?
- Yeah.

841
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,546
Rolling your own is best.

842
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,294
Also, like...

843
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:52,173
I'm trying as much as possible not
participate in our economy.

844
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,595
I don't like money.

845
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,806
So...

846
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,975
I'm trying to live by bartering alone.

847
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,144
But doesn't Catholic school cost money?

848
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,017
Yeah. The diocese we're in
are super into it.

849
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,687
It mattered to my dad that...

850
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,731
I go to Xavier, so

851
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,279
just trying to make him happy.

852
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,504
- I haven't had sex yet.
- Me neither.

853
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,456
- With another person. Really?
- Nope. Me either. Yeah.

854
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,924
It's the tanning bed.

855
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,101
Julie will love this.

856
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,143
Who's Julie?

857
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,249
Lady Bird. You can't lock the door when
we have one bathroom.

858
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,795
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

859
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,123
It's just this is the only place
I can get any privacy.

860
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,924
You really need to use two towels?

861
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,421
Uh, no.

862
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,969
- I guess no.
- If you need to use two towels,

863
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,138
you just have to say
because this affects my whole day.

864
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,635
Because I have to do laundry before work

865
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,887
and I need to know if there's more towels
that I need to wash.

866
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,344
I just need one. Sorry.

867
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:27,022
Okay. Well, let me get to the mirror,
I've gotta get going.

868
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:40,490
When do you think
is a normal time to have sex?

869
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,492
- You're having sex?
- No.

870
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,825
Um, college is good.

871
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:50,458
I think college and use protection
like we talked about.

872
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,538
Okay.

873
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,223
Is Dad depressed?

874
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,343
Why do you ask that?

875
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,892
The pills. They have Dad's name on them.

876
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,646
Dad's been struggling
with depression for years.

877
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,151
I didn't know that.

878
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,321
Money is not life's report card.

879
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,782
He's depressed about money?

880
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:27,367
Being successful doesn't mean anything
in and of itself.

881
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,996
It just means that you're successful.

882
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,748
Yeah, but then you're successful.

883
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,955
But that doesn't mean that you're happy.

884
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,585
But he's not happy.

885
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:49,312
I have to get out of Sacramento.

886
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:51,765
Why?

887
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,858
Because it's soul killing.

888
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,150
It's the Midwest of California.

889
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,945
Isn't there a thing, like,

890
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,072
"Think globally, act locally"?

891
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,953
I feel that the person who said that
didn't live in Sacramento.

892
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,127
Ah!

893
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,374
<i>I love it here.</i>

894
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,205
<i>I want to send my daughters
to Immaculate Heart.</i>

895
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,129
<i>I wanna... You know, I wanna be a mom.</i>

896
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,593
At least go to San Francisco.

897
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:23,922
I don't like hills.

898
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,390
Start simple with x plus three
times x plus two.

899
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,566
<i>- Now if we use FOIL, where do we start?
- Julie?</i>

900
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,519
Julie?

901
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,023
Julie. Hey.

902
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,574
What do you want from Julie?

903
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:44,819
Darlene, can you excuse us?

904
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,278
Darlene's staying.

905
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,613
Why aren't you in Algebra 2?

906
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:49,118
- I switched sections.
- Why?

907
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,790
Aren't Jenna and Kyle enough?

908
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,081
I'm sorry that you're jealous.

909
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,753
Jenna's a moron, you know.

910
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,502
She's not. She's in AP Calculus.

911
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:58,958
She's a moron in a deeper sense.

912
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,132
You don't even know her.

913
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,553
Miss Patty assigned you a role by the way,
you just never showed up to claim it!

914
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,302
- What role?
- The tempest!

915
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:10,227
- There is no role of the tempest!
- It is the titular role!

916
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,272
No, it's a made up thing
so we all can participate!

917
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:17,351
You can't do anything unless
you're the center of attention, can you?

918
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:20,313
Yeah. Well, you know your mom's tits,
they're fake. Totally fake!

919
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,614
She made one bad decision at 19!

920
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,191
Two bad decisions!

921
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:27,904
And at 15, this girl was pregnant.

922
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,614
She decided that
she was going to get an abortion.

923
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,372
It made sense.
It was the right thing to do.

924
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,079
- She was sitting there...
- Let me guess, she didn't get it.

925
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:40,007
...and something deep inside of her said,

926
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,958
- "No."
- Bingo.

927
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,965
Anyone want to guess who this woman is?

928
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,088
The young lady right here.

929
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:48,799
- You?
- No. It was not me.

930
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,725
Um, your friend?

931
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,268
No.

932
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,722
The girl in the story was...

933
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,931
my mother.

934
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:03,360
I am that baby that
she decided not to abort.

935
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,985
That could have been me.

936
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,783
That could have been my fate.

937
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,907
Just because something looks ugly
doesn't mean it's morally wrong.

938
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,329
What did you say, ma'am?

939
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,912
- Nothing.
- Please. Share.

940
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,002
I said,

941
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:22,083
"Just because something looks ugly
doesn't mean that it's morally wrong."

942
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,759
You think dead children
aren't morally wrong?

943
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:30,432
No. I'm just saying that if you took
up close pictures of my vagina

944
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:34,057
while I was on my period, it would be
disturbing, but it doesn't make it wrong.

945
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,136
Excuse me?

946
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,723
Listen. If your mother had
had the abortion,

947
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,400
we wouldn't have to sit through
this stupid assembly.

948
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,404
Suspended? How does this happen?

949
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,032
Everything we do is for you. Everything.

950
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,034
Do you think
I like driving that car around?

951
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,285
- No.
- Do you?

952
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,082
- No.
- Do you think I like working double shifts

953
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,249
at the psych hospital?

954
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,453
- No.
- You needed to go to the Catholic school

955
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:02,790
because your brother saw somebody knifed
in front of him at the public school.

956
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,341
Is that what you want?
Larry, what are you doing on the computer?

957
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,215
- Nothing.
- You think your dad and I don't know

958
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,887
how ashamed that you are of us?
Your dad knows.

959
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,349
Your dad knows why you ask him to drop you
off a block away from school every day.

960
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,019
- Dad, I didn't mean to.
- You made him feel horrible!

961
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,471
- Horrible! You know that?
- I'm sorry.

962
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,648
- Marion, you didn't have to bring that up.
- No, Larry, you can't just be

963
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,396
the nice guy. She has to know.

964
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,896
She has to know how you feel.

965
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,525
Otherwise, she's just gonna think
she can say anything at all,

966
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,027
and nobody ever gets hurt.

967
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,858
Wrong side of the tracks!

968
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,568
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Yeah.

969
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,278
- It was a joke.
- Yeah. It's just a joke Mom and Dad.

970
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,206
They don't care. We didn't think we'd be
in this house for 25 years.

971
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,908
We thought we would've moved
some place better.

972
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,789
Whatever we give you, it's never enough.

973
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,586
- It's never enough.
- It is enough.

974
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,880
Do you have any idea
what it costs to raise you?

975
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,380
And how much you're just throwing away
every day?

976
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,086
Give me a number.

977
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,546
What?

978
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,479
Give me a number.

979
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,894
I don't understand.

980
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,943
You give me a number
for how much it cost to raise me.

981
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,521
And I'm going to get older
and make a lot of money,

982
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,356
and write you a check for what I owe you.

983
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,737
So that I never have
to speak to you again.

984
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:16,451
Well I highly doubt that you will be able
to get a job good enough to do that.

985
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,420
<i>So the attack on Baghdad last night,</i>

986
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,169
<i>it was absolutely unbelievable.</i>

987
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,875
<i>That's right. Yeah, the
likes of which, uh, many US...</i>

988
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,461
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me, Jenna.</i>

989
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,888
<i>Hey. Are you calling me from school?</i>

990
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,433
No. We got out early 'cause all the
Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon.

991
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,762
Oh, right. Happy St. Patrick's Day.

992
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,439
<i>Yeah. I guess they'd been stockpiling
mini liquor bottles in the tampon machine,</i>

993
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,062
<i>and now they're all throwing up.</i>

994
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,984
Everyone else got out early.

995
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,695
So, guess where I am.

996
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:50,943
I don't know. Where?

997
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,867
Ding dong. I'm outside.

998
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:56,411
<i>- What?
- I'm standing outside.</i>

999
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:00,324
No. Just leave.

1000
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,407
Leave.

1001
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,627
- Fuck!
- Hello.

1002
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,794
Hi.

1003
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,596
So this is your house?

1004
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,761
Yeah.

1005
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:20,845
That lady in the other house
was totally freaked out.

1006
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:24,022
That's my friend's grandma.
That's her house.

1007
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,189
Why did you say it was your house?

1008
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,607
I wished I lived in that house.

1009
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:38,286
I don't even sort of understand why
somebody would lie about that.

1010
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,988
I- I didn't lie.

1011
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,994
You lied. You're a liar.

1012
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,916
I hate dishonesty.

1013
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:44,993
I'm sorry.

1014
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,499
Apology accepted, I guess.

1015
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,886
Are we still friends?

1016
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:00,635
I mean, if you're still Kyle's girlfriend,
then yeah, I guess I'll see you around.

1017
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,227
<i>Mortar rounds fired at the camp
that will fly over them</i>

1018
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,485
<i>if they are down below
on surface of the ground.</i>

1019
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,942
<i>And that is hard work, indeed. Believe me.
We've had to do it...</i>

1020
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,033
I'm ready.

1021
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,748
What?

1022
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,577
I'm ready to have sex.

1023
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,707
Oh. Okay.

1024
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,788
Great.

1025
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,425
You're so dexterous with that.

1026
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,508
Thanks.

1027
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,688
Oh.

1028
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,315
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1029
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:21,631
Are you...

1030
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,017
- Are you done?
- Yeah. Yes.

1031
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,347
Sorry. I was confused.

1032
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,524
- You have like...
- What?

1033
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,943
- You have some sort of like blood.
- What?

1034
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,645
Oh. Shit!

1035
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,196
I get nosebleeds.

1036
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,237
- Here.
- Thanks.

1037
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,317
I'm sorry.

1038
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,570
No. I'm good.

1039
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,415
Remember when tie-dye
was an activity?

1040
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,915
Oh, I didn't make that shirt.
My parents got it for me at Sea Ranch.

1041
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,497
You can read Sea Ranch if you look close.

1042
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,676
Cut to ten years later.

1043
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,846
What?

1044
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,470
Like how ten years ago,
you were in first grade.

1045
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,222
Now we cut to...

1046
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,396
What does cut to mean to you?

1047
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,395
Or like, you know, little did he know.

1048
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,021
Nothing you're saying is making any sense.

1049
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,899
How we're not virgins now.

1050
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:20,198
We deflowered each other.
We have each other's flowers.

1051
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,163
Sorry.

1052
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,205
I'm just happy.

1053
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,250
I didn't lose my virginity to you.

1054
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:41,836
Wait...

1055
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:43,838
What?

1056
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,183
I lost my virginity to Cassy Duvall.

1057
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:49,427
Excuse me?

1058
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,057
You said you were a virgin.

1059
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,185
No, I didn't. 'Cause I'm not.

1060
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,483
- And I haven't lied in two years.
- Oh, Jesus.

1061
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,568
Yeah. I probably slept with,
like, six people.

1062
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,740
You don't even know if it's six people?

1063
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,570
I don't keep a list.

1064
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,905
Why wouldn't you keep a list?

1065
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,991
- We're in high school.
- Whoa. Why are you... What?

1066
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:14,328
- Why are you getting so moody?
- You did say you were a virgin.

1067
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,205
I think you might've made an assumption.

1068
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,589
I just had a whole experience
that was wrong.

1069
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,136
- Look, you're deciding to be upset.
- No. I am upset.

1070
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,306
Because you're deciding to be.
Don't be mad at me for this.

1071
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,054
It's stupid. You can't be mad at me
for something I have no control over.

1072
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,056
I just wanted it to be special.

1073
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:34,264
Why? You're gonna have so much
unspecial sex in your life.

1074
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,851
I was on top!
Who the fuck is on top their first time?

1075
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,779
You have any, like, awareness of how many
civilians we've killed

1076
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,277
- since the invasion in Iraq started...
- Shut up!

1077
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:44,448
Shut up.

1078
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,202
Different things can be sad.
It's not all war.

1079
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,169
Are we still going to prom together?

1080
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,708
Sure.

1081
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,735
I thought Miguel was gonna pick me up.

1082
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,537
Well, I was just arriving from work
and it was easier.

1083
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,574
You okay?

1084
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,999
Aww, honey.

1085
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,250
He...

1086
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,376
Oh. Oh, it's okay.

1087
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,051
It's okay.

1088
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,719
What's this sweater?

1089
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:55,183
This is... My friend,
Jenna, gave it to me.

1090
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,604
Who's Jenna?

1091
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,851
My friend.

1092
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,938
You wanna do our favorite Sunday activity?

1093
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,523
I don't have a second shift.

1094
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,234
Yeah.

1095
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,025
<i>The attack came in waves,</i>

1096
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,783
<i>cruise missiles, followed by
the F117 stealth bombers</i>

1097
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,957
<i>with so-called bunker buster bombs.</i>

1098
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,000
<i>With target a bunker believed...</i>

1099
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:02,670
Lady Bird, a bunch of things
arrived for you.

1100
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,746
Holy shit!

1101
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,759
- Since when do you get mail?
- I get mail.

1102
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:13,135
Whatever you're up to,
it's not gonna end well.

1103
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,865
Yes!

1104
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,748
These programmers nowadays
are like kids, man.

1105
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,174
I know.

1106
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,924
But that's why I think with me,
you'll find something different.

1107
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,801
Yeah, but they're like babies.

1108
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,597
I hear you. It's wild.

1109
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:57,596
Which is why I went back to school

1110
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:01,270
and got my MBA at UC Davis
while still working at ISC.

1111
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,972
Oh.

1112
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,932
- Wow. That must've been a lot of work.
- It was.

1113
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,893
I heard ISC's closing now though.

1114
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,478
I heard. Yes.

1115
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:12,566
So the assholes who fired you
are now closing up shop.

1116
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,444
- Feels good.
- Yeah.

1117
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,031
Uh...

1118
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,701
What else is supposed to happen?

1119
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,912
Oh, I, uh, thought we'd...

1120
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,540
talk about the position.

1121
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,625
How'd it go?

1122
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,841
Let's go buy a big bag of Doritos
and eat them in the car

1123
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,971
- to celebrate your wait list.
- Okay.

1124
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:44,063
But don't tell Mom about the Doritos
or the wait list.

1125
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,936
- Hey.
- Hi, son.

1126
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,734
Wait. What are you doing here?

1127
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,777
Well, um...

1128
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,322
I guess we're, uh,
going for the same job then.

1129
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:58,573
Looks like it.

1130
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,000
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

1131
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,956
- This-This way? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

1132
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,553
I know it was you
who did the just married thing.

1133
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,221
It wasn't me.

1134
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,094
I'm not going to punish you.

1135
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,641
Oh. Why not?

1136
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,226
It was funny.

1137
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:28,142
Sister Gina and I drove all the way home
before we noticed people were honking.

1138
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,522
Really?

1139
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:35,983
To be fair, I wasn't just married
to Jesus. It's been 40 years.

1140
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,317
Well, he's a lucky guy.

1141
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,574
I read your college essay.

1142
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,830
You clearly love Sacramento.

1143
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,582
- I do?
- You write about Sacramento

1144
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,380
so affectionately and with such care.

1145
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,549
Well, I was just describing it.

1146
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,173
Well, it comes across as love.

1147
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,755
Sure. I guess I pay attention.

1148
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,759
Don't you think
they are maybe the same thing?

1149
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,433
Love and attention?

1150
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,482
Guess you won't be
going to any dances in college.

1151
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,192
This is our last one.

1152
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,869
You know Davis has a terrific theater

1153
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,038
if you're still interested in theater.

1154
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,787
- Are ya?
- I'm probably no good at acting.

1155
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:31,625
Why don't I look like the girls
in the magazines?

1156
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,503
It's too bad I can't meet
this Kyle before prom.

1157
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:36,960
Well, he's not my boyfriend anymore.

1158
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,669
I mean, maybe he never even was.

1159
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,220
Well, I'd still like to meet him.

1160
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,599
It's too tight. Fuck.

1161
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,138
Well, I suggested you not have
that second helping of pasta.

1162
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,099
- Mom.
- Honey, you seem upset about it

1163
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,810
- and I'm trying to help.
- You're giving me an eating disorder.

1164
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:56,692
I wish
I could get an eating disorder.

1165
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,781
I love it.

1166
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,367
Is it too pink?

1167
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:14,371
What?

1168
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:21,091
Why can't you say I look nice?

1169
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,052
I thought you didn't even care
what I think.

1170
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,976
- I still want you to think I look good.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

1171
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:29,645
I was telling you the truth.
You want me to lie?

1172
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,018
No. I mean, I just wish...

1173
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,016
I just...

1174
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,190
I wish that you liked me.

1175
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,277
Of course I love you.

1176
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,077
But do you like me?

1177
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:54,379
I want you to be the very best version
of yourself that you can be.

1178
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,840
What if this is the best version?

1179
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,564
You look really pretty.

1180
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,141
- Really?
- Yeah.

1181
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:16,726
You look like a badass girl in a band.

1182
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:18,937
Thanks.

1183
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:22,940
Um...

1184
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,151
I guess that's my date.

1185
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:29,034
You aren't gonna get in a car with a guy
who honks, are ya?

1186
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:31,081
I think, yes, I am.

1187
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,418
Let me get your picture.

1188
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,245
Your mom's pissed,
she had to work a double.

1189
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,080
Even you deserve better than this.

1190
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,001
Have a good time.

1191
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,336
Yeah. Good luck.

1192
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,467
- See ya.
- See ya.

1193
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:49,809
- I think she's weird.
- She is weird.

1194
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,055
Hey, guys.

1195
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:53,058
I guess I'll just sit shotgun.

1196
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,138
Yeah.

1197
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,401
- You look really nice, Kyle.
- You look good.

1198
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,603
Thanks.

1199
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:02,605
Hi.

1200
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,235
- Hi.
- Hey.

1201
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:10,613
Hey, what's going on, man?

1202
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,583
Hey. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

1203
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:17,290
Okay.

1204
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,997
Hey, do you guys wanna ditch prom
and just go to Mike's instead?

1205
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,878
Yeah. I hate dances.

1206
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,129
Yes.

1207
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,051
Yeah. Okay. No prom.

1208
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,564
I love it.

1209
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,447
I actually want to go to prom.

1210
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,573
Okay. Yeah. I mean...

1211
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,538
I don't really want to do that.

1212
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:58,752
Can you... Can you take me to my friend,
Julie's house, please?

1213
01:10:58,838 --> 01:10:59,828
Sure.

1214
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,502
Who's Julie?

1215
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:05,797
She's my best friend.

1216
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,524
Julie, honey?

1217
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,226
There's someone here to see you.

1218
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,158
- Hey.
- Hey.

1219
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,286
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'm fine.

1220
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,292
What happened?

1221
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:43,793
Nothing really. Nothing.

1222
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,175
Why are you crying?

1223
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:48,878
Just crying.

1224
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,055
Some people aren't built happy, you know.

1225
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:02,475
Oh, my gosh.

1226
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:03,855
We ate all the cheese.

1227
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,564
It's okay. Lots of cheese vary in size.

1228
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,865
- This one was a small one.
- It's so small.

1229
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,283
- It was tiny.
- That's not our fault.

1230
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,780
What-What were we to do?

1231
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,988
Fuck it! Let's just go to prom.

1232
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,663
Doesn't your mom have a dress?

1233
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,787
Let's be honest.
I've had a dress for months.

1234
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,251
It's purple.

1235
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,249
- It is?
- Uh-hmm, you're really gonna like it.

1236
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,830
- Come and see it.
- Okay.

1237
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,961
Cracker time. Dress time.

1238
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,041
I hope it fits.

1239
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:08,883
People make so much noise in the movies,
but it's really not a big thing.

1240
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,960
You can totally be quiet during it.

1241
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,636
Was it amazing though?

1242
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,509
I wanted it so badly,

1243
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:19,014
but then I found that when it happened...

1244
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,812
I- I really like dry humping much more.

1245
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:28,190
You're not a virgin.

1246
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,692
- I can't wait for state fair.
- Ah, I know.

1247
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,648
Log ride.

1248
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,036
- Shit.
- What?

1249
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,666
I'm not gonna be here this summer,
like, all summer, basically.

1250
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,664
- Why not?
- My dad, my real dad,

1251
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,495
he resurfaced in Yellowstone,

1252
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,048
and he wants me to come there
for the summer,

1253
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,083
before I start SCC.

1254
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:52,922
Oh.

1255
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:57,598
I'm not going anywhere to college,
so it seemed like a good opportunity.

1256
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:58,720
Yeah.

1257
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,353
I'm gonna miss
the fuck out of you.

1258
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,642
I probably won't get in, so

1259
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,068
I'll go to Davis
and I'll see you every day.

1260
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:21,622
Now, I want spirits to enforce,
and art to enchant,

1261
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,370
and my ending is despair.

1262
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:25,910
Unless I be relieved by prayer,

1263
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:29,918
which pierces so that
it assaults mercy itself

1264
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,250
and freeze all faults.

1265
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,336
As you from crimes would pardon thee.

1266
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,468
Let your indulgence set me free.

1267
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,174
Yes!

1268
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:41,804
Ooh!

1269
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:47,769
<i>Christine "Lady Bird" McPherson.</i>

1270
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,189
Yeah!

1271
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,896
Cheers.

1272
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,652
To Miguel and his new job.

1273
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,278
- Yay.
- Here, here. Yes.

1274
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,611
- To Lady Bird going to Davis.
- To Davis.

1275
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,446
- Congratulations.
- Good school.

1276
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:06,284
Hey. So I talked to my manager and, um,
you could totally take over my old job.

1277
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:09,120
- Great. Thanks, Miguel.
- I'm so proud of you, Lady Bird.

1278
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,421
You walked weird across the stage,
but you did it!

1279
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,499
- I didn't walk weird.
- Well, it seemed a little weird.

1280
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:16,711
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

1281
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,670
Aw, I missed you guys.

1282
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,506
Oh, did you find out about the wait list?

1283
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,966
Oh, fuck.

1284
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,141
What?

1285
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,349
I'm not even in yet,
so this might not even be a problem.

1286
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,316
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have gone behind your back.

1287
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:39,150
I just... It's not like I'm definitely
going to New York.

1288
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:41,485
Mom.

1289
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,117
Mom.

1290
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:47,541
Aren't you, sort of, proud
that I'm so close to getting in?

1291
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,243
Just a little?

1292
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:51,704
I mean...
yes, I know it was probably easier

1293
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:55,257
because 9-11 and less people
applying with terrorism and all that,

1294
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,630
but still though, I'm sorry.

1295
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,303
I know I can lie
and not be a good person, but...

1296
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,299
please, Mom.

1297
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:05,476
Please. I'm so sorry.

1298
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,177
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1299
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,558
I- I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

1300
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:11,356
I'm ungrateful and I'm so sorry.

1301
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:13,149
I'm so sorry I wanted more.

1302
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:17,779
Just... Please!

1303
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:18,855
Talk to me.

1304
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,658
I know I'm-I'm so bad!

1305
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,825
I know I am.

1306
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,778
But please just talk to me, Mom.

1307
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,534
Mom, please talk to me.

1308
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,133
Here.

1309
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,304
Then next one.

1310
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,051
That'll be three dollars.

1311
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:51,980
You passed.

1312
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,398
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1313
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,817
Thanks.

1314
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:57,235
It's not a thanking situation.

1315
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,108
You either pass or you don't pass.

1316
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,778
Yay.

1317
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,111
Come in.

1318
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,621
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1319
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,037
You remembered.

1320
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,292
You're my only daughter.

1321
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,043
Well, Shelly too. Kind of.

1322
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,965
Thanks.

1323
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,214
Make a wish.

1324
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,515
Are you and Mom gonna
get a divorce over this?

1325
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:36,817
No. We can't afford to.

1326
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:39,020
Dad.

1327
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,361
I'm kidding, no.

1328
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,652
I love your mom.

1329
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:43,983
Does Mom hate me?

1330
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:47,787
You both have such
strong personalities.

1331
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,033
She doesn't know how to help you
and it frustrates her.

1332
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:53,788
I wish she'd talk to me.

1333
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:56,541
She will. I know.

1334
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,791
Happy 18.

1335
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:01,875
Thanks.

1336
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,211
Do you want some?

1337
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,472
Yes.

1338
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:10,016
One pack of Camel Lights please,

1339
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:11,719
and a Scratcher,

1340
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,100
<i>and a Playgirl.</i>

1341
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,180
ID.

1342
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,483
That'll be 10.87.

1343
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,687
Oh, um, it's my birthday today.

1344
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:25,070
I'm 18, which is why all these things,
I can buy them.

1345
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,775
Okay. Happy birthday.

1346
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,492
Thanks.

1347
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:04,689
With her scholarships and then if we
refinance the house, then where are we?

1348
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,286
You're only supposed to use it
for emergencies.

1349
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,245
It's my tracking device.

1350
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,337
- Thank you for driving.
- You're welcome.

1351
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,674
You're not coming?

1352
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:08,798
You can't walk up
to the gates anymore, anyway.

1353
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,014
Yeah, but I'm going to college.

1354
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,557
Well, Dad will walk you to security.

1355
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,718
Parking's too expensive here.

1356
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,581
There it is.

1357
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:25,916
There it is.

1358
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:27,914
Hello.

1359
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,015
It's okay.

1360
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:48,481
She'll be back.

1361
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:51,942
She'll come back.

1362
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:10,104
<i>She was worried that there would
be errors or mistakes or something,</i>

1363
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,062
<i>that you'd judge her writing abilities.</i>

1364
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,772
I wouldn't do that.

1365
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,732
<i>I thought you should have them,</i>

1366
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:21,867
<i>but I want you to know
how much she loves you,</i>

1367
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:24,949
<i>but also don't tell her
I salvaged them, okay?</i>

1368
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,667
Okay.

1369
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,677
- Hey.
- Hey.

1370
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,897
Do you believe in God?

1371
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,270
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

1372
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,068
Really? Uh, it's ridiculous.

1373
01:23:57,283 --> 01:24:01,823
People call each other by names
that their parents made up for them,

1374
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:03,653
but they won't believe in God.

1375
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,202
What's your name?

1376
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,708
Christine. My name is Christine.

1377
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,255
Hey. I'm David.

1378
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:15,627
You shake.

1379
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,051
- I shake.
- Okay.

1380
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:20,504
- Where you from?
- Sacramento.

1381
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,806
Sorry. Where?

1382
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,133
San Francisco.

1383
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,344
Oh, cool. Yeah.
San Francisco's a great city.

1384
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:28,519
Really.

1385
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,195
Bruce. Bruce.

1386
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,575
No. My name is David.

1387
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:48,497
Jesus Christ. You have really bad music.

1388
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,621
It's all greatest hits.

1389
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,418
But they're the greatest.

1390
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:53,791
What's wrong with that?

1391
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,055
Oh, God!

1392
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:05,598
I'm sorry.

1393
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,274
What do you want us to do? She's drunk.

1394
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,216
Excuse me. What day is it?

1395
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:23,919
Sunday.

1396
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:25,220
Thank you.

1397
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,493
<i>Hi.
You've reached the McPherson family.</i>

1398
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,374
<i>Please leave a message. Thank you.</i>

1399
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,168
Hi, Mom and Dad.

1400
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:46,839
It's me. Christine.

1401
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:51,260
<i>It's the name you gave me.
It's a good one.</i>

1402
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:55,723
Dad, this is more for Mom.

1403
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,564
Hey, Mom.

1404
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,147
Did you feel emotional the first time
that you drove in Sacramento?

1405
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:13,446
<i>I did, and I wanted to tell you,</i>

1406
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,498
<i>but we weren't really talking
when it happened.</i>

1407
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,702
<i>All those bends I've known my whole life,</i>

1408
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:25,131
<i>and stores and the whole thing.</i>

1409
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:46,903
<i>But I wanted to tell you...</i>

1410
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,027
I love you.

1411
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,032
Thank you. I'm...

1412
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,990
Thank you.
