Yeah, I sure do know
what I'm going to do with the money.

686

OK, which will it be?
The Sentinel or the Landlord?

Yes, sir.

1007
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:12,059
- Melvin, are you lying?
- No, sir.

1008
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:20,358
I want you to know that...

1009
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:27,161
...there is a still, small voice
that many people are blessed with,

1010
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:31,588
that tells them
when the truth is being spoken.

1011
01:23:34,133 --> 01:23:38,344
It's been said,
"What doth it profit a man

1012
01:23:38,554 --> 01:23:43,512
if he gain the whole world
yet lose his soul?"

1013
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:51,648
Now, if you're lying, Melvin,
which you are in my opinion,

1014
01:23:51,858 --> 01:23:59,071
your soul may be in jeopardy but that's
not really what I'm concerned with now.

1015
01:23:59,282 --> 01:24:02,069
I'm concerned with your hide.

1016
01:24:04,162 --> 01:24:08,325
Because if I find that
you're lying before this court,

1017
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:13,203
I'll make it a special duty
to have a piece of your hide.

1018
01:24:14,338 --> 01:24:19,084
I'll direct the District Attorney to
bring a criminal case against you.

1019
01:24:20,177 --> 01:24:24,305
And I'll make it my special project
that if you're convicted,

1020
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:28,382
I will recommend
that you do time in prison.

1021
01:24:31,814 --> 01:24:35,265
And I want you to know
Nevada State Prison's no country club,

1022
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:40,478
like Gabbs local jail
or wherever it was you served time.

1023
01:24:47,788 --> 01:24:53,623
If you're lying, you go straight
to Nevada State Prison.

1024
01:24:54,878 --> 01:24:57,629
All right, Melvin?

1025
01:24:57,839 --> 01:24:59,582
You bet.

1026
01:24:59,799 --> 01:25:01,293
Your Honour.

1027
01:25:03,511 --> 01:25:05,551
[Sighs]

1028
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:08,139
Brother Dummar...

1029
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:14,179
I want the truth.

1030
01:25:20,152 --> 01:25:22,987
Where did this so-called will come from?

1031
01:25:25,741 --> 01:25:30,617
It... uh... Some man brought it
by the station where I was working.

1032
01:25:32,414 --> 01:25:34,870
He left it there.

1033
01:25:37,252 --> 01:25:41,748
Are you gonna persist in giving the
answers elicited from you this morning?

1034
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,172
Yes, sir.

1035
01:25:46,386 --> 01:25:49,671
Do you know who wrote the will?

1036
01:25:49,889 --> 01:25:51,633
No, I don't

1037
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:56,013
Did you in any way participate
in the preparation of the will?

1038
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:58,435
No, sir.

1039
01:26:03,152 --> 01:26:05,145
I've done my best, gentlemen.

1040
01:26:05,363 --> 01:26:08,233
[Courtroom murmurs]

1041
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:12,612
Melvin, you did it. On July 6,
they determine the validity of the will.

1042
01:26:12,828 --> 01:26:14,987
Like he says,
it's the only will we got.

1043
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:17,993
With the testimony
by handwriting experts,

1044
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:22,123
the will's gonna be admitted to
probate. You'll get your inheritance.

1045
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:25,338
- You think so?
- It's gonna be a long road.

1046
01:26:25,549 --> 01:26:28,384
But we won the first battle, I can tell.

1047
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:32,300
The T-shirt people called again.

1048
01:26:33,473 --> 01:26:37,850
Look, they're worth an easy 15,000.
What do you say?

1049
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:41,145
No, I don't think so, man.

1050
01:26:41,356 --> 01:26:43,645
You can use the cash.

1051
01:26:43,858 --> 01:26:46,065
What's the matter, you want to get paid?

1052
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:50,109
No... They started paving the freeway
down from the gas station.

1053
01:26:50,323 --> 01:26:54,403
- In two weeks, you'll be Ionely there.
- Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1054
01:26:54,619 --> 01:26:58,616
- You won, Mel!
- What are you so worried about?

1055
01:26:58,831 --> 01:27:01,501
I just hope you don't
have any illusions.

1056
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:05,244
They'll fight in every court they can,
the relatives, Summa...

1057
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:08,832
Meanwhile, the government
will take out taxes, the state...

1058
01:27:09,049 --> 01:27:12,335
Lawyers'll take legal fees.
Money's gonna be siphoned off.

1059
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:16,385
Yeah, listen, I've known that
since I first found that will.

1060
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:19,054
What do you mean?

1061
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:23,396
I mean, you think that Melvin Dummar
is gonna get $156 million?

1062
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,764
Or anything like it?

1063
01:27:25,983 --> 01:27:28,652
Nah, I'm not gonna see that money.

1064
01:27:29,736 --> 01:27:31,729
That's all right.

1065
01:27:33,156 --> 01:27:35,647
Cos you know what happened?

1066
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:42,822
Howard Hughes
sang Melvin Dummar's song.

1067
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:45,448
That's what happened.

1068
01:27:45,668 --> 01:27:47,460
He sang it.

1069
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,752
He was funny.

1070
01:27:57,555 --> 01:28:02,181
Yeah, he sang it.
Santa's Souped-Up Sleigh.

1071
01:28:02,393 --> 01:28:04,516
I'll see you.

1072
01:28:08,774 --> 01:28:09,972
[Melvin] Sorry.

1073
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,937
That's OK.
Gave me a chance to get 'em fed.

1074
01:28:13,153 --> 01:28:14,731
Sure you wanna do this?

1075
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:19,905
Are you kidding? See my kids,
up there in the fresh air? Oh, yeah.

1076
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:24,531
Go on the back seat. I got some
comic books and a little toy for Farron.

1077
01:28:29,586 --> 01:28:33,666
You're not gonna hassle me when I want
them back at the end of the summer?

1078
01:28:33,882 --> 01:28:36,124
You got my word.

1079
01:28:36,342 --> 01:28:39,546
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Aww, come on.

1080
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:43,178
Bonnie sure is gonna have
her hands full this summer.

1081
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:47,341
- Yeah.
- Give us a kiss.

1082
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:09,197
[Darcy] Bye, Mom!

1083
01:29:25,682 --> 01:29:27,888
Don't wake him up.

1084
01:29:29,936 --> 01:29:32,261
I'll try not to.

1085
01:29:49,205 --> 01:29:52,455
How about lettin' me drive?

1086
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:56,165
- You?
- I'm a darned good driver.

1087
01:29:56,378 --> 01:29:59,213
You haven't driven
since they put out the Hudson.

1088
01:29:59,423 --> 01:30:02,340
I'm a darned good driver, I'll bet you.

1089
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:07,345
All right.

1090
01:30:12,853 --> 01:30:16,720
When we get into Vegas, though,
I'm gonna run it in.

1091
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,348
Slide over.
