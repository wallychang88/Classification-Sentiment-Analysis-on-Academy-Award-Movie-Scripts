1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,925
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

2
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
Let's get a rotation in here.

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
Hey, I found something!

4
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>Hanako...</i>

5
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,282
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

6
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,452
<i>We dig all day.</i>

7
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

8
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,084
<i>and die in.</i>

9
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>Hanako...</i>

10
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,675
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

11
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,962
<i>Today, I head for the post
where my men await.</i>

12
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.</i>

13
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,721
<i>I believe I have organized
everything at home...</i>

14
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,517
<i>but I am sorry I wasn't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

15
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,978
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

16
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>but had to leave
without having the time...</i>

17
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,983
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

18
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

19
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,413
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

20
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,208
Nothing grows here.

21
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:16,214
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

22
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,304
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

23
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,681
There's nothing sacred about this island.

24
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,394
Saigo.

25
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,648
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

26
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,358
and then we can go home.

27
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,030
Saigo!

28
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,200
What did you say, soldier?

29
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,330
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

30
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,625
You there, is that what he said?

31
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,378
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm Kuribayashi.

33
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,173
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

34
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,885
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

35
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,387
Three hours, sir.

36
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,889
Sorry to hear that.

37
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,643
They wouldn't allow me to wire my arrival
after what happened to Admiral Yamamoto.

38
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,020
I understand, sir.

39
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,147
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

40
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,275
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

41
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,820
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

42
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,488
Sorry to hear that.

43
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,657
This way to your quarters.

44
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,535
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

45
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,787
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

46
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,915
No, let's walk.

47
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,542
Walking is good for the health.

48
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,878
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

49
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
So that's Suribachi.

50
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,697
You unpatriotic...

51
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,741
no-good peasants!

52
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
Hey, stop it!

53
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,289
Stand up!

54
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,667
What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,712
These soldiers...

56
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,550
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

57
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,719
I see.

58
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,597
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

59
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,392
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

60
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,519
No, sir.

61
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,063
Then stop beating them.

62
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,732
Deny their lunch rations instead.

63
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,987
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

64
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,702
What is all this?

65
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,537
All this?

66
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,122
Trenches, sir.

67
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,582
Why are the men digging trenches here?

68
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,961
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

69
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,548
Have them stop immediately.

70
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,758
But, General--

71
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,593
And, Captain...

72
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,430
make sure these men get proper breaks.

73
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,224
They look like they're from Mars.

74
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
Stop digging!

75
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,007
Just as well.

76
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,053
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

77
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,473
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

78
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,851
a fine commander.

79
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,523
Better than sake!

80
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,109
I heard he lived in America.

81
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,780
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

82
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,656
Maybe he likes Americans.

83
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,494
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

84
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,373
So now he knows how to beat them.

85
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
I heard from someone in the 204th...

86
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,174
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

87
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,011
but he didn't want the job.

88
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,517
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

89
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,814
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

90
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,400
but your ears are full of wax!

91
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,115
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

92
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,158
They're part of the Navy.

93
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,495
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

94
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,247
Look...

95
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:28,294
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

96
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,814
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

97
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,615
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

98
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,416
Ito, reporting for duty.

99
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,626
Thank you for coming right away.

100
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,505
How much air force
do we have available?

101
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,300
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

102
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,467
Is that all?

103
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,722
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

104
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,352
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

105
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,315
Is this the current defense plan?

106
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,948
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

107
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,661
I don't know exactly.

108
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,706
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adaohi.

109
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,250
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

110
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,170
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands--

111
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,256
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

112
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,555
This will not work.

113
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,183
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

114
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,811
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

115
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,563
moved down to the beaches.

116
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,190
Well, move them back.

117
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,153
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

118
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,406
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

119
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,158
I'm going to walk some more.

120
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,245
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

121
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,757
This one is trouble.

122
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,054
Army commanders usually are, sir.

123
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,140
Another letter?

124
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,435
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

125
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,312
I have a lot of family.

126
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,648
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

127
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,401
Nosey!

128
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,236
Here, let me do you a favor.

129
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,948
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

130
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,826
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,705
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

132
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,458
You mean demoted.

133
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,962
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

134
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,840
No, no, no. This will never pass.

135
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,427
Give me that back!

136
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:17,607
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

137
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,612
Next!

138
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,370
Good!

139
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,523
Are you blind?

140
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,859
Can't you see the target?

141
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,531
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

142
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,908
Do it again!

143
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,459
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an Imperial soldier?

144
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,965
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

145
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,216
Go to the rear!

146
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,347
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

147
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,759
What are those tanks doing here?

148
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,097
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

149
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,933
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

150
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>Taro, America is filled with cars.</i>

151
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...</i>

152
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,882
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

153
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,929
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?</i>

154
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,306
<i>I miss you.</i>

155
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,611
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

156
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,572
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,926
<i>Hanako...</i>

158
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,762
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

159
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.</i>

160
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,895
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

161
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,441
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

162
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,585
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

163
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,090
<i>But there are no women
left on the island to woo.</i>

164
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,495
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

165
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,246
From Chichi Jima.

166
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,421
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

167
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,674
Of course, I know.

168
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,344
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

169
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,430
One who understands horses
the way I do.

170
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,768
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

171
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,812
those were the good old days...

172
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,273
not like these mechanized contraptions.

173
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,819
I could send for another horse...

174
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,196
and we could ride together.

175
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,031
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

176
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:05,413
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

177
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,623
My stallion, Uranus.

178
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,138
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

179
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,685
I bought him in Italy.

180
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,521
They were happy to get rid of him.

181
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,441
He was such a wild horse.

182
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,738
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

183
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,823
such a headstrong horse...

184
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,618
is a perfect match for me.

185
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,667
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

186
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,086
I think that can be arranged.

187
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,223
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

188
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,642
I drank some already.

189
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,777
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

190
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,070
That's fine, as long as we have this.

191
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,202
What is this empty plate?

192
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,874
I have told our cook that all officers will
have the same rations and food as our men.

193
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

194
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,882
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

195
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,300
You're absolutely right.

196
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,271
When you think about it...

197
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,943
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

198
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,279
We still have some battleships left...

199
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:07,451
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

200
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,079
Nishi, what do you mean?

201
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:18,045
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

202
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:24,134
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

203
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,097
The Imperial headquarters...

204
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,642
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

205
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,812
If you want my honest opinion, General...

206
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,440
the best thing to do...

207
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,821
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

208
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,158
And yet, you still came?

209
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,413
Well...

210
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,835
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

211
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
This must be it.

212
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,638
Yes, the enemy must land here.

213
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,186
Run!

214
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,855
Like you were one of the Americans!

215
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,982
Go on! Which direction would you take?

216
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,096
Hey...

217
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,307
I think your general has gone mad.

218
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,021
Look at the gun he has.

219
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,612
He probably took it
from a dead American.

220
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,156
Maybe.

221
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,582
Break time is over.

222
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,543
Back to work!

223
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,924
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

224
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,135
You look pale.

225
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,014
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

226
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,518
But...l...really...need to go.

227
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,165
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

228
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:46,587
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

229
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,508
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

230
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,012
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

231
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,184
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

232
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,729
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

233
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:08,901
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

234
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,235
Five million.

235
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,781
The Americans' technological advancements
cannot be underestimated.

236
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,742
They will cross the beaches eventually.

237
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,829
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

238
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,790
It is inevitable that men will die...

239
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,627
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

240
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,422
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

241
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,216
We should force the enemy
near the island...

242
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,551
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

243
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,096
I agree. That makes the most sense.

244
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,388
Ohsugi...

245
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,141
doesn't the Navy know?

246
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,690
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

247
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,984
The island is now isolated.

248
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:00,244
What's more, I received a new order from
the Imperial headquarters this morning.

249
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,832
The remaining fighter planes are to be
sent back to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

250
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,043
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

251
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,717
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

252
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,877
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

253
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,756
<i>I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.</i>

254
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,012
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

255
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,307
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

256
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,822
Look at this picture.

257
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,785
That's some fancy castle.

258
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,748
You know who this castle was built for?

259
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,375
Someone who was already dead.

260
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,963
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

261
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,591
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

262
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,428
Why are you reading that book anyway?

263
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,723
We're never going to war over there.

264
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,977
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

265
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,730
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

266
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,196
Is this the 312th?

267
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,948
That's right.

268
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,409
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

269
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,748
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

270
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,088
There's an empty space in the back.

271
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,966
Don't mind him.

272
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,679
His friend Kashiwara just died.

273
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,348
That used to be his spot.

274
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,941
But we are all going to die.

275
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,735
That's the plan, isn't it?

276
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,990
For our country, it is an honor.

277
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,577
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

278
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,707
Shimizu, where are you from?

279
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,294
Kanagawa-ken.

280
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,047
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

281
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,425
That's right.

282
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,014
Where were you trained?

283
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,726
Maybe we were at the same school?

284
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,853
No.

285
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,731
I trained in Tokyo.

286
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,483
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

287
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,076
The <i>Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

288
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,131
Hey...

289
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,885
why do you think they put
a <i>Kempeitai</i> in our unit?

290
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,428
I don't know.

291
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,935
He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not <i>Kempeitai.</i>

292
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,898
He went to the <i>Kempeitai</i>
military academy.

293
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,942
Maybe he was kicked out.

294
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,823
He acts like a <i>Kempeitai.</i>

295
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,872
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

296
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,378
He's been put here to spy on us.

297
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,632
Why would he spy on us?

298
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,096
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

299
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,016
You should be careful.

300
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,753
Weed soup again?

301
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,342
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

302
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,972
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

303
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,935
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

304
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,772
we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.

305
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,358
What?

306
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:29,364
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

307
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,616
Back when we could still get sugar...

308
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,706
we sold <i>ampan</i> and <i>kasutera</i> cakes.

309
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,509
However, his <i>Kempeitai</i> brethren...

310
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,929
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

311
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,018
For the war...

312
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,646
For the country...

313
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,692
Why bread?

314
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:14,159
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

315
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,788
When we started making sandwiches...

316
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,501
they took those, too.

317
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,173
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

318
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:37,682
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

319
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,480
and we were out of business.

320
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,194
I should have been a fisherman.

321
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,783
It must have been hard on your wife...

322
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,205
without the shop
and without her husband.

323
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,867
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

324
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,669
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

325
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,185
Thank you very much.

326
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,690
I'm happy to serve the country.

327
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,281
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

328
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:21,328
I beg of you! We have only each other.

329
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,542
This is not the time.

330
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:34,257
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

331
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:39,304
We all have to do our part.

332
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,935
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

333
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,785
I can't eat with you like that.

334
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:09,084
What am I going to do after you die?

335
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,717
I'm not in the coffin yet.

336
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,265
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

337
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,937
They'll never let you come home.

338
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,399
Don't worry.

339
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,528
And now, with the baby.

340
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,511
Can you hear me?

341
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,556
It's Dad.

342
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,601
Listen.

343
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,275
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

344
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,737
It's a secret.

345
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,170
Your dad...

346
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,050
is going to come home for you.

347
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,525
Hurry up!

348
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,488
The enemy approaches!

349
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,583
This is ridiculous!

350
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,461
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

351
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,214
They are all going to die anyway.

352
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,385
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

353
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,024
You wanted to see me, sir?

354
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,735
Care for a drink?

355
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,493
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

356
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,834
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

357
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,460
That's not good.

358
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,048
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

359
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,804
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

360
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,808
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

361
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:58,646
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

362
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,609
We should fight to the death.

363
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:08,364
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

364
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:13,077
Maybe the stand on Iwo will be futile.

365
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,747
Maybe the whole war is futile.

366
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,582
But will you give up then?

367
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,043
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

368
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,462
Until the very last soldier is dead!

369
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,634
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

370
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,012
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

371
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,139
Ohsugi...

372
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:37,727
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

373
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,938
I beg of you...

374
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,691
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

375
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:12,136
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

376
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,392
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

377
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,145
We may have had our differences...

378
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,191
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

379
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,862
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

380
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:36,327
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

381
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,454
I understand.

382
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,333
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

383
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,433
Listen.

384
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,645
The Americans are likely to land here.

385
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,566
Crossfire positions will be here...

386
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:08,735
here...

387
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,029
and here.

388
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,740
The fact is...

389
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:20,204
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

390
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,000
But we have a great advantage.

391
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,587
Can anyone tell me what that is?

392
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,179
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

393
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,805
Very good, Shimizu.

394
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,224
Why is that?

395
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,101
They are not as disciplined...

396
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,979
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

397
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,439
That is correct.

398
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,112
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

399
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,823
He should be your target.

400
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,745
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

401
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,747
Understood?

402
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,220
General, may I speak with you?

403
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,058
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

404
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,521
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

405
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,899
but we don't have any time to waste.

406
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,486
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

407
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,241
Admiral Ichimaru.

408
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
Reporting for duty, sir.

409
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,915
Excuse me.

410
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,918
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

411
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,537
Jupiter!

412
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,667
Jupiter.

413
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,136
Yamazaki...

414
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,307
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us--

415
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,099
I think he's writing about us
in his reports.

416
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,977
He's just writing a letter.

417
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,356
It's been two months, Nozaki.

418
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,609
He would have reported us by now.

419
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,527
How can you be sure?

420
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,330
Will they ever stop?

421
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,833
Day and night, day and night...

422
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,171
It's driving me crazy!

423
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:07,385
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

424
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,222
why don't they hurry up and land?

425
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,196
<i>Tako-Chan...</i>

426
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,534
<i>the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.</i>

427
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:36,038
<i>The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...</i>

428
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:40,709
<i>but they're giving me a hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

429
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,009
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

430
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,103
So they are on their way.

431
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,523
Ready the troops.

432
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,435
Men...

433
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,772
the time has come
to show your true colors.

434
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,067
As a member of the honorable
Imperial Army...

435
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,279
I trust that you will fight with honor.

436
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,495
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

437
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,164
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

438
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,126
the enemy...

439
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:09,131
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

440
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,134
For the mainland...

441
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,179
For our homeland...

442
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,140
Until the very last man.

443
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,186
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

444
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,064
<i>Not one of you...</i>

445
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,901
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

446
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,283
Do not expect to return home alive.

447
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,915
I will always be in front of you.

448
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,717
Long live the Emperor.

449
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,140
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

450
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:47,771
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

451
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,319
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

452
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,613
<i>Takeichi.</i>

453
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:17,384
<i>Every household is assigned a quota
of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

454
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:22,681
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.</i>

455
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,518
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

456
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,731
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.</i>

457
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,692
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

458
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,071
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

459
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,711
No one can shoot me now.

460
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:00,928
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

461
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,853
Doesn't look like Mr. <i>Kempeitai</i>
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?

462
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,731
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

463
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,442
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

464
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,700
His mother made him one after all.

465
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,976
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

466
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,229
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

467
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:56,108
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

468
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,027
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

469
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,947
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

470
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,282
Where do I go then?

471
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,617
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

472
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,848
The shit pot is full.

473
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,100
Someone needs to throw it out.

474
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,043
If anything happens to that pot...

475
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:02,382
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

476
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,285
Is this some kind of a joke?

477
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,788
Why are you always picking on me?

478
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:58,206
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

479
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,765
Shall we commence fire?

480
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,224
Not yet.

481
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,941
The men wish to commence firing.

482
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,783
Hold your fire!

483
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,454
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

484
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,122
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

485
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,217
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

486
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,386
Wait until the beach is full.

487
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,953
Let's go. Commence firing!

488
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,335
Commence firing!

489
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,921
<i>Commence firing!</i>

490
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,069
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

491
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,571
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

492
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,656
However, all other forces are intact...

493
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,076
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

494
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,995
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

495
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,498
Overall, that is good news.

496
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,666
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

497
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,127
Forces are intact.

498
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,299
What is the enemy situation?

499
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:57,469
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

500
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:02,099
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

501
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,810
Currently the enemy front extends...

502
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,979
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

503
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,774
and Chidori airfield south.

504
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,654
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

505
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,907
They are making a two-pronged attack.

506
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,425
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

507
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,994
Take his place!

508
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,538
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

509
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,667
Watch out! Imbecile!

510
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,961
I can't rely on you.

511
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:16,339
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

512
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,008
Hurry up!

513
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,703
Colonel Adaohi is asking
for reinforcements.

514
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:51,374
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

515
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,054
Shoot him!

516
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,397
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

517
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,085
We are losing Suribachi.

518
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:40,257
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

519
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,760
No. You must try to hold them off.

520
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:48,348
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

521
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,225
But, sir...

522
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,853
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

523
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,023
Permit me to die with honor
with my men.

524
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,525
No, Colonel.

525
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,527
<i>This is an order!</i>

526
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,117
Adachi.

527
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,453
Adachi!

528
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:27,387
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

529
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,849
It's over.

530
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,191
Suicide...

531
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,528
That's the only thing left.

532
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,447
But...

533
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,784
Here, take this to your commander.

534
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:38,375
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

535
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,584
Quiet!

536
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,383
Escape is the coward's way.

537
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,802
Sit down!

538
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,023
Men...

539
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:05,985
we are...

540
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,157
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

541
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,413
Don't ever forget that.

542
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,502
The only way left for us...

543
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,339
is to die with honor.

544
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,594
This is our fate...

545
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,598
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

546
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,355
I'll see you there.

547
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,127
Soldiers, farewell!

548
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,493
Stop!

549
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,671
You should die like an honorable soldier.

550
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,090
Look, Shimizu...

551
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,637
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

552
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,266
Our orders are to stay here until death.

553
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,268
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

554
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,062
That's what he said...

555
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,232
over the radio.

556
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:33,943
It's true.

557
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,283
We can die here...

558
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,454
or we can continue fighting.

559
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,752
Which would better serve the Emperor?

560
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,131
Which one?

561
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,696
Where does this go?

562
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,157
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

563
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,082
Do you have orders to move back?

564
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,460
Where are the rest of your men?

565
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,295
All dead.

566
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,715
It's the same with us.

567
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,975
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

568
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,352
Be quiet!

569
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:41,904
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

570
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,922
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

571
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,632
Send a messenger!

572
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,603
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

573
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,739
We will make a run for Motoyama.

574
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,075
There is no cover for two kilometers.

575
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,454
It will be every man for himself.

576
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,962
See you on the other side.

577
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,425
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

578
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,068
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

579
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,444
Stay back.

580
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,613
That's cowardice!

581
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,077
There is no use for a dead soldier.

582
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,192
Wait until the flare is gone.

583
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,053
Crawl forward.

584
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,073
What happened to the messenger?

585
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,700
He never came back.

586
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,331
I will go to Adachi myself.

587
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,709
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

588
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,837
Why not try there, sir?

589
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,944
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

590
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,410
What are your names?

591
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,246
Saigo, from the 312th.

592
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,415
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

593
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,586
You escaped from Suribachi?

594
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,095
How dare you!

595
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,933
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

596
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,812
You should have died...

597
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,107
with your fellow troop members.

598
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,153
You are both a disgrace.

599
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,784
Get on your knees.

600
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,123
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

601
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,770
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

602
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,065
Put down your sword.

603
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,900
Put it down!

604
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,825
What's going on here?

605
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:44,373
These men ran from Suribachi.

606
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:51,714
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

607
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,718
I am very sorry, General.

608
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,221
It's just...

609
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:01,974
Suribachi...

610
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,770
has fallen.

611
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,751
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

612
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,337
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

613
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,506
We must move
our command center north, sir.

614
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,013
Ito...

615
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,351
fight for your fallen brethren...

616
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,896
until the end.

617
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,878
Get up!

618
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,218
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

619
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,011
We are to join him.

620
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,934
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

621
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:33,732
Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

622
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,495
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

623
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,644
Where is Major General Hayashi?

624
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,607
We don't know, sir.

625
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,650
Who is in charge here?

626
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,777
I'm not sure.

627
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,283
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

628
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,560
We're dead.

629
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,652
Pull back!

630
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:02,029
We'll get reinforcements.

631
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:39,191
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

632
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:44,947
Don't sit here like rats!

633
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:49,410
Come out of your caves and fight!

634
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,788
Where is your commander?

635
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,832
We haven't received the order to attack.

636
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,255
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

637
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:05,759
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

638
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,220
There is to be no attack.

639
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,059
We will take back Suribachi...

640
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,645
with or without Kuribayashi.

641
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,566
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

642
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:23,402
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

643
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,946
Your disrespect for senior officers...

644
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,575
puts your men at needless risk.

645
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,620
I suggest you go back to your cave...

646
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:37,666
or hand over your men.

647
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,094
Enough.

648
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,263
We'll do it ourselves.

649
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,734
That's against regulations.

650
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:07,654
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

651
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,188
I won't go back.

652
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,442
I've had enough of cave fighting.

653
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,531
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

654
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,503
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

655
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,634
I will take out one of their machines.

656
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:40,497
Hurry.

657
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,293
What is the status?

658
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,838
A thousand men were lost...

659
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,882
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

660
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,843
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

661
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,763
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

662
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,891
Hayashi.

663
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,726
Damn you!

664
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,312
And the American advancement?

665
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:07,691
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

666
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:12,112
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

667
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,823
This just arrived.

668
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,116
Read it.

669
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,623
From headquarters...

670
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:29,463
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to Iwo at this time.

671
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:34,384
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

672
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,346
and die for your country."

673
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,532
Bring him in.

674
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,341
Bring him in.

675
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:49,936
Shall I finish him off?

676
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,689
No. Treat him.

677
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,359
But, sir--

678
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,153
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

679
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,613
Endo, treat him.

680
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,824
We are low on morphine as it is.

681
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:07,120
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

682
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:10,248
Son, have you ever met one?

683
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:12,918
Treat him.

684
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,499
Where are you, American tanks?

685
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,210
Come and get me!

686
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,477
How is the prisoner doing?

687
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,312
He is awake, sir.

688
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:21,445
I will question the prisoner
for information.

689
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,219
Damn.

690
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,098
I've had enough of this.

691
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,392
I'm going to surrender.

692
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,023
Go ahead and arrest me.

693
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:27,028
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

694
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,907
To report treasonous thoughts.

695
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:37,205
I was put here because...

696
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:40,792
I was discharged from the <i>Kempeitai.</i>

697
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,213
Discharged?

698
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:53,138
I had only been in service
for five days.

699
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:57,475
Shimizu...

700
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,395
you must always be firm.

701
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:05,734
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

702
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,407
That's unpatriotic.

703
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,242
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

704
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:29,758
You do not have the Imperial flag
properly displayed.

705
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,176
I'm sorry.

706
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,846
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

707
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,724
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

708
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,185
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

709
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,624
Get that dog to shut up.

710
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,377
What was that, sir?

711
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:10,799
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

712
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,426
I am very sorry, sir.

713
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,893
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

714
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:26,773
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

715
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,197
Take the dog in the back.

716
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:35,907
It's only a dog.

717
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:38,702
It won't happen again.

718
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,578
Take it out back.

719
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,747
Keep the children inside.

720
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,166
Hurry up.

721
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,800
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

722
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:37,510
and never let him out.

723
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,232
It's taken care of, sir.

724
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,523
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

725
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:38,696
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

726
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,866
You are unpatriotic!

727
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,458
I was discharged for insubordination...

728
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:53,378
and sent here.

729
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,930
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

730
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,101
At least now only the enemy hates you.

731
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:14,983
I don't blame the dog.

732
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:41,926
<i>Taro...</i>

733
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:45,263
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

734
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,433
<i>The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

735
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,519
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

736
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:54,898
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

737
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:42,023
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

738
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,026
No, it's just a letter.

739
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:48,696
It's from his mother.

740
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,241
"Sam...

741
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,620
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

742
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:57,789
I hope that you like them.

743
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,166
Yesterday...

744
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:05,671
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

745
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:11,302
They ran all over the neighborhood.

746
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,597
By the time we found them...

747
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:20,812
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

748
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:24,440
Don't worry about us.

749
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:29,779
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

750
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:33,866
Remember what I said to you...

751
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,122
always do what is right...

752
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,417
because it is right.

753
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:47,255
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

754
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:48,840
and your safe return.

755
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:51,759
Love, Mom."

756
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:29,046
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

757
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,383
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

758
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,768
Okubo, come here.

759
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,235
How are we on ammunition?

760
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,739
Not good, sir.

761
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,243
Our mortars have been taken out...

762
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,912
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

763
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:30,042
We have only our rifles.

764
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:33,129
Okubo...

765
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:37,091
you are now in charge of the men.

766
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:43,431
We can no longer hold this area.

767
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:47,685
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

768
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:53,733
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

769
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,278
What about you, sir?

770
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:04,118
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

771
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,496
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

772
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,582
What are you talking about, sir?

773
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:14,253
Your first order of business...

774
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,048
is to find some water.

775
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,201
Men...

776
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,287
do your best.

777
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:54,210
Do what is right...

778
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:58,297
because it is right.

779
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:01,717
Understood?

780
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:14,480
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

781
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:18,067
It has been a great honor...

782
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:20,736
to serve...

783
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,489
under you.

784
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:04,196
Hand me my rifle.

785
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,889
I'm sorry, Okubo.

786
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:53,222
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

787
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,141
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

788
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,647
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

789
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,607
None of them have come back.

790
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,901
You can't plan strategy like this!

791
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:20,583
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

792
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,751
He's right.

793
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:30,926
I don't know anything about the enemy.

794
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:35,347
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

795
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:43,272
but they weren't.

796
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,654
I was taught...

797
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,033
that they were savages...

798
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:57,828
but that American soldier...

799
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:07,463
his mother's words...

800
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:13,510
were the same as my mother's.

801
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:18,724
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

802
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,810
and our country...

803
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,689
but I don't want to die for nothing.

804
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,030
What do you think?

805
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,377
You...

806
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,422
haven't lived enough to realize...

807
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,721
what you are sacrificing.

808
01:48:06,063 --> 01:48:08,273
Will you surrender with me?

809
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:31,046
Careful.

810
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:38,429
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

811
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,181
I'll make up an excuse.

812
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,976
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

813
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:46,145
We'll be gone before they even notice.

814
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:51,608
Pretend that you have dysentery.

815
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:54,653
Give me your dysentery look.

816
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:06,290
I guess that'll have to do.

817
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:16,800
Where are you going?

818
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,802
I've got dysentery.

819
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,180
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

820
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:23,474
If you are, take me with you.

821
01:49:24,099 --> 01:49:26,685
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

822
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:37,654
Where are you going?

823
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:40,365
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

824
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:41,825
You two! Stop!

825
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:48,874
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

826
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:08,644
Miura, you're on guard.

827
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,313
Make sure we have no more deserters.

828
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,234
What unit were you with?

829
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:45,949
Higashiyama 314th.

830
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,127
Did you hear...

831
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:02,424
I heard that they would give you a meal.

832
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:05,636
A meal...

833
01:52:09,806 --> 01:52:11,516
That sounds good.

834
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:18,190
I'm from Yokohama, too.

835
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:24,947
After this is over, you can come visit me.

836
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:42,441
Lieutenant!

837
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,901
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

838
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:29,780
who wants to surrender.

839
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:46,523
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

840
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:49,109
and join our forces at the front.

841
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:56,241
Listen.

842
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:59,828
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

843
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:04,916
Don't waste a bullet!

844
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,544
Not a single one.

845
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:09,671
Don't shoot recklessly.

846
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:14,402
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

847
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:20,450
Are there no officers?

848
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,581
You all did a good job making it here.

849
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:29,292
Fujita, water for them.

850
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:36,841
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

851
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:41,805
I'm sorry.

852
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:44,474
At least you can rest.

853
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:01,283
You look familiar.

854
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:08,123
You almost lost your head.

855
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:15,213
That was the second time you saved me.

856
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:19,467
The first time...

857
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:23,805
was the day you landed on the island.

858
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:29,519
Of course. I remember.

859
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:32,814
Well, everything happens in threes.

860
01:58:49,497 --> 01:58:50,832
<i>Hanako...</i>

861
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,252
<i>This letter will probably
never get to you...</i>

862
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:56,004
<i>but...</i>

863
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,923
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

864
01:59:00,383 --> 01:59:02,927
<i>For five days, we've been
without water and food.</i>

865
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:06,014
<i>To survive...</i>

866
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:09,851
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

867
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,689
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

868
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,608
<i>But...</i>

869
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:20,695
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

870
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:28,787
Dig up some worms.

871
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:50,600
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

872
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:53,895
<i>and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.</i>

873
01:59:54,062 --> 01:59:57,565
<i>All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.</i>

874
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,320
<i>I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.</i>

875
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:05,073
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

876
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:10,787
<i>For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

877
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:14,916
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

878
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:24,592
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

879
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:29,681
That must have been quite a journey.

880
02:00:35,437 --> 02:00:37,021
You are quite a soldier.

881
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:40,775
No, sir.

882
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:43,153
I'm just a simple baker.

883
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:45,780
You were a baker?

884
02:00:47,282 --> 02:00:48,324
Any family?

885
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:50,660
A wife...

886
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:55,832
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

887
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:00,962
I haven't met her yet.

888
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:08,636
It's strange.

889
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:14,726
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

890
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:20,982
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

891
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,341
A radio transmission from the homeland.

892
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,481
<i>For General Kuribayashi...</i>

893
02:02:01,648 --> 02:02:06,027
<i>and his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...</i>

894
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:10,782
<i>a song will be sung by the children of
Nagano, which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

895
02:02:11,115 --> 02:02:15,245
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

896
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:18,706
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

897
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:23,920
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

898
02:02:27,298 --> 02:02:30,927
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

899
02:02:31,094 --> 02:02:35,765
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

900
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:41,229
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

901
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:48,278
<i>As long as we stand</i>

902
02:02:48,736 --> 02:02:52,824
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

903
02:02:52,991 --> 02:02:57,662
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

904
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:05,628
<i>We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price</i>

905
02:03:08,006 --> 02:03:11,593
<i>Our proud island</i>

906
02:03:12,176 --> 02:03:14,846
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

907
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,494
Do me a favor.

908
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:43,958
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

909
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:47,295
Everything happens in threes.

910
02:04:16,741 --> 02:04:18,785
We will make a general attack.

911
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:22,205
Although Japan has lost...

912
02:04:22,914 --> 02:04:24,791
one day...

913
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:27,794
our people will praise your dedication.

914
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:32,966
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

915
02:04:35,677 --> 02:04:37,971
Be proud to die for your country.

916
02:04:45,103 --> 02:04:47,605
I will always be in front of you.

917
02:07:30,226 --> 02:07:31,477
No more.

918
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:34,689
No more.

919
02:07:42,738 --> 02:07:44,448
Thank you, Fujita.

920
02:08:16,606 --> 02:08:17,773
This is an order.

921
02:09:26,217 --> 02:09:27,426
You again.

922
02:09:30,888 --> 02:09:34,684
I have one more favor to ask of you.

923
02:09:36,727 --> 02:09:37,937
Bury me...

924
02:09:39,063 --> 02:09:41,065
so that no one will find me.

925
02:09:55,663 --> 02:09:56,664
<i>Taro...</i>

926
02:09:57,081 --> 02:09:58,541
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

927
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,794
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

928
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:06,173
<i>but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.</i>

929
02:10:09,635 --> 02:10:11,220
<i>I drove home...</i>

930
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:13,347
<i>but...</i>

931
02:10:13,764 --> 02:10:16,392
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

932
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:30,823
Is this still Japanese soil?

933
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:42,084
This is still Japan.

934
02:14:02,993 --> 02:14:04,370
Be careful.
