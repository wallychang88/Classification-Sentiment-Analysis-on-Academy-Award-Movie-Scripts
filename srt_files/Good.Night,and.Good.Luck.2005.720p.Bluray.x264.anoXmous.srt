1
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:38,124
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his career with CBS.

2
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,585
When World War Two broke out...

3
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,462
...his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us...

4
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:46,007
...through his "This Is London"
radio series.

5
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:48,467
He started with us all...

6
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:52,013
...many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy...

7
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,557
...with the news documentary show,
"See It Now".

8
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,475
He threw stones at giants.

9
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,813
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers...

10
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:03,107
...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover...

11
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:08,112
...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

12
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,867
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...

13
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:16,370
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...

14
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,165
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...

15
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,586
...inspired, lectured, and taught.

16
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:26,046
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,301
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...

18
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,636
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

19
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,450
This might just do nobody any good.

20
00:03:56,326 --> 00:04:00,080
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...

21
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,374
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...

22
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,336
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...

23
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,797
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

24
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,134
But the elaborate structure
of networks...

25
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:16,054
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

26
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,350
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...

27
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,979
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio and television.

28
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,022
And if what I say is responsible...

29
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,025
...I alone am responsible
for the saying of it.

30
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,404
Our history will be
what we make of it.

31
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,866
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...

32
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,577
...and there should be preserved...

33
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,496
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...

34
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:45,583
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...

35
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,211
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...

36
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,923
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

37
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:56,261
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

38
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:00,807
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

39
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:03,226
Our mass media reflect this.

40
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,604
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...

41
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:09,148
...and recognize
that television in the main...

42
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:13,444
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...

43
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,239
...then television
and those who finance it...

44
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:19,242
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...

45
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:22,161
...may see a totally
different picture too late.

46
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,336
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

47
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:24,306
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

48
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,516
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

49
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,434
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

50
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:30,646
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

51
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,899
Morning, Johnny!

52
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,111
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

53
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,445
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

54
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,740
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...

55
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,618
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

56
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:46,036
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,413
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

58
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,333
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

59
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,335
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

60
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:54,711
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

61
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,296
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

62
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,174
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

63
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,055
Let me see this.

64
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:12,312
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

65
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,064
You promise to be a loyal American?

66
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,316
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

67
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,110
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

68
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:20,195
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

69
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,655
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,866
Are you now
or have you ever been...

71
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,202
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

72
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:29,830
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

73
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:32,124
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

74
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,794
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

75
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:38,213
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

76
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,632
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

77
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,885
- Maybe you should talk to Murrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

78
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,847
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

79
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:52,102
If I don't sign it,
they'll fire me.

80
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,567
Sign it.

81
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,153
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

82
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,866
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...

83
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:11,621
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...

84
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,583
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

85
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,628
"Yes, 'tis but a violet..."

86
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,089
"...glistening with dew."

87
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,635
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

88
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,388
"So in our heart..."

89
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:31,391
"...our love for you..."

90
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:34,977
"...lies unrevealed."

91
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,606
I used to...

92
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,784
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...

93
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:57,792
...especially over the past
18-19 months, when we've been...

94
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,462
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

95
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,090
I didn't think that...

96
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:09,387
...I could be... touched very deeply.

97
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,847
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

98
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:13,974
- It's short.
- How long is the piece?

99
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,810
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

100
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,687
It can't stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

101
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:21,107
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

102
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,527
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...

103
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,738
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...

104
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:30,282
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

105
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:33,619
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

106
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,288
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...

107
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:39,708
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

108
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:43,128
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

109
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:46,340
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Franklin...

110
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:47,675
...than with Mr. Hoover.

111
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,219
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

112
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,763
"At home with Ben Franklin.
His electricity awards."

113
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,765
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

114
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:58,560
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

115
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,395
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.

116
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,023
- New York Times? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

117
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,817
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...

118
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:09,613
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

119
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,366
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not an obit piece.

120
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:15,077
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

121
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,871
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...

122
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:21,875
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...

123
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,919
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...

124
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:26,755
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

125
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:28,382
Can you take this?

126
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:31,051
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...

127
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:34,638
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...

128
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,140
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

129
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:39,351
May I finish?
It's national security!

130
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:42,229
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

131
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:47,108
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

132
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:51,279
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

133
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,699
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

134
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:57,327
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

135
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,121
Thank you, John.

136
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,415
There's not much there.

137
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,044
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

138
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:09,714
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

139
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,344
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

140
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:17,180
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

141
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:22,519
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...

142
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:27,232
...read some Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

143
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,150
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

144
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:32,570
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

145
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,948
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...

146
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,784
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...

147
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:41,162
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

148
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,706
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

149
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,087
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

150
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,464
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

151
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:53,174
No.

152
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,676
Then it's not McCarthy.

153
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:58,304
Isn't it?

154
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:05,937
Milo Radulovich.

155
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,609
What happens to your children...

156
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,612
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

157
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:17,656
If I am being judged
on my relatives...

158
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:23,746
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

159
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,875
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

160
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:33,589
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

161
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:36,008
...why their father
is a security risk?

162
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:41,639
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...

163
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:46,143
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...

164
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:49,229
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

165
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:57,237
Well, that's new.

166
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,074
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

167
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,452
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

168
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,120
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

169
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,248
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...

170
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,583
...both sides, no commentary.

171
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,669
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...

172
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,421
We're giving them
the information up front...

173
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,089
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.

174
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,216
Frank, hold on.

175
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,635
I've searched my conscience.

176
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,013
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

177
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,974
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...

178
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,101
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

179
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:31,146
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

180
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,939
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

181
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:35,108
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

182
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,153
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...

183
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,279
Do me a favor...

184
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:42,699
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

185
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,992
Please, don't insult me.

186
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:48,663
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...

187
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:51,499
...and also have
some military contracts...

188
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,794
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...

189
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,922
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

190
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:00,133
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

191
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:03,595
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

192
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:07,182
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

193
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:12,228
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

194
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:13,855
Excuse me.

195
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,782
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

196
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,368
I've got a great story about Hoover.

197
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:33,791
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...

198
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,961
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

199
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,130
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

200
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,762
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

201
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,183
Alcoa won't pay for the ads.

202
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:54,854
And we probably won't either.
But nobody'll stop you.

203
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,105
How much are the ads?

204
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,527
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

205
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,449
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

206
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,994
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

207
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,173
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

208
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,551
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

209
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,679
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

210
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,514
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

211
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:35,269
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...

212
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,064
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

213
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,860
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...

214
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,320
...not to approve it.

215
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,990
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...

216
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,618
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...

217
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,287
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...

218
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,041
...without his Constitutional rights...
- You have not seen the evidence...

219
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,460
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

220
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:03,672
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...

221
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:07,801
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

222
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:11,221
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

223
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,891
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

224
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,643
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

225
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:21,148
Or you, Colonel Jenkins? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

226
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:27,696
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

227
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,575
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

228
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,203
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...

229
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,248
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

230
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,377
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

231
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:54,347
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had no day in court.

232
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,894
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...

233
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:03,648
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...

234
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,734
...as this thing has developed.

235
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,820
- Now this whole theory...
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

236
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,864
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

237
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,325
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

238
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
He's on his way
to the control room.

239
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,454
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

240
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,330
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

241
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,665
Booth is there, it's already set.

242
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,959
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

243
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,878
That's not what I asked for.

244
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,506
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

245
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,717
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

246
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,553
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

247
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,929
Get him out of the booth!

248
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,685
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

249
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,564
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

250
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,982
2 minutes to air, fellas.

251
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,737
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

252
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,950
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

253
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,036
- As long as he talks fast because...
- He will talk fast.

254
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,334
We got the film.

255
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,795
Will it be ready?

256
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,338
You bet.

257
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,554
Funny thing, Freddy!

258
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,308
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

259
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,825
It occurs to me
we might not get away with this one.

260
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,251
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...

261
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,503
- 10 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

262
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,046
Ready on camera 1.

263
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:02,308
5, 4, 3, 2.

264
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,437
Pan, camera 1.

265
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,981
Good evening.

266
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,110
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...

267
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,987
...about Milo Radulovich...

268
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,573
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

269
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,577
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...

270
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,039
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...

271
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,376
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...

272
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,170
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

273
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,633
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

274
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,094
A board was called
and heard his case.

275
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:42,806
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...

276
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,309
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...

277
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,228
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

278
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,772
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...

279
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,983
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

280
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,986
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

281
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,906
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.

282
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:03,618
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...

283
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,662
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

284
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,082
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

285
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,583
They weren't too pleased.

286
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,420
You're gonna get audited this year.

287
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,965
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

288
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,885
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

289
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,144
In 10 seconds.

290
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:36,234
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

291
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,779
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

292
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:44,784
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...

293
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,829
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

294
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:53,501
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

295
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:57,714
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

296
00:20:58,172 --> 00:21:03,094
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

297
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,263
...why their father
is a security risk?

298
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,102
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

299
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:15,773
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...

300
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:20,152
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...

301
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:23,698
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

302
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:27,660
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...

303
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:30,871
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

304
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,041
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...

305
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,211
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...

306
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,296
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

307
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:44,093
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...

308
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:47,513
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...

309
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:51,642
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.

310
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:55,521
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...

311
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:59,817
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

312
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,360
We do not know.

313
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:05,489
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

314
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:09,118
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

315
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,455
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...

316
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:17,459
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...

317
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,003
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...

318
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,506
...in attempting to protect
the national security...

319
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,342
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

320
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:29,137
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...

321
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:31,348
...between the individual
and the state...

322
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,016
...we will do it ourselves...

323
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,021
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

324
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:42,109
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...

325
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,113
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

326
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,574
Good night, and good luck.

327
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:57,624
And we're out.

328
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:34,553
May I tell you something
about yourself...

329
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,638
May I tell you something
about yourself...

330
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,140
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

331
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,309
Based on audience
research studies...

332
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:44,438
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

333
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:48,192
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...

334
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,194
...to sports and show business.

335
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:53,739
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...

336
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:57,743
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

337
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:01,330
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...

338
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,582
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow's program...

339
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,209
...to tell you about Kent.

340
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:10,547
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filters best.

341
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,926
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...

342
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,221
...with many other thinking people
who have changed to Kent.

343
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:22,476
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

344
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,730
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...

345
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:30,651
...on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

346
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,319
Now back to Ed Murrow.

347
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,490
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...

348
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:40,327
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

349
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:44,498
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...

350
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:48,502
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

351
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,214
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...

352
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:55,634
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

353
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:59,679
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

354
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,558
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

355
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,728
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

356
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:11,566
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...

357
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:18,573
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

358
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:21,034
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

359
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:24,120
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

360
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:26,831
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...

361
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:30,835
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

362
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,630
I want to some day
find the perfect mate...

363
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:38,093
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...

364
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:40,845
...by faith
and will be a lasting union.

365
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:46,100
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...

366
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:49,312
...and she's looking
for her dream man, too...

367
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,898
...and I hope she finds him some day.

368
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:57,028
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

369
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:58,279
It's been very pleasant.

370
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,531
And will you say good night
to your family for us?

371
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:02,325
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

372
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,243
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

373
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:08,456
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...

374
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,209
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his new bride.

375
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,961
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

376
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:21,803
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

377
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:46,243
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

378
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:49,038
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

379
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:52,249
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

380
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,376
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

381
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,670
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

382
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:59,632
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

383
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:02,384
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

384
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,554
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

385
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,015
You're getting good at this!

386
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:10,351
They're gonna think you like it!

387
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:12,811
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

388
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:15,147
Ah, it's...

389
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:17,816
...day to day.

390
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:21,487
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

391
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,449
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

392
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,162
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

393
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:33,582
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

394
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,503
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

395
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:40,714
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

396
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,925
Well, see, I rest my case.

397
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:48,889
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

398
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,185
Thanks, Ed.

399
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,814
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

400
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:01,109
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

401
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:04,112
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

402
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:09,743
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

403
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,703
You let me know if I can help.

404
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:13,371
But you're a pinko.

405
00:29:16,124 --> 00:29:17,375
I'll see you.

406
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,019
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?

407
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:39,022
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.

408
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:40,440
What would you say if I told you...

409
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:43,109
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

410
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,364
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

411
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:52,118
McCarthy going
to the Eisenhower dinner?

412
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:55,788
- I have no idea. I don't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

413
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:03,630
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

414
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:05,840
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

415
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:09,093
I didn't know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

416
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:12,764
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

417
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,640
No pun elocuted.

418
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:20,104
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

419
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,107
Murrow's been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

420
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:26,736
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...

421
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,363
...and on the Soviet payroll
in 1935. It's all there.

422
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:31,324
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

423
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:32,909
Why you'll lose this one?

424
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,369
Because everyone in this country...

425
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:38,581
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's a patriot.

426
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,294
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

427
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:46,380
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

428
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,010
I think you guys go too far.

429
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,721
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

430
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:01,896
Yes, Mr. Paley.

431
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,523
Right away.
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,693
No, he hasn't called.

433
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:12,823
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?

434
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:16,035
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

435
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:19,872
Mr. Murrow!

436
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:22,499
Mr. Paley will see you now.

437
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:30,090
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

438
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:33,469
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

439
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,387
How's Janet?

440
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:38,223
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

441
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:41,518
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...

442
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:44,813
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

443
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,608
You'd never know.

444
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:52,779
Reading fiction?

445
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:55,282
I hope so. You tell me.

446
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,535
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

447
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:01,538
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

448
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:04,249
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

449
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:09,421
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

450
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:14,176
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

451
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:18,805
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

452
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:22,726
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

453
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,270
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...

454
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,855
...and that the News
was to be left...

455
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,732
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

456
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,568
99% of the time he's wrong about those
he's marked as Communists.

457
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,695
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...

458
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:34,779
...and we will report on that.

459
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:38,158
But he's wrong 100% of the time when
he oversteps people's civil liberties.

460
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,367
And you're trying him in the press?

461
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,453
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

462
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:44,039
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

463
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:46,458
- What I am doing...
- I write your check.

464
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:50,420
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

465
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:54,424
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

466
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:09,814
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

467
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:14,610
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.

468
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:18,531
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...

469
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:22,285
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

470
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:25,788
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...

471
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:29,208
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

472
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:31,794
Yes?

473
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:40,636
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

474
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,514
And we're gonna go right at him.

475
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,934
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

476
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:50,187
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

477
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:52,481
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...

478
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:56,402
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...

479
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,362
...if you attended a party,
anything...

480
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:01,615
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...

481
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:04,410
...because now would be
the time to tell us.

482
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,876
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

483
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:14,295
Palmer, you kidding?

484
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,798
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...

485
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:20,968
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

486
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:24,013
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

487
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:27,558
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

488
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:32,021
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...

489
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,564
...somebody'll find out.

490
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,775
They'll hurt us with it.

491
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,779
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:43,031
Fred.

493
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,912
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...

494
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,290
...or had a friend
who was "different"...

495
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,042
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...

496
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,962
...we'd all be the kind of people
Joe McCarthy wants.

497
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:02,551
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

498
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:08,849
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

499
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:12,853
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

500
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:15,480
Okay, fellas, here we go.

501
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:18,066
His own words,
that's what we need.

502
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,694
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...

503
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:23,780
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General..."

504
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:26,199
"...you should be removed
from any command."

505
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,495
"Any man who says, 'I will protect
and honor a General'..."

506
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:35,083
"...'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

507
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,002
Ethically, we're fine.

508
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,922
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

509
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,425
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

510
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,928
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

511
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,388
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

512
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:50,515
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...

513
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,101
...scream and cry about our methods...

514
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,354
...of trying to drag the truth...

515
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:00,108
...from those who know
or should know...

516
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,903
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

517
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,155
But they say, "Oh..."

518
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:11,160
"...it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

519
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:17,792
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

520
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,420
I had many offers of attorneys...

521
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:24,424
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The questions is:

522
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:27,468
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

523
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,138
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

524
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,264
The answer is yes.

525
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,850
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...

526
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,145
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

527
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,605
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

528
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,358
I know this was in 1932.

529
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,610
Do you know that they since
have been listed...

530
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:47,238
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

531
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,574
I do not know
that they have been listed so, sir.

532
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,034
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned...

533
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:53,369
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

534
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:57,248
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

535
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,667
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

536
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,169
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

537
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,838
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

538
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,257
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

539
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,550
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

540
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:10,010
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

541
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,929
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

542
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:14,849
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

543
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,475
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

544
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,978
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

545
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:24,316
Did you finish your closing piece?

546
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,277
It's Shakespeare.

547
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,488
Write your closing.

548
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,311
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...

549
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,938
...it doesn't make any difference.

550
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:05,315
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

551
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,441
If you don't, you'll love it.

552
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,527
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

553
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,112
I don't think
we can take that chance.

554
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:12,823
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

555
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:17,953
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the Alsops or Herb Block.

556
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,956
Honey, the Alsops and Herb Block...

557
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:25,293
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.

558
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,462
Then I guess it's time.

559
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:35,762
You worried?

560
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:39,933
I didn't think I was.

561
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,228
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

562
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:46,606
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

563
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,150
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

564
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,572
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...

565
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:57,784
...to see who was listening.
- And who was listening?

566
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:00,829
Chairman Mao...

567
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,586
I'll see you at the office.

568
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,172
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

569
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:15,927
Name me another wife...

570
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:19,138
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...

571
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:22,433
...before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

572
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:33,528
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

573
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:39,242
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

574
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:41,452
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

575
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:45,164
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

576
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:46,666
Are you interested?

577
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,461
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

578
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:51,754
Is that tonight?

579
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:54,757
We're covered, Bill.

580
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:56,759
All right.

581
00:39:58,678 --> 00:40:03,391
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

582
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:21,450
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

583
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:24,912
Can we hold all the calls, please?

584
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:27,373
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

585
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,917
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

586
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:33,045
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

587
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:50,229
10 seconds.

588
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:59,112
5, 4, 3, 2.

589
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:01,949
And pan, camera one.

590
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:09,081
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...

591
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:11,833
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...

592
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:14,670
...and request your permission
to read from a script...

593
00:41:14,753 --> 00:41:17,297
...whatever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

594
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,635
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...

595
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,970
...and desires to answer himself...

596
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:27,015
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

597
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:30,018
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

598
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:32,395
..."If this fight
against Communism..."

599
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:35,816
"...has made a fight between
America's two great political parties..."

600
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,402
"...the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed..."

601
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:42,948
"...and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

602
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:44,991
We applaud that statement...

603
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,327
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

604
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,871
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

605
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:54,292
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...

606
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,045
...between America's
two great political parties.

607
00:41:57,128 --> 00:41:58,755
If this fight against Communism...

608
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:02,050
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...

609
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:05,762
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...

610
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:09,265
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

611
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,727
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

612
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:16,606
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...

613
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,900
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...

614
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,444
...accused civilian
and military leaders...

615
00:42:21,528 --> 00:42:23,988
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...

616
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:26,074
...to turn over the country
to Communism.

617
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:30,578
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...

618
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,416
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...

619
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:38,503
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

620
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:41,631
As I read his statement, I...

621
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,593
...thought of that quotation,
"On what meat..."

622
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,513
"...doth this our Caesar feed?".

623
00:42:48,638 --> 00:42:49,639
The questions is:

624
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:52,767
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

625
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,436
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

626
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,521
The answer is yes.

627
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:59,357
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

628
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:00,983
Its publication...

629
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:04,779
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?

630
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:08,407
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...

631
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:13,287
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...

632
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:15,539
You can go back
to the publisher...

633
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:19,293
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

634
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:21,545
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

635
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:25,049
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.

636
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:27,051
I'll say that.

637
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:31,430
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

638
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:32,765
Twice he said...

639
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:36,894
..."The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

640
00:43:36,977 --> 00:43:39,980
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...

641
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:42,900
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...

642
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:45,235
...or any other
federal government agency.

643
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:48,697
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...

644
00:43:48,781 --> 00:43:51,408
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...

645
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,119
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

646
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:59,625
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

647
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:02,628
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...

648
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:06,298
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

649
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:10,677
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

650
00:44:11,386 --> 00:44:13,639
No one familiar with the history
of this country...

651
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:16,433
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

652
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,394
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...

653
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:23,065
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...

654
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:27,027
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

655
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:29,780
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

656
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:33,450
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...

657
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:37,496
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

658
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,749
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

659
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:43,710
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...

660
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:46,463
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...

661
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:49,966
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...

662
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:53,678
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...

663
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:57,182
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

664
00:44:57,766 --> 00:45:01,144
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...

665
00:45:01,227 --> 00:45:03,813
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

666
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:07,067
We can deny our heritage
and our history...

667
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,944
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

668
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:12,822
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...

669
00:45:12,906 --> 00:45:16,868
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...

670
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:20,455
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

671
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,416
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...

672
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,502
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...

673
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:29,130
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

674
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:32,675
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

675
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:35,470
He didn't create
this situation of fear...

676
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,723
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

677
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:41,601
Cassius was right.

678
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:46,522
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

679
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:49,609
Good night, and good luck.

680
00:45:57,325 --> 00:45:58,451
And we're out.

681
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:13,132
Nothing?

682
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:17,845
Maybe nobody watched.

683
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:25,311
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

684
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:28,397
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

685
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,276
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

686
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,196
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...

687
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:37,573
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

688
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,408
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

689
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:42,745
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

690
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:45,831
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...

691
00:46:45,915 --> 00:46:48,626
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...

692
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:50,336
...with what Ed Murrow
has just said...

693
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:53,172
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

694
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,137
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...

695
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:08,854
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...

696
00:47:09,104 --> 00:47:10,898
...the national policy...

697
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,736
- Is that Hollenbeck?
- Congratulations!

698
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:16,862
Great show!

699
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:18,989
Feel like a Scotch?

700
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:21,658
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

701
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:16,546
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

702
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:18,298
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...

703
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:21,342
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

704
00:48:21,426 --> 00:48:23,386
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

705
00:48:26,014 --> 00:48:27,932
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

706
00:49:00,298 --> 00:49:02,133
Okay. Here we go.

707
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:05,636
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

708
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:06,804
- First?
- Good.

709
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,307
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

710
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,183
Gould...

711
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:15,187
Edward R. Murrow's television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...

712
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:19,108
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

713
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:22,737
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

714
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,573
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...

715
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:29,452
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

716
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:30,828
The program... Hold on!

717
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:33,706
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...

718
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:36,876
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...

719
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,961
...would just go away
and leave them alone.

720
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:42,006
That was Mr. Murrow's
and television's triumph...

721
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:43,632
...and a very great one.

722
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:48,137
Here! Here!

723
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:50,431
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

724
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,933
Send the New York Times
a bottle of Scotch.

725
00:49:53,017 --> 00:49:55,060
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

726
00:49:55,144 --> 00:49:57,104
- How's the Post?
- Pretty good!

727
00:49:57,813 --> 00:49:59,815
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

728
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:04,361
- Go on, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

729
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:05,904
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

730
00:50:08,157 --> 00:50:10,033
- There we go.
- Shirley, that...

731
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:17,249
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrow's "Hate McCarthy" telecast...

732
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:20,294
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...

733
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:23,714
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...

734
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:26,216
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...

735
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,720
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...

736
00:50:29,803 --> 00:50:32,806
...featured Murrow's PM protg,
Hollenbeck.

737
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:35,934
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...

738
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:39,479
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...

739
00:50:39,563 --> 00:50:40,897
...from and for the Left.

740
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:43,275
So on. So on...

741
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,485
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

742
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:48,738
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

743
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:56,580
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

744
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:58,373
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...

745
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,667
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

746
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,713
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...

747
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:08,592
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

748
00:51:08,675 --> 00:51:11,011
He then proceeded
through an equally...

749
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:14,639
...tilted review of the day's events...

750
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:18,101
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

751
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,061
So on.

752
00:51:22,856 --> 00:51:25,775
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

753
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:29,279
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

754
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:33,867
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.

755
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:36,327
Joe... Shirley...

756
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:42,542
It doesn't matter.

757
00:51:47,797 --> 00:51:48,923
To Jack Gould!

758
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:52,927
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

759
00:51:53,011 --> 00:51:54,012
I love Jack Gould!

760
00:51:55,972 --> 00:51:57,515
May he rest in peace.

761
00:51:59,726 --> 00:52:02,562
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.

762
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,731
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

763
00:52:05,815 --> 00:52:07,692
All the ad guys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

764
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:09,777
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.

765
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,237
We're putting out a press release...

766
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,198
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

767
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:16,659
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

768
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:20,288
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...

769
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:22,415
Mr. Paley...

770
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:25,668
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

771
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:31,799
How's your wife?

772
00:52:32,258 --> 00:52:34,427
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

773
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,596
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

774
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,681
It's nice there.

775
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:40,599
Yes, sir.

776
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:48,649
Excuse me.

777
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:52,695
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckley
to do his rebuttal.

778
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:55,030
I said no.

779
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:57,866
Yes, sir.

780
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,249
Hey, Johnny!

781
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:07,751
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

782
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,587
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

783
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,548
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

784
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:15,175
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

785
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:16,760
Got some very good news.

786
00:53:17,386 --> 00:53:20,472
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

787
00:53:20,556 --> 00:53:22,599
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

788
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,602
I have decided
that it is consistent...

789
00:53:25,686 --> 00:53:28,438
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...

790
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:31,817
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.

791
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:35,320
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Full stop.

792
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,576
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.

793
00:53:42,244 --> 00:53:43,245
Great job!

794
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:45,247
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

795
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,290
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

796
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:48,625
This means something.

797
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:50,293
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

798
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:54,423
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of...

799
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:02,430
Palmer!

800
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:07,561
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

801
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,190
When?

802
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:13,900
Tomorrow.

803
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,196
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

804
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,322
Any ideas?

805
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,534
Just tell them what you know.

806
00:54:22,617 --> 00:54:25,328
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

807
00:54:25,412 --> 00:54:28,623
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...

808
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:31,042
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.

809
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:33,461
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

810
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:35,505
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

811
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:37,215
No, sir, never.

812
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:39,551
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

813
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:43,429
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

814
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:49,435
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...

815
00:54:50,144 --> 00:54:53,481
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...

816
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:56,776
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...

817
00:54:56,985 --> 00:55:00,196
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...

818
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,448
...of Communists
who were paying dues.

819
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:05,701
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

820
00:55:06,577 --> 00:55:09,455
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...

821
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:13,126
...or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money...

822
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:16,003
...to the Communist Party.

823
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:18,464
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

824
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:20,758
You've never paid
any dues, payment...

825
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:22,510
Thank you very much, Leo!

826
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:25,263
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

827
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:27,223
Now what is the show?

828
00:55:27,306 --> 00:55:30,059
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

829
00:55:30,142 --> 00:55:32,728
- Or is it her Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

830
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:35,272
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

831
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:37,066
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

832
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:39,777
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...

833
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,570
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...

834
00:55:41,654 --> 00:55:43,406
...and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

835
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:45,991
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...

836
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,911
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today..."

837
00:55:48,994 --> 00:55:51,539
"...that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room..."

838
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:54,208
"...who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

839
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,793
It's the front page
of the New York Times.

840
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:59,547
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...

841
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,591
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...

842
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:04,301
...he ducks out, leaves...
- Right.

843
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:07,388
- He leaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

844
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:09,056
Get me copies from any newspaper...

845
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,766
...that printed anything
about that assertion.

846
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,186
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

847
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:17,314
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

848
00:56:17,398 --> 00:56:20,526
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

849
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:23,654
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

850
00:56:23,737 --> 00:56:25,656
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

851
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:28,909
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...

852
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:31,829
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...

853
00:56:31,912 --> 00:56:34,081
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of the chair.

854
00:56:34,164 --> 00:56:36,833
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so...

855
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:40,796
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.

856
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:45,884
Thank you, Natalie.

857
00:56:50,514 --> 00:56:53,767
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

858
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:56,436
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

859
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,022
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

860
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:04,569
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

861
00:57:04,653 --> 00:57:07,656
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

862
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:10,242
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

863
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,202
He'll lose.

864
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:14,246
Not if we're playing bridge.

865
00:57:15,956 --> 00:57:18,833
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

866
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:21,086
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have a minute?

867
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:25,173
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

868
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:26,925
We have 4 days...

869
00:57:27,175 --> 00:57:29,678
...to do a 28 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

870
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:31,221
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

871
00:57:31,304 --> 00:57:33,014
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

872
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:34,933
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

873
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:37,894
Thank you, dear.

874
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:42,357
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

875
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,359
- O'Brian doesn't matter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

876
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:46,236
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

877
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,737
We've got to let that guy have it.

878
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:51,115
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

879
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:52,492
I can't defeat them both.

880
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:56,871
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

881
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:04,379
Okay. I guess not.

882
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:06,756
Sorry, Don.

883
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:22,730
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...

884
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:25,942
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

885
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:29,737
- She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...

886
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,491
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...

887
00:58:33,574 --> 00:58:34,742
...so help you God?

888
00:58:38,537 --> 00:58:41,207
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

889
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:42,917
Annie Lee Moss.

890
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:45,711
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

891
00:58:46,045 --> 00:58:49,298
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...

892
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:51,592
...for the information
of your counsel...

893
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:54,053
...that you are not here because...

894
00:58:55,387 --> 00:59:00,434
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

895
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,063
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

896
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:08,651
We are rather curious, however,
to know how you suddenly...

897
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:11,362
...were shifted from...

898
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,325
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

899
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:19,912
I am today much more interested...

900
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:24,375
...in the handling of your case...

901
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:28,337
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

902
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:32,883
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

903
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:36,303
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

904
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:38,889
You have been told what the rule is.

905
00:59:39,181 --> 00:59:42,226
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

906
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:49,650
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...

907
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:52,736
...1945?
- Yes, sir.

908
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:57,866
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

909
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:59,284
Yes, I had.

910
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:03,914
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...

911
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:07,000
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?

912
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:09,044
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

913
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:12,672
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

914
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:15,175
No more than to transmit
the message.

915
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,636
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

916
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:20,430
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

917
01:00:20,513 --> 01:00:23,141
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

918
01:00:23,683 --> 01:00:24,976
Do you know the...

919
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:28,647
...type of classification...

920
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:32,901
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

921
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,529
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

922
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:37,989
I see.

923
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,368
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...

924
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:47,582
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...

925
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:51,920
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would take over as Chairman?

926
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:58,426
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

927
01:00:58,509 --> 01:01:01,554
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

928
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:05,767
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...

929
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:09,604
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...

930
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:11,439
...of the Communist Party...

931
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:14,192
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

932
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:17,612
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...

933
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:20,865
...witness who was called
before the Committee...

934
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:22,784
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...

935
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:25,536
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...

936
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,663
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

937
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:32,001
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

938
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,297
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

939
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:40,301
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...

940
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,929
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...

941
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:47,641
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...

942
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:51,103
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

943
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:57,818
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

944
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:01,947
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...

945
01:02:03,657 --> 01:02:05,367
...by testimony, under oath.

946
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:09,246
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...

947
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,956
...be stricken from the record.

948
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:13,751
I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman!

949
01:02:13,834 --> 01:02:16,462
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...

950
01:02:16,545 --> 01:02:19,757
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...

951
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,386
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...

952
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,682
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...

953
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:33,896
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...

954
01:02:35,814 --> 01:02:37,149
...evil of it!

955
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:40,652
- Well, I'd look at it...
- I don't think it's fair to a witness...

956
01:02:40,736 --> 01:02:42,196
...to a citizen of this country...

957
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:44,364
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...

958
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:45,866
...then when they get through, say...

959
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:48,911
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

960
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:51,705
- The Chair agrees...
- It is not sworn testimony...

961
01:02:51,788 --> 01:02:55,417
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

962
01:02:57,085 --> 01:03:00,714
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...

963
01:03:00,797 --> 01:03:05,135
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

964
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:08,013
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

965
01:03:08,055 --> 01:03:10,307
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

966
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:29,242
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

967
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:31,453
We labeled it as controversial.

968
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:35,665
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

969
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:37,792
At that time, we said...

970
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:41,880
..."If the Senator believes we have done
violence to his words or pictures..."

971
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:44,549
"...if he desires to speak,
to answer himself..."

972
01:03:44,632 --> 01:03:47,761
"...an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

973
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:51,764
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...

974
01:03:51,848 --> 01:03:55,935
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

975
01:03:56,477 --> 01:03:57,520
We agreed.

976
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:02,191
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...

977
01:04:02,317 --> 01:04:05,403
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...

978
01:04:05,486 --> 01:04:07,238
...on this particular program.

979
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,743
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

980
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:19,500
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...

981
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:22,837
...devoted his program
to an attack...

982
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,132
...on the work of the US Senate
Investigating Committee...

983
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:28,759
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.

984
01:04:29,594 --> 01:04:33,222
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...

985
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:35,474
...and those fighting Communists.

986
01:04:36,893 --> 01:04:40,104
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...

987
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:43,691
...is of any great importance
as individuals.

988
01:04:44,775 --> 01:04:46,277
We are only important...

989
01:04:46,611 --> 01:04:50,656
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

990
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:55,828
Now ordinarily, I wouldn't take time
out from the important work at hand...

991
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:57,830
...to answer Murrow.

992
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,874
However, in this case...

993
01:04:59,957 --> 01:05:03,753
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...

994
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:05,588
...the leader...

995
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,010
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...

996
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:15,472
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

997
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,601
And I am compelled by the fact...

998
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:21,520
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...

999
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:24,648
...as far back as 20 years ago...

1000
01:05:25,316 --> 01:05:28,736
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

1001
01:05:29,945 --> 01:05:32,990
For example, the Institute
of International Education...

1002
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:35,451
...of which he was
the Acting Director...

1003
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:38,996
...was chosen to act
as a representative...

1004
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:41,039
...by a Soviet agency...

1005
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:47,588
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

1006
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:52,175
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...

1007
01:05:52,259 --> 01:05:54,803
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...

1008
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:57,681
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...

1009
01:05:58,265 --> 01:06:00,767
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.

1010
01:06:00,934 --> 01:06:04,271
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...

1011
01:06:05,063 --> 01:06:08,775
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..."

1012
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:14,156
"...have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

1013
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:18,702
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

1014
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:24,791
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

1015
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,043
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...

1016
01:06:27,502 --> 01:06:29,588
...is giving comfort to our enemies...

1017
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:32,299
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...

1018
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:36,094
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

1019
01:06:36,219 --> 01:06:37,679
And I want to assure you...

1020
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,808
...that I will not be deterred...

1021
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:48,398
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...

1022
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:53,153
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

1023
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:58,450
And I make no claim to leadership.

1024
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:02,328
In complete humility...

1025
01:07:04,163 --> 01:07:08,293
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...

1026
01:07:09,002 --> 01:07:10,628
...to join with me.

1027
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:40,783
[Everyone talks about the weather.]

1028
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:44,453
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms...]

1029
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:49,208
[... aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather.]

1030
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:53,337
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa...]

1031
01:07:53,421 --> 01:07:54,797
[... since 1888...]

1032
01:07:55,131 --> 01:07:58,968
[... has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal.]

1033
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:03,681
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming.]

1034
01:08:04,306 --> 01:08:07,977
[The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer...]

1035
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:12,022
[... Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America.]

1036
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:15,025
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...

1037
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:17,611
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...

1038
01:08:17,695 --> 01:08:19,280
...in our report of March 9th.

1039
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:22,783
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...

1040
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:25,619
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

1041
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:29,039
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...

1042
01:08:29,123 --> 01:08:33,752
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...

1043
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:36,380
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...

1044
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:39,174
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

1045
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:41,552
I fully expected this treatment.

1046
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:45,806
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...

1047
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:49,393
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

1048
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:51,520
His proposition is very simple:

1049
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:55,357
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...

1050
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:56,984
...must be a Communist.

1051
01:08:57,693 --> 01:09:01,446
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

1052
01:09:02,114 --> 01:09:05,742
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

1053
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:07,911
He claimed, but offered no proof...

1054
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:11,331
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

1055
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:12,582
That is false.

1056
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:16,962
I was never a member of the IWW,
never applied for membership.

1057
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:20,674
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...

1058
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,802
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

1059
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:24,970
That's true.

1060
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:28,723
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

1061
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,476
He was a civilized individual...

1062
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,813
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...

1063
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:37,732
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

1064
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:40,402
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

1065
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,822
Laski, as he makes clear
in the introduction...

1066
01:09:43,905 --> 01:09:47,367
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...

1067
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,287
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

1068
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,498
And the dedication so reads.

1069
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,544
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...

1070
01:09:58,002 --> 01:10:01,631
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...

1071
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:04,968
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...

1072
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:07,595
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.

1073
01:10:08,388 --> 01:10:10,974
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...

1074
01:10:11,349 --> 01:10:13,851
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...

1075
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:18,564
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...

1076
01:10:19,023 --> 01:10:20,858
...but in the area of ideas.

1077
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:25,780
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

1078
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,909
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...

1079
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,412
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

1080
01:10:33,246 --> 01:10:36,707
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...

1081
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,418
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

1082
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:42,922
Having searched my conscience
and my files...

1083
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,050
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...

1084
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:49,262
...but I have attempted to pursue
the truth with diligence...

1085
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,471
...and to report it...

1086
01:10:50,555 --> 01:10:53,641
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...

1087
01:10:53,724 --> 01:10:57,270
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

1088
01:10:58,229 --> 01:11:02,358
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

1089
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,860
Good night, and good luck.

1090
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:16,372
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...

1091
01:11:16,455 --> 01:11:18,749
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

1092
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,544
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...

1093
01:11:21,627 --> 01:11:24,421
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...

1094
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:28,008
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

1095
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,470
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

1096
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,639
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

1097
01:11:34,265 --> 01:11:36,934
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion...

1098
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,602
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1099
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:40,729
What?

1100
01:11:40,854 --> 01:11:44,483
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...

1101
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,945
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

1102
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:52,074
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

1103
01:11:52,157 --> 01:11:55,494
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

1104
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,371
- Really?
- What happened?

1105
01:11:57,538 --> 01:12:00,415
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

1106
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:02,000
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

1107
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,877
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1108
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:06,838
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

1109
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,924
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...

1110
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:11,760
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

1111
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:15,722
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

1112
01:12:19,017 --> 01:12:22,562
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

1113
01:12:22,646 --> 01:12:25,065
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...

1114
01:12:25,148 --> 01:12:26,983
...and be privy to other testimony.

1115
01:12:27,275 --> 01:12:31,154
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk to Thompson.

1116
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:35,200
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

1117
01:12:36,076 --> 01:12:39,037
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

1118
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,332
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

1119
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:50,799
- 74, 76, 47. Thank you.
- Murrayville 3, 1-2-7-6.

1120
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,947
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...

1121
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:17,992
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...

1122
01:13:18,701 --> 01:13:23,748
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

1123
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:28,378
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...

1124
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:31,047
...and questionable new methods
considered...

1125
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:36,719
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

1126
01:15:10,938 --> 01:15:12,981
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

1127
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:19,154
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

1128
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:22,324
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...

1129
01:15:22,699 --> 01:15:25,327
...but no one ever called it
anything but honest.

1130
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:29,539
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

1131
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:32,876
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now".

1132
01:15:33,585 --> 01:15:36,421
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.

1133
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:39,841
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

1134
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:43,011
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

1135
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:46,014
Not much of an obit.

1136
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:49,643
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

1137
01:15:50,685 --> 01:15:53,229
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

1138
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:55,982
Good night, and good luck.

1139
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:03,740
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

1140
01:16:04,824 --> 01:16:06,326
What time is your train?

1141
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,411
8:00.

1142
01:16:09,996 --> 01:16:12,582
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

1143
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:22,800
Here's a thought.

1144
01:16:24,636 --> 01:16:26,012
What if we're wrong?

1145
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:29,933
We're not wrong.

1146
01:16:31,643 --> 01:16:33,353
We're not going to look back...

1147
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:37,523
...and say we protected
the wrong side?

1148
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:45,281
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

1149
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:49,827
Argument could be made,
"for the greater good".

1150
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:54,790
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

1151
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:57,877
It's just a thought.

1152
01:17:04,592 --> 01:17:09,347
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

1153
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:12,016
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

1154
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:16,062
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

1155
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:18,773
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

1156
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:22,026
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

1157
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:27,907
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

1158
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,785
- Let's... let's...
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

1159
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:37,124
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

1160
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:41,503
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

1161
01:17:41,629 --> 01:17:45,132
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation...

1162
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:49,011
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...

1163
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:52,556
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

1164
01:17:52,723 --> 01:17:56,352
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

1165
01:17:56,518 --> 01:18:01,857
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

1166
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,985
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

1167
01:18:05,068 --> 01:18:08,822
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

1168
01:18:09,114 --> 01:18:11,825
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

1169
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:13,285
I think no comment.

1170
01:18:16,914 --> 01:18:20,292
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I can't write about it.

1171
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:22,794
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

1172
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:26,048
- Charlie said he dropped...
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

1173
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:27,883
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

1174
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:29,009
You, too.

1175
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:40,395
Close the door.

1176
01:18:43,648 --> 01:18:44,733
Have a seat.

1177
01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:51,489
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

1178
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:55,243
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...

1179
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,454
...that no two employees
can be married.

1180
01:19:00,248 --> 01:19:03,668
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

1181
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:05,503
I want you to consider it.

1182
01:19:06,671 --> 01:19:08,340
I know you two are married.

1183
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:11,551
Everyone knows.

1184
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,012
That's not my question.

1185
01:19:14,387 --> 01:19:17,474
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

1186
01:19:17,557 --> 01:19:20,393
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

1187
01:19:21,686 --> 01:19:23,313
I wanted you to know that...

1188
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:26,482
...because you could save
someone else being fired.

1189
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:32,530
I'm asking you to consider
making this decision a little easier.

1190
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:36,534
I don't need an answer now.

1191
01:19:38,077 --> 01:19:40,121
Just think about it.

1192
01:19:41,789 --> 01:19:42,790
Good.

1193
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:55,970
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

1194
01:19:56,387 --> 01:19:59,599
- Sure we're gonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

1195
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:05,563
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

1196
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,483
Mrs. Wershba...

1197
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:13,529
Everybody knew.

1198
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,540
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

1199
01:20:24,623 --> 01:20:27,501
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

1200
01:20:43,225 --> 01:20:44,351
Uh-oh!

1201
01:20:47,771 --> 01:20:51,233
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

1202
01:20:51,609 --> 01:20:53,944
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

1203
01:20:54,028 --> 01:20:55,404
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

1204
01:20:55,487 --> 01:20:58,073
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

1205
01:20:58,157 --> 01:21:00,075
Fred, you're speaking
beyond your competence.

1206
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,578
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

1207
01:21:02,661 --> 01:21:06,373
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 80,000 in sponsors...

1208
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:08,667
...and it costs one-third
of what you do.

1209
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:11,753
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

1210
01:21:11,837 --> 01:21:15,299
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

1211
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:18,302
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache...

1212
01:21:18,385 --> 01:21:20,888
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.

1213
01:21:22,598 --> 01:21:25,684
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

1214
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:30,063
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

1215
01:21:30,147 --> 01:21:32,566
The content of what we're doing
is more important...

1216
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:36,028
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
- It's what you're doing, Ed. Not me.

1217
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:37,237
Not Frank Stanton. You.

1218
01:21:37,612 --> 01:21:41,616
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong to you, Bill.

1219
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,826
You wouldn't know it.

1220
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:49,374
- What is it you want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

1221
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:54,754
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.

1222
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,923
I fight to keep the license...

1223
01:21:57,007 --> 01:22:00,385
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...

1224
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:05,515
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

1225
01:22:06,891 --> 01:22:10,020
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

1226
01:22:11,146 --> 01:22:13,064
I would argue that this network...

1227
01:22:14,315 --> 01:22:17,360
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

1228
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:21,489
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

1229
01:22:21,573 --> 01:22:24,742
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

1230
01:22:31,124 --> 01:22:32,458
Let me ask you this:

1231
01:22:34,168 --> 01:22:35,962
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...

1232
01:22:36,045 --> 01:22:39,090
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

1233
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:42,969
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

1234
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:46,848
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

1235
01:22:46,931 --> 01:22:49,767
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

1236
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:55,481
What do you want to do, Bill?

1237
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:02,447
I'm taking your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

1238
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:06,033
And it won't be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

1239
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:09,036
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

1240
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,834
- How many episodes?
- 5.

1241
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:19,505
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

1242
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:22,008
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

1243
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,847
You owe me 5 shows.

1244
01:23:37,857 --> 01:23:40,484
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

1245
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:42,820
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

1246
01:23:57,543 --> 01:23:59,878
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

1247
01:24:06,093 --> 01:24:09,430
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

1248
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:12,641
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

1249
01:24:15,769 --> 01:24:19,189
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

1250
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:22,484
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

1251
01:24:22,818 --> 01:24:27,030
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

1252
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:39,876
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

1253
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,800
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

1254
01:24:46,883 --> 01:24:48,844
See, you should have worn a dress!

1255
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:53,181
- How does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

1256
01:24:54,224 --> 01:24:56,768
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

1257
01:24:56,852 --> 01:24:58,895
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

1258
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:01,773
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...

1259
01:25:02,232 --> 01:25:03,692
...man can walk upright.

1260
01:25:06,403 --> 01:25:08,655
No matter who he is
or who she is.

1261
01:25:09,531 --> 01:25:13,493
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

1262
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:17,414
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...

1263
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:20,542
...may be in a position
of great power...

1264
01:25:21,501 --> 01:25:26,297
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...

1265
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:31,344
...to rot there without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

1266
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:36,474
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.

1267
01:25:37,308 --> 01:25:40,520
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it.

1268
01:25:41,271 --> 01:25:42,814
If we go on as we are...

1269
01:25:43,106 --> 01:25:46,693
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...

1270
01:25:46,776 --> 01:25:48,194
...in catching up with us.

1271
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,700
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

1272
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:58,538
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...

1273
01:25:58,621 --> 01:26:00,873
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...

1274
01:26:00,957 --> 01:26:04,752
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

1275
01:26:04,836 --> 01:26:08,256
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...

1276
01:26:08,339 --> 01:26:12,635
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

1277
01:26:13,594 --> 01:26:17,139
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

1278
01:26:17,431 --> 01:26:20,643
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

1279
01:26:21,435 --> 01:26:22,436
Would anything happen...

1280
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,315
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...

1281
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,652
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...

1282
01:26:29,735 --> 01:26:32,238
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?

1283
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:36,409
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."

1284
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:39,495
"...they're too complacent,
indifferent and insulated"...

1285
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:43,582
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...

1286
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:46,669
...considerable evidence
against that contention.

1287
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:50,714
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

1288
01:26:50,965 --> 01:26:52,550
Because if they are right...

1289
01:26:52,633 --> 01:26:54,677
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...

1290
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,304
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...

1291
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:59,890
...then the tube is flickering now...

1292
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:03,060
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

1293
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:05,562
This instrument can teach.

1294
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,482
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

1295
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:13,237
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...

1296
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,738
...towards those ends.

1297
01:27:16,156 --> 01:27:18,742
Otherwise,
