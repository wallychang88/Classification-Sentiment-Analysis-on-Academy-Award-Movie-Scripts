00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,600
ASK HIM WHY THOSE
WEAPONS WERE HERE.

594
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:03,259
HE SAYS THEY HAD NO CHOICE. THE N.V.A.

YOU THINK THESE CHUCKS
GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU AND ME?

695
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,227
COULD JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN
YOU, HAROLD, YOU GOT IN BARNES'S WAY.

696
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,229
AND THAT BUNNY?

HE JUST SCARES ME. LOOK.

700
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:11,390
YOU BLOODS ARE GETTING
TOO HUNG UP ON ALL THIS SHIT.

701
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,225
THESE GOOKS ARE A LOT
SMARTER THAN YOU THINK.

702
01:00:14,295 --> 01:00:16,395
YOU KNOW, BARNES
KNOWS HIS SHIT, MAN.

703
01:00:16,463 --> 01:00:20,215
THEY WAS N.V.A., EVERY
LAST ONE OF THEM.

NOW HE'S TAKEN
US THIS FAR, RIGHT?

705
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,597
HE'LL TAKE US THE REST OF
THE WAY. <i>I DON'T KNOW, HOMES.</i>

706
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,924
I MEAN, A CHRISTIAN DON'T GO AROUND
A VILLAGE CUTTING OFF HEADS AND SHIT.

707
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,970
SHIT IS REALLY GETTING
OUT OF HAND, MAN.

708
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,972
IT'S BLOWIN' WAY OUT OF CONTROL.

709
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:36,147
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU DON'T
SEEM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE...

710
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:39,000
<i>THE WAY YOU SHOOT UP
THAT SHIT ALL THE TIME.</i>

711
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,420
I DON'T KNOW, BROTHERS,

712
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:45,657
BUT I'M HURTING REAL BAD INSIDE.

713
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:51,213
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SERGEANT.
ELIAS WON'T BE ABLE TO PROVE A THING.

714
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,549
I MEAN, HE'S A TROUBLEMAKER.
HE... ELIAS IS A WATER WALKER.

715
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:57,597
LIKE THEM POLITICIANS IN
WASHINGTON TRYING TO FIGHT THIS WAR...

716
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:00,555
WITH ONE HAND TIED
AROUND THEIR BALLS.

717
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,291
AIN'T NO NEED OR TIME FOR
A COURTROOM OUT HERE.

718
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,629
<i>SARGE.</i> THANKS, BUN.

725
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,879
<i>SOMEBODY OUGHT TO FRAG HIS ASS.</i>

INVESTIGATION OR WHAT?

728
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,453
<i>BOB?</i>

<i>YEAH, I LOVE THIS
PLACE AT NIGHT...</i>

01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:50,422
THE STARS.

734
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,603
THERE'S NO RIGHT
OR WRONG IN THEM.

735
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,695
<i>THEY'RE JUST THERE.</i>

736
01:01:56,763 --> 01:01:59,764
THAT'S A NICE WAY OF PUTTING IT.

737
01:02:03,436 --> 01:02:05,615
BARNES HAS GOT IT IN
FOR YOU, DOESN'T HE?

738
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,272
BARNES BELIEVES
IN WHAT HE'S DOING.

739
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:12,611
<i>AND YOU? DO YOU BELIEVE?</i>

740
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:18,950

NOW,

742
01:02:23,624 --> 01:02:25,957
NO.

743
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:32,063
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

744
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:34,766
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THIS WAR.

745
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,235

746
01:02:37,303 --> 01:02:40,105
YOU REALLY THINK SO? HONEST?

747

WE'VE BEEN KICKING OTHER
PEOPLE'S ASSES FOR SO LONG...

748
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:46,277

753
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:09,534
<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S WRONG ANYMORE.</i>

754
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:11,536
<i>THE MORALE OF THE MEN IS LOW...</i>

755
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:13,538
<i>A CIVIL WAR IN THE PLATOON,</i>

756
01:03:13,607 --> 01:03:16,073
<i>HALF THE MEN WITH

775
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:31,182

01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:44,599
LIEUTENANT, THEY'RE GONNA
GET IN TIGHT UNDER THE ARTY.

793
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,835
I SPOTTED A CUT OVER THERE. LET ME
GET SOME MEN AND ROLL UP THAT FLANK.

794

ELIAS, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE? LISTEN TO ME, BARNES.

799
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,853

WE'LL SHOOT EACH OTHER TO SHIT.

803
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:14,045
SOUNDS PRETTY
FAR OUT TO ME, ELIAS.

804
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,480
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.
YA TRANG IN '66.

805
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:19,300
THEY CUT US TO FUCKING
PIECES. I NEED THREE MEN.

I KNOW THAT HE KILLED HIM. I SAW
HIS EYES WHEN HE CAME BACK IN.

912
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:07,244
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE

01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,019
<i>SHIT, YOU'RE TRYING TO CURE THE
HEADACHE BY CUTTING OFF THE HEAD.</i>

930
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:53,741
ELIAS DIDN'T ASK YOU TO
FIGHT HIS BATTLES FOR HIM.

931
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:57,745
AND IF THERE'S A HEAVEN...
AND GOD I HOPE THERE IS...

932
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:03,250
I KNOW HE'S SITTING UP THERE DRUNK
AS A FUCKING MONKEY AND SMOKING SHIT,

933
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,819
'CAUSE HE DONE LEFT

938
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:18,915

941
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,304
BARNES HAS BEEN SHOT
SEVEN TIMES, AND HE AIN'T DEAD.

DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU? HUH?

943
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:34,931
BARNES AIN'T MEANT TO DIE.

THE ONLY THING THAT
COULD KILL BARNES...

945
01:22:37,002 --> 01:22:39,102
IS BARNES.

ELIAS WAS FULL OF SHIT.

957
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,055
ELIAS WAS A CRUSADER.

958
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,057
NOW, I GOT NO FIGHT...

959
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,726

YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

977
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:38,932
<i>COME ON, MAN. GO.</i> GET HIM!

978
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:42,219
<i>GET HIM, CHRIS.</i>

979
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:47,141
EASY, BARNES. DON'T DO IT, MAN.

980
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:49,109
<i>YOU'LL GO DINKY
DAU IN L.B.J., MAN.</i>

981
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:51,878
TEN YEARS FOR KILLING
AN ENLISTED MAN.

982
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:55,115
TEN YEARS. YOU'LL CLIMB
THE FUCKING WALLS, MAN.

983
01:25:57,436 --> 01:25:59,436
<i>DON'T DO IT.</i>

984
01:26:17,122 --> 01:26:19,222
DEATH?

985
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:22,292
WHAT DO YOU ALL
KNOW ABOUT DEATH?

986
01:26:36,475 --> 01:26:38,453
<i>THEY SENT US BACK INTO
THE VALLEY THE NEXT DAY,</i>

987
01:26:38,477 --> 01:26:42,812
<i>ABOUT 2,000 METERS FROM
CAMBODIA, INTO A BATTALION PERIMETER.</i>

988
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:46,666
<i>IT FELT LIKE WE WERE RETURNING
TO THE SCENE OF A CRIME.</i>

989
01:27:20,586 --> 01:27:24,905
<i>ALPHA COMPANY HAD BEEN HIT HARD
THE DAY BEFORE BY A SIZEABLE FORCE,</i>

990
01:27:24,974 --> 01:27:27,307
<i>AND CHARLIE COMPANY HAD
BEEN PROBED THAT NIGHT.</i>

991
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:30,577
<i>THERE WERE OTHER BATTALIONS IN THE
VALLEY... WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES...</i>

992
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,096
<i>BUT WE KNEW WE WERE GOING
TO BE THE BAIT TO LURE THEM OUT.</i>

993
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:37,717
<i>SOMEWHERE OUT THERE WAS
THE ENTIRE 141st N.V.A. REGIMENT.</i>

994
01:27:55,938 --> 01:28:00,357
<i>CAUGHT THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS TRYING TO PULL
SOME SHIT ON CHARLIE COMPANY LAST NIGHT.</i>

995
01:28:00,426 --> 01:28:03,026
THEY FOUND MAPS ON THEM, MAN.

996
01:28:03,094 --> 01:28:05,072
GOT A FRIEND AT BATTALION.

997
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:07,909
SAYS THEY HAD EVERY
FUCKING FOXHOLE HERE FIXED ON.

998
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:12,636
DISTANCES, TREE LINES,
OUR CLAYMORES, EVERYTHING.

999
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,704
THIS IS BAD, MAN.

1000
01:28:14,773 --> 01:28:16,806
I GOT BAD VIBES HERE.

1001
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,521
I ALSO HEARD WE'RE IN
FUCKING CAMBODIA RIGHT NOW.

1002
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:22,345
CAMBODIA? MAN,
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

1003
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:24,947
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, SIR?

1004
01:28:26,284 --> 01:28:28,217
YEAH, RAMUCCI.

1005
01:28:28,286 --> 01:28:31,220
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ELIAS'S
SQUAD NOW. SQUAD, SIR?

1006
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:34,101
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE STILL REFERRING
TO THIS PLATOON IN TERMS OF SQUADS.

1007
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,604
ALL RIGHT. LOOK. I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THOSE TWO HOLES.

1008
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:38,706
RIGHT THERE AND THERE.

1009
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,826
YOU'RE TYING IT OFF WITH
BARNES UP HERE, KING DOWN THERE.

1010
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,251
YEAH. BEGGING YOUR PARDON, SIR,

1011
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,253
MY TWO HOLES ARE
FAR ENOUGH APART...

1012
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,922
YOU CAN RUN A REGIMENT
THROUGH THEM AND NEVER SEE IT.

1013
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,024
I GOT FIVE LIVE
BODIES LEFT, SIR.

1014
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:53,054
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR PROBLEMS, RAMUCCI.

1015
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,011
YOU'LL GET NEW MEN ANY DAY.

1016
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,891
MEANTIME, YOU MAKE
DO LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

1017
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,311
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS JOB.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

1018
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,269
- OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1019
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:05,939
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT, 'CAUSE TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T GIVE A SHIT, OKAY?

1020
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,024
I JUST DON'T GIVE A
FLYING FUCK ANYMORE.

1021
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,160
RIGHT.

1022
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:18,852
I'M GLAD I AIN'T
GOING WITH THEM.

1023
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:24,073
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS THE
BEAST, AND HE HUNGRY TONIGHT.

1024
01:29:24,142 --> 01:29:26,242
MOTHERFUCKIN' BUMMER.

1025
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:30,313
TEN DAYS AND A WAKE-UP, AND
I'M STILL DEALING WITH THIS SHIT.

1026
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,180
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, MAN?

1027
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,538
HOW COME YOU AIN'T
WRITING NOBODY?

1028
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:41,141
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FOLKS?

1029
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,810
THAT GRANDMA YOU
WAS TELLING ME ABOUT?

1030
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,464
<i>GIRL?</i>

1031
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:54,087
YOU GOT A MOTHER AND FATHER,
DON'T YOU? THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY.

1032
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,689
NAH, THERE'S NOBODY.

1033
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,977
YOU'VE BEEN SMOKING TOO
MUCH OF THIS SHIT, TROOP.

1034
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,082
GOTTA CONTROL THAT.
BRING A MAN DOWN.

1035
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,796
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST
COME OUT HERE TO THE BUSH.

1036
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,471
YOU WERE AS GREEN AS A...

1037
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:16,092
DID YOU EVER GET CAUGHT IN A MISTAKE
THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF, KING?

1038
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,239
THERE'S A WAY OUT
OF ANYTHING, MAN.

1039
01:30:18,263 --> 01:30:21,781
JUST KEEP YOUR PECKER
HARD AND YOUR POWDER DRY,

1040
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,851
AND THE WORM WILL TURN.

1041
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:29,122
HOW MANY DAYS YOU SHORT?

1042
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,240
NAH, IT'S NOT JUST ME.

1043
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:33,460
IT'S THE WAY THE
WHOLE THING WORKS.

1044
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,462
PEOPLE LIKE ELIAS GET WASTED.

1045
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:39,299
PEOPLE LIKE BARNES JUST GO ON
MAKING UP THE RULES ANY WAY THEY WANT.

1046
01:30:39,368 --> 01:30:41,301
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

1047
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:44,137
SIT IN THE MIDDLE
AND SUCK ON IT.

1048
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,790
WE JUST DON'T
ADD UP TO DRY SHIT.

1049
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:48,891
WHOEVER SAID WE DID, MAN?

1050
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,728
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE,

1051
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:53,730
AND IT'S ALL GRAVY.

1052
01:30:53,799 --> 01:30:56,466
EVERY DAY, THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE... GRAVY.

1053
01:30:59,638 --> 01:31:02,739
OH, SHIT. SUPER-LIFER.

1054
01:31:02,808 --> 01:31:06,192
HEY KING, COLLECT UP YOUR SHIT.
YOUR ORDERS JUST COME THROUGH.

1055
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:07,889
OH, LOOK, MAN.
DON'T FUCK WITH ME.

1056
01:31:07,913 --> 01:31:10,458
WHAT DO YOU NEED, A WRITTEN
INVITATION, FOR CHRISSAKE?

1057
01:31:10,482 --> 01:31:13,250
COCKSUCKER! OH, WOW!

1058
01:31:13,318 --> 01:31:15,418
THE LIFERS DONE MADE A MISTAKE.

1059
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:17,420
THEY CUT ME SOME SLACK, TAYLOR.

1060
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:19,267
GET YOUR PIG TO
RODRIGUEZ. YOU GOT TEN

1061
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:21,424
MINUTES TO MAKE THE
LAST CHOPPER OUT OF HERE.

1062
01:31:21,493 --> 01:31:23,471
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT ON IT,

1063
01:31:23,495 --> 01:31:26,096
I'M GONNA BE.

1064
01:31:26,164 --> 01:31:28,142
TAYLOR, FRANCIS IS COMING UP.

1065
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:30,166
<i>THAT'S GREAT KING.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, MAN.</i>

1066
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,435
TAKE IT ON HOME
FOR ME, OKAY? YEAH.

1067
01:31:32,504 --> 01:31:35,321
YOU GOT MY ADDRESS. YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU CAN GET A HOLD OF ME.

1068
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:39,325
I GOTTA DI DI, MAN. I DON'T
WANNA MISS THAT CHOPPER.

1069
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:42,629
WHEW.

01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:44,698
YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M OKAY.

1071
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,728
REMEMBER NOW, TAKE IT EASY.

1072
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,553
DON'T THINK TOO MUCH,
AND DON'T YOU BE NO FOOL.

1073
01:31:50,622 --> 01:31:52,600
REMEMBER, AIN'T NO SUCH
THING AS A COWARD OUT HERE.

1074
01:31:52,624 --> 01:31:55,057
DON'T MEAN NOTHIN'.

1075
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:57,126
MY MAN.

1076
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:05,818
I'LL WALK YOU OUT, MAN.

1077
01:32:10,325 --> 01:32:12,258
<i>TAKE IT EASY, KING.</i>

1078
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:16,095
I'M GONNA TAKE IT ANY WAY I CAN
GET IT, BROTHER. I HEAR YOU. LATER.

1079
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:19,248
MY FOOT IS FUCKED-UP, SARGE.
NO, MAN! DON'T TOUCH THIS!

1080
01:32:19,317 --> 01:32:21,751
<i>I'VE GOTTA GET ON

1081
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:24,799
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
SAYS HE CAN'T WALK.

1082
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:27,757
SHIT.

1083
01:32:27,826 --> 01:32:31,494
MARTIN, GET YOUR BOOTS ON.

1084
01:32:33,832 --> 01:32:35,810
AND THE NEXT TIME I CATCH YOU...

1085
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:38,768

THAT LONG, HAIRY, RED AND BLACK
BASTARD I FOUND IN THE AMMO CRATE.

1094
01:33:03,862 --> 01:33:07,563
<i>I'M GONNA PUT IT IN THIS BOY'S
CROTCH, SEE IF HE CAN WALK.</i>

1095
01:33:07,632 --> 01:33:09,899

1096
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:12,068
HEY! NOW HOLD UP, MAN.

01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:39,307
BOB, I GOT ELIAS'S R &
R. IT'S IN THREE DAYS.

1106
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:42,765
I WAS THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO HAWAII AND SEE PATSY.

1107
01:33:42,834 --> 01:33:45,646
HEY, BOB, COME ON. I NEVER
ASKED YOU FOR A FUCKING THING.

1108
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:47,581
I WAS THINKING, MAYBE...
WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

1109
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:49,583
I WAS HOPING YOU'D PUT ME
ON THAT CHOPPER WITH KING.

1110
01:33:49,607 --> 01:33:51,585
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THERE, CHIEF-A-ROONEY?

1111
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:53,543
NAH, I CAN'T DO
THAT FOR YOU, RED.

1112
01:33:53,611 --> 01:33:55,711
WE NEED EVERY
SWINGING DICK IN THE FIELD.

1113
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,758
<i>HEY BOB. TALK TO ME FOR
CHRISSAKE.</i> SIN LOY, BUDDY.

1114
01:33:57,782 --> 01:33:59,927
<i>ALL I'M ASKING YOU FOR IS
THREE FUCKING DAYS HERE.</i>

1115
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:02,685
I AM TALKING TO YOU, RED,
AND I'M TELLING YOU "NO."

1116
01:34:02,754 --> 01:34:05,722
SO GET BACK IN YOUR FOXHOLE.

1117
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:09,558
BOB, I GOT A BAD FEELING
ON THIS ONE, ALL RIGHT?

1118
01:34:09,627 --> 01:34:12,561
I MEAN I GOT A BAD FEELING.

1119
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:15,398
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE.

1120
01:34:15,466 --> 01:34:17,967
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU?

1121
01:34:18,036 --> 01:34:21,654
EVERYBODY GOT TO
DIE SOMETIME, RED.

1122
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,598
OH, SHIT.

01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:48,448
GOOD-BYE, MOTHERFUCKERS!

01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,258
<i>YOU KNOW, JUNIOR.</i>

1129
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:18,227
SOME OF THE THINGS
WE DONE, MAN...

1130
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:21,264
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE
DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

1131
01:35:21,332 --> 01:35:24,733
SOMETIMES, MAN,

1132
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:27,136
I GET THIS BAD FEELING.

1133
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:32,592
<i>I TOLD THE PADRE THE
TRUTH. I LIKE IT HERE.</i>

1134
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:35,762
YOU GET TO DO WHAT YOU
WANT. NOBODY FUCKS WITH YOU.

1135
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:38,431
