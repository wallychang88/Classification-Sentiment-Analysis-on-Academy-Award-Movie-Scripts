1
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,473
Right into the car.
To the back of the car.

2
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,476
Watch your step.
Step lively, please.

3
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,812
That's all.
Take the next train.

4
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,067
Step back.

5
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,233
-Look here, Doris--
-Shut up!

6
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,276
My dear husband!

7
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,405
Oh, no. Doris, please!

8
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,158
Don't, Doris!

9
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,247
Oh, Doris!

10
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,257
Help! Help!

11
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,967
Help! Murder!

12
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,387
Help! Help!

13
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,150
No!

14
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,988
No more, please.

15
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,111
7:30

16
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,415
7:30

17
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,924
You said it. 7:30.

18
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,346
Hello, Pinky.

19
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,483
Hello, Pinkie.

20
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,571
You feel all right?

21
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,365
No. Why?

22
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,159
You were making some funny noises
in the night.

23
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,911
I always do, don't l?

24
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,123
That is, you always say
that I always do. How do I know?

25
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,458
You always do,
but not this kind.

26
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,002
What kind?

27
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,338
I don't remember exactly,
but sort of like--

28
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,055
-Like that, sort of.
-Really? You don't say.

29
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,557
Yeah.

30
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,559
-Fascinating.
-Huh?

31
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,769
I say I sound fascinating.

32
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,855
You'll do--

33
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,527
-Hot dog!
-What?

34
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,529
Wait a second.

35
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,156
What is it?

36
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,657
Woman shot her husband.

37
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,284
Kill him?

38
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,121
Wait a second.
I think she, uh--

39
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,373
Let's see.

40
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,753
-Nope.
-That's a shame.

41
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,755
Condition critical, though.

42
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,298
Congratulations.

43
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,716
Wow!

44
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,927
What?

45
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,762
-Wait a second.
-What is it?

46
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,348
-Find it in yours.
-lt isn't in here.

47
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,227
He was playing her fast and loose,
so she caught him out and shot him.

48
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,686
Who?

49
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,773
-This lady l've been telling you about.
-Some lady.

50
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,319
Serves him right,
the little two-timer.

51
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,280
Says here he's 5'11, weighs 180.
Some little.

52
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,492
Little in spirit,
I mean, of course.

53
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,162
I don't approve of people rushing
around carrying loaded revolvers.

54
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,498
Depends on who they're rushing at.

55
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,335
Is that what they taught you
at Yale Law School?

56
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,711
It's not funny.

57
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,422
Contempt for the law
is the first thing--

58
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,924
Come in.

59
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,262
Better get movin', you two.
Heavy traffic today.

60
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,522
Attagirl!

61
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,025
You big pig.

62
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,027
-Let him go by.
-He wants the whole road.

63
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,197
All l'm saying is there are lots
of things that a man can do...

64
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,783
and in society's eyes
it's all hunky-dory.

65
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,996
A woman does the same thing,
and she's an outcast.

66
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,664
-Finished?
-No.

67
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,166
I'm not blaming you personally,
Adam, because this is so.

68
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,587
-That's awfully large of you.
-No, it's not your fault.

69
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,215
Why let this deplorable system
seep into our courts of law...

70
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,843
where women
are supposed to be equal?

71
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,387
Mostly, I think,
females get advantages.

72
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,056
We don't want advantages,
and we don't want prejudices.

73
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,685
Don't get excited, honey.
You're giving me the Bryn Mawr accent.

74
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,855
What did she try to do?
She tried to keep her home intact.

75
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,982
By knocking off her husband.

76
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,526
She didn't knock him off.
He's alive.

77
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,029
-She tried. She missed.
-Now supposing--

78
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,656
-You wanna give her another shot at him?
-No, I don't.

79
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,120
-lt burns my goat.
-Your what?

80
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,663
My goat!

81
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,665
Crime should be punished,
not condoned.

82
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,168
-lf a woman commits it.
-Anybody. Pull over.

83
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,971
-Sorry.
-Aw, you lady drivers!

84
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,140
You'll put me away yet!

85
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

86
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,154
-Morning, Roy.
-They down?

87
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,950
Just now. We've got five assaults and
seven robberies, and l'm still counting.

88
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,993
-You're still young.
-Not for long.

89
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,995
Mommy's only got
one pair of brains.

90
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,997
I may give up smoking,
you know that?

91
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,999
What's this habeas corpus on 904A?

92
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,001
-Search me.
-No sense to it.

93
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,254
Why should I give up smoking
if I like it?

94
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,631
-Oh, no.
-Something?

95
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,758
-Good heavens.
-What?

96
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,263
The one case I don't want
is the case I get.

97
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,306
That's always the way.
Rule of the profession.

98
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,350
-But this.
-Which one?

99
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,186
This hysterical Hannah
who tried to kill her husband.

100
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,355
-My wife feels--
-That's a cinch.

101
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,357
You've already got
your full confession.

102
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,359
That's the kind of case
you take your knitting. A cinch.

103
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,194
-A cinch?
-What?

104
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,698
-You're not married to my wife.
-How do you know?

105
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,075
A cinch. I think I oughta
poke you one, Roy.

106
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,704
-Yes, sir.
-Adam, you got a minute?

107
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,205
Right now, chief.

108
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,381
Cinch.

109
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,011
A case of overwrought.
Simple overwrought.

110
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,055
I've noticed guys doing
that sort of thing more and more.

111
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,349
I've got a theory.
You wanna hear it?

112
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,894
I think the human race
is having a nervous breakdown.

113
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,109
Which is why I am compelled...

114
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:18,572
to return same to you
for further revision.

115
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,491
If this course seems to you...

116
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,869
unnecessarily exacting...

117
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,414
may I again remind you
that unless we obtain...

118
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,626
certiorari
in the immediate future--

119
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,461
-Grace.
-Yeah?

120
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,464
What do you think of a man
who's unfaithful to his wife?

121
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,924
Not nice, but--

122
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,552
What about a woman who's
unfaithful to her husband?

123
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596
-Something terrible.
-Aha!

124
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,932
-What?
-Why the difference?

125
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,644
Why not nice if he does it,
and something terrible if she does it?

126
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,522
-l don't make the rules.
-Sure you do. We all do.

127
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,442
Unless we obtain certiorari
in the immediate future--

128
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,279
The matter looks hopeless.

129
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,616
I again urge you to study
and consider United Zinc--

130
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,703
A boy sows a wild oat or two,
the world winks.

131
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,748
A girl does the same, scandal.

132
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,875
-Yeah.
-Hello, honey.

133
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,503
Hello.
Hello, husband.

134
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,256
-You've been on my mind.
-Where you been keeping yourself?

135
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,716
-l've been resting up after a hard--
-Adam!

136
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,511
You know the woman who shot her
husband yesterday? Want a good laugh?

137
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,763
-Sure, go ahead.
-Well, l'm elected.

138
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,808
I was gonna ask the chief to let me off
to keep peace at home.

139
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,813
-What?
-The boss wants a quick conviction...

140
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,649
and l'm the guy
who can get it for him.

141
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,318
-So he says.
-You big he-men make me sick!

142
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,280
-What?
-An outrage, that's what I think.

143
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,782
You're getting awful dramatic.

144
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,951
Why? What's so funny?

145
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,956
Nothing. You just sound cute
when you get causey.

146
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,252
Hello? Hello?

147
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,686
Did you ever hear about the straw
that broke the camel's back?

148
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,188
Many times.

149
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,690
Well, itjust happened again,
right on that phone.

150
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,737
The last straw
on a female camel.

151
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,489
-Right on that phone?
-Yeah. Take all this down.

152
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,033
This is important.

153
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,452
There's a woman named--
Wait a minute.

154
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,997
Hey, Bobby, bring me the morning papers
in here right away, will you, please?

155
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,208
Whatever her name was,
she shot her husband last night.

156
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,835
-Served him right.
-l'm not talking. This is big.

157
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,462
One: Find out where she is.

158
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,883
Two: Get me copies of all the police
and court records that are available.

159
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,636
Three: Find out who's handling her.
Probably Legal Aid Society.

160
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,638
If that's it, let me talk
to Rogers down there.

161
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,057
If she's privately defended,
find out who, let me talk to them.

162
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,018
Four: Get Miss Bassett
at Women's Council for Equal Rights.

163
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,188
Five: Get my husband on the phone.
Six: Don't get my husband.

164
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,774
-Thank you, Bobby.
-Woman popped her ever-lovin'.

165
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,318
Yeah. Thanks. Beat it.
Attinger.

166
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,945
A-T-T-l-N-G-E-R.

167
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,198
Yes, Doris Attinger. I want
to see her today without fail.

168
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,742
-What's going to happen?
-Plenty.

169
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,662
What explanation have you got?

170
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,915
She's crazy, that's all.
That's the only explanation.

171
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,583
Plain crazy.

172
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,377
Plain crazy.

173
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,921
She's always been crazy,
if you want a fact.

174
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,634
-Crazy when you married her?
-Certainly. A fruitcake.

175
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,889
-Why did you marry her?
-How should I know? Who knows?

176
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,600
Why'd you marry yours?
Does anybody know?

177
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:38,397
Wait, Mr. Attinger. Let's not play
around with this too free and easy.

178
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,940
After you've filed complaint--

179
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,860
I've been complaining ever since
the day I got married to her.

180
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,154
Go ahead and file it.
She's nuts! That's my complaint.

181
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,449
I'd like to see her
put away somewheres.

182
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,451
That's all. Out of my hair.

183
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,788
Murderers running around.
What kind of a town is this?

184
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,791
We don't have so many murderers
running around, Miss--

185
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,586
but we have a lot of other things
just as bad.

186
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,671
You mean like me, huh?

187
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,674
Listen, bub, I connect with you.
You ain't over my head.

188
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,219
-Good.
-l'm gettin' a lawyer on my own.

189
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,680
-l gotta get her put away.
-Listen, pal.

190
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,099
You're running
way ahead of yourself.

191
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,311
You just give us the facts
and the background.

192
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,813
We'll get a conviction
on an attempted murder...

193
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:23,984
or first-degree assault or however else
the office wishes to proceed.

194
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,485
You understand that?

195
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,656
What do I do?

196
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,285
You just tell us the truth as clearly
and as accurately as you can.

197
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,330
Shoot. I mean, go ahead.

198
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,042
State your full name.

199
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,169
Warren Francis Attinger.

200
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,587
Where do you live?

201
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,297
66 West 12th Street.

202
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,299
-New York City?
-New York City.

203
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,467
Occupation?

204
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,469
No occupation.

205
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,514
-Housewife.
-That's right. Housewife.

206
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,432
-All right.
-And mother?

207
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,767
Yes.

208
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,646
No, thank you.

209
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,649
I don't believe women should smoke.
You'll excuse me saying it.

210
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,651
Yes, l'll excuse you.

211
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,694
-Now--
-lt's not feminine.

212
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,907
How long have you been married,
Mrs. Attinger?

213
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,034
Nine years and four months.

214
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,286
-l see.
-And 12 days.

215
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,622
-Finished?
-Yes, thank you.

216
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,999
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

217
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,043
And you have three children?

218
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,796
Warren, Jr., he's eight...

219
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,132
Allan, he's seven,
and Trudy, she's six.

220
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,759
That's all.

221
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:35,556
When did you begin to suspect that you
were losing your husband's affection?

222
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,978
When he stopped battin' me around.

223
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,439
-When was that?
-Eleven months ago. March 14.

224
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,942
He struck you?

225
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,611
First time, he broke a tooth.

226
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,655
-My tooth.
-l see.

227
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,782
Upper left molar.

228
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:57,035
-And how often--
-lt's capped now. You can't notice it.

229
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,707
Good. Now, let's start
with the day of the accident--

230
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,627
Oh, no accident.
I wanted to shoot him.

231
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,672
Suppose we decide later
just what you wanted to do.

232
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,091
Silly.

233
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,969
The difference between ten years
in prison and freedom...

234
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,013
is not silly, Mrs. Attinger.

235
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,472
Call me Doris.

236
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,516
Pay attention to what l'm saying.

237
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,894
I don't care what happens to me.

238
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,063
Do you care what happens
to Warren and Allan and Trudy?

239
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,608
Yes, I do.
I wanna go home.

240
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,651
Can't you fix it
so I should go home?

241
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,863
Not right now,
but we're working on it. Here.

242
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,908
I promised my kids l'd take 'em
to Coney lsland tomorrow.

243
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,576
Yes, you drink that.

244
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,122
Now, you would help us very much
if you could reconstruct the day.

245
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,458
All of yesterday.

246
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,631
Well, first thing in the morning...

247
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,259
-Yes?
-l woke up.

248
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,887
-Yes?
-And I see he didn't sleep home.

249
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,848
You were shocked and surprised.

250
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,184
Oh, no. Not shocked,
not surprised.

251
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,770
He used to not do that a lot--
come home.

252
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,856
Did you ever question him
about his behavior?

253
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,191
Certainly.

254
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,735
-Did he offer any explanation?
-Certainly.

255
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,071
He told me to shut up
and mind my own business.

256
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,615
I see.

257
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,076
But yesterday, I got worried.

258
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,913
Not worried, mad.

259
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,791
-l got mad. You know why?
-Why?

260
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,001
'Cause it was the fourth night
in a row he didn't.

261
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,588
-Come home?
-Yeah.

262
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,967
-And that made you angry?
-Sure. lt was gettin' a habit with him.

263
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,387
So I sent the kids to school,
and I went and bought a gun.

264
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,390
-Where?
-This hock shop I go to.

265
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:45,435
I bought a gun and they gave me
a book how to--free.

266
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,314
Had you decided by this time
exactly what you planned to do?

267
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,320
I'll tell you the honest truth.
I didn't decide nothin'.

268
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,115
I was doin' everything
like in a dream--

269
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:02,035
like I was watchin' myself,
but I couldn't help it.

270
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,246
-Like a dream?
-Yeah. Wait a second.

271
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,706
You got all that?

272
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,334
Like I was watching myself
but couldn't help it. Like a dream.

273
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,378
Yeah, that's good.
Now, go on, Doris.

274
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,425
So then I got very hungry.

275
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,594
-When?
-When I bought the gun.

276
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,054
-Yeah?
-So I went in this hamburger place...

277
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:25,058
and I ate two--rare--
and one lemon meringue pie.

278
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,312
And then?

279
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,398
Then I was still hungry.

280
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,900
Think of that.

281
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,740
So I walked all around...

282
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,993
and I kept talkin' to myself
not to be foolish.

283
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,746
-And then?
-And then I called up Warren.

284
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,498
He was just gettin'
his lunch hour by now.

285
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,961
I said to him I wanna see him important,
so if we could have lunch together.

286
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,422
So he said no, naturally.

287
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,091
So I asked him,
You comin' home after?

288
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,260
So he says, What for?

289
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,097
So I said to him,
Don't you live there no more?

290
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,519
So he says, Don't bother me at the
office. You want me to lose my job?

291
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,812
Loud. So then he hung up.

292
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,774
And what did you do?

293
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,817
I had a cup of coffee.

294
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,819
Where?

295
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,030
The same place as him,
only he didn't see me.

296
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,616
It was crowded.
The Buffet Exchange.

297
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,203
So then I bought
some chocolate nut bars...

298
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,915
and I went outside of his office
and I waited the whole afternoon.

299
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:34,545
And I kept eatin' the candy bars
and waitin' until he come out.

300
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,005
And then I followed him.

301
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,007
And then I shot him.

302
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,431
And after you shot him,
how did you feel then?

303
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,521
Hungry.

304
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,121
Everything looks lovely, Mary.

305
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,625
-You must be dead.
-l don't care, except the extra help.

306
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,003
With me, the more help I got,
the harder I have to work.

307
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,422
-l'm not late, am l?
-lsn't that typical?

308
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,923
Twenty minutes of 8:00.

309
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,261
Oh! Beautiful!

310
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,222
Uh, I don't--

311
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,481
Can you get dressed
in four minutes?

312
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,861
Of course I can't get dressed
in four minutes.

313
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,655
Why, sure, darling,
I can get dressed in four minutes.

314
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:47,034
I may have a little trouble
getting in a bath in that time.

315
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,969
You are hurrying up,
aren't you, darling?

316
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,431
Do you remember
Judge Marcasson's wife's name?

317
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:12,601
Oh, I do. Alice.

318
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,771
I hope Kip knows enough to behave
with the judges around.

319
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,607
I'll keep him playing the piano
as much as possible.

320
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,860
-Have a good day?
-Yeah.

321
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,572
-You make a lot of money?
-No.

322
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,953
-Better than money.
-Really? What?

323
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,539
A very interesting development.

324
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,916
Very.

325
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,292
Good.

326
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,337
I hope you'll think so
when you find out what it is.

327
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,006
It may jar you
a bit at first, but--

328
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,597
Pinky!

329
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,975
Calling me?

330
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,602
What's that?

331
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,646
Just the best hat in the world.

332
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,691
For the best head.

333
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,611
I may ask you to come home late
every single night.

334
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:14,162
Someday they're gonna build
a statue to you somewhere.

335
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,083
I said--
Now, what about that?

336
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,377
-That's sweet.
-lsn't that absolutely a miracle?

337
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,838
You look kind of like Grandma Moses.

338
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,299
-Yeah?
-Your mother and father are here.

339
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,427
-Tell 'em we'll be right down.
-Tell 'em to fix themselves a drink!

340
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,137
-What?
-A drink.

341
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,471
No, thanks.

342
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,932
What?

343
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,976
I said I don't want one, thanks.

344
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,478
For the love of heaven.

345
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,813
How do I look?

346
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,482
Oh, boy, you look handsome.

347
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:46,778
-This is a dress I have on.
-Oh, it's beautiful!

348
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,656
They'll be right down, Mrs. Bonner.

349
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,700
-How are you, Mary?
-Hello, everybody.

350
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,036
-Hello, honey.
-lt's just us.

351
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,580
-Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
-Well, son, how are you?

352
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,040
Dad. Hi.

353
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,083
-Hello, Adam.
-Hello, dear.

354
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:03,587
Adam, mix the drinks. l'm sorry
we're so late, but l'm not to blame.

355
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,673
-l have an irresponsible husband.
-Hereditary.

356
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,510
We're gonna have
the most sensational dinner.

357
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:13,180
-Oh, my dress. Do it up, will you?
-l'm sorry. I forgot my glasses.

358
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,850
You did? Adam!
Come in here and fasten me up.

359
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,353
-Sit down.
-Fasten? Oh, here, Pop.

360
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,188
Mix 'em, don't drink 'em.

361
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,232
I suppose someday somebody
will invent something--

362
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,858
You've got no complaint.

363
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,986
You oughta see some of the things
that I used to have to handle.

364
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,821
Hooks and eyes.

365
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,449
She had an evening gown one time
had about two thousand.

366
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,786
-Don't exaggerate.
-All right, then. One thousand.

367
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,455
Used to start to hook her up
right after breakfast.

368
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,499
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Mary.

369
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,043
Anybody else important here yet?

370
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,380
Well, look at us. All the way
from across the hall and on time.

371
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,382
-Don't we look nice?
-You certainly do.

372
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,176
-You know Emerald Messel, don't you?
-Emerald, how are you?

373
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,304
You know Adam's father and mother?
Emerald Messel.

374
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:57,516
She's just been proposing to me.
That's why we're on time.

375
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,851
Ha, ha!

376
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,853
No humor, but stinkin' rich.

377
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,690
-What do you want to drink?
-Whatever's going.

378
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,775
-Dad, would you be an angel?
-You bet.

379
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,944
-Need some help, old friend?
-No, thanks.

380
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:12,072
Why not? She may be your wife,
but she's my lawyer.

381
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,285
Amanda, my love, why do you stay
married to a legal beagle with ten thumbs?

382
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,495
All right, Kip.
That's enough.

383
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,330
Not for me it's not.

384
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,374
-Why don't you go play the piano?
-All right.

385
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,252
-l suppose that is why I was invited.
-That's right.

386
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:29,882
Somebody ought to bring me a drink.
I choose Amanda.

387
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,348
Are you the judges?
Somebody said judges were coming.

388
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,935
Hello, Dotty.

389
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:45,480
You always have judges here.
Why is that? To get in good with them?

390
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,029
How very nice to see you,
Mrs. Marcasson.

391
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,532
How very nice to see you
Mrs. Marcasson

392
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,619
How very nice to see you
Mrs. Marcasson

393
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:02,831
The judge is standing by
but I really don't know why

394
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,170
What were you doing
down in my bailiwick today?

395
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,672
Oh, just a little ambulance chasing.

396
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,799
-Successful?
-Well, I got the case.

397
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,134
What case?

398
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,304
A girl named Doris Attinger shot
her husband. l'm going to defend her.

399
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,435
Dinner is served, madam.

400
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,231
Oh, well, let's go on in, everyone.

401
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,485
That's all right, darling.

402
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,784
The trouble with this picture--
it drags.

403
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,369
Shut up, Kip.

404
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,330
Are you all sure
that you want to see this?

405
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:44,665
I don't.

406
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,209
Look at that.

407
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:51,463
This is our main house.
The cottage is out here by the camera.

408
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:54,007
I can't see it.

409
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,261
What an unusual name.
Your idea, Adam?

410
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,564
Cute outfit, Amanda.
Really cute.

411
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,487
Mighty pretty country up there!

412
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,740
Ha, ha.

413
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,577
I know a lady collapsed a lung once
laughing like that.

414
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:58,071
Oh, cute outfit, Adam!
Really cute!

415
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,877
Look at those darling dogs.

416
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,546
One, two, three.

417
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,715
Sort of an animal picture,
isn't it?

418
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,553
I would say this movie
has a rather limited appeal.

419
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,972
-What's that anyhow?
-lt's the mortgage.

420
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,225
That was the day
they paid off the mortgage.

421
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,768
Brought it out myself.

422
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,396
Looks like rubber from here.

423
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,402
We acted this all out later, of course.
I mean, it's not actual.

424
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,531
-All right, bigmouth, settle down.
-Oh, Kip!

425
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:52,668
Seems much slower than
the other eight times l've seen it.

426
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,754
Who took these pictures,
your cow?

427
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:02,052
-You oughta be on the stage, Judge.
-Anywhere but in this picture.

428
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,975
You should have taken a picture
of burning the mortgage.

429
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,686
We did, Dad. Wait, look.

430
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,731
Oh, cute, Adam. Very cute.

431
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,736
Oh, expensive hot dogs.

432
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,992
Our tree.

433
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,203
Tree kissing, a famous
old Connecticut custom.

434
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,920
Barn kissing, a famous
old Connecticut custom.

435
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,218
What a funny--

436
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:10,537
Wife kissing, a famous
old Connecticut custom.

437
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,375
Okay, everybody, on your heads.

438
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,177
As the sanking soo
sunks into the sinking sand...

439
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,720
we say good-bye...

440
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,890
to Bonner Hill
and the sickening home movies.

441
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,936
All right! All right!

442
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,979
You've said the same thing
nine times!

443
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:39,441
For the tenth time then, will you
stay out of this Attinger thing?

444
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,402
Did you have to sulk all evening,
and with a growl on your face?

445
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,404
How could a man have
a growl on his face?

446
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,157
If you think you're gonna turn a court
of law into a Punch-and-Judy show--

447
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:51,119
Darling, please!
This means a great deal to me...

448
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:52,788
and it's not a stunt.

449
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,999
This poor woman. lsn't she
entitled to the same justice...

450
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,210
that's usually reserved for men?

451
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,254
The same unwritten law
that got Lennahan off.

452
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,548
-Would you please--
-l know what you're going to say.

453
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,800
He should have been convicted too,
but he wasn't.

454
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,177
-Couldn't I please get one, little--
-You're not putting her away...

455
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,429
because she had the misfortune
to be born a female.

456
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,431
Just one word in edgewise.

457
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,643
Could I please
get a word in edgewise?

458
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,895
-Go ahead.
-Not one sybbal--

459
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:20,941
Not one syllable of what you
have been blabbering here tonight--

460
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,277
You always do that
when you get excited.

461
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,450
I am going to cut you
into 12 little pieces...

462
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,745
and feed you to the jury,
so get prepared for it.

463
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,674
Good night, Pinky.

464
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,303
Oh, good night.

465
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,781
We're here.

466
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,868
Have you agreed on a date
for the People v. Riverton?

467
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,369
Yes, Your Honor.

468
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,302
The People v. Delwyn
has been assigned to part three.

469
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,472
All witnesses in that case
will proceed to that part.

470
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,806
That's part three.

471
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,376
People against Attinger.

472
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,379
You may proceed.

473
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,382
Your Honor, I move the case of the
People of the State of New York...

474
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,968
against Doris Szabo Attinger
to trial.

475
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,220
-ls the defendant ready?
-Defendant is ready.

476
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,556
Very well. You may proceed
to select ajury.

477
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,939
Paul Hurlock.

478
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,652
Take your coat with you, please.

479
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,247
Place your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

480
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,749
You swear you will true answers
make to all questions...

481
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,918
put to you upon the challenges
touching upon your competence...

482
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,004
as a fair and impartial juror
in this proceeding...

483
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,132
between the people of New York and
Doris Szabo Attinger, so help you God?

484
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,592
-l do.
-Be seated.

485
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,594
State your full name and address.

486
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:57,639
Paul Hurlock, 1731 Boylston Avenue,
New York City.

487
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,398
Mr. Hurlock,
what's your occupation?

488
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,025
Infants headgear.

489
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:12,905
Are you personally acquainted
with one Warren Attinger?

490
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,199
-No.
-Doris Szabo Attinger?

491
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,659
-No.
-Beryl Caighn?

492
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:22,289
Do you think that you're able to render
ajust and honest verdict...

493
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,710
in this case as deduced by the evidence
of the law as laid down by the court?

494
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,462
-Sure.
-Yes?

495
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,465
-Uh, yes.
-The juror is acceptable to the People.

496
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:37,804
-Good morning, Mr. Hurlock.
-Good morning.

497
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,098
Do you believe
in equal rights for women?

498
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:42,267
-What?
-Objection.

499
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:46,438
May it please the court, I submit that
my entire line of defense...

500
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,900
is based on the proposition
that persons of the female sex...

501
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:53,862
should be dealt with before the law
as equals of persons of the male sex.

502
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,324
I submit that I cannot
hope to argue this line...

503
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:01,995
before minds hostile to
and prejudiced against the female sex.

504
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,040
Objection still stands,
Your Honor.

505
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,750
-Overruled.
-Exception.

506
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,127
Repeat the question, Counselor.

507
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,672
Do you believe
in equal rights for women?

508
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,132
I should say not.

509
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:17,052
The defendant challenges
this juror for cause.

510
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,680
Excused.

511
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,181
Benjamin Klausner.

512
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,778
Your Honor, in view of the fact
that counsel have agreed...

513
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,197
that alternate jurors
are not to be selected...

514
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:41,159
may we proceed without making a call
for additional prospective jurors?

515
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,494
You may proceed.

516
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,789
Left hand on the Bible,
raise your right hand.

517
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,792
You swear that you will true answers
make to all questions put to you...

518
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,961
upon the challenges
touching upon your competence...

519
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,963
as a fair and impartial juror
in this proceeding...

520
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,716
between the people of New York and
Doris Szabo Attinger, so help you God?

521
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,926
-l do.
-Be seated.

522
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,053
-You're Benjamin Klows-ner?
-Klausner.

523
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,599
-State your address.
-107 East 77th Street, New York City.

524
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,727
-Occupation.
-Motion picture projectionist.

525
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,034
Have you ever served on
a motion picture projectionist before?

526
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,577
What?

527
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,747
Uh, have you ever served
on ajury before?

528
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,029
Hello, thing.

529
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,739
Hello, at last.

530
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,242
Well, well, well.

531
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,035
Well, well, well, what?

532
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,539
-Here we are.
-How true.

533
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,082
Home at last.

534
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,084
Took the words right out of my--

535
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,213
Darling?

536
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,467
Are you--are you all right?

537
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,969
How do you mean?

538
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,263
I mean in health and so forth.

539
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,265
-Sure.
-Good.

540
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,310
In health, excellent.
ln so forth, fair.

541
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,312
-What's that some of?
-Some of daiquiris.

542
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,605
Oh, good.

543
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,706
Nobody died in the evening papers.
lsn't that nice?

544
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,751
What do you suppose it is,
perverseness of human nature or what?

545
00:38:54,835 --> 00:39:00,048
It seems every night when Mary's out,
that's the night I want to stay home.

546
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,177
Not me. I love to go out to dinner.
l'd rather go out than anything.

547
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,431
-Where do you want to go tonight?
-No place. I want to stay home.

548
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,349
Would you mind? Please?

549
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,144
-Well, I don't know. All right.
-Cook up something ourselves.

550
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,521
Something exotic. How would
you care for some of that?

551
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,565
-Oh, I would.
-Of what?

552
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,901
What you said.

553
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,028
Fine. You gonna make it?

554
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,530
You're not making too much sense.

555
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,575
Do you want to talk to me
or read that paper?

556
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,994
-Read the paper.
-Why?

557
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,663
Quite a lot about me in it.
I guess that's why.

558
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:32,998
Yes, l'll bet.

559
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,000
You feel Pinky, cranky?

560
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,462
You feel cranky, Pinky?

561
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,672
Hard day, huh?

562
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,883
-ln court all day?
-Yes.

563
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,886
Had to mix it up
with a tough customer.

564
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,472
-That always makes you irritable.
-Not so bad.

565
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,642
-ln fact, it was a cinch.
-That's good, isn't it?

566
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:55,062
-lsn't it?
-Oh, my, my, my.

567
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,396
Dear?

568
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,484
-You mean me?
-l sure do.

569
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,528
-Listen.
-l'm all ears.

570
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,571
-Oh, sure.
-What?

571
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,657
You all right?

572
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,701
Me? Sure. Of course. Why?

573
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:13,455
I just wouldn't wanna think of you
not being all right, that's all.

574
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,669
-You know what you are?
-What?

575
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,049
-Lovable.
-l know.

576
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,093
-Are you hungry?
-Yes, l'm starving.

577
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,804
Let's go.

578
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,436
Thank you, thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

579
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,522
Give you a real rubdown later
if you'll give me one.

580
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,318
There. That's more like it.

581
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,529
-Ouch!
-What's the matter?

582
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,917
Anything for a hungry man?

583
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:02,671
-Cheese. A soufflé, maybe?
-No, no.

584
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,299
I've got enough on my mind
without a soufflé.

585
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,301
There ought to be
some lamb left.

586
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:10,095
I don't think--wait a minute.
Yes!

587
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,805
-Lamb?
-Mm-hmm.

588
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,308
-Lamb curry. What do you say?
-Perfect.

589
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,642
With rice.

590
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:18,228
-Chutney, chutney.
-Yes, I think so.

591
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,606
Tea. Tea and curry.
That's the thing.

592
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,609
-And salad.
-Give me the junk for the salad.

593
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:30,949
Do you know, you were pretty cute
in there today, my little.

594
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,785
You weren't so bad yourself, chum.

595
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,496
-Do you mind a bit of garlic?
-Why a bit?

596
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,250
-Pinkie?
-What, Pinky?

597
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,961
-Do me a favor, will ya?
-Not too much salt?

598
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,380
No. Drop the case.

599
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,382
-l can't.
-Why not?

600
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,635
-lt's my cause.
-l know.

601
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:53,263
But I could see in there today,
it's gonna get sillier and messier...

602
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,307
day by day by day.

603
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,808
By day.

604
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,478
-l don't ask many favors.
-Sure you do.

605
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,189
-You can handle it from your desk.
-Not as good.

606
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:05,484
Listen, darling, I know that
deep down you agree with me...

607
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,362
with everything I want
and hope and believe in.

608
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:11,490
We couldn't be so close if you didn't--
if I didn't feel that you did.

609
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:13,325
-Oh, sure.
-Take this trial.

610
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,078
Maybe it has some of the
inconvenience of the spotlight...

611
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,955
but that's my whole point.

612
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:20,249
Not any green peppers.
lndigestible.

613
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,376
Everything's indigestible
to some people.

614
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,378
Anyway, I don't like
green peppers.

615
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,463
-No green peppers.
-Take the Boston Tea Party.

616
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,132
-lnstead of the green peppers?
-What did they do?

617
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,177
They dramatized an injustice.
That's all l'm trying to do.

618
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,889
Yeah. People will be making jokes
about us over the radio before long.

619
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:38,642
-All in a good cause.
-Your cause.

620
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,018
Everybody's.

621
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,480
Now--there's just enough for us.

622
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,871
Hello, you well-known thing, you.

623
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,289
How are you?

624
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,584
You ask that because you can't
think of anything else to say.

625
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,752
You don't care
whether I live or die.

626
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,882
Hello, lawyer dear.
Seen all these?

627
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:12,050
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Have some extras.

628
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,887
Marvelous goings-on.
Everybody's talking about it.

629
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:18,182
-Yeah. That's the idea.
-Sort of like the World Series.

630
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,683
Yes, l'm afraid it is.

631
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,399
What have you been eating,
raspberry jam or Amanda's face?

632
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,990
Oh, very funny.

633
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,534
-Very, very funny.
-l didn't even notice it.

634
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:40,412
If you'd look at me once in a while,
you would notice things like that.

635
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,748
Bicker, bicker. I give them
three months at the most.

636
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,499
What do you want, anyway?

637
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,585
As if you didn't know.

638
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,007
-How's it coming?
-The show?

639
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,051
Smashing. Simply smashing.

640
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,304
Couldn't get much work done today.
Another notion got in the way.

641
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,765
-A new song. Wanna hear it?
-Maybe some other time.

642
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,684
It's not finished yet,
but please, it's for you.

643
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,811
And, Adam, you don't have to listen.

644
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,443
-He's written a song.
-Darling, don't be cross.

645
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,237
He's sweet.

646
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,571
Listening?

647
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:23,163
Farewell, Amanda

648
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:27,751
Adiós, addio, adieu

649
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:34,174
Farewell, Amanda

650
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:37,636
It all was great fun
but it's done

651
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,263
It's through

652
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:42,558
Still now and then

653
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:46,228
Fair Amanda

654
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:50,983
When you're stepping on
the stars above

655
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:56,071
Please recall
that wonderful night

656
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,782
On the veranda

657
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,244
Sweet Amanda

658
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,163
And our love

659
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,749
No verse yet.

660
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,544
Listening?

661
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:20,554
Farewell, Amanda

662
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:24,850
Adiós, addio, adieu

663
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:32,024
Farewell, Amanda

664
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:35,611
It all was great fun
but it's done

665
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,988
It's through

666
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,824
Still now and then

667
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,702
Fair Amanda

668
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:48,832
When you're stepping
on the stars above

669
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:54,463
Please recall
that wonderful night

670
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:57,966
On the veranda

671
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,136
Sweet Amanda

672
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,389
And our love

673
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,937
Help!

674
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,067
Pardon.

675
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,116
Did I hear someone say,
Sing it again?

676
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,410
-No.
-l haven't got time anyway.

677
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,955
-lt's very pretty.
-Pretty and fresh.

678
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,749
You're not friendly to me.
I may consult my lawyer.

679
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,835
I think you should
change the name.

680
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:36,255
Can't. lt won't scan, see?
Good luck tomorrow, Amanda.

681
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,799
I'm on your side.
I guess you know that.

682
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:41,969
You've got me so convinced,
I may even go out and become a woman.

683
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,470
Good night, all.

684
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,849
He wouldn't have
far to go either.

685
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,934
-Shh!
-What's the matter?

686
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:50,978
He can hear you.

687
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,780
Then what happened?

688
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:04,867
-Then I heard a noise, and--
-What kind of a noise?

689
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:11,290
Like a sound.
Like a loud sound going off.

690
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,792
-Yes?
-So I jumped up...

691
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,295
and all of a sudden I saw her.

692
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,130
-Mrs. Attinger?
-Yes.

693
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,341
-Say so, please.
-l seen Mrs. Attinger.

694
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:24,678
She was comin' after me with this gun
right in her two hands.

695
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,889
I guess I must've started to conk out--

696
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,725
Excuse me, to faint.

697
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:34,146
So then Mr. Attinger grabbed me,
so's I shouldn't fall down, I guess...

698
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:37,441
and then she, Mrs. Attinger,
tried to kill me.

699
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,984
Objection.

700
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:42,196
Will the court instruct the witness to
refrain from testifying to conclusions?

701
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:46,366
Sustain that.
Jury, disregard reply.

702
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,868
Strike from record.

703
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,330
Witness will please confine herself
to the recital of facts.

704
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:56,627
-What did she do?
-She shot me--at me.

705
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,754
I mean, she tried to shoot me.

706
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:02,007
-How do you know that?
-Because she did it.

707
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,677
So then he jumped in front of me--
Warren, Mr. Attinger--

708
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,804
and I ran out
in the hall hollering...

709
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:11,433
and then I fainted
and everything went black.

710
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,187
Your witness.

711
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:19,358
Everything went black a little earlier,
didn't it, Miss Caighn?

712
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,526
What?

713
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,028
I refer to the color
of the black silk negligee...

714
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,489
you put on
to receive Mr. Attinger.

715
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,033
Objection. lrrelevant. What difference
does it make what color she was wearing?

716
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,368
-A lot.
-Oh, come, come.

717
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,994
Overruled.

718
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,412
Exception.

719
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,415
Were you wearing
a black silk lace negligee?

720
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,544
-Yes.
-Speak up, Miss Caighn.

721
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,921
We're all interested
in what you have to say.

722
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,173
-What else?
-What?

723
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,967
Answer the question.

724
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,011
-l can't remember.
-Shoes? Slippers?

725
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,763
-Yes.
-Which?

726
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,349
-Slippers.
-Stockings?

727
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:53,934
Yes.

728
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,061
Think again.

729
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,231
Nothing else?

730
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,858
-Yes.
-What?

731
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,609
A hair ribbon.

732
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,028
This your usual costume...

733
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,030
for receiving casual callers?

734
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,241
Objection.

735
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:11,201
Sustained.

736
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:16,915
Withdrawn. Uh, Miss Caighn, you said
Mr. Attinger came to see you about--

737
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,918
About another insurance policy.
I said this already.

738
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,920
Well, say it again.

739
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:26,049
Mr. Attinger came to collect on
my policy and explain me another kind.

740
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,051
-You hold?
-Straight life, 3,000.

741
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,220
-And he came to discuss?
-Health and accident.

742
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:34,057
He showed remarkable foresight
in this, wouldn't you say?

743
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,185
Would Your Honor instruct counsel...

744
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,770
to refrain from these sly
and feminine hints to the jury?

745
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:40,772
I'll withdraw the question,
Your Honor, on condition...

746
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:43,400
that the word feminine
be stricken from the record.

747
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,652
-So be it.
-So ordered.

748
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,200
Miss Caighn,
a while ago you said--

749
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,829
Would you be kind enough to read me
some of Miss Caighn's testimony?

750
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:59,374
She just fainted, I believe,
for the first time.

751
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,921
So I guess I must've started
to conk out--

752
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:07,466
Excuse me--to faint.
So Mr. Attinger grabbed me--

753
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:11,303
That's it. Thank you very much.
You said Mr. Attinger grabbed you.

754
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,972
-Yes.
-Had he ever grabbed you before?

755
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,602
Never before?

756
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,481
You're aware
that you're under oath...

757
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:25,442
and that any false answer
makes you liable to perjury?

758
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,903
-Yes.
-Mr. Attinger...

759
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:31,114
had never touched you
before this time.

760
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,742
-Sure.
-Ahh.

761
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,994
We used to shake hands
quite a lot.

762
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,207
I see.
Did you enjoy it?

763
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,292
Objection!

764
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:43,836
Sustained.

765
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,928
And the year before that, what did you
give your wife for her birthday?

766
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:54,930
-Nothing.
-Nothing again.

767
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,349
-And the year before that?
-l don't remember.

768
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:00,018
You don't remember because
there's nothing to remember.

769
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,020
Wait a second. lt was--

770
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:05,274
Husbands remember the gifts
they give, Mr. Attinger.

771
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:09,653
-Okay, so I didn't.
-Why?

772
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,655
Had she ceased to be
a good wife to you?

773
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:14,032
Oh, she's okay.

774
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:17,995
Mr. Attinger, do you wish to see
justice done in this case?

775
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:21,290
-Yes!
-All right. Tell the truth.

776
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,834
Do you love your wife?
Tell the truth.

777
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,461
-No.
-Did you love her before she shot you?

778
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:29,256
-Tell the truth.
-When before?

779
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,300
-The day before.
-No.

780
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,719
When did you meet Beryl Caighn?

781
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:36,388
A year--maybe and a half.

782
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,141
And when did you stop loving
your wife? Tell the truth.

783
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:43,520
-At least three years.
-Why? Tell the truth.

784
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,397
She started getting too fat.

785
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,399
-Did you tell her about that?
-Yeah.

786
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,234
-What happened?
-She got fatter.

787
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:51,904
Mr. Attinger...

788
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:56,450
did you ever strike your wife?

789
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,828
-Not much.
-Tell the jury yes or no.

790
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:01,955
-Yeah.
-Knock her down?

791
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,876
-What?
-Did you ever knock her down?

792
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,211
Tell the truth.

793
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:10,506
Maybe a couple of times
she tripped or slipped.

794
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:12,049
Scold her?

795
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,010
Tell the jury yes or no.

796
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,388
-Yeah.
-Stay out all night?

797
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,806
Yeah.

798
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,893
Do you consider yourself
a good husband?

799
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,311
Yes.

800
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,940
That's all.

801
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:36,657
-Your wife ever scold you?
-Yes.

802
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,367
-Strike you?
-Yes.

803
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,452
-Knock you down?
-Yes.

804
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:45,707
-Did she ever stay out all night?
-No. I wish she did.

805
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,294
Never mind the comment.
Just answer the questions.

806
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,672
What l'm doin' now--all day.

807
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:55,425
Now listen to this
very carefully.

808
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,511
Did your wife ever threaten you?

809
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,096
Sure. Yeah.

810
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,098
-When?
-Every day.

811
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,142
And what effect
did this have upon you?

812
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:06,311
It made me into a nervous wreck.

813
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:10,148
How else did she mistreat you?

814
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,526
In bed. She used to hit me
in my sleep.

815
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,488
-How?
-What do you mean, How?

816
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,990
With her fist.

817
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:23,120
Now you're sure this wasn't
just your imagination?

818
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:26,331
You don't get a split lip
from imagination.

819
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:30,586
She used to wait 'til
I went to sleep. Then pow, pow!

820
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,254
So then an argument.

821
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,299
So then l'd go to sleep again.
So then pow, pow!

822
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,012
-This caused you great distress?
-Yes.

823
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:42,014
Also sleepless nights.

824
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:51,565
So I says, Listen, Warren,
you can't have it both ways.

825
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:56,278
So make up your mind, and don't try to
make some kind of part-timer out of me.

826
00:53:56,361 --> 00:54:00,032
So he says,
Bite your tongue, fatso.

827
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,701
So I says,
You comin' home for supper?

828
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,329
So he says,
l'll write you a letter.

829
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,623
So I said,
You comin' home after?

830
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:11,418
So he says, l'll put an ad in the
New York Times personal column...

831
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:12,920
and let you know.

832
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:16,548
So I says, Don't get too sassy,
Mr. Attinger.

833
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,843
So he says, Don't you be lookin'
at me so cockeyed...

834
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,930
'cause I don't wanna have to shake
your head up to straighten 'em out.

835
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,141
So I threw it.

836
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,727
-Threw what?
-The pot.

837
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,271
So he left mad.

838
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,816
And that was
the last you saw him?

839
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,110
'Til later,
when I followed him up...

840
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:39,613
caught him muzzlin'
that tall job.

841
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,867
-Objection.
-Sustained.

842
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,703
Instructjury, bear in mind
activity not yet known.

843
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:50,123
When you entered apartment D,
what did you see?

844
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:51,625
Them, clutchin'.

845
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,964
-How close together were they?
-Oh, close. Together.

846
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:00,133
-No space between them?
-No space.

847
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,760
Where were her hands?

848
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:04,137
On his ears.

849
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:09,309
-On his ears?
-One on each ear.

850
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:12,062
Maybe that's why
he didn't hear me come in.

851
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,606
And where were his hands?

852
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:15,941
Who knows?

853
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,777
You didn't see them?

854
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:20,821
Around her someplace.

855
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,075
-Did that surprise you?
-No. I figured.

856
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,078
But it enraged you?

857
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:30,455
-Objection. Leading.
-Sustained.

858
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:38,046
When you found them thus embraced,
what happened?

859
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:41,258
It enraged me.

860
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,759
Then what?

861
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:46,054
I pressed the gun.

862
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,389
And?

863
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,433
Bang?

864
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,645
Did you take careful aim?

865
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:55,397
I was too nervous.

866
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,899
Did you aim at all?

867
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,442
I was too nervous.

868
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:01,153
Did you at that time
intend to kill Beryl Caighn?

869
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:05,866
-To wound her?
-No.

870
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,701
-To frighten her?
-Yes.

871
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:10,037
To kill your husband?

872
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,999
-To wound him? To frighten him?
-No.

873
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,584
-No?
-No.

874
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:20,214
In other words,
you fired the pistol...

875
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:22,382
only to frighten Beryl Caighn.

876
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:25,969
Yes.

877
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,138
What was the point of that?

878
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,682
I have three children.

879
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,435
She was breakin' up my home!

880
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:47,658
That's right, Mrs. Attinger.
Go ahead and have a good cry.

881
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,664
But somewhere in between those sobs
maybe you could tell us...

882
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,666
who it is
you're crying for.

883
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:58,919
Is it for Beryl Caighn,
an innocent bystander...

884
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,547
to your sordid domestic failure...

885
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,509
or is it your husband,
driven ill by your shrewishness?

886
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:09,888
Or is it your children, cursed with
an unstable and irresponsible mother?

887
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:14,059
-Or could it be for yourself--
-l object to this pre-peroration...

888
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:17,145
on the grounds that it is
prejudicial to the defendant!

889
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:21,441
Oh, let it stand. I can't see
that it much matters. Overruled.

890
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:23,527
Exception.

891
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,281
But do get on with it,
Mr. Bonner. Please.

892
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,201
Your husband has testified...

893
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,245
that you have frequent
fits of temper.

894
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,622
-l must object--
-What are you gonna do...

895
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:37,624
object before I ask the question?

896
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,960
This is an attempt to paint
the defendant as a lunatic.

897
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,546
Mrs. Attinger
is a fine, healthy--

898
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,673
-A noble wife, mother--
-Just a moment, please!

899
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:47,718
May I remind the court of the words
of the poet Congreve?

900
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:49,720
Are you gonna quote poetry?

901
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:51,763
Heaven hath no rage like love
to hatred turned...

902
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:53,807
nor hell a fury
like a woman scorned!

903
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,810
Now just a moment!
Read the question.

904
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:03,734
Your husband has testified that
you have frequent fits of temper.

905
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,068
What--

906
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:17,539
Don't tell me
thatjudge is impartial.

907
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:20,083
Every time I look up at him,
I can just see him.

908
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:25,005
Quiet, please. lt doesn't do you
any good if you don't--wait a minute.

909
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,007
-Relax.
-l'm relaxed.

910
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:30,802
-No, I can feel.
-So can l.

911
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,346
You can?

912
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:34,806
Ow! What are you doing?

913
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:36,141
Testing.

914
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,272
Oh, I thank you.

915
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:45,817
Seems to me I need this
more every year.

916
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:48,862
-You're aging fast, that's all.
-You can say that again.

917
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:51,865
All right, I will.
You're aging fast, that's all.

918
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,367
And you're helping.

919
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,370
Done.

920
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:58,956
I thank you.

921
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:06,255
There ought to be news on the radio.
You wanna hear it?

922
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,091
If it's good news, yep.

923
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:11,343
-Oh, sorry.
-l'll do my best.

924
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:13,470
Why don't they have all the good news
on one station...

925
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,931
and all the bad news
on another station?

926
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,599
Wouldn't that be good?

927
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,234
I got the station with the bad news.

928
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:30,821
Getting awfully popular, Kip's song.

929
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:33,198
-l hear it everywhere.
-So do l.

930
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:35,450
I hear it sometimes
even when it isn't playing.

931
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,789
Farewell, Amanda

932
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:45,961
Adiós, addio, adieu

933
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:49,506
Farewell, Amanda

934
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,058
What's the matter?
Don't you want your rubdown?

935
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,604
What, are you sore
about a little slap?

936
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,315
-No.
-Well, what, then?

937
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:09,151
You meant that, didn't you?
You really meant that.

938
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:11,403
-Why, no, l--
-Yes, you did. I know your touch.

939
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,364
-l know a slap from a slug!
-Okay, okay.

940
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:18,118
I'm not so sure it is. l'm not
so sure I care to expose myself...

941
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:21,622
to typical, instinctive
masculine brutality!

942
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:24,458
-Oh, come now!
-lt felt not only as if you meant it...

943
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,877
but as though you felt
you had a right to.

944
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:30,464
-l can tell.
-You got radar equipment back there?

945
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
You're really sore at me,
aren't you?

946
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:37,971
Oh, don't be diriculous--ridiculous.

947
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,057
-There. Proves it.
-All right!

948
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:43,060
All right, I am sore!
What about it?

949
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,022
-Why are you?
-You know why.

950
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,483
You mean Kip? Just because
he's having a little fun?

951
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:53,529
No, because you're having fun.
The wrong kind, down in that courtroom.

952
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:56,573
You're shaking the law by the tail,
and I don't like it!

953
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:59,117
I'm ashamed of you, Amanda.

954
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,119
-ls that so?
-Yes, that's so.

955
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:04,498
We've had differences, and l've always
tried to see your point of view...

956
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,542
but this time
you've got me stumped.

957
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,585
You haven't tried to see
my point of view.

958
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,712
You haven't any respect for my--

959
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:13,215
There we go.
There we go.

960
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:16,510
Here we go again.
The old juice.

961
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,933
Guaranteed heart-melter.
A few female tears.

962
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,060
-l can't help it!
-Stronger than any acid.

963
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,062
But this time they won't work.

964
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:29,690
You can cry from now
until the jury comes in...

965
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:33,485
and it won't make you right,
and it won't win you that silly case!

966
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:37,656
Adam! Please, try to understand!

967
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:54,256
Don't you want your rubdown?

968
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:58,677
Want a drink?

969
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,722
-No.
-Do you want any--

970
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:05,309
What, honey?

971
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,644
-Ow!
-Let's all be manly!

972
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:20,657
...and represents a wanton waste
of the taxpayers' money.

973
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:22,784
I have called
these few witnesses...

974
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,913
to assist me in graphically
illustrating my point:

975
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,708
That woman as the equal of man
is entitled to equality before the law.

976
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,754
They have been carefully selected
to testify in this case...

977
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:37,716
each representing a particular branch
of American womanhood...

978
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:41,470
for not only one woman
is on trial here but all women.

979
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:44,765
Your Honor, I submit that not one
of this long string of witnesses...

980
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,767
has any direct bearing
on the case.

981
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,102
For years, women have been
ridiculed, pampered...

982
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:50,604
chucked under the chin.

983
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:54,358
I ask you on behalf of us all,
be fair to the fairer sex.

984
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,026
We'll be here a year.

985
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,780
Mrs. Bonner, couldn't you
cover the ground with three witnesses?

986
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:06,203
Well, Dr. Margaret Brodeigh,
will you take the stand, please?

987
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,831
With this witness
to be examined...

988
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:12,501
this case will continue
for at least two days.

989
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:14,670
With Your Honor's permission,
l'll report that no new cases...

990
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,672
are to be added
to our day calendar.

991
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:17,923
So ordered.

992
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:20,050
Left hand on the Bible,
raise your right hand.

993
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:22,678
You swear that the evidence
you'll give to the jury...

994
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,097
will be nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

995
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:27,891
-l do.
-Be seated. Your name and address.

996
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:31,353

58 East 88th Street.

997
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:34,398
Dr. Brodeigh, would you be
good enough to state your age?

998
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,817
-Thirty-three.
-Your occupation?

999
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,861
-Chemist.
-Will you tell the court...

1000
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,488

01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:06,638
Will you tell the court
what degrees you have?

1008
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,558
Well, let's see.

01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:20,569

01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,290
Seventeen.

1017
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:35,459
And this promotion
placed under you how many?

1018
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,503
Uh, 3-8-3.

1019
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,505
-Any men?
-Mostly.

1020
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:41,924
-They didn't complain?
-Couldn't. Seniority.

1021
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,134
Does your husband
object to your employment?

1022
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,636
-No.
-ls he employed?

1023
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,970
-Yes.
-Where?

1024
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,097
Under me.

1025
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:54,811
Just what do you mean
by show business, Miss La Pere?

1026
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:57,439
Well, I mean all different kinds
of show business.

1027
01:04:57,523 --> 01:05:00,901
There's carnival and vaudeville,
Ringling Brothers, nightclubs.

1028
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,612
-l even did legit once.
-What do you do?

1029
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:07,366
It changes, see?
Take, for instance, tumbling.

1030
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,993
I used to do
a lot of tumbling...

1031
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,871
but it gets corny, and l'm stuck
with the role of flip-flap--

1032
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,749
-What are they?
-Well, it's a--

1033
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,171
Hey, look.

1034
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,403
That's it.

1035
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:47,614
But nobody wants it.
lt's corny.

1036
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,033
So then I got trapeze work
and high bar...

1037
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:52,953
but l'm getting
a little heavy for that now...

1038
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,080
so I got into this lift act.

1039
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:57,416
I'm one of the only female
under-standers around.

1040
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,459
-What?
-We do this open pyramid...

1041
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,128
where I support five men.

1042
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,297
Surely you're not the only female
who does that.

1043
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,091
No, I mean in the act.
Oh, a gag.

1044
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:08,886
That's pretty good.

1045
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,513
Yeah, support.

1046
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:14,600
That was a good one.

1047
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:16,768
Let's get on, counsel, shall we?

1048
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:18,395
Yes, sir.

1049
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:21,607
Now, what do you consider
your best physical...

1050
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,609
or athletic accomplishment?

1051
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,444
My lifts, I guess.

1052
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,947
I was out last year, these three
Olympic guys and me. Just lifts.

1053
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,284
I've done the finish where I lift
the champ with his barbell together.

1054
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:34,369
-What?
-Yeah. This was a good act.

1055
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:37,414
You see, they lift, lift, lift...

1056
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:40,959
and then the last guy does
a one-hand 350 barbell lift.

1057
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:45,380
Then while he's still got it up,
I lift him with his barbell together...

1058
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,549
peeled down so they could tell
I was a woman.

1059
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:50,177
-Remarkable.
-Yeah, I used to get a good hand.

1060
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,304
Can you lift any man?

1061
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,932
Well, I don't know.

1062
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:57,142
-Could you lift Mr. Bonner?
-Who's he?

1063
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:00,229
Your Honor, I object to this farce.
I call to counsel's attention--

1064
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:02,606
-That's him.
-Oh, sure.

1065
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:05,776
May it please the court,
I strenuously object...

1066
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,819
to the methods being used
in this matter...

1067
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:11,156
if for no other reason that it's
an insult to the dignity of the court.

1068
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,285
We all love the circus. I love it
as much as anybody else, but it seems--

1069
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:20,249
-No, no, no, no!
-l'll get you up here. That's it.

1070
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,836
-Clap your hands.
-Put him down!

1071
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,507
-Your Honor, l'm trying to demonstrate--
-Let me down!

1072
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:31,677
-Let me down, lady!
-Come down from there!

1073
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,345
Your Honor--

1074
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,514
Just put him down!

1075
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:36,849
Put him down.

1076
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:38,183
Let me down, lady.

1077
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:41,144
Now, baby, there you are now.

1078
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,361
Hello, thing.

1079
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:01,623
I'm sorry l'm so late, darling,
but l--

1080
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:17,598
Guess who this is for?

1081
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,574
Darling, please.

1082
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:39,703
You're real mad,
or is this a tease or what?

1083
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:42,706
Real mad.

1084
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,376
Shouldn't we talk about it?

1085
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:49,421
Don't you want to hear my side?

1086
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:04,645
Oh, Adam, don't you
want to talk to me?

1087
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:17,074
Well, what is it?
Did I go too far?

1088
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,786
If you think I did,
then l'm sorry.

1089
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:25,332
Can't I apologize?

1090
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:27,417
Didn't you ever go too far?

1091
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:30,504
Once.

1092
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:57,114
If l'm in the wrong,
I want to make it right...

1093
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:00,826
but you're making a mountain out of
something that isn't even an anthill...

1094
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:02,494
let alone a molehill.

1095
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,539
-A hill of beans--
-May I say just one thing?

1096
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:08,041
-Of course.
-Save your eloquence for the jury.

1097
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:13,964
Adam, please, forgive me.

1098
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,341
-What for?
-For whatever it is that's upset you.

1099
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,510
-You don't know what it is?
-Not exactly, no.

1100
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:21,763
-That's just my point.
-What point?

1101
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,099
We've been close,
but we've never been this close...

1102
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:28,103
and I see something in you l've never
seen before, and I don't like it.

1103
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:31,356
-ln fact, I hate it.
-Go ahead.

1104
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,442
Contempt for the law,
that's what you've got.

1105
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,485
It's a spreading disease.

1106
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:39,114
You think the law is something you can
get over or get under or get around...

1107
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,158
orjust plain flaunt.

1108
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,535
You start with that,
and you wind up in the--

1109
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:45,037
Well, look at us.

1110
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,707
The law is the law,
whether it's good or bad!

1111
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:52,211
If it's bad, change it,
don't bust it wide open.

1112
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,131
You start with one law.
Then pretty soon it's all laws.

1113
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:59,092
Pretty soon it's everything.
Then it's me.

1114
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:02,596
-You got no respect for me, have you?
-Not at the moment, no.

1115
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:06,600
Answer me one question, will you?
What is marriage? Tell me that.

1116
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,602
-You tell me.
-l will tell you.

1117
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:11,104
It's a contract.
lt's the law.

1118
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:14,191
Are you going to outsmart that the way
you've outsmarted all other laws?

1119
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:16,443
That's very clever.

1120
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:20,906
You've outsmarted yourself,
you've outsmarted me and everything.

1121
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:23,742
You get yourself set
on some dimwitted cause...

1122
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:25,744
and you go ahead regardless!

1123
01:11:25,786 --> 01:11:28,997
You don't care what it does to me
or to you or to anybody...

1124
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,999
and you don't care
what people watching think of us.

1125
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:34,920
I'll tell you what they think of us.
They think we're uncivilized nuts!

1126
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,672
Uncivilized!

1127
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,925
Just what blow you struck
for women's rights or what have you...

1128
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:42,177
I am sure I don't know...

1129
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:46,056
but you certainly have fouled us up
beyond all recognition.

1130
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:48,684
You've split us
right down the middle.

1131
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:50,018
How?

1132
01:11:51,645 --> 01:11:53,814
Just how?

1133
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:56,066
I've done it all the way
I said I would.

1134
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:59,444
I'm sick of this health,
richer, poorer, better or worse.

1135
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,697
This is too worse.
This is basic.

1136
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,533
I'm old-fashioned.
I like two sexes!

1137
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:08,453
I don't like being married
to what is known as a new woman.

1138
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:11,957
I want a wife,
not a competitor. Competitor!

1139
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:14,835
If you wanna be a big he-woman,
go and be it, but not with me.

1140
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,504
You're not gonna solve anything
by running away!

1141
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:19,173
Where are you going?

1142
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:23,135
Why don't you stand still
and have it out?

1143
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:26,680
-Where are you going?
-Because I don't want to.

1144
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:28,891
Adam, please.
l've said all the wrong things.

1145
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:31,560
I don't know what's the matter with me.
But you've said--

1146
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:34,062
No, I haven't.
l've said everything I meant.

1147
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:42,696
-Adam!
-What?

1148
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,781
Don't you dare slam that door.

1149
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,200
All right.

1150
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,190
The question here
is equality before the law...

1151
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:20,734
regardless of religion,
color, wealth...

1152
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:23,153
or, as in this instance, sex.

1153
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,780
Excuse me.

1154
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:29,201
Law, like man,
is composed of two parts.

1155
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:31,537
Just as man
is body and soul...

1156
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:34,331
so is the law letter and spirit.

1157
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:38,252
The law says,
Thou shalt not kill.

1158
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:41,839
Yet men have killed
and proved a reason...

1159
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,841
and been set free.

1160
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:46,218
Self-defense,
defense of others--

1161
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,303
of wife, of children and home.

1162
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,932
If a thief
breaks into your house...

1163
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,725
and you shoot him...

1164
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:58,188
the law will not deal harshly with you,
nor indeed should it.

1165
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:02,568
So here you are asked to judge
not whether or not...

1166
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,903
these acts were committed...

1167
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:08,323
but to what extent
they were justified.

1168
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,910
Now, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

1169
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:16,039
I request that you join me
in a revealing experiment.

1170
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:21,545
I ask you all
to direct your attention...

1171
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:24,214
to the defendant, Mrs. Attinger.

1172
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:26,258
Keep looking at her.
Keep watching.

1173
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:29,678
Listen carefully
and look at her hard.

1174
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:33,098
Now imagine her a man.

1175
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,809
Go on now.
Use your imaginations.

1176
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:40,147
Think of her as a man sitting there
accused of a like crime.

1177
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:43,442
A husband who was only trying
to protect his home.

1178
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:47,321
Now hold that impression
and look at Beryl Caighn.

1179
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:49,406
Look at her hard.

1180
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:53,702
A man. A slick home wrecker.
A third party.

1181
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:56,413
A wolf.
You know the type.

1182
01:14:56,455 --> 01:15:00,334
All right, hold that impression
and look at Mr. Attinger...

1183
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,169
and suppose him a woman.

1184
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:03,837
Try. Try hard.

1185
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:06,798
Ah, yes, there she is.

1186
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:11,303
The guilty wife. Look at her.
Does she arouse your sympathy?

1187
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:14,348
All right.
Now you have it.

1188
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,016
Judge it so!

1189
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:20,062
An unwritten law stands back of a man
who fights to defend his home.

1190
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:26,193
Apply this same law
to this maltreated wife...

1191
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:27,778
and neglected woman.

1192
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:32,407
We ask you no more.
Equality.

1193
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:35,744
Deep in the heart
of South America...

1194
01:15:35,827 --> 01:15:39,831
there thrives today a civilization
far older than ours.

1195
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:43,335
A people known as the Lorcananos,
descended from the Amazons.

1196
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:48,841
In this vast tribe,
members of the female sex...

1197
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:50,843
rule and govern...

1198
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:55,097
and systematically deny
equal rights to the men...

1199
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,225
made weak and puny
by years of subservience...

1200
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,768
too weak to revolt.

1201
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:03,689
And yet how long have we lived...

1202
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:06,400
in the shadow of a like injustice?

1203
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:11,113
Consider this
unfortunate woman's act...

1204
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:14,324
as though you yourselves
had each committed it.

1205
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:19,413
Every living being
is capable of attack...

1206
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:20,914
if sufficiently provoked.

1207
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:25,252
Assault lies dormant
within us all.

1208
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:29,923
It requires only circumstance
to set it in violent motion.

1209
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:31,800
I ask you...

1210
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,554
for a verdict of not guilty.

1211
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,517
There was no murder attempt here.

1212
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:46,815
Only a pathetic attempt
to save a home.

1213
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,943
I should like to say
at the outset...

1214
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:53,530
that I think the arguments advanced
by the counsel for the defense...

1215
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:55,449
were sound.

1216
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:56,783
Mere sound.

1217
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:05,709
Ladies and joodlemen
of the jerry--

1218
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:08,253
that is to say,
gentlemen of the jury.

1219
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:12,382
While I have been vastly amused by some
of the entertainment provided here...

1220
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:16,428
I must remind you that it has
absolutely no bearing on the case.

1221
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:21,558
Of course, l'm going to ask you
for a verdict of guilty as charged.

1222
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,062
You, not l,
must speak for the people...

1223
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:29,191
and the people ask you to say,
Citizens abide by the law.

1224
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,362
No one can feel safe
living in a community...

1225
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:36,448
when there are reckless
and irresponsible neurotics...

1226
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:40,661
wandering about its thoroughfares
armed with deadly weapons.

1227
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:43,664
-You must deal with criminals--
-Objection!

1228
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:45,874
-You must deal with criminals--
-Not brought out by testimony.

1229
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,043
Sit down, Pinkie! I didn't
get up and interrupt you--

1230
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:50,587
-Just a moment!
-l didn't get his last--

1231
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,631
You said, Sit down something.

1232
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:54,216
No matter, no matter.

1233
01:17:54,299 --> 01:17:56,885
May I have it
for the record, please?

1234
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:58,595
Sit down, Pinkie.

1235
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:00,973
Pinkie?

1236
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,225
-Yes.
-What's that, a name?

1237
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:07,187
-Yes.
-Whose?

1238
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,273
The counsel for the defense.

1239
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:12,693
Oh. ls that a Y
or an l-E?

1240
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,820
Y for him, l-E for me.

1241
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:19,157
Can we get on with it? What was
your objection, Pinkie--counsel?

1242
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:22,619
I object to the characterization
of the defendant as a criminal.

1243
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,705
-A strange appellation...
-Sustained.

1244
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:27,040
-for one with an unblemished record...
-Jury disregard reference.

1245
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:29,960
-as citizen, wife and mother!
-l have ruled!

1246
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:32,171
The court has ruled!

1247
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:33,755
All right, Pinky.

1248
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:40,304
Well, as I was saying...

1249
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:44,850
or rather, as I was hoping
I would be able to say...

1250
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:48,270
the purpose of any summation
in any lourt of caw--

1251
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:50,772
in any court of caw--

1252
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:54,526
I beg your pardon, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me begin again.

1253
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,446
What is there for you to decide?
One thing.

1254
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:02,576
Was she trying to kill her husband
and Beryl Caighn or both?

1255
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:03,952
I smile.

1256
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:06,413
I find it a little difficult
to proceed in this case...

1257
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:11,126
without bursting into laughter at
the utter plimsicity of the answer...

1258
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,046
and the puny excuse,
well after the fact...

1259
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,131
that she was merely trying
to frighten them.

1260
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:17,466
Simplicity!

1261
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,471
I resent--l resent any neighbor...

1262
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:25,474
who takes the law
into her own hands...

1263
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:30,312
and places a special interpretation
upon itjust for herself.

1264
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:35,067
Now, let's take the character
of this Doris Attinger.

1265
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,362
I'm afraid that's going to be
a little difficult...

1266
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:42,407
because we haven't been told
much about her in here...

1267
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:46,161
and we certainly haven't seen
Doris Attinger in this courtroom.

1268
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:50,082
What we have seen
is a performance...

1269
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:53,377
complete with makeup
and costume.

1270
01:19:54,545 --> 01:19:57,798
Coached by her counsel for the defense,
she has presented...

1271
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:01,760
a sweet face--what a sweet face.

1272
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:06,014
Crowned by
a tenderly trimmed bonnet.

1273
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:10,894
I find it a little difficult
to be taken in, ladies and gentlemen...

1274
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:14,273
because I happen to be the fellow
who paid for the bonnet...

1275
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:16,233
and here's the receipt
to prove it.

1276
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:18,360
Do you mind if I show that
to the jury?

1277
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:21,071
I'd like to enter this
as people's exhibit number 12.

1278
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:24,908
And also, Mrs. Attinger,
I would like to have my hat back!

1279
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:26,285
Your Honor!

1280
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:29,121
-Mr. District Attorney!
-Now, any further attempts--

1281
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:32,541
You will conclude your summation
without any further demonstration!

1282
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,802
Okay, everybody, let's go!

1283
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:57,024
Please rise.

1284
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,822
Please be seated.

1285
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,412
Mr. Foreman, please rise.

1286
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,124
Have you agreed upon a verdict?

1287
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,168
We have.

1288
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:19,546
Jurors, please rise.

1289
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:25,010
Defendant rise.

1290
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:32,434
Jurors, look upon the defendant.

1291
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:38,190
Defendant, look upon the jurors.

1292
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:42,361
How say you? Do you find
the defendant guilty or not guilty?

1293
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,451
We find the defendant not guilty.

1294
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,876
Hearken to your verdict
as it stands recorded.

1295
01:21:57,918 --> 01:21:59,920
You find the defendant
not guilty of the offense...

1296
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:02,005
as charged in the indictment.

1297
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,341
-So say you all?
-Yes, sir.

1298
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:09,012
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your efforts.

1299
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,974
Jury dismissed.
Defendant discharged.

1300
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,851
Court is adjourned.

1301
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,352
Please rise.

1302
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:19,189
Let's get a picture.

1303
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,234
All right.

1304
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:24,236
Come on, honey.
Let's go over here.

1305
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:41,753
I don't want my picture taken.

1306
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,970
-Bring her in here.
-Smile. That's it.

1307
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,139
How 'bout the three of you
shakin' hands?

1308
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:54,725
Shakin' hands. That's it.
All is forgiven.

1309
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:03,901
-One more picture.
-My babies!

1310
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,695
-Get me a camera!
-Let's get these two together.

1311
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:08,280
My babies!

1312
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:12,117
-Let's get some pictures.
-Bring the children around.

1313
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,953
Turn around, son.
Let your face love the camera.

1314
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:16,580
Bring the father in.

1315
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:20,751
Turn around.
Bring Beryl in. Where's Beryl?

1316
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,920
Bring her in.
Turn your face up.

1317
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:29,009
Put your arms around him.
All right. Look up.

1318
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,014
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1319
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,518
Or should I say congratulations?

1320
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:43,273
I wish it could've been a tie.

1321
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:45,651
Stand together, will ya?
Right there.

1322
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:48,403
Mrs. Bonner, do you consider this
a significant verdict?

1323
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,489
-Yes, she does.
-Can you look pleasant at her?

1324
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:52,491
-Laugh it up for the camera.
-Smile!

1325
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,035
A small but important step
in women's march toward equality--

1326
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:57,037
From your summation.
Okay to quote you now?

1327
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,623
-Oh, yeah.
-How 'bout shakin' hands?

1328
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:02,167
-Good idea. All is forgiven. Swell.
-One more.

1329
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:04,711
-No, that's enough.
-Put your arm around her.

1330
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:08,215
-That's enough!
-That's what I call cooperation.

1331
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:10,884
-l'm sorry about--
-Excuse me, please.

1332
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:12,970
-Greatjob, Mrs. Bonner.
-Thank you.

1333
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:39,162
We have to get with Julie
over the quarterly tax return.

1334
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:40,998
Tomorrow all right?

1335
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:43,041
-Fine.
-Want me to set it up?

1336
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:45,586
-No, l'll do it.
-Thanks.

1337
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:50,757
See you.

1338
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:52,759
Yes, I suppose so.

1339
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:01,560
...question of the value
of the residuals of the piece.

1340
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:06,398
You see, the question
of retaining copyright--

1341
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:10,944
-l made a mistake tonight.
-So?

1342
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:13,530
I should have invited
your mind to supper too.

1343
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,574
-What?
-Your absent mind.

1344
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:18,368
I'm sorry, Kip.

1345
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:22,789
-This is in order, though.
-Thanks.

1346
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:25,292
Want a drink?

1347
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:29,087
-He thinks l'm unreasonable.
-Who?

1348
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:32,382
-Adam.
-Never mind Adam.

1349
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,802
Just as a friend, Kip--

1350
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:39,014
-Yes, you beautiful barrister, you.
-As a friend, do--

1351
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:42,559
do you think
that l'm unreasonable?

1352
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:44,645
I think you're reasonable.

1353
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:48,440
Yes, but do I strike you--

1354
01:25:48,524 --> 01:25:50,317
strike you as overbearing?

1355
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,902
Under-bearing.

1356
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:55,656
I may be wrong about much,
about plenty, but not about this.

1357
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,990
Not about what?

1358
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,785
Marriage.
What it's supposed to be.

1359
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:03,664
-What makes it work or perfect.
-You're so right.

1360
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:06,458
Balance, equality,
mutual everything.

1361
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:10,504
There's no room in marriage for what
used to be known as the little woman.

1362
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:12,631
She's got to be
as big as the man is.

1363
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,675
-What if he's a little man?
-Sharing.

1364
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:16,927
That's what it takes
to make a marriage--

1365
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:20,806
keep a marriage from getting sick
of all the duties and respon--

1366
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,933
You're sure that we can
hear my phone in here?

1367
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:26,311
-l'm sure.
-All the duties and responsibilities...

1368
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,480
and troubles.

1369
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:31,358
Listen.
No part of marriage...

1370
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:34,444
is the exclusive province
of any one sex.

1371
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:37,447
Why can't he see that?

1372
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:40,242
Because he's unreasonable.
And overbearing.

1373
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:45,831
Sore as he was, that was wrong
to call me a comtetitor.

1374
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:47,875
-A what?
-A competitor?

1375
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:53,338
-What a way to put it.
-He's miffed because he lost.

1376
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:56,175
Don't be idiotic.

1377
01:26:56,216 --> 01:27:01,305
Be something, won't it?
Win the case and lose my husband.

1378
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,225
Well, maybe it's a test.

1379
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:08,729
Maybe if we weather this,
we'll be better together, and...

1380
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,480
if we don't--

1381
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:13,150
Lawyers should never marry
other lawyers.

1382
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:16,820
This is called inbreeding
from which comes idiot children...

1383
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:18,614
and more lawyers.

1384
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:20,616
I wish he'd call me up.

1385
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:22,951
You're sure that we can hear
my phone in here?

1386
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:27,039
Lawyers should marry piano players
or songwriters or both.

1387
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,666
How would you like
to give me a kiss?

1388
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,336
-What time is it?
-Wouldn't like to, hmm?

1389
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:35,797
Why don't l--
Why don't I call him up?

1390
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:38,050
How would you like me
to give you a kiss?

1391
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:41,929
I would, but I don't know
where to call him, that's why.

1392
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:45,182
You couldn't with
your mouth full anyway.

1393
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:52,231
You mind if I call you
Mrs. Bonner?

1394
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:55,025
Equality. Mutual everything.

1395
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:57,110
-Or nothing.
-Mrs. Bonner, I love you.

1396
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:59,363
I love lots of girls
and ladies and women...

1397
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:02,783
but you're the only one
I know why I love, and you know why?

1398
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:05,244
-What?
-Because you live across the hall.

1399
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:07,704
You're mighty attractive
in every single way, Mrs. Bonner...

1400
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:10,749
but l'd probably love anybody
who lived across the hall from me.

1401
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,209
It's so convenient.

1402
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:14,378
Is there anything worse
than taking a girl home...

1403
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:16,713
and then that long trek back alone?

1404
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:19,383
-Wanna trade kisses? That's equal.
-Look here, Kip.

1405
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:23,303
I'm fighting my prejudices, but it's
clear that you're behaving like--

1406
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:26,390
I hate to put it this way--
but like a man.

1407
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:28,559
You watch your language.

1408
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,561
Was that my phone?

1409
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,292
-Could I use your pass key?
-Sure thing.

1410
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:56,545
-What would I do without you, Louie?
-You'd remember your keys.

1411
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:58,881
-Don't wait. l'll be right down.
-Sure thing.

1412
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:18,609
Just pretend, like they do on the stage.
Like Lunt and Fontanne.

1413
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,069
You be Lunt and l'll be Fontanne.
The other way.

1414
01:29:23,989 --> 01:29:26,992
All right. All right.
Break it up.

1415
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:35,209
Adam. Listen to me.

1416
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:38,504
Don't you handle me, lady.
l'm not nutty.

1417
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:41,423
Not any more than the average.
You said it yourself today.

1418
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:44,843
You said anyone is capable
of attack if provoked.

1419
01:29:44,885 --> 01:29:46,845
You bet, including me. Yes.

1420
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:50,516
Don't you move, young man.
You stand as still as you can be.

1421
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:53,685
Now, Adam--Adam.

1422
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:55,229
You said that before.

1423
01:29:56,104 --> 01:29:58,690
You're sick. Please.

1424
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:01,235
-What are you doing?
-Teaching a lesson.

1425
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:05,239
Him first. Then comes yours.

1426
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:06,698
Get away, Amanda.

1427
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,325
Adam, stop.

1428
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:09,785
Get away, Amanda!

1429
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:12,955
-Don't do it, Amanda.
-Stop it. Stop it.

1430
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:17,334
You've no right.
You can't do what you're doing.

1431
01:30:17,376 --> 01:30:19,419
-What?
-No one has a right to--

1432
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:25,843
That's all, sister.
That's all I wanted to hear.

1433
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:27,678
Music to my tin ear.

1434
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:42,401
Licorice.

1435
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:47,573
If there's anything l'm a sucker for,
it's licorice.

1436
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:57,165
I'll never forget this!

1437
01:30:57,249 --> 01:30:58,500
Never!

1438
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:01,503
Me neither.

1439
01:31:01,587 --> 01:31:04,339
I'll never forget that no matter
what you think you think...

1440
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:06,383
you think the same as I think.

1441
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:10,387
That I have no right--that no one
has a right to break the law!

1442
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,765
That your client had no right.
That l'm right and you're wrong.

1443
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:16,685
...worthless, corrupt,
mean, rotten...

1444
01:31:16,768 --> 01:31:20,606
dirty, contemptible, little, petty,
gruesome, contemptible--

1445
01:31:20,647 --> 01:31:22,608
-You said all that before.
-What?

1446
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,735
Go back to your wrestling match.

1447
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:27,154
You think you can
hit and run? You're wrong.

1448
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:31,033
-l have a thing or two to say too.
-No, no. Don't try me now, Pinkie.

1449
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:33,368
-Don't you Pinkie me.
-What's biting you, Adam?

1450
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:35,412
You're biting me.

1451
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,001
-How dare you!
-l can have you arrested!

1452
01:31:48,217 --> 01:31:50,219
Get out of here!

1453
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:53,222
The manners
of a great big educated ape.

1454
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:58,310
You think you've humiliated me.
That's where you're wrong.

1455
01:31:58,393 --> 01:32:01,688
You haven't humiliated anyone
with the possible exception of yourself.

1456
01:32:01,772 --> 01:32:03,982
You've just revealed yourself
for what you are.

1457
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:06,109
You couldn't bear
to be bested by a woman.

1458
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:08,320
That's enough yelling
just to let the people--

1459
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:10,989
If you want to talk, go in
and we'll talk things over.

1460
01:32:11,073 --> 01:32:14,868
Are you joking? l'd be afraid to be
in the same room with a mad bull.

1461
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:16,954
I'll never be
in the same room with you!

1462
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:20,749
That suits me fine. You will be in
the same room with me to settle things.

1463
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:23,377
-All right!
-That's tomorrow. Don't forget it.

1464
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,504
I hope you can afford to pay me...

1465
01:32:25,587 --> 01:32:27,798
for what you owe me,
you great clumsy oaf!

1466
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,424
Oh, go inside!

1467
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:31,635
You think you know
something about law.

1468
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:34,847
Well, let me tell you.
I know something about law too.

1469
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:41,061
I know something about the law...

1470
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:43,605
and there's gonna be
a law against you!

1471
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:02,541
Nobody. Like I told you,
just plain nobody.

1472
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,626
I don't know what's
the matter with you lately.

1473
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:06,128
You're always hearing things.

1474
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,768
Now, here's a check.

1475
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:25,105
$337.41 issued to Martin L. Baumer.

1476
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:27,107
What's that?
lt's on the joint account.

1477
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:28,901
-Furrier.
-Mending a coat.

1478
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:31,528
Put it on mine.
The coat was a present.

1479
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,530
-l know.
-l gave you the coat.

1480
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:35,824
-l expect you to keep it in repair.
-Not at all.

1481
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,826
-l want to.
-l can't help that.

1482
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,579
If we're gonna debate every item,
we'll be here 'til the next quarter.

1483
01:33:40,662 --> 01:33:42,122
-Okay.
-Mine.

1484
01:33:42,206 --> 01:33:44,499
And not deductible. N.D.

1485
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:49,546
All right.
Next is Pollard and Douglas.

1486
01:33:49,588 --> 01:33:53,425
That's seeds for the house
in the country.

1487
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:55,677
$478.60?

1488
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:58,263
-We like a lot of plants.
-Liked.

1489
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:00,849
N.D.

1490
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:04,520
All right.
A hundred dollars to Dwight Everly.

1491
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:07,356
That was--remember that--

1492
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,401
Uh, that was a bet
we lost--l lost.

1493
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:12,945
What kind of bet?

1494
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:15,280
What difference does it make?

1495
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:16,615
N.D.

1496
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,785
-Something you can't tell me?
-lt's nothing. Silly.

1497
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:25,040
All right.
Juel Delwyn, $280.

1498
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:27,376
You should note all these
on your stubs. Saves time.

1499
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:30,796
-That was mine. Not deductible.
-What is it? Maybe it is.

1500
01:34:30,838 --> 01:34:33,340
-Just some underwear.
-Underwear?

1501
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:34,925
$280 worth?

1502
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:37,469
Wasn't my underwear.

1503
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,222
Very well.

1504
01:34:41,515 --> 01:34:43,225
Thank you.

1505
01:34:43,308 --> 01:34:47,980
Bridgeport, Connecticut,
Citizens' Bank: $8,740.30.

1506
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:49,147
That's what?

1507
01:34:49,231 --> 01:34:51,400
The last payment on the farm.

1508
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:54,695
It's written on the stub there.

1509
01:34:54,778 --> 01:34:57,573
I made out that check myself.
l'm sure it's there.

1510
01:34:57,656 --> 01:34:59,575
Who said it wasn't?
lt isn't.

1511
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:02,452
The point is, how much of that
is interest which is deductible...

1512
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:05,372
and how much is actual
mortgage payment, which is not?

1513
01:35:05,455 --> 01:35:07,833
-l don't know. Do you, Adam?
-No, no.

1514
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:11,086
By that time we were so excited
at getting it paid off...

1515
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,130
that we just got careless.

1516
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:15,507
Oh, this was final?

1517
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:16,675
Yes.

1518
01:35:17,593 --> 01:35:19,678
We own it now.

1519
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:23,182
Every scrap.

1520
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:25,184
It took us six years.

1521
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:27,769
But we made it.

1522
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:31,523
Free and clear.

1523
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:48,415
You know, there's
a new ruling on that.

1524
01:35:48,498 --> 01:35:52,044
This process could be considered
as paying the interest in advance.

1525
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:55,714
The taxpayer, however, can deduct
this type of interest payment...

1526
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:58,842
only at the time
the mortgage is fully paid.

1527
01:35:58,926 --> 01:36:01,345
Taxpayers who use
the accrual method of accounting...

1528
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:04,431
can take the deduction
as the interest payments...

1529
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:06,892
accrued during
the life of the mortgage.

1530
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:08,977
But I don't know
whether that would actually--

1531
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:10,562
-Listen, Pinky.
-What?

1532
01:36:10,646 --> 01:36:14,650
If we started now, we could
get there in time for dinner.

1533
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:17,986
And see the dogs?

1534
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:23,367
There isn't much in the freeze.

1535
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:25,953
You don't wanna go.

1536
01:36:26,036 --> 01:36:28,664
We'll be here
another two hours at least.

1537
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:30,207
Yes, I do.

1538
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:34,753
-You don't really wanna go.
-There are a lot more items.

1539
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:37,214
Here.

1540
01:36:37,256 --> 01:36:38,841
Come on.

1541
01:36:38,924 --> 01:36:40,175
Where?

1542
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:42,177
Come on.

1543
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:45,305
Home. Back to the farm.

1544
01:36:45,389 --> 01:36:48,809
-Wait. You've got to--
-Sign our names. Give them the money.

1545
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,894
-Sign anything.
-This could cost you.

1546
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:52,896
We don't care about that.

1547
01:36:52,938 --> 01:36:55,399
The more taxes we pay,
the better we like it.

1548
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,775
See?

1549
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:11,790
-Say!
-Speaking to me?

1550
01:37:11,874 --> 01:37:13,792
-You were pretty good.
-When?

1551
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:17,004
All the way through.
Especially the summation.

1552
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:18,338
You had me.

1553
01:37:19,756 --> 01:37:21,967
-Almost.
-Almost?

1554
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:27,472
-You weren't so bad yourself.
-l didn't think so either.

1555
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:29,850
We got a big thing
to talk about tomorrow.

1556
01:37:29,933 --> 01:37:31,351
What?

1557
01:37:31,435 --> 01:37:34,479
They want me to run
for that county courtjudgeship.

1558
01:37:34,563 --> 01:37:37,316
The Republicans do.
lt's a sure seat, practically.

1559
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:39,526
-Pinky!
-Yeah, that's me.

1560
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:42,196
County Court Judge Pinky.

1561
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:45,532
I'm real proud of you.

1562
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,286
I'd rather have you say that
than anything.

1563
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:57,628
Hello, Amanda

1564
01:37:57,669 --> 01:38:01,131
Here's a hearty welcome to you

1565
01:38:01,173 --> 01:38:04,426
Hello, Amanda

1566
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:06,929
The battle was fun
but it's done

1567
01:38:07,012 --> 01:38:08,555
It's through

1568
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:14,019
And from now on
fair Amanda

1569
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:17,856
When you're gazing
at the stars above

1570
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,692
We'll revive
that wonderful night

1571
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:23,695
On the veranda

1572
01:38:23,779 --> 01:38:26,573
-Sweet Amanda
-Adam.

1573
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:28,242
Yes?

1574
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:30,994
And our love

1575
01:38:31,078 --> 01:38:34,873
Have they picked
the Democratic candidate yet?

1576
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,092
I was just wondering.

1577
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:47,177
-You were.
-Mmm.

1578
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:51,056
But you wouldn't.

1579
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:53,100
How do you know?

1580
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:55,686
Because l'd cry,
and then you wouldn't.

1581
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:57,729
-What?
-l'd cry...

1582
01:38:57,771 --> 01:38:59,857
the way I did
in Julie's office today.

1583
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:03,110
Got me what I wanted.
Got me you back.

1584
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:05,737
-Those were real, those tears.
-Of course they were...

1585
01:39:05,821 --> 01:39:08,365
but I can turn 'em on
anytime I want to.

1586
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:11,368
Us boys can do it too.
We just never think to.

1587
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:13,537
-Bunk!
-Bunk, huh?

1588
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:17,958
Keep your eye on the eye. We're having
a fuss, see, and l'm losing.

1589
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:20,460
So here they come.

1590
01:39:21,587 --> 01:39:24,923
On your mark, get set, go.

1591
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:40,772
See?

1592
01:39:41,899 --> 01:39:43,817
Now l'll help it along
a little like this.

1593
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:02,377
Oh, yes. There ain't any of us
don't have our little tricks.

1594
01:40:09,092 --> 01:40:12,596
All right, but what does that show?
What have you proved?

1595
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:15,349
It shows the score.

1596
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:19,228
Shows that what I said was true.
There's no difference between the sexes.

1597
01:40:19,311 --> 01:40:21,230
Men, women, the same.

1598
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,191
They are, huh?

1599
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:28,195
Maybe there is a difference,
but it's a little difference.

1600
01:40:28,278 --> 01:40:30,822
-You know as the French say?
-What do they say?

1601
01:40:30,906 --> 01:40:33,116
-Vive la différence!
-Which means?

1602
01:40:33,158 --> 01:40:35,661
Which means,
Hooray for that little difference!
