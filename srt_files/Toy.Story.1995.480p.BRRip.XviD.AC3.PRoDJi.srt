1
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:03,353
All right, everyone! This... is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!

2
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,582
Now, empty that safe!

3
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:11,528
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Money, money, money!

4
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,996
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

5
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,160
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

6
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,170
Help! Baa!
Help us!

7
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:22,763
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

8
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:32,017
Reach for the sky!

9
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:34,518
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

10
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:37,318
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

11
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,893
Doh!
How'd you know it was me?

12
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,723
Are you gonna
come quietly?

13
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,494
You can't touch me, Sheriff! I brought my
attack dog with the built-in force field

14
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:50,367
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

15
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,872
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

16
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:56,742
You're going to jail, Bart!
Say good-bye to the wife and later tots.

17
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,338
You saved the day again, Woody.

18
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,068
You're my favorite deputy.

19
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,906
# You've got a friend in me #

20
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:17,743
# You've got a friend in me #

21
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,750
Come on, let's
wrangle up the cattle.

22
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,083
# When the road looks
rough ahead #

23
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,522
# And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #

24
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:31,030
- Round 'em up, cowboy!
- # Just remember what your old pal said #

25
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,656
# Boy, you've got
a friend in me #

26
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:37,260
- Yee-haw!
- # Yeah, you've got a friend in me #

27
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,397
Hey, cowboy!

28
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:43,705
# Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #

29
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,780
# Big and stronger too #

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,849
- Come on, Woody.
- # Maybe #

31
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,115
# But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #

32
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,190
# It's me and you, boy #

33
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,850
- # And as the years go by #
- Whoa!

34
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,726
- Whoa!
- # Our friendship will never die #

35
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,525
- Whoo!
- # You're gonna see #

36
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,661
# It's our destiny #

37
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,208
- # You've got a friend in me #
- All right!

38
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:15,608
- # Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
- Score!

39
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:19,149
- # You got a friend in me #
- Wow! Cool!

40
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,481
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

41
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,954
- Okay, birthday boy- - We saw that
at the store! I asked you for it!

42
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,957
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so-

43
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:31,086
- One, two- Four. Yeah, I think that's
gonna be enough. - Oh, my gosh, you got-

44
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,323
- Could we leave this up till we move?
- Well, sure!

45
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,866
- We can leave it up. Now go get Molly.
- Yeah!

46
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:39,735
- Your friends are gonna be here any minute.
- Okay. It's party time, Woody.

47
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,365
Yee... haw!

48
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:51,183
Howdy, little lady.

49
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,919
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.

50
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:00,186
- Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.

51
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,785
See you later, Woody.

52
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,273
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,567
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

54
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:27,540
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

55
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:31,519
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

56
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,837
Hey, Hamm.

57
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:48,395
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

58
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:53,378
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

59
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,781
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

60
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,948
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,394
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

62
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:12,432
- No. S-Slink- - Oh, well, all
right. You can be red if you want.

63
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,969
- N-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,469
Shh, shh, shh!

65
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:20,473
- Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting, and be happy.
- Got it.

66
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,475
- Be happy!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

67
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:26,412
- Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium please.

68
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,813
Hey.

69
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,478
Hey, Etch. Draw!

70
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,824
Oh! Got me again.

71
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:40,522
Etch, you've been working
on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.

72
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,428
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

73
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,094
Now, where is that- Oh.

74
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,604
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

75
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,508
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

76
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:56,911
I was close to being scared that time.

77
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

78
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,683
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

79
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,882
Owl Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

80
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,017
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

81
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,527
Oh, hey,
it was, uh, nothin'.

82
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,796
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

83
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:19,497
Oh, yeah!

84
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:23,667
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

85
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:27,008
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! - Come on,
come on. Smaller toys up front.

86
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,816
Hey, Woody, come on.

87
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,752
Ahem!

88
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:38,348
Oh, thanks, Mike.

89
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,088
Okay- Whoa, whoa. Step back.

90
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,664
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

91
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:46,734
- Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

92
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:50,635
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

93
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:53,936
Okay. First item today:

94
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:57,341
Uh... oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

95
00:06:57,446 --> 00:07:00,108
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

96
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:02,343
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

97
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,851
Do we have to hold hands?

98
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,286
You guys think
this is a big joke.

99
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,791
We've only got one week
left before the move.

100
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,418
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

101
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,259
If you don't have one,
get one!

102
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:18,426
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.

103
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,767
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting...

104
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,273
was, I think,
a big success.

105
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,367
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

106
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,209
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.

107
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,649
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.

108
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,720
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

109
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:39,052
Wait a minute here!

110
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,388
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not till next week!

111
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,121
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

112
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,892
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,198
- I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
- Of course Woody ain't worried.

114
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,499
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

115
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,733
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

116
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,209
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

117
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,941
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

118
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,746
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

119
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,754
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

120
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,724
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

121
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:14,125
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

122
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,561
This is Andy
we're talking about.

123
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:19,657
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

124
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:26,364
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

125
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,466
That's what we're
made for, right?

126
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:32,309
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

127
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,349
Birthday guests
at three o'clock!

128
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,577
Stay calm, everyone!

129
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,018
Hey!

130
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:41,090
Uh, meeting adjourned.

131
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,591
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

132
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,787
I can't see a thing.

133
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,432
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

134
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:56,564
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones? - Oh, for crying
out loud. They're all in boxes, you idiot.

135
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:58,574
They're getting bigger.

136
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:02,077
- Wait, there's a nice little one over there.
- Hi!

137
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:06,812
- Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!

138
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,648
All right! All right!

139
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:12,815
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

140
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:16,588
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

141
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,061
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

142
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,668
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

143
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:28,240
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

144
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,866
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

145
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:34,106
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

146
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:36,274
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

147
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,629
Yeah!

148
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,537
Okay, come on, kids.

149
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,543
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

150
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,500
All right, gangway, gangway.

151
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,700
And this is
how we find out...

152
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,039
what is in those presents.

153
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,717
Okay, who's hungry?

154
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,750
Here come the chips!

155
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,186
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue! Ow!

156
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,350
What in the world- Oh!

157
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,258
I thought I told him to pick these up.

158
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:53,389
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

159
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,559
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

160
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,036
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

161
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:12,245
G- G-Go on without me!
J- Just go!

162
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,254
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

163
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,802
Okay, everybody, come on.

164
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,902
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody-

165
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,916
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

166
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:46,216
- Good. And- Which present
are you gonna open first?

167
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:49,122
- Mine!
- There they are.

168
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:52,196
Come in,
Mother Bird. This is Alpha Bravo.

169
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,992
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

170
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,932
Andy's opening the first present now.

171
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,698
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

172
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,740
Hey, I can dream,
can't I?

173
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:05,935
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

174
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:08,342
It's a- It's-
It's a- a lunch box.

175
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,575
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

176
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:12,514
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

177
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,814
Okay, second present.
It appears to be-

178
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,889
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

179
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,429
Oh! Only one left.

180
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,931
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

181
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:30,299
It's a big one.
It's a-

182
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,770
- It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

183
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:35,000
Hallelujah!

184
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,009
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

185
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,011
Sorry there,
old spud head.

186
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,880
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

187
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:45,418
So did I tell ya?
Huh? Nothin' to worry about.

188
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,887
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

189
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,824
Wait a minute. Oh!

190
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:55,454
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

191
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:58,032
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

192
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,227
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

193
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:02,931
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

194
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,473
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

195
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:08,202
Oh, get outta the- One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

196
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:11,405
- It's a-
- Wow!

197
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:15,849
It's a what? What is it?

198
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,420
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

199
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,389
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

200
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,983
- No, no! Turn him around! Turn him
around! - He's puttin' 'em in backwa-

201
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,960
Here, you're
puttin' 'em in backwards!

202
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,693
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

203
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,269
Let's go to my room, guys!

204
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,839
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

205
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,431
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

206
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,443
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

207
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,445
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

208
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,448
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

209
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,178
- Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

210
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:50,017
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

211
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,162
Hey, look,
its lasers light up. Take that, Zurg!

212
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:06,103
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

213
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,301
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

214
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,311
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

215
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,462
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

216
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:32,125
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

217
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,328
Woody?

218
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:37,873
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Uh, nothin'. Uh, nothin'.

219
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:40,704
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

220
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,301
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

221
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,180
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

222
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:50,412
Have you been replaced? -
What did I tell you earlier?

223
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,989
No one is getting replaced

224
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,219
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there...

225
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:59,922
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

226
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,853
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

227
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,326
Come in, Star Command.

228
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,795
- Star Command, come
in. Do you read me?

229
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,459
Why don't they answer?
My ship!

230
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,572
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.

231
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:44,668
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

232
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,113
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

233
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:50,708
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

234
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,310
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

235
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,920
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.

236
00:15:58,026 --> 00:16:01,326
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

237
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:03,865
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

238
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,901
Hello!

239
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,493
Whoa! H-Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

240
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:11,074
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

241
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:13,699
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

242
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,008
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

243
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:20,447
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

244
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:22,883
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

245
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,455
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

246
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:28,457
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

247
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,028
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.

248
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:34,462
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

249
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,898
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

250
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:39,436
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

251
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,269
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

252
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,933
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

253
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:46,307
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

254
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:50,314
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

255
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,578
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

256
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,450
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

257
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,820
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

258
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:01,326
Bye, bye. Thank you!

259
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:04,397
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

260
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:07,228
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

261
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:10,098
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
- Oh!

262
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,468
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

263
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,270
- Only it's-
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

264
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,709
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

265
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,872
Probably all
copper wiring, huh?

266
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,975
So, uh, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

267
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,853
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

268
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:32,591
As a member of the elite Universe
Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,

269
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,389
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

270
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,055
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

271
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,220
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

272
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,321
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

273
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,832
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

274
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,563
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

275
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:55,006
Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

276
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,634
Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.

277
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,475
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

278
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,845
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

279
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,978
It's not a laser! It's a-
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

280
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,646
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

281
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,690
All right, that's enough!

282
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,955
- Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?

283
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,122
T- O-Y. Toy!

284
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:19,190
Excuse me, I-I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger. "

285
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:23,636
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

286
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,106
Gettin' kinda tense,
aren't ya?

287
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:28,736
Uh, Mr. Lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.

288
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:31,178
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

289
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:33,306
He's not a Space Ranger!

290
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:37,615
- He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!
- Excuse me.

291
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:43,024
- Ooh!
- Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good!

292
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:47,758
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

293
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:51,393
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

294
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,438
- No, you can't.
- Yes, lean.

295
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,440
- You can't.
- Can.

296
00:18:56,542 --> 00:19:00,137
- Can't. Can't. Can't!
- I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!

297
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:03,443
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

298
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,485
Stand back, everyone!

299
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,758
To infinity and beyond!

300
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:45,619
- Can!
- Whoa!

301
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:49,130
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

302
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:53,362
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.

303
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,406
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

304
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,602
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

305
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:04,738
Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

306
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,874
You know, in a couple of days, everything
will be just the way it was. They'll see.

307
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,044
They'll see.

308
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,555
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

309
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,491
# I was on top of the world
livin' high #

310
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:20,497
- Whoa!
- # It was right in my pocket #

311
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,090
# I was livin' the life #

312
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:26,569
# Things were just the way
they should be #

313
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,671
# When from out of the sky
like a bomb #

314
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:33,075
# Comes some little punk
in a rocket #

315
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,746
# Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to m

316
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,753
Buzz Lightyear
to the rescue!

317
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:45,220
# Strange #

318
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,692
# Things are happening to me #

319
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:53,089
# Strange #

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,431
# Things #

321
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:59,404
- # Strange #
- Ha!

322
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,170
# Things are happening to me #

323
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:05,178
# Ain't no doubt about it #

324
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:14,283
# I had friends
I had lots of friends #

325
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,359
# Now all my friends
are gone #

326
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,759
# And I'm doin'
the best I can #

327
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:27,028
- # I had power #
- # Power #

328
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:29,469
- # I was respected #
- # Respected #

329
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,769
# But not anymore #

330
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:34,470
# And I've lost the love
of the one #

331
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:37,309
# Whom I adore #

332
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:41,784
# Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange #

333
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:46,152
# Things are happenin' to me #

334
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:49,818
# Strange #

335
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,896
# Things #

336
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:56,024
# Strange #

337
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,865
# Things are happen in'

338
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:01,337
# Ain't no doubt about it #

339
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,671
# Strange #

340
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,181
# Things #

341
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:14,821
# Strange #

342
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,981
# Things #

343
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,423
Finally!

344
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,396
Hey, who's got my hat?

345
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,261
Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy!

346
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:29,359
Ah-ha!Ah-ha, ha, ha!
Gimme that!

347
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,371
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

348
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:36,240
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

349
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:39,314
- Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
- Wow!

350
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:42,076
With permanent ink too!

351
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,653
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

352
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,820
Don't let it
get to you, Woody.

353
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:52,554
Uh... let what? I don't, uh-
What do you mean? Who?

354
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,393
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

355
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,060
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

356
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,798
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

357
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:06,035
Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip.

358
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,544
Mr. Lightyear
wants more tape.

359
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:10,444
Hmm?

360
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:14,278
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

361
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:17,981
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

362
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:22,253
- What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?

363
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:27,765
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!

364
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:31,530
- It's getting on my nerves!
- Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?

365
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:35,596
Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

366
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,475
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

367
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:52,858
The air isn't... toxic.

368
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,828
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet
on an uncharted planet!

369
00:23:56,932 --> 00:24:01,061
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

370
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,333
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

371
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,433
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

372
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:11,672
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

373
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,714
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

374
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:16,512
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

375
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,177
Where?

376
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,829
Yes!

377
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:30,560
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.

378
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:33,762
- It's Sid!
- Don't move!

379
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:37,272
- I thought he was at summer camp.
- They must've kicked him out early this year.

380
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,776
Oh, no, not Sid!

381
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,780
Incoming!

382
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,647
- Who is it this time? - I- I can't-
I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?

383
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:52,781
- Right here, Woody.
- Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.

384
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,883
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

385
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:00,329
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns you spacemen; just us toys.

386
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,333
I'd better
take a look anyway.

387
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,871
- Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

388
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,372
That's why: Sid.

389
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,444
Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.

390
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,604
No, no, that's Scud,
you idiot.

391
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:16,239
That is Sid.

392
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,410
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

393
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,617
He tortures toys,
just for fun!

394
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,528
Well, then we've got
to do something.

395
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,861
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

396
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,866
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

397
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,300
Melt him with your scary laser.

398
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:39,339
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

399
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:42,070
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

400
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:45,204
Lookout!

401
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,478
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

402
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:54,819
- Whoo!
- I could've stopped him.

403
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:58,088
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

404
00:25:58,195 --> 00:26:01,028
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

405
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:04,465
The sooner we move, the better.

406
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,867
Yeah!

407
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:14,044
To infinity and beyond!

408
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:18,516
All this packing
makes me hungry.

409
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:22,576
- What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet?
- Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

410
00:26:22,654 --> 00:26:24,588
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

411
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:29,889
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

412
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:32,892
- Just one?
- One toy?

413
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,430
Hmm.

414
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:41,134
Will Andy pick me?

415
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,767
"Don't count on it"?

416
00:27:00,628 --> 00:27:02,619
Mmm!

417
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,333
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

418
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:12,064
Buzz Lightyear,
thank goodness. We've got trouble!

419
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,869
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

420
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:17,604
A helpless toy, it's-
it's trapped, Buzz!

421
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,112
Then we've
no time to lose.

422
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:29,588
- I don't see anything!
- Oh, he's there! Just, just keep looking!

423
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:31,819
What kind of toy-

424
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,033
Oh! Whoa, whoa! Oh!

425
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:50,437
Buzz!

426
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:52,539
Buzz!

427
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:55,709
I don't see him in the driveway.

428
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:58,618
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

429
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:05,292
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

430
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:08,696
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

431
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:12,362
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was
pushed... by Woody! - No!

432
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,564
- What?
- Wait a minute.

433
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:19,236
You
- You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you? Potato Head?

434
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:22,315
- That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

435
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:24,975
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.

436
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,246
Now, you, you
gotta believe me.

437
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:30,449
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

438
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,288
Well, yea- N-
I don't like confrontations!

439
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,852
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

440
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:38,796
You don't deserve to- Hey!

441
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,891
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

442
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:46,496
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

443
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,203
So you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy
starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?

444
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,678
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

445
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:56,012
- I don't think we should give him the chance.
- There he is, men.

446
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,088
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up by his pull string!

447
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,418
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

448
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,459
- Tackle him! - No, no, no!
W-W-Wait! I can explain everything!

449
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,723
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

450
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,061
Retreat!

451
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:16,301
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

452
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,775
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Psst!

453
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:22,244
Andy, I'm heading out the door!

454
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:25,908
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy. Now, come on!

455
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:28,484
Oh, okay.

456
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:36,424
I couldn't find my Buzz,
know I left him right there.

457
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:39,861
Honey, I'm sure he's around
You'll find him.

458
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,240
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

459
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:59,409
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

460
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,683
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

461
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,783
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

462
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:09,089
Oh, where could he be?

463
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:23,812
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

464
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:25,903
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

465
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:28,141
Yuk, yuk, yuk! Funny, Mom.

466
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,620
Aw, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

467
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:38,050
Buzz!

468
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:42,120
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

469
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,532
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

470
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,537
Andy'll find you here;
he'll take us back to the room;

471
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:53,373
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

472
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,345
Huh? Right?
Buddy?

473
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:59,849
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

474
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,714
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

475
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,723
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

476
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,816
No.

477
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:16,765
Okay, come on!

478
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:19,360
You want a piece of me?

479
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:27,378
- Owww!
- Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

480
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,381
- Aah-ouch!
- Next stop.

481
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,281
Pizza Planet! Yeah!

482
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,719
Andy!

483
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:46,866
Wh- Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

484
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:50,233
I'm lost!

485
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:53,603
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

486
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,212
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

487
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:03,649
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

488
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:06,916
You!

489
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,137
- According to my nava-computer, the-
- Shut up!

490
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,579
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

491
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,118
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

492
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,586
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

493
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,852
My- My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place-

494
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,927
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you...

495
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:47,192
hadn't shown up in your stupid little
cardboard spaceship and taken away everything...

496
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,393
- that was important to me-
- Don't talk to me about importance!

497
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:52,130
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

498
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,331
What? What are
you talkin' about?

499
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,307
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg...

500
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,641
has been secretly building
a weapon...

501
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:02,113
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

502
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:06,346
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

503
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,888
And you, my friend,
are responsible...

504
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,551
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

505
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,858
You... are... a... toy!

506
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:18,194
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a-

507
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:23,032
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

508
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:27,734
You are a sad, strange little man;
and you have my pity.

509
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:32,075
- Farewell.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony!

510
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:35,412
"Rendezvous with Star Command. "

511
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:37,918
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?

512
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,149
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

513
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:44,352
- Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
- Oh. no!

514
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:47,487
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

515
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:50,499
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

516
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:54,002
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I-

517
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:57,905
I found a spaceship!

518
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:01,439
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

519
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,944
Come on, man, hurry up! Urn, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

520
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:10,487
Uh, Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

521
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:13,558
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin...

522
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,991
- once it jettisons its food supply?
- Uh-huh.

523
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:20,532
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

524
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:24,194
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

525
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:27,102
- Let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
- Negative.

526
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:29,675
There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

527
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,904
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu-

528
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:35,846
- Buzz! Buzz!
That's two lefts and a right, huh?

529
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,885
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid-

530
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:41,614
Buzz!

531
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:55,726
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

532
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,955
Next shuttle liftoff is scheduled for...

533
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,400
T- minus 30 seconds and counting.

534
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,534
You are clear to enter.

535
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,771
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

536
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,178
The white zone is for immediate pizza-

537
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,251
Sheriff!

538
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:42,478
There you are.

539
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,318
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

540
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:48,222
Great idea, Woody.

541
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:51,125
I like your thinkin'.

542
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,698
You are clear to enter.

543
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:56,360
- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!

544
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:59,063
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

545
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:02,232
Jones, party
of five, your shuttle is now boarding-

546
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:04,310
Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?

547
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:06,539
Ow! Watch
where you're going!

548
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:08,547
Sorry.

549
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:18,386
...nine, eight, seven, six,

550
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:22,020
five, four, three,

551
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,725
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

552
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:39,072
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

553
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:41,878
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12.

554
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:44,044
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, Buzz! This way.

555
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:47,646
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

556
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:50,056
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

557
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,391
And Astro, uh, turf!

558
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:56,227
- Where is it? I-I don't see the-
- Come on. That's it.

559
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,393
Spaceship!

560
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:02,734
All right, Buzz,
get ready. And-

561
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:06,572
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket.

562
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:09,409
Buzz!

563
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:11,449
- No!
Hey, Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

564
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,247
- can I have some alien slime?
- This cannot be happening to me.

565
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,628
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

566
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:31,670
- Ooh!
- Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

567
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:34,900
I come in peace.

568
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:39,508
Before your
space journey, re-energize yourself...

569
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:43,744
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

570
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,251
This is an intergalactic emergency.

571
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,845
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

572
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,426
Who's in charge here?

573
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,325
The claw!

574
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:59,735
- The claw is our master.
- The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.

575
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:03,236
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

576
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:06,797
Take that!

577
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,707
Oh, no! Sid!

578
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:12,976
Get down!

579
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,916
- What's gotten into you? I wa- - You are
the one that decided to climb into this-

580
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,250
Shh! The claw, it moves.

581
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,822
have been chosen!

582
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,798
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

583
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,062
Gotcha!

584
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:36,907
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

585
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,892
Yes!

586
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,861
Buzz! No!

587
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,398
Hey!

588
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,969
He has been chosen!

589
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,061
- He must go.
- Hey!

590
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,972
- What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.

591
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:15,082
All right!
Double prizes!

592
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:20,279
Let's go home and... play.

593
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,837
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

594
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:40,136
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming. The mystic portal awaits.

595
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,904
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?

596
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,574
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

597
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:49,208
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

598
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,344
Sit! Good boy.

599
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:54,789
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

600
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,020
Ready, set, now!

601
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,697
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

602
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,031
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

603
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,537
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

604
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,903
I don't know!

605
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,875
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

606
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,947
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

607
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:18,484
- I'll have to perform one of my operations.
- No!

608
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,679
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.
- Hey, give it back!

609
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:24,517
Bid! Bid!

610
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:28,355
- Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, Nurse.

611
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:32,056
Prepare the O. R., stat!

612
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,463
Patient is... prepped.

613
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,302
No one's ever attempted
a double bypass...

614
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:40,669
brain transplant before.

615
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:44,266
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

616
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,973
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

617
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:50,415
Doctor, you've done it!

618
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:54,782
Hannah!

619
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,792
Janie's all better now.

620
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,824
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

621
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,643
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

622
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:24,981
Locked.

623
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:28,058
- There's gotta be
another way outta here.

624
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,934
Uh, Buzz?
W- Was that you?

625
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:53,778
Hey, hi there,
little fella.

626
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,219
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

627
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:29,919
B- B-B-B-Bu-Buzz!

628
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:42,633
They're cannibals.

629
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:47,065
Mayday, mayday.

630
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:49,576
- Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

631
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,240
Star Command, do you copy?

632
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:54,840
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

633
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:59,116
Aw, great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

634
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:04,551
- Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

635
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:07,063
Buzz, is that you?

636
00:43:07,165 --> 00:43:09,531
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

637
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:12,502
- You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

638
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,301
Look, they're home.

639
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:22,413
Mom, have you seen Woody?

640
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,178
- Where was the last place you left him?
- Right here in the van.

641
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,618
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

642
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:30,655
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

643
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:33,157
Woody's gone?

644
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,421
Yeah, boy,
the weasel ran away.

645
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,759
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

646
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:41,994
Who would've thought he was capable
of such atrocities?

647
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:45,937
Oh, Slink,
hope he's okay.

648
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,012
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

649
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:59,115
I can see
your will is strong.

650
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:03,723
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

651
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:17,267
Where are your rebel friends now?

652
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:19,842
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

653
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:22,343
All right!

654
00:44:33,357 --> 00:44:35,724
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

655
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:38,489
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

656
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:41,760
I sure hope
this isn't permanent.

657
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,461
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

658
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,539
The door. It's open!
We're free!

659
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,838
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha-

660
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:55,573
- They're gonna eat us, Buzz! Do something quick!
- Shield your eyes.

661
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,512
It's networking. I recharged it
before I left, I-It should be good for-

662
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:05,022
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

663
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:08,754
- Get away! Hoo-cha! - Hey! Hey!
How're you doin' that? Stop that.

664
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,625
Back! Back,
you savages! Back!

665
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:14,633
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

666
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:17,830
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

667
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:21,466
There's no place like home.

668
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:36,716
Another stunt like that,
cowboy, you're gonna get us killed.

669
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:39,591
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!

670
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,246
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

671
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:05,482
- We got to get this wagon
train a-movin'!

672
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:09,658
Split up!

673
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:18,164
Hmm?

674
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:33,415
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

675
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:37,082
- This is Star Command. Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Star Command!

676
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:39,750
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.

677
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,055
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

678
00:46:42,162 --> 00:46:44,528
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!

679
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:48,693
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

680
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:51,601
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

681
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:54,368
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate chop action!

682
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:57,104
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!

683
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:59,680
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phase voice simulator!

684
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:01,875
There's a secret
mission in uncharted space.

685
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,576
There's
a secret mission in uncharted space.

686
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:07,623
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

687
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,756
- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.

688
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,335
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure...

689
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,074
- and save a galaxy near you!
- Buzz Lightyear!

690
00:47:16,176 --> 00:47:19,942
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the Tri-county area.

691
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,515
And welcome back...

692
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:24,173
to the Point Richmond
Bowling Championship.

693
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,352
# Out among the stars I sit #

694
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:34,087
# Way beyond the moon #

695
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:40,124
# In my silver ship I sailed #

696
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:44,296
# To a dream
that ended too soon #

697
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,204
# Now I know exactly #

698
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:50,710
# Who I am and what I'm here for #

699
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:54,215
You are a toy! You can't fly!

700
00:47:56,219 --> 00:48:00,622
# And I will go sailing #

701
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:04,360
# No more #

702
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:13,062
# But no, it can't be true #

703
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:16,196
# I could fly if I wanted to #

704
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:18,832
# Like a bird in the sky #

705
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,878
# If I believed I could fly #

706
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:25,074
# Why, I'd fly #

707
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:27,947
To infinity and beyond!

708
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:47,400
# - Clearly, I. #

709
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:52,275
# Will go sailing #

710
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,491
- Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

711
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,829
What, dear? What was that?

712
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:17,371
Never mind!

713
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:24,245
Oof! Oof!

714
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:27,180
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

715
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:30,776
There's a secret
mission, in uncharted space. Let's go.

716
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:34,846
Really? That is so interesting.

717
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:38,360
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

718
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:42,092
- Buzz!
- It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.

719
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,158
- Oh. no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

720
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:48,534
It goes quite well
with your head

721
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:51,699
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

722
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,607
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

723
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:57,010
I'll be right back.

724
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,009
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

725
00:50:03,122 --> 00:50:05,886
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

726
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:09,155
Gone!
It's all gone.

727
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:12,095
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.

728
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:15,964
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending the whole galaxy.

729
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:20,507
And suddenly you find
yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with...

730
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:23,076
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

731
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:27,476
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

732
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:29,516
Let's get you
outta here, Buzz.

733
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:32,518
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

734
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:37,250
- I am Mrs. Nesbitt! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

735
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:43,428
- I-I-I'm sorry. I-
You're right.

736
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:45,432
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

737
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:48,128
I can get through this.

738
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:50,137
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!

739
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,900
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

740
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,442
I can't even
fly out of a window.

741
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:58,913
The hat look good?
Tell me the hat look good.

742
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:03,077
- The apron is a bit much.
- "Out the window"! Buzz, you're a genius!

743
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:05,178
Come on, come on. This way.

744
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:08,281
Years of academy,
training, wasted!

745
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,359
Ha, ha. B-3.

746
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,361
- Miss! G-6.
- Oh!

747
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:14,863
- You sunk it. Are you peeking?
- Heh, heh!

748
00:51:14,966 --> 00:51:18,264
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

749
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:20,769
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

750
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:25,832
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

751
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:28,174
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

752
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:31,443
- Ha, ha! Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

753
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,177
- Woody? - You're
kidding! - Woody?

754
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:35,719
Ha! We're gonna
get outta here, Buzz.

755
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,721
Buzz?

756
00:51:42,562 --> 00:51:44,325
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

757
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:46,194
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

758
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:48,893
- I knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

759
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:51,368
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

760
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,337
Here! Catch this!

761
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:54,499
Ha!

762
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:57,043
- Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

763
00:51:57,144 --> 00:52:00,011
Good goin', Slick. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

764
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:03,016
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got a better idea. How 'bout we don't?
- Hey!

765
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:05,881
- Potato Head.
- Did you all take stupid pills this morning?

766
00:52:05,987 --> 00:52:07,887
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

767
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:09,923
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

768
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:14,325
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it-
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

769
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:16,659
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

770
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:20,030
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

771
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:24,698
Tell the nice boys that you're-
that you're not dead.

772
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:27,867
Just a sec!

773
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:31,970
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

774
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:34,846
That's very funny, Buzz.

775
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:37,443
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

776
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,454
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

777
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,787
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

778
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,988
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

779
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:49,396
Hiya, fellas! To infinity and beyond!

780
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:51,264
Hey, look!
It's Buzz!

781
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,806
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

782
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,807
Give me five, man!

783
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,740
Something's screwy here.

784
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,335
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

785
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:04,347
You bet. Give me a hug.

786
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:06,748
Ho-ho! Boy, I love you too.

787
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:08,752
See? It is Buzz.

788
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:11,448
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.

789
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:14,924
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

790
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:20,398
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

791
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,764
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

792
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,303
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

793
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,397
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

794
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,908
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

795
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:32,479
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

796
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,480
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

797
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:37,051
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

798
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:39,176
Come back! Slink!

799
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:43,587
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

800
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:46,752
No! No! Come back!

801
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:49,660
Slinky!

802
00:53:58,074 --> 00:54:00,770
Buzz! Go away!

803
00:54:00,877 --> 00:54:03,846
You disgusting freaks!
Aaah!

804
00:54:03,947 --> 00:54:07,645
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals! Aah! Oof!

805
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:14,680
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

806
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,726
What are you doin'?

807
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:21,327
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

808
00:54:24,603 --> 00:54:26,661
But- But they're cannibals.

809
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:30,538
We saw them eat
those other toys.

810
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,910
Uh, sorry, I-I-I thought
that you were gonna-

811
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,510
You know, you know, eat my friend.

812
00:54:42,622 --> 00:54:44,590
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

813
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,521
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

814
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:47,888
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

815
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,896
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

816
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:55,901
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you, but don't blame me!

817
00:54:57,037 --> 00:55:00,269
It came!
It finally came!

818
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:03,503
Ha, ha!

819
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:05,511
"The Big One. "

820
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,676
"Extremely dangerous.

821
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:13,413
Keep out of reach of children. "

822
00:55:15,056 --> 00:55:18,548
Cool!
What am I gonna blow?

823
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,562
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

824
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:40,382
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

825
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:49,121
Heh, heh.

826
00:55:49,227 --> 00:55:53,062
Now. Yes.

827
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:59,294
Oh, no!

828
00:56:01,606 --> 00:56:03,734
Oh, man!

829
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:11,181
Sid Phillips reporting.

830
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:13,377
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed...

831
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:16,284
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

832
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:19,483
Tomorrow's forecast: sunny.

833
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:23,461
Sweet dreams.

834
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:31,332
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

835
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:33,498
But what if we
leave them behind?

836
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:38,671
Oh, don't worry, honey. I'm sure we'll find
Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

837
00:56:46,221 --> 00:56:48,121
I need air!

838
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:50,487
Why will you quit
movin' around?

839
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:54,256
I'm sorry. It's just that I get-
I get so nervous before I travel.

840
00:56:54,363 --> 00:56:56,831
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

841
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:59,731
Everyone else was picked.

842
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:06,675
Oh, Woody.

843
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:11,874
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

844
00:57:24,295 --> 00:57:27,288
Psst. Psst! Hey, Buzz!

845
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:34,694
Hey.

846
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:39,912
Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

847
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:43,540
Oh, come on, Buzz, I-

848
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:47,916
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

849
00:57:48,021 --> 00:57:52,390
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

850
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:55,723
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

851
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:58,731
Then I'll get that rocket off you,
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

852
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:02,098
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

853
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:06,470
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

854
00:58:06,575 --> 00:58:09,840
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

855
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,540
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

856
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:17,416
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

857
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,420
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

858
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:22,251
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

859
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:24,291
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

860
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:27,295
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

861
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:30,594
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

862
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,466
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

863
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,629
But why would Andy want me?

864
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:41,143
Why would Andy want you? Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear.

865
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:44,271
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

866
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:48,010
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

867
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,384
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

868
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:55,823
You are a cool toy.

869
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:01,498
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

870
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,797
mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have...

871
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:08,134
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

872
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,834
All I can do is-

873
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:15,346
There's a snake in my boots.

874
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:17,416
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me...

875
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:20,384
when he's got you?

876
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:25,049
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

877
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:50,916
Listen, Buzz,
forget about me.

878
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,920
You should get outta here
while you can.

879
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,069
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were-

880
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,162
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

881
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,174
Now let's get you out of this thing.

882
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,403
Yes, sir!

883
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:18,278
Come on, Buzz. We can do it.

884
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:25,955
Woody, it's the moving van.

885
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:28,787
We gotta get outta here now.

886
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:35,556
Come on, Buzz.

887
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:39,466
All right.
Buzz!

888
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:42,301
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

889
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:49,808
I want to ride the pony.

890
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:54,047
Phew. Woody?

891
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:57,715
Woody? Are you all right?

892
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,385
I'm fine. I'm okay.

893
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:15,303
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff! Whoo!

894
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:20,008
To infinity and beyond!

895
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:31,922
Aah! Back, back.

896
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:34,222
Down, down!

897
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,495
- Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

898
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:42,135
Guys!

899
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,935
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

900
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:49,103
There's a good toy down there, and he's
gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.

901
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:52,671
All because of me.
We've gotta save him.

902
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:55,685
And, uh-
Bull need your help.

903
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:07,022
Please. He's my friend.

904
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:09,693
And he's the only one
I've got.

905
01:02:21,314 --> 01:02:25,876
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

906
01:02:25,985 --> 01:02:28,477
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

907
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:31,683
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

908
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:45,228
- Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

909
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,903
Launch pad is
being constructed.

910
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:51,445
All right, listen up.

911
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:54,414
need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

912
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:58,284
Legs, you're with Ducky.

913
01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:00,582
Roller Bob and I don't move
till we get the signal. Clear?

914
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,182
Okay. Let's move!

915
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:26,449
Wind the frog.

916
01:03:48,507 --> 01:03:50,669
Wait for the signal.

917
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:07,486
Go!

918
01:04:09,363 --> 01:04:12,925
All right, let's go!

919
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:15,026
I'll get it!

920
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:17,435
Now!

921
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:18,836
I'm coming. I'm coming.

922
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:30,118
Scud!

923
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,315
Stupid dog.

924
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:44,325
Lean back!

925
01:04:49,248 --> 01:04:54,312
Uh, Mission Control, is
the launch pad construction complete?

926
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:57,015
Uh, roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

927
01:04:57,123 --> 01:05:00,286
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

928
01:05:00,393 --> 01:05:04,160
- Countdown will commence momentarily. Standby.
- Let's go.

929
01:05:04,265 --> 01:05:08,668
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind

930
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:11,329
- Woody! Great! Help me outta this thing.
- Shh!

931
01:05:11,439 --> 01:05:13,840
- What?
- It's okay.

932
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,502
Everything's under control.

933
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,705
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston.

934
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:23,250
All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch-

935
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:27,379
Hey? How'd you get out here?

936
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:30,981
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

937
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:36,425
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

938
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,591
Uh, roger. Permission granted.

939
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:42,364
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

940
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:47,171
And counting.
Ten, nine,

941
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,939
eight, seven, six,

942
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,914
five, four, three, two,

943
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:57,614
- one!
Reach for the sky!

944
01:05:57,722 --> 01:06:01,214
- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough for the two of us.

945
01:06:01,326 --> 01:06:06,355
- What?
- Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

946
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:09,956
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

947
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:11,968
That's right.

948
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:16,132
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

949
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:21,805
- We don't like bein' blown up, Sid, or smashed or ripped apart.
- "We"?

950
01:06:21,914 --> 01:06:24,246
That's right!
Your toys!

951
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,649
Mama!

952
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:28,948
Mama!

953
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:32,617
Mama! Mama!

954
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,771
Aaah!

955
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:52,779
Aaah!

956
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:55,246
Mama!

957
01:06:55,349 --> 01:07:00,811
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

958
01:07:00,923 --> 01:07:05,087
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

959
01:07:05,194 --> 01:07:10,827
We toys can see
everything.

960
01:07:12,268 --> 01:07:14,634
So play nice.

961
01:07:14,738 --> 01:07:18,539
Aaah!

962
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,677
Ha-ha! We did it!
We did it! Ha-ha! Yes!

963
01:07:24,782 --> 01:07:27,546
The toys!
The toys are alive!

964
01:07:27,651 --> 01:07:31,486
N- Nice toy.
Aaah!

965
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,616
What's wrong, Sid?

966
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:37,388
Don't you want to play with Sally?

967
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:40,125
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

968
01:07:40,233 --> 01:07:43,360
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

969
01:07:43,468 --> 01:07:46,164
Woody.

970
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:49,639
Thanks.

971
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:51,676
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

972
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:54,076
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

973
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,645
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

974
01:08:02,022 --> 01:08:05,150
Quick!

975
01:08:08,028 --> 01:08:10,759
Just go.
I'll catch up.

976
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:27,710
Aaah!

977
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:33,784
Come on!

978
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:49,571
You can do it, Woody!

979
01:08:49,673 --> 01:08:54,737
I got it! Woo-hoo-hoo!

980
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:57,781
I made it.

981
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:03,746
Aaah! Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

982
01:09:03,856 --> 01:09:06,416
- Down! Aah! Aah!
- Hold on, Woody!

983
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:10,757
I can't do it.

984
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:13,424
Take care of Andy for me!

985
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:16,160
No!

986
01:09:16,268 --> 01:09:19,499
Buzz!

987
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:47,166
- Ow! - Are we there
already? - Woody?

988
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:48,531
- How did you-
- How'd he get here?

989
01:09:48,637 --> 01:09:49,865
- Where have you-
- What happened?

990
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:51,302
- Ow!
- What's goin' on?

991
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:55,434
- What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!

992
01:09:55,544 --> 01:09:59,310
Hey. What's he doing?

993
01:09:59,415 --> 01:10:01,713
- Aah!
- He's at it again!

994
01:10:10,259 --> 01:10:12,159
Ha, ha, ha!

995
01:10:13,496 --> 01:10:15,692
- Get him!
- Come on!

996
01:10:22,272 --> 01:10:25,140
Ah, ah, no, no!

997
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:31,545
- No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

998
01:10:31,649 --> 01:10:34,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

999
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:37,184
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1000
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:42,187
Pig pile!

1001
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,662
Aaah!

1002
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,945
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1003
01:11:06,052 --> 01:11:08,112
Whew.

1004
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,281
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1005
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,291
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1006
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,691
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1007
01:11:14,795 --> 01:11:18,892
No, no, no!
Wait! Aah!

1008
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:21,026
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1009
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:26,202
Aah!

1010
01:11:26,308 --> 01:11:29,073
Oh! Woody!

1011
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:31,578
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Lookout!

1012
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:33,808
Aaah!

1013
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,417
Now let's catch up to that truck.

1014
01:11:44,594 --> 01:11:48,395
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1015
01:11:48,499 --> 01:11:50,467
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1016
01:11:53,937 --> 01:11:57,839
- It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth.

1017
01:11:57,941 --> 01:12:01,002
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1018
01:12:01,112 --> 01:12:04,513
We're almost there!

1019
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:08,575
Rocky, the ramp!

1020
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:15,789
Lookout!

1021
01:12:17,296 --> 01:12:19,857
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1022
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:29,533
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1023
01:12:29,642 --> 01:12:30,871
Woody! Speed up!

1024
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:33,172
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1025
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,679
They're runnin' out!

1026
01:12:34,781 --> 01:12:36,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1027
01:12:37,984 --> 01:12:41,318
Whoa! Aah!

1028
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:45,483
# Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase

1029
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:48,460
Aaah!

1030
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:55,201
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1031
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:58,239
- Aaah!
- Ouch!

1032
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,352
Great!

1033
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,822
Woody! The rocket!

1034
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,985
The match! Yes!

1035
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,086
Thank you, Sid!

1036
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,737
No! No, no! No!

1037
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,834
No! Oh, no!

1038
01:13:33,945 --> 01:13:37,403
No, no, no, no, no,

1039
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:39,450
no!

1040
01:13:39,551 --> 01:13:42,679
No!

1041
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:54,699
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1042
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:57,360
- Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
- You did it!

1043
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,665
Next stop: Andy!

1044
01:13:59,772 --> 01:14:03,709
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1045
01:14:13,754 --> 01:14:17,020
I should have
held on longer.

1046
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,561
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1047
01:14:20,662 --> 01:14:23,597
Woody!

1048
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:34,170
Aah! Take cover!

1049
01:14:39,549 --> 01:14:42,074
Aaah! This is the part
where we blow up!

1050
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:44,277
Not today!

1051
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,793
Aaah!

1052
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,630
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1053
01:14:57,735 --> 01:15:00,863
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1054
01:15:00,972 --> 01:15:03,202
Ha-ha-ha!

1055
01:15:03,307 --> 01:15:08,211
To infinity and beyond!

1056
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:16,111
Uh, Buzz,
we missed the truck.

1057
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:18,122
We're not aiming
for the truck.

1058
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:26,022
Hey, wow!

1059
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:28,533
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1060
01:15:28,636 --> 01:15:31,798
- Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
- Here in the car!

1061
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:36,568
See? Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1062
01:15:44,785 --> 01:15:48,222
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1063
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:55,758
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1064
01:15:55,864 --> 01:16:00,234
- Hey, heads up, everybody. It's show time.
- Whoa! It's time!

1065
01:16:00,336 --> 01:16:03,464
Ohh! Oh, Bo.

1066
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:05,870
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1067
01:16:05,975 --> 01:16:09,104
Merry Christmas,
Sheriff.

1068
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,703
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.

1069
01:16:11,815 --> 01:16:14,215
Ooh!

1070
01:16:14,318 --> 01:16:16,615
Maybe Andy will get
another dinosaur.

1071
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,214
Like a leaf eater. That way
I could play the, uh, dominant predator.

1072
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:23,225
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet!

1073
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:25,522
Molly's first
present is Mrs. Potato Head.

1074
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:28,359
Repeat: a Mrs. Potato Head.

1075
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:30,798
Way to go, Idaho!

1076
01:16:30,902 --> 01:16:33,268
Gee, I'd better shave.

1077
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,640
Come in, Frankincense.

1078
01:16:38,743 --> 01:16:40,473
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1079
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:43,412
- It's-
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1080
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:45,483
- I can't quite-
- you are not worried, are you?

1081
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:47,609
- Me? No, no. Pfft.
- Make out-

1082
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,984
No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

1083
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,183
A large box- It's- It's- It's-

1084
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:54,760
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1085
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:59,457
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1086
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:01,626
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1087
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:04,829
Wow! A puppy!

1088
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:18,800
# Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo #

1089
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:22,244
# You've got a friend in me #

1090
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:26,508
# You've got a friend in me #

1091
01:17:27,786 --> 01:17:30,949
# When the road looks rough ahead #

1092
01:17:31,056 --> 01:17:35,960
# And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #

1093
01:17:36,062 --> 01:17:39,520
# You just remember
what your old pal said #

1094
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:42,398
# Boy, you've got as friend in me #

1095
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:47,367
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #

1096
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,749
# You've got a friend in me #

1097
01:17:56,984 --> 01:17:59,475
# You've got a friend in me #

1098
01:18:01,188 --> 01:18:05,285
- # You got troubles #
- # And I got 'em too #

1099
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:09,387
# There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you #

1100
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:12,467
# If we stick together
we can see it through #

1101
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:15,935
# 'Cause you've got a friend in me #

1102
01:18:17,774 --> 01:18:20,299
# You've got a friend in me #

1103
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:26,139
# Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #

1104
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,276
# Bigger and stronger too #

1105
01:18:31,488 --> 01:18:36,051
# But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #

1106
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:38,651
# It's me and you, boy #

1107
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:42,220
# And as the years go by #

1108
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:45,326
# Our friendship will never dies #

1109
01:18:47,005 --> 01:18:51,840
# You're gonna see it's our destiny #

1110
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:55,778
# You've got a friend in me #

1111
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:58,372
# You've got a friend in me #

1112
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:02,519
# You've got a friend in me #
