00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:55,297
Chapter One

00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,466
Chapter One
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:02,971
Chapter One
Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France

4
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,256
Pappa.

5
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,968
Julie, get me some water
for my wash up...

6
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:54,638
...then get inside with your sisters.

7
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,873
Ready, Papa.

8
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,260
Thank you, my darling...

9
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,595
...now you go inside with your sisters.

10
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,226
Don't run.

11
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,064
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

12
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,066
Yes Herr Colonel.

13
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,368
Herman, until I summon you,
I am to be left alone.

14
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,370
As you wish Heer Col.

15
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,959
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

16
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:07,460
I am Perrier LaPadite.

17
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,965
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Monsieur LaPadite...

18
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,509
...I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

19
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,052
What can I do for you?

20
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,431
I was hoping you could invite me
inside your home...

21
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,017
...and we may have a discussion.

22
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:24,978
Certainly. After you.

23
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,781
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

24
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,168
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

25
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:49,669
...Mademoiselle...

26
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,004
...at your service.

27
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:56,134
The rumors I have heard in the
village about your family are all true.

28
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:02,057
Each one of your daughters
is more lovely than the last.

29
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,309
Merci.

30
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,603
Please...

31
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,396
...have a seat.

32
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:16,029
Suzanne, would you be so good as to
get the Colonel some wine?

33
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,531
But no.

34
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,992
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite,
but no wine.

35
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:26,873
This being a dairy farm, one would be
safe in assuming you have milk?

36
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:27,999
Oui.

37
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,501
Then milk is what I prefer.

38
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:30,961
Very well.

39
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,755
Julie, would you mind closing the window?

40
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,193
Merci.

41
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:15,171
Monsieur, to both your family
and your cows...

42
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,924
...I say, "Bravo."

43
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,051
Thank you.

44
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,097
Please join me at your table.

45
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:26,016
Very well.

46
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:32,564
Monsieur LaPadite...

47
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:37,569
...what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private.

48
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,323
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.

49
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,329
If it wouldn't offend them, could you
ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

50
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,165
You are right.

51
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,335
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside?

52
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:55,795
The Colonel and I need to have
a few words.

53
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,017
Monsieur LaPadite...

54
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:15,440
...I regret to inform you
I've exhausted the extent of my French.

55
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:20,487
To continue to speak it so inadequately
would only serve to embarrass me.

56
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:24,574
However, I've been led to believe
you speak English quite well.

57
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,951
Yes.

58
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:31,206
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house...

59
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:33,917
...I ask your permission to switch
to English...

60
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,752
...for the remainder of the conversation.

61
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,088
By all means.

62
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,551
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

63
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:45,305
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.

64
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,475
Are you aware
of my existence?

65
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,477
Yes.

66
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,645
This is good.

67
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,316
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

68
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,694
Yes.

69
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:02,364
Please tell me
what you've heard.

70
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:04,658
I've heard

71
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,496
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

72
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,499
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

73
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,837
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

74
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:22,426
But the meaning
of your visit,

75
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:27,097
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

76
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:32,018
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

77
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,770
and found nothing.

78
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,190
I'm aware of that.

79
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,193
I've read the reports
of this area.

80
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:45,407
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

81
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,577
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

82
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:54,499
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,545
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

84
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:02,299
If you can assist me
with answers,

85
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:05,510
my department can close
the file on your family.

86
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:15,145
Now,

87
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:21,067
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

88
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,987
all dairy farmers
like yourself.

89
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:30,410
Doleracs, Rollins,
the Loveitts

90
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,914
and the Dreyfuses.

91
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,624
Is that correct?

92
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,708
To my knowledge,

93
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,253
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

94
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,257
Herr Colonel, would it disturb
you if I smoked my pipe?

95
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,801
Please,
monsieur LaPadite,

96
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,887
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

97
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,182
Now, according
to these papers,

98
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,520
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

99
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,439
except the Dreyfuses.

100
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,319
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

101
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,697
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

102
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,700
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

103
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,539
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

104
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:16,581
Only rumors.

105
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:17,958
I love rumors!

106
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,877
Facts could be
so misleading,

107
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:24,131
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

108
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,007
So, monsieur LaPadite,

109
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,344
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

110
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,308
Again, this is just a rumor, but

111
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,690
we heard the Dreyfuses

112
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,292
had made their way into Spain.

113
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,284
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

114
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,078
Yes.

115
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:02,419
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

116
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:05,797
the exact members of the
household and their names?

117
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,180
There were
five of them.

118
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,059
The father, Jacob.

119
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,439
Wife, Miram.

120
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:28,069
And her brother, Bob.

121
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,870
How old is Bob?

122
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,831
Thirty, 31.

123
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:45,337
Continue.

124
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,339
And the children,

125
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,175
Amos

126
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,720
and Shosanna.

127
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,724
Ages of the children?

128
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:08,401
Amos was nine or 10.

129
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:12,531
And Shosanna?

130
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,741
And Shosanna was

131
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,205
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.

132
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,385
Well, I guess
that should do it.

133
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:44,187
However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?

134
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,733
But of course.

135
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,534
Monsieur LaPadite,

136
00:12:57,617 --> 00:13:01,621
are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?

137
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,669
I have no interest
in such things.

138
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:11,423
But you are aware
of what they call me.

139
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,302
I'm aware.

140
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,930
What are you aware of?

141
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,358
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter. "

142
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,985
Precisely.

143
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,948
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

144
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,326
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

145
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,078
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

146
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:45,415
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

147
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:48,835
It would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

148
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,172
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

149
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,674
precisely because
I've earned it.

150
00:13:56,093 --> 00:14:00,138
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

151
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,933
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

152
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,018
I can think like a Jew

153
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,396
where they can only
think like a German.

154
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:11,191
More precisely,
a German soldier.

155
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:22,828
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

156
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,915
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

157
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:31,211
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

158
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:33,422
it would be
that of the rat.

159
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:40,053
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

160
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:43,140
But where our conclusions
differ,

161
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:46,226
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

162
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:52,566
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

163
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,694
It's a hostile world,
indeed.

164
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,906
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

165
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,409
would you greet it
with hostility?

166
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,245
I suppose I would.

167
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,872
Has a rat ever done
anything to you

168
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:10,250
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

169
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:13,795
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.

170
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:18,133
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

171
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,844
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

172
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:23,388
a squirrel could
equally carry.

173
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,056
Would you agree?

174
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,519
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

175
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:31,605
that you do with rats,
do you?

176
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:32,689
No.

177
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:35,275
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

178
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:39,362
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

179
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,616
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

180
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,368
However interesting
as the thought may be,

181
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,705
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

182
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,128
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

183
00:15:56,254 --> 00:16:00,092
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

184
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,635
Probably not.

185
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,012
I didn't think so.

186
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,181
You don't like them.

187
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,141
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

188
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:10,977
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

189
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:16,233
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

190
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,860
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

191
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,363
Where does the hawk look?

192
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:24,616
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

193
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:27,160
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

194
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,290
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

195
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:38,213
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

196
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:42,717
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

197
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,305
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

198
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,433
once they abandon dignity.

199
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,353
May I smoke my pipe
as well?

200
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:58,567
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

201
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,376
Now, my job dictates

202
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,384
that I must have my men
enter your home

203
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,182
and conduct
a thorough search

204
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:34,060
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

205
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:38,690
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.

206
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,984
That is unless you have
something to tell me

207
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:44,112
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

208
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,448
I might add, also,
that any information

209
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:51,203
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

210
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,582
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

211
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,375
And that reward will be,

212
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,253
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

213
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:04,758
by the German military during the
rest of our occupation of your country.

214
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:18,772
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

215
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:25,195
Yes.

216
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:32,035
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

217
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,622
Yes.

218
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,503
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

219
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:03,900
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,

220
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:07,696
I assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

221
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:10,657
Yes.

222
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:15,579
I'm going to switch back to French now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade.

223
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,122
Is that clear?

224
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,167
Yes.

225
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,209
Monsieur LaPadite...

226
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,339
...I thank you for the milk...

227
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,342
...and your hospitality.

228
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:36,055
I do believe our business here is done.

229
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,311
Ah, ladies.

230
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:48,567
I thank you for your time.

231
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:52,780
We shan't be bothering your family
any longer.

232
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:54,865
So, Monsieur...

233
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:56,951
...Mademoiselle.

234
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:00,287
I bid farewell to you and say...

235
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:01,914
...adieu.

236
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,230
It's the girl.

237
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:12,028
Au revoir, Shosanna!

238
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,837
Ten-hut!

239
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,596
My name is
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

240
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,641
And I'm putting together a special
team, and I need me eight soldiers.

241
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,853
Eight Jewish
American soldiers.

242
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,399
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the Armada happening soon.

243
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,194
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.

244
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:56,698
We're going to be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.

245
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:59,618
Once we're
in enemy territory,

246
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:02,204
as a bushwhacking
guerrilla army,

247
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,665
we're going to be doing one
thing and one thing only.

248
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,667
Killing Nazis.

249
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,254
I don't know
about you all,

250
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:14,257
but I sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

251
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:18,261
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

252
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:22,766
and jump out of a fucking airplane to
teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

253
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,935
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

254
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:29,189
They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac

255
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:31,525
and they need
to be destroyed.

256
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,238
That's why any and every son of a
bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

257
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,532
they're going to die.

258
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,913
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

259
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,124
That means I got
a little Indian in me.

260
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:51,461
And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.

261
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,881
We will be cruel
to the Germans.

262
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:58,552
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

263
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:00,971
And they will find
the evidence of our cruelty

264
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,973
in the disemboweled,
dismembered

265
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:06,726
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.

266
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,312
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

267
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:13,150
but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands,

268
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:17,237
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.

269
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:20,991
And the German
will be sickened by us.

270
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,285
And the German
will talk about us.

271
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,579
And the German
will fear us.

272
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,582
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

273
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:31,960
and they're tortured by their
subconscious for the evil they have done,

274
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,756
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.

275
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:38,467
Sound good?

276
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,177
Yes, sir!

277
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:43,305
That's what I like to hear.

278
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:47,350
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

279
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,312
When you join my command,
you take on debit.

280
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,315
A debit you owe me,
personally.

281
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:59,905
Each and every man under my
command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

282
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,449
And I want my scalps.

283
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:08,538
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

284
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,042
Or you will die trying!

285
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:12,748
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

286
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,375
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

287
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:18,504
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure?

288
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,965
They butcher my men like they were flies!

289
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:29,223
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured
up in their fear-induced delirium?

290
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:30,599
The one...

291
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,894
...that beats my boys with a bat!

292
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:37,064
The one they call "The Bear Jew"...

293
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:38,399
...is a Golem!

294
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,567
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.

295
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,240
No one really believes "The Bear Jew"
is a Golem.

296
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,616
Why not?

297
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:50,869
They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.

298
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:55,499
They seem to be able to appear and
disappear at will.

299
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:59,878
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?

300
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,381
Then bring them to me!

301
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:08,220
I will hang them naked, by their heels,
from the Eiffel Tower!

302
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:12,391
And then throw their bodies in the sewers...

303
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:16,019
...for the rats of Paris to feast!

304
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,692
Kliest!

305
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,985
Yes, my Führer!

306
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:28,532
I have an order I want relayed to all
German soldiers stationed in France.

307
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:36,415
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew," henceforth,
is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.

308
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,833
Yes, my Führer!

309
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:40,419
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

310
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,546
Who and what is a Private Butz?

311
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:45,215
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.

312
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,136
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.

313
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:51,096
He was its only survivor.

314
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:54,725
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.

315
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:55,976
Send him in.

316
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:12,117
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the
only ones left alive after the ambush.

317
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:17,581
While one man guarded us,
the rest removed the hair.

318
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,831
Hey, Hirschberg.

319
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,291
Send that Kraut
sarge over.

320
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,876
You. Go.

321
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,662
Sergeant
Werner Rachtman.

322
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,166
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.

323
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,752
You know what
"sit down" means, Werner?

324
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:43,628
Yes.
Then sit down.

325
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,383
How is your English,
Werner?

326
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,428
Because if need be, we got a
couple of fellows who can translate.

327
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,596
Wicki here,

328
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,932
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.

329
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:59,936
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.

330
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,106
Another one up there
you might be familiar with.

331
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,108
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

332
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,695
Heard of him?

333
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,699
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

334
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,337
The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity

335
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,547
among German soldiers
is simple.

336
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:33,303
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.

337
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,570
Instead of putting him up
against a wall,

338
00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:53,490
the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin

339
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:55,075
to be made an example of.

340
00:28:56,618 --> 00:29:00,372
Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,

341
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,374
he never got there.

342
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:41,163
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

343
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,543
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

344
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,295
Ever heard of us?

345
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:52,883
We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.

346
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,092
When it comes
to killing Nazis...

347
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,598
...I think you show
great talent.

348
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,477
And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.

349
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,150
But your status as a Nazi
killer is stilI amateur.

350
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:14,237
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

351
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:23,371
Can I assume
you know who we are?

352
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,790
You're Aldo the Apache.

353
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,627
Werner,
if you heard of us,

354
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,379
you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.

355
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,383
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.

356
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,760
Oh, yeah.

357
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:39,888
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

358
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,182
Either kill you
or let you go.

359
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,810
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

360
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:46,853
depends entirely on you.

361
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:53,944
Up the road a piece,
there's an orchard.

362
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:58,782
Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.

363
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,785
If that patrol were
to have any crack shots,

364
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:04,830
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

365
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,376
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

366
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:14,297
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.

367
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,510
You got to tell me how many
they are, and you got to tell me

368
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,054
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

369
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:26,768
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.

370
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:31,815
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.

371
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:34,776
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

372
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,029
And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.

373
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,740
Now, just take that
finger of yours

374
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:44,161
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,

375
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:47,622
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with.

376
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:57,007
I respectfully refuse,
sir.

377
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:00,677
Hear that?

378
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,054
Yes.

379
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:08,477
That's Sergeant
Donny Donowitz.

380
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,480
You might know him better
by his nickname.

381
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,315
The Bear Jew.

382
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,403
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

383
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:19,738
I heard of The Bear Jew.

384
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,448
What did you hear?

385
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,951
Beats German soldiers
with a club.

386
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,122
He bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat, what he does.

387
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,541
And, Werner, I'm going to
ask you one last goddamn time,

388
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,502
and if you still
respectfully refuse,

389
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,629
I'm calling
The Bear Jew over.

390
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,631
He's going to take
that big bat of his,

391
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:40,884
and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.

392
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,014
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

393
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:49,101
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

394
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,485
Fuck you.

395
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,570
And your Jew dogs.

396
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,493
Actually, Werner, we're all
tickled to hear you say that.

397
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,453
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death

398
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:11,415
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

399
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:12,624
Yeah?

400
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:15,252
Got us a German here who
wants to die for country.

401
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:16,670
Oblige him.

402
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:25,739
Did you get that
for killing Jews?

403
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,199
Bravery.

404
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:44,883
Yeah!

405
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,846
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

406
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,098
Donny!

407
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,849
Yeah, Donny!

408
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,852
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

409
00:34:57,354 --> 00:35:00,023
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

410
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:03,693
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

411
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:07,697
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

412
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:08,865
You!

413
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:13,787
Damn it,
Hirschberg!

414
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,790
Donny, bring that other one
over here. Alive!

415
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,001
Get the fuck up! Batter
up. You're on deck!

416
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:23,004
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground.

417
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:25,215
English?

418
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,509
Wicki.

419
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,098
Ask him
if he wants to live.

420
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:37,644
Tell him to point out on
this map the German position.

421
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,192
Ask him how many Germans.

422
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,280
Around about 12.

423
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,823
What kind of artillery?

424
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:57,994
How did you survive this ordeal?

425
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:00,830
They let me go.

426
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:03,170
Now, when you report
what happened here,

427
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,923
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.

428
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:10,927
They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.

429
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:14,681
So tell them, we let you live so you
could spread the word through the ranks

430
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:17,225
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

431
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:22,143
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!

432
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,980
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!

433
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:27,857
Not one word more!

434
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:30,276
Yes, my Führer.

435
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:36,199
Did they mark you like they did
the other survivors?

436
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:38,701
Yes, my Führer.

437
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,043
Now that you've survived the war, when
you get home, what you going to do?

438
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,795
I will hug my mother like
I've never hugged her before.

439
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,384
He's going
to hug his mother.

440
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,305
Well, ain't that nice?

441
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,224
Ask if he's going
to take off his uniform.

442
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:01,891
Not only shall I remove it,
but I intend to burn it.

443
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:04,189
He's going
to burn it.

444
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:07,192
Yeah, that's what we
thought. We don't like that.

445
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:12,155
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.

446
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,782
Just like that.

447
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:22,666
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

448
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,918
And that don't sit
well with us.

449
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,593
So I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

450
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:49,443
You know, Lieutenant, you're
getting pretty good at that.

451
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:53,071
You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?

452
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,282
Practice.

453
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,847
What starts tomorrow?

454
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,269
A Max Linder festival.

455
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:13,022
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.

456
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:17,110
Except Linder never made a film
as good as "The Kid."

457
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:20,196
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.

458
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:28,538
I adore your cinema very much.

459
00:39:29,873 --> 00:39:30,957
Merci.

460
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:32,875
Is it yours?

461
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:35,628
Do I own it?

462
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:36,838
Oui.

463
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:38,464
Oui.

464
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:43,511
How is it a girl as young as you
owns a cinema?

465
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:45,471
My aunt left it to me.

466
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:48,558
Merci for hosting a German night.

467
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:51,060
I don't have a choice...

468
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:52,729
...but you're welcome.

469
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:55,690
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films...

470
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:57,066
...especially Piz Palü.

471
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:00,737
It's nice to see a French girl
who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.

472
00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:03,239
"Admire" would not really be
the word I would use...

473
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:06,200
...to describe my feelings towards
Fräulein Riefenstahl.

474
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:10,413
But you do admire the director Pabst,
don't you?

475
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:14,042
That's why you include his name
on the marquee...

476
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,127
...when you didn't have to.

477
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:28,306
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.

478
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:30,308
Even Germans.

479
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:31,768
Even Germans, oui.

480
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,771
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.

481
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,982
You're not finished.

482
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:39,776
I'll finish in the morning.

483
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,277
May I ask your name?

484
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:45,114
You wish to see my papers?

485
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:01,297
Emmanuelle Mimieux.

486
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,092
That's a very pretty name.

487
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:06,302
Merci.

488
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,678
Are you finished with my papers?

489
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:13,684
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself...

490
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:15,853
...Fredrick Zoller.

491
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:24,445
Well...

492
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:29,659
...it's been a pleasure chatting
with a fellow cinema lover.

493
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,120
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.

494
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:33,996
Adieu.

495
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:16,038
Hello, mademoiselle.

496
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,207
May I join you?

497
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,543
Look, Fredrick...

498
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:23,045
You remember my name?

499
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
Yes.

500
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:28,217
Look, you seem a
pleasant enough fellow...

501
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,385
Thank you.

502
00:42:29,595 --> 00:42:30,678
You're welcome.

503
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,763
Regardless, I want you
to stop pestering me.

504
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:38,060
I apologize, mademoiselle...

505
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:39,937
...I wasn't trying to be a pest.

506
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:42,565
I was simply trying to be friendly.

507
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:44,775
I don't wish to be your friend.

508
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:47,403
Why not?

509
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:50,907
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

510
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:55,077
I'm more than just a uniform.

511
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:56,579
Not to me.

512
00:42:57,247 --> 00:42:59,373
If you are so desperate
for a French girlfriend...

513
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,542
...I suggest you try Vichy.

514
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:34,784
Who are you?

515
00:43:35,827 --> 00:43:37,078
I thought I was just a uniform.

516
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,330
You're not just a German soldier.

517
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:41,999
Are you somebody's son?

518
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:44,961
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

519
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:20,538
You're a very lucky girl,
catching a brave war hero.

520
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:23,499
No, no, no, no, the
mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.

521
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:27,169
Can you write "Amour Babette"?

522
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:49,734
So you're a war hero.

523
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:52,570
What did you do?

524
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,535
I was alone in a bell tower
in a walled off city.

525
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:03,039
It was myself and a thousand
rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest...

526
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,208
...against three hundred enemy soldiers.

527
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,878
What's a bird's nest?

528
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:14,717
A bird's nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower.

529
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:18,179
It's a high structure, offering a three
hundred and sixty degree view.

530
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:21,098
Very advantageous for marksmen.

531
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:24,560
How many did you kill?

532
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:27,355
Sixty-eight.

533
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:30,691
The first day.

534
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,236
A hundred and fifty...

535
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,239
...the second day.

536
00:45:40,077 --> 00:45:41,577
Thirty-two the third day.

537
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:45,956
On the fourth day they exited the city.

538
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:51,629
Naturally, my war story received a
lot of attention in Germany...

539
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:53,589
...that's why they all recognize me.

540
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:57,259
They call me the German Sergeant York.

541
00:45:58,595 --> 00:46:00,262
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.

542
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:05,267
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.

543
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:08,604
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."

544
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,318
And they wanted me to play myself...

545
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:16,737
...so I did.

546
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,740
Joseph thinks this movie will
be proven to be his masterpiece.

547
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:22,076
And I will be the German Van Johnson.

548
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:24,412
"Nation's Pride" is about you?

549
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:28,624
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?

550
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:29,834
I know.

551
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:31,127
Comical?

552
00:46:31,962 --> 00:46:35,297
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.

553
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:46,976
Goodbye!

554
00:46:48,895 --> 00:46:49,895
Do you need help?

555
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,147
No, it's okay.

556
00:46:51,314 --> 00:46:52,481
If you need me, I'll be in the
storage room.

557
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:53,649
Okay, my love.

558
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:28,017
Mademoiselle Mimieux?

559
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:31,896
Yes?

560
00:47:36,193 --> 00:47:37,193
Is this your cinema?

561
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:39,069
Yes.

562
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:43,866
Come down!

563
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:48,204
Please.

564
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:06,555
I don't understand. What have I done?

565
00:48:06,723 --> 00:48:07,723
She wants to know what she's done.

566
00:48:08,058 --> 00:48:09,767
Get your ass in that car.

567
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:34,917
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows
America to be competitive athletically.

568
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:40,256
American Olympic gold can be
measured in Negro sweat.

569
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:56,438
Good, you came.

570
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:59,149
I wasn't sure whether or not
you'd accept my invitation.

571
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:01,193
Invitation?

572
00:49:01,278 --> 00:49:02,611
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?

573
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:03,946
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.

574
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:06,490
Emmanuelle, there is somebody
I want you to meet.

575
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:13,789
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce
you to the minister of propaganda...

576
00:49:14,457 --> 00:49:17,126
...the leader of the entire
German film industry...

577
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:21,463
...and now that I'm an actor, my boss,
Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

578
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:23,757
Your reputation precedes you,
Fräulein Mimieux.

579
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,143
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels'
French interpreter...

580
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:35,686
...Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

581
00:49:36,146 --> 00:49:37,146
Hello.

582
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,360
Hello.

583
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:47,781
And you've met the Major.

584
00:49:48,325 --> 00:49:51,660
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.

585
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:53,329
At your service, mademoiselle.

586
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:55,372
Please allow me...

587
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:57,708
...have a seat please.

588
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:06,842
Try the champagne, mademoiselle,
it's quite good.

589
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:19,188
I must say, Fräulein,
I should be rather annoyed with you.

590
00:50:20,523 --> 00:50:21,982
I arrive in France...

591
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:25,361
...and I wish to have lunch with my star.

592
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:27,196
Little do I know...

593
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:30,199
...he's become the toast of Paris.

594
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:34,870
And now he must find time for me.

595
00:50:37,248 --> 00:50:41,877
People wait in line hours, days to see me.

596
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:45,047
For the Führer...

597
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:48,384
...and Private Zoller, I wait.

598
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:54,264
So finally, I'm granted an audience
with the young Private.

599
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:59,895
And he spends the entire lunch speaking
of you and your cinema.

600
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,147
So Fräulein Mimieux,
let's get down to business.

601
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:03,399
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...

602
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:04,858
I haven't informed her yet.

603
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:07,903
Unless the girl's a simpleton,
I'm sure she's figured it out by now.

604
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:09,738
After all, she does operate a cinema.

605
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:12,241
Francesca, tell her.

606
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:15,327
What they are trying to tell you,
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller...

607
00:51:15,412 --> 00:51:17,955
...has spent the last hour at lunch trying
to convince Monsieur Goebbels...

608
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,582
...to abandon previous plans for
Private Zoller's film premiere...

609
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:23,752
...and change the venue to your cinema.

610
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:25,921
What?

611
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:27,631
I wanted to inform her.

612
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:30,968
Shit! I apologize,
Private, of course you did.

613
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,261
What's the issue?

614
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:35,931
The Private wanted to
inform the mademoiselle himself.

615
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:37,433
Nonsense!

616
00:51:38,435 --> 00:51:40,769
Until I ask my questions,
he has nothing to inform.

617
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:44,898
Let the record state, I have not agreed
to switch cinemas for my premiere.

618
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:46,900
Duly noted.

619
00:51:51,906 --> 00:51:53,741
You have opera boxes?

620
00:51:55,076 --> 00:51:56,118
Yes.

621
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,162
How many?

622
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:01,081
Two.

623
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:04,168
More would be better.

624
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:07,087
How many seats in your auditorium?

625
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:08,797
Three hundred and fifty.

626
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,804
That's almost four hundred
less than The Ritz.

627
00:52:16,097 --> 00:52:17,473
But Dr. Goebbels...

628
00:52:17,974 --> 00:52:19,099
...that's not such a terrible thing.

629
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,686
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge
every two-faced French bourgeois...

630
00:52:22,812 --> 00:52:23,812
...taking up space, currying favor.

631
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:27,024
With less seats, it makes the
event more exclusive.

632
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:30,944
You're not trying to fill the house,
they're fighting for seats.

633
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:33,280
Besides, to hell with the French.

634
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:37,159
This is a German night, a German event,
a German celebration.

635
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:40,204
This night is for you, me...

636
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,706
...for the German military,
the high command...

637
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:43,832
...their family and friends.

638
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:46,210
The only people who should
be allowed in the room...

639
00:52:46,336 --> 00:52:48,670
...are people who will be moved by
the exploits on the screen.

640
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:00,182
I see your public speaking has improved.

641
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,685
It appears I've created a monster.

642
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:09,191
A strangely persuasive monster.

643
00:53:15,365 --> 00:53:18,075
When the war is over, politics await.

644
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:27,876
Well, Private...

645
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,757
...though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything...

646
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:38,595
I must watch a film in this young lady's
cinema before I can say, yes or no.

647
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:46,103
So young lady, you are to close your cinema
for a private screening tonight.

648
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:52,901
What German films do you have?

649
00:53:53,444 --> 00:53:53,485
Ah, Landa, you are here.

650
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:54,903
Ah, Landa, you are here.

651
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:00,742
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa
of the SS.

652
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,370
He'll be running the security for the premiere.

653
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:10,419
Charmed, mademoiselle.

654
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,225
Au revoir, Shosanna!

655
00:54:20,805 --> 00:54:24,975
And now I must get the Reich Minister
to his next appointment.

656
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:27,603
Slave driver.

657
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:31,607
French slave driver.

658
00:54:34,235 --> 00:54:38,947
Actually, in my role as security chief of this
joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must...

659
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,575
...have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

660
00:54:42,952 --> 00:54:43,994
What sort of discussion?

661
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:51,793
That sounded suspiciously like a Private
questioning the order of a Colonel.

662
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:53,587
Or am I just being sensitive?

663
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,756
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Colonel.

664
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:57,299
Your authority is beyond question.

665
00:54:58,635 --> 00:54:59,968
But your reputation does precede you.

666
00:55:00,345 --> 00:55:02,471
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

667
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,806
Hans, the boy means no harm...

668
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:06,975
...he's simply smitten.

669
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:10,312
And he's correct. Your reputation
does precede you.

670
00:55:10,647 --> 00:55:14,483
No need for concern, you two. As
security chief, I simply need to have a chat...

671
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:17,819
...with the possible new venue's property owner.

672
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,833
Have you tried the strudel here?

673
00:55:34,504 --> 00:55:35,629
No, no.

674
00:55:36,005 --> 00:55:37,130
It's not so terrible.

675
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:43,553
So how is it the young Private and
yourself came to be acquainted?

676
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:49,685
Yes, two strudels. One for myself and
one for the mademoiselle.

677
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:54,856
For me a cup of espresso
and for the mademoiselle...

678
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:56,358
...a glass of milk.

679
00:55:59,696 --> 00:56:02,531
So, mademoiselle, you were
beginning to explain?

680
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:09,204
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no
knowledge of Private Zoller...

681
00:56:09,872 --> 00:56:10,872
...or his exploits.

682
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,041
To me...

683
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:17,546
...the Private was simply just a
patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times but...

684
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:20,716
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.

685
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:24,261
This is a simple formality.

686
00:56:24,554 --> 00:56:27,055
No reason for you to feel anxious.

687
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,730
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.

688
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:36,398
One moment.

689
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,948
Wait for the cream.

690
00:56:57,295 --> 00:57:00,756
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?

691
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:02,924
Oui.

692
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:07,262
So, Emmanuelle...

693
00:57:08,598 --> 00:57:09,639
...explain to me...

694
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:13,769
...how does it happen, that a young lady such
as yourself, comes to own a cinema?

695
00:57:26,282 --> 00:57:27,282
After you.

696
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:44,800
Verdict?

697
00:57:45,968 --> 00:57:47,803
Like I said, not so terrible.

698
00:57:55,978 --> 00:57:58,814
You were explaining the origin
of your cinema ownership.

699
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:03,985
The cinema originally belonged
to my aunt and uncle.

700
00:58:05,822 --> 00:58:07,155
What are their names?

701
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:08,782
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

702
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,992
Where are they now?

703
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:13,829
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.

704
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:15,664
Pity.

705
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,791
Continue.

706
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:21,503
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.

707
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:23,130
Regrettable.

708
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,551
It's come to my attention you have a
Negro in your employ. Is that true?

709
00:58:29,637 --> 00:58:30,679
Oui.

710
00:58:32,515 --> 00:58:33,640
He is a Frenchman.

711
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:36,184
His name is Marcel.

712
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:41,481
He worked with my aunt and uncle
since they opened the cinema.

713
00:58:42,692 --> 00:58:44,693
He's the only other one who works with me.

714
00:58:44,986 --> 00:58:46,027
Doing what?

715
00:58:46,237 --> 00:58:47,362
Projectionist.

716
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,156
Is he any good?

717
00:58:49,365 --> 00:58:50,407
The best.

718
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:55,704
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.

719
00:59:02,378 --> 00:59:04,838
Can you operate the projectors?

720
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:06,548
Of course I can.

721
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:11,887
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...

722
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,598
I'm quite positive...

723
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:19,186
...he wouldn't want the
success or failure of his illustrious evening...

724
00:59:21,731 --> 00:59:23,398
...dependent on the prowess of a Negro.

725
00:59:25,026 --> 00:59:26,067
So...

726
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:27,694
...if it comes to pass...

727
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:31,406
...we hold this event at your venue...

728
00:59:32,575 --> 00:59:35,452
...talented no doubt, as your Negro may be...

729
00:59:36,871 --> 00:59:37,913
...you will...

730
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:40,415
...operate the projectors.

731
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:46,630
Is that acceptable?

732
00:59:47,256 --> 00:59:48,298
Oui.

733
00:59:49,884 --> 00:59:50,926
Cigarette?

734
00:59:54,096 --> 00:59:55,138
They are not French.

735
00:59:56,057 --> 00:59:57,098
They are German.

736
01:00:15,493 --> 01:00:17,327
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.

737
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:32,467
But right now, for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.

738
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:35,804
Oh well, must not have been important.

739
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:41,017
'Til tonight.

740
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:53,947
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this cinema.

741
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,701
Your cinema has real respect, almost
church like.

742
01:00:58,494 --> 01:01:01,496
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit.

743
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:06,001
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few
Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.

744
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,171
So, Emmanuelle, how did
you like "Lucky Kids"?

745
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:12,757
I quite like Lilian Harvey.

746
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,719
Lilian Harvey!

747
01:01:16,178 --> 01:01:18,388
Never mention that name again in my presence!

748
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:42,871
Hey...

749
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,873
...what the fuck are we supposed to do?

750
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:49,377
It looks like we're supposed
to have a Nazi premiere.

751
01:01:49,545 --> 01:01:53,048
Like I said
what the fuck are we supposed to do?

752
01:01:55,885 --> 01:01:58,553
Well, I need to talk with you about that.

753
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:02,724
I'm confused, what are we talking about?

754
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:07,062
Filling the cinema with Nazis
and burning it down to the ground.

755
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:08,396
I'm not talking about that.

756
01:02:08,731 --> 01:02:09,898
You are talking about that.

757
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:12,067
No, we're talking about that, right now.

758
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:16,571
If we can keep this place from burning
down by ourselves...

759
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:18,907
...we can burn it down by ourselves?

760
01:02:21,494 --> 01:02:23,119
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

761
01:02:23,412 --> 01:02:26,122
And with Madame Mimieux's
350 nitrate film print collection...

762
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:29,417
...we wouldn't even need explosives...

763
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:31,503
...would we?

764
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:34,589
You mean we wouldn't
need any more explosives?

765
01:02:34,636 --> 01:02:39,015
At that time, 35 millimeter
nitrate film was so flammable

766
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:42,144
that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a streetcar.

767
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:44,062
Hey, you can't bring those
here on a public vehicle.

768
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:45,564
They're films, ain't they? Yes.

769
01:02:45,647 --> 01:02:47,315
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.

770
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:51,319
Because nitrate film burns
three times faster than paper.

771
01:02:54,948 --> 01:02:56,992
Shosanna has a collection

772
01:02:57,075 --> 01:03:02,122
of over 350 nitrate
film prints.

773
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,454
I am going to burn down
the cinema on Nazi night.

774
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:13,545
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema...

775
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,004
...which I am...

776
01:03:16,966 --> 01:03:19,300
...we both know, you're not
going to let me do it by myself.

777
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:27,976
Because you love me. And I love you. And you're
the only person on this earth I can trust.

778
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,647
But that's not all we're going to do.

779
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:37,152
Does the filmmaking equipment
in the attic still work?

780
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:40,071
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?

781
01:03:40,197 --> 01:03:41,489
Quite well, actually.

782
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:46,161
I recorded a new guitarist I met in
a cafe last week. It works superb.

783
01:03:48,205 --> 01:03:50,331
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

784
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:58,214
Because Marcel, my sweet...

785
01:03:59,049 --> 01:04:00,175
...we're going to make a film.

786
01:04:02,344 --> 01:04:03,928
Just for the Nazis.

787
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,862
Right this way,
Lieutenant.

788
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:38,718
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.

789
01:04:38,802 --> 01:04:41,596
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.

790
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:43,640
Drink?

791
01:04:45,392 --> 01:04:49,604
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.

792
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:53,275
That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself like a good chap, will you?

793
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:55,360
The bar is in the globe.

794
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,825
Something for yourself,
sir?

795
01:05:01,908 --> 01:05:05,078
Whiskey. Straight.
No junk in it.

796
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:09,249
It says here that
you speak German fluently.

797
01:05:09,332 --> 01:05:11,293
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

798
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:14,004
And your occupation
before the war?

799
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:15,255
I'm a film critic.

800
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:17,841
List your accomplishments.

801
01:05:17,924 --> 01:05:19,801
Well, sir,
such as they are,

802
01:05:19,885 --> 01:05:24,431
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

803
01:05:24,514 --> 01:05:26,933
and I've had
two books published.

804
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:30,854
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

805
01:05:30,937 --> 01:05:31,938
The first book
was called

806
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:36,526
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

807
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:40,447
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

808
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:45,869
It's a subtextual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

809
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:47,954
What should we
drink to, sir?

810
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:49,289
Well...

811
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,501
Down with Hitler.

812
01:05:52,584 --> 01:05:53,960
All the way down, sir.

813
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:55,587
Yes.

814
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:03,386
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

815
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:09,476
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

816
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,812
but I'm familiar with it.

817
01:06:11,895 --> 01:06:12,938
Explain it to me.

818
01:06:13,605 --> 01:06:14,648
Pardon, sir?

819
01:06:14,731 --> 01:06:18,985
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

820
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:24,241
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me U FA under Goebbels.

821
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,787
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

822
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:32,124
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

823
01:06:32,582 --> 01:06:34,251
An alternative
to what he considers

824
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:37,295
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

825
01:06:38,004 --> 01:06:40,674
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

826
01:06:40,757 --> 01:06:42,342
How's he doing?

827
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:45,470
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

828
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:50,517
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

829
01:06:51,518 --> 01:06:54,521
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

830
01:06:55,355 --> 01:06:57,607
how's he doing?

831
01:06:57,691 --> 01:06:58,942
Quite well, actually.

832
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:01,194
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

833
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:05,699
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

834
01:07:05,782 --> 01:07:09,244
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

835
01:07:09,327 --> 01:07:13,123
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

836
01:07:17,544 --> 01:07:18,920
Brief him.

837
01:07:19,254 --> 01:07:24,301
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

838
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:26,011
Three days from now

839
01:07:26,094 --> 01:07:30,432
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

840
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:31,641
What film, sir?

841
01:07:31,725 --> 01:07:34,394
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

842
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:38,732
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

843
01:07:38,815 --> 01:07:43,236
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

844
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,074
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

845
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:50,577
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

846
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,746
The master race at play?

847
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:57,000
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

848
01:07:57,084 --> 01:07:59,628
The objective
of Operation Kino,

849
01:08:00,545 --> 01:08:02,297
blow up the basket.

850
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:07,177
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.

851
01:08:08,095 --> 01:08:09,763
Jolly good, sir.

852
01:08:10,514 --> 01:08:14,017
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

853
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:15,644
will be your assist.

854
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:19,606
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

855
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:23,360
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.

856
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:26,363
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

857
01:08:26,446 --> 01:08:30,450
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.

858
01:08:30,534 --> 01:08:35,247
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

859
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,416
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.

860
01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:40,252
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

861
01:08:41,378 --> 01:08:44,172
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

862
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:47,426
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

863
01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:49,636
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

864
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:53,473
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

865
01:08:53,557 --> 01:08:56,977
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

866
01:08:57,811 --> 01:08:58,979
How will I know her?

867
01:08:59,104 --> 01:09:02,315
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

868
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,319
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.

869
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:07,863
Bridget von Hammersmark?

870
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:12,117
The German movie star
is working for England?

871
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,786
Yes, for the last
two years now.

872
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:18,415
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.

873
01:09:18,498 --> 01:09:19,666
Indeed.

874
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:20,792
Got the gist?

875
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:23,628
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.

876
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:31,261
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

877
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:32,679
I didn't know.

878
01:09:32,763 --> 01:09:34,181
You said it was
in a tavern.

879
01:09:34,264 --> 01:09:35,432
It is a tavern.

880
01:09:35,515 --> 01:09:36,892
Yeah, in a basement.

881
01:09:37,559 --> 01:09:40,437
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

882
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,815
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

883
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:45,776
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

884
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:47,110
We wait.

885
01:09:47,944 --> 01:09:52,032
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

886
01:10:13,553 --> 01:10:15,889
Stiglitz, right?

887
01:10:15,972 --> 01:10:17,015
That's right, sir.

888
01:10:18,266 --> 01:10:20,769
I hear you're pretty good
with that.

889
01:10:24,564 --> 01:10:27,692
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

890
01:10:27,943 --> 01:10:31,488
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

891
01:10:33,323 --> 01:10:38,203
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

892
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,332
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

893
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:48,463
I don't look calm to you?

894
01:10:51,425 --> 01:10:56,304
Well, now that you put it
like that, I guess you do.

895
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:17,242
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not
exactly the loquacious type, is he?

896
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:22,789
Is that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?

897
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,085
Fair point, Lieutenant.

898
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:32,132
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

899
01:11:32,215 --> 01:11:34,426
Make bets
on how it all comes out?

900
01:11:35,635 --> 01:11:38,805
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

901
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:43,226
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

902
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,481
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

903
01:11:48,398 --> 01:11:52,652
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

904
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:58,658
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

905
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:01,078
She chose the spot.

906
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:02,788
Isn't that just dandy?

907
01:12:02,871 --> 01:12:06,833
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.

908
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:11,046
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

909
01:12:11,129 --> 01:12:13,173
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

910
01:12:13,256 --> 01:12:16,051
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.

911
01:12:17,516 --> 01:12:18,683
So, I'm male...

912
01:12:19,518 --> 01:12:21,686
...I'm a fictional, literary character
from the past...

913
01:12:21,895 --> 01:12:24,689
...I'm American, and that's controversial.

914
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,025
No, it's not controversial at all.

915
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,030
The nationality of the author has nothing to do
with the nationality of the character.

916
01:12:34,074 --> 01:12:35,700
The character is the character.

917
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,369
Hamlet is not British. He is Danish.

918
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:42,165
So yes, this character was born in America.

919
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:43,291
Well then.

920
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:46,210
Mathilda.

921
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,379
Schnapps?

922
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,755
Schnapps...Schnapps...Schnapps.

923
01:12:50,048 --> 01:12:51,424
Five schnapps, please.

924
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,803
If I had a wife...

925
01:12:57,097 --> 01:12:58,264
...would she be called a squaw?

926
01:12:58,557 --> 01:12:59,599
Yes!

927
01:12:59,683 --> 01:13:00,725
He's got it.

928
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:01,934
Three more questions!

929
01:13:02,269 --> 01:13:03,728
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

930
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:04,854
Yes!

931
01:13:04,938 --> 01:13:05,980
Did Karl May write me?

932
01:13:06,064 --> 01:13:07,148
Yes!

933
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:08,316
So who are you?!

934
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:11,152
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!

935
01:13:11,612 --> 01:13:12,695
Yes!

936
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:14,822
That was good! That was good! That was good!

937
01:13:15,032 --> 01:13:16,449
Now down with the glasses!

938
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,619
Cheers.

939
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:27,918
Attention!

940
01:13:35,093 --> 01:13:36,385
Hello, my lovelies.

941
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:38,095
Take a seat.

942
01:13:39,055 --> 01:13:42,683
I will join you in moments. I'm just saying
goodbye to my five new friends here.

943
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,936
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark. Take your time.

944
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:47,980
Enjoy yourself. We'll be just over here waiting.

945
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,699
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.

946
01:13:58,866 --> 01:14:00,576
Please treat them to anything they like.

947
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:03,537
Frau von Hammersmark. Your wish is my command.

948
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:06,206
Officers...

949
01:14:06,499 --> 01:14:08,125
...it would appear
the drinks are on the Fräulein.

950
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:09,793
What would you like?

951
01:14:09,877 --> 01:14:10,877
Whiskey.

952
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:12,087
Two whiskeys.

953
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,171
Three whiskeys.

954
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,339
Three whiskeys, very well.

955
01:14:16,509 --> 01:14:18,552
I wish you a wonderful evening.

956
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:20,554
Same to you.
- I thank you.

957
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:22,472
Your card!

958
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:23,890
Yes, you're right.

959
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:26,226
Let's see.

960
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:30,230
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.

961
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,607
But of course you would have!

962
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:32,899
Hello, darling.

963
01:14:35,278 --> 01:14:36,320
How are you?

964
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:40,532
So good to see you.

965
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:53,086
I thought this place was supposed to
have more French than Germans?

966
01:14:54,297 --> 01:14:56,298
Yes, normally that's true.

967
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:59,760
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.

968
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:05,599
And his commanding officer gave him
and his mates the night off to celebrate.

969
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,602
We should leave.

970
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,312
No.

971
01:15:10,938 --> 01:15:11,980
We should stay.

972
01:15:12,273 --> 01:15:13,607
For one drink at least.

973
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,859
I've been waiting for you in a bar.

974
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:19,154
It would look strange if
we left before we had a drink.

975
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:22,449
She's right. Just be calm
and enjoy your whiskey.

976
01:15:23,498 --> 01:15:24,499
Mmm.

977
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:29,748
Mathilda...

978
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:31,792
...come join us in the game.
Take Frau Hammersmark's place.

979
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:42,844
She would love to play the game.

980
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:47,474
I will translate... and protect.

981
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:48,809
Don't worry, pretty little thing.

982
01:15:48,976 --> 01:15:53,313
If any of these wolves gets
out of line, I'll kick their ass in.

983
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:54,564
Watch.

984
01:15:56,984 --> 01:15:58,026
Rip off his nose.

985
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:06,743
Stop it!

986
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:09,162
Schnapps, schnapps, take your
schnapps in hand, comrades.

987
01:16:09,997 --> 01:16:11,081
Before we go on playing...

988
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:12,708
...we will drink.

989
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,877
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.

990
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:18,839
And his little boy...

991
01:16:19,799 --> 01:16:20,841
...Maximilian.

992
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:23,176
To Max!
- To Max!

993
01:16:24,178 --> 01:16:25,470
There's some new development.

994
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:27,681
The cinema venue has changed.

995
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:29,182
Why?

996
01:16:29,267 --> 01:16:31,226
No one knows but that should
not be a real problem.

997
01:16:31,894 --> 01:16:34,813
The cinema it's been changed to
is considerably smaller than The Ritz.

998
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:39,151
So whatever explosives you brought for
The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

999
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,197
Now the next piece of information...

1000
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:45,741
...is colossal.

1001
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,325
Try not to overreact.

1002
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:50,746
The Führer-

1003
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:54,708
...I was just thinking...

1004
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:58,378
...could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?

1005
01:17:00,298 --> 01:17:02,549
Of course. I'd love to, Wilhelm.

1006
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:07,053
This handsome Staff Sergeant
just became a father today.

1007
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:08,472
Congratulations.

1008
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:11,099
Thank you.

1009
01:17:11,184 --> 01:17:12,851
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?

1010
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:18,690
I most certainly do,
Fräulein. His name is Maximilian.

1011
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:20,692
Maximilian, wonderful name.

1012
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,446
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1013
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:29,701
Nothing but the best
for little Maximilian.

1014
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:39,836
Max may not know who you are now but...

1015
01:17:41,088 --> 01:17:43,256
...he will. I will show him
all of your movies.

1016
01:17:43,716 --> 01:17:44,758
Good.

1017
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:46,885
He will grow up with your films and...

1018
01:17:49,555 --> 01:17:51,431
...this napkin on his wall.

1019
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:57,437
I propose a toast to
the greatest actress in Germany!

1020
01:17:57,647 --> 01:18:02,067
There is no Dietrich! There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!

1021
01:18:03,569 --> 01:18:04,736
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1022
01:18:05,404 --> 01:18:06,446
Cheers!

1023
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:12,911
Once again-

1024
01:18:15,748 --> 01:18:19,459
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?

1025
01:18:21,003 --> 01:18:22,754
None of your business!

1026
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,923
Staff Sergeant.

1027
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:33,473
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the Fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior...

1028
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:35,600
...but you have worn out your welcome with me.

1029
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:41,356
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant,
you are an enlisted man.

1030
01:18:41,607 --> 01:18:43,275
This is an officer's table!

1031
01:18:45,778 --> 01:18:49,197
I suggest you stop pestering the Fräulein...

1032
01:18:49,949 --> 01:18:51,783
...and rejoin your table.

1033
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:02,460
Excuse me, Captain,
but your accent is very unusual.

1034
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:06,631
Where are you from?

1035
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:12,888
You must be either completely
drunk or mad to dare...

1036
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:15,473
...to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinentness!

1037
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:17,142
Staff Sergeant.

1038
01:19:18,644 --> 01:19:20,312
I'm making you and you responsible for him.

1039
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:21,688
I suggest you take hold of your friend...

1040
01:19:21,814 --> 01:19:25,901
...or he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness.

1041
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:26,067
Might I inquire?

1042
01:19:26,068 --> 01:19:27,861
Might I inquire?

1043
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:01,478
Like our young newly christened father here...

1044
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:05,065
...l, too, have an acute ear for accents.

1045
01:20:08,694 --> 01:20:09,736
And like him...

1046
01:20:10,863 --> 01:20:12,280
...l, too, find yours odd.

1047
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:15,825
From where do you hail, Captain?

1048
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:17,452
Major, this is highly-

1049
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:19,746
I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.

1050
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:23,708
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.

1051
01:20:25,628 --> 01:20:30,340
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.

1052
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:39,224
I was born in a village that rests
in the shadow of the Piz Palü.

1053
01:20:39,558 --> 01:20:40,642
The mountain?

1054
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:41,726
Yes.

1055
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:43,895
In that village, we all speak like this.

1056
01:20:45,564 --> 01:20:47,774
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

1057
01:20:48,192 --> 01:20:49,192
Yes.

1058
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:50,610
Then you saw me.

1059
01:20:52,363 --> 01:20:55,407
You remember the skiing torch scene?

1060
01:20:57,243 --> 01:20:58,284
Yes.

1061
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:04,916
In that scene was myself, my father,
my sister and my two brothers.

1062
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,253
My brother is so handsome...

1063
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:12,257
...the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.

1064
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:16,553
Herr Major, if my word means anything...

1065
01:21:17,263 --> 01:21:21,099
...I can vouch for everything
the young captain has just said.

1066
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:25,103
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.

1067
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:30,316
He was in the film and his brother is far more
handsome than he.

1068
01:21:40,786 --> 01:21:42,328
You should rejoin your friends.

1069
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:47,584
May I join you?

1070
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:48,752
By all means.

1071
01:21:49,879 --> 01:21:50,920
Wunderbar!

1072
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:01,806
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.

1073
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:04,350
That's extraordinary.

1074
01:22:05,061 --> 01:22:06,102
What are you doing here?

1075
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,481
Aside from having a drink
with the lovely Fräulein?

1076
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:13,109
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

1077
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,528
I mean in country.

1078
01:22:17,156 --> 01:22:19,949
You're obviously not stationed in
France or I'd know who you are.

1079
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:22,494
You know every German in France?

1080
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:24,412
Worth knowing.

1081
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:32,420
Well, there lies the problem.

1082
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,714
We never claimed to be worth knowing.

1083
01:22:35,966 --> 01:22:37,634
All levity aside,
what are you doing in France?

1084
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:42,305
Attending Minister Goebbels' film
premiere as the Fräulein's escort.

1085
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:47,102
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.

1086
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,106
Someone has to carry her lighter.

1087
01:22:57,029 --> 01:23:00,406
The captain is my date,
but all three are my guests.

1088
01:23:01,283 --> 01:23:02,659
We are old friends...

1089
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:04,744
...who go back a long time.

1090
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:10,500
Actually, longer than an actress
would care to admit.

1091
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:15,004
Well, in that case...

1092
01:23:15,214 --> 01:23:18,508
...let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

1093
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:20,593
I'll drink to that.

1094
01:23:24,181 --> 01:23:25,807
Queen Christina.

1095
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:31,980
Mata Hari.

1096
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:37,861
I must say...

1097
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,530
...that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun.

1098
01:23:41,073 --> 01:23:43,575
I didn't join them because
you're quite right, Captain.

1099
01:23:44,243 --> 01:23:46,411
An officer should not
fraternize with enlisted men.

1100
01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:49,080
But...

1101
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,291
...seeing as we are all officers...

1102
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:54,544
...and sophisticated lady
friends of officers.

1103
01:23:55,087 --> 01:23:56,129
What say we play the game?

1104
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,756
Yes, great, one game.

1105
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,049
Wunderbar.

1106
01:24:02,511 --> 01:24:03,595
Soldiers...

1107
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,263
...the cards.

1108
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,641
Thank you.

1109
01:24:10,644 --> 01:24:11,686
So gentlemen...

1110
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:14,939
...the object of the game is to...

1111
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,817
...write the name of a famous
person on your card.

1112
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:20,069
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.

1113
01:24:20,779 --> 01:24:22,989
For instance, you could write,
Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.

1114
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,449
Eric! More pens.

1115
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,618
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.

1116
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:29,621
When you finish writing,
put the card face down on the table.

1117
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:32,081
And move it to the person on your right-

1118
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,374
Thanks.

1119
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:35,501
the person to your left
moves his card to you.

1120
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,921
You pick up the card without looking at it...

1121
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:39,380
...lick the back...

1122
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:43,218
...and stick it on your forehead.

1123
01:24:57,524 --> 01:24:58,608
Write!

1124
01:24:58,692 --> 01:24:59,734
Write.

1125
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,715
I'll start, give you the idea.

1126
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:26,761
Am I German?

1127
01:25:27,054 --> 01:25:28,137
No.
- No.

1128
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:29,597
Am I American?

1129
01:25:29,765 --> 01:25:30,807
No.
- No.

1130
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:32,141
Wait a minute, he goes to... -

1131
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:35,937
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.

1132
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:39,065
So... I visited America, aye?

1133
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:40,358
Yes.

1134
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:43,736
Was this visit fortuitous?

1135
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:45,613
Not for you.

1136
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:51,744
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?

1137
01:25:51,829 --> 01:25:52,870
Yes.
- Yes.

1138
01:25:56,083 --> 01:26:00,962
That could be either a reference
to the jungle or the Orient.

1139
01:26:02,756 --> 01:26:05,425
I'm going to let my first instinct
take over and ask. Am I from the jungle?

1140
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:06,634
Yes.
- Yes.

1141
01:26:06,927 --> 01:26:10,179
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask whether you're real or fictitious.

1142
01:26:10,764 --> 01:26:13,266
I, however, think that's too easy,
so I won't ask that yet.

1143
01:26:13,892 --> 01:26:14,976
Okay...

1144
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,312
...my native land is the jungle...

1145
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:19,605
...I visited America...

1146
01:26:20,774 --> 01:26:22,317
...but my visit was not fortuitous to me...

1147
01:26:23,235 --> 01:26:26,779
...but the implication is
that it was to somebody else.

1148
01:26:31,952 --> 01:26:32,994
When I went...

1149
01:26:34,788 --> 01:26:36,622
...from the jungle to America...

1150
01:26:39,752 --> 01:26:40,793
...did I go by boat?

1151
01:26:40,878 --> 01:26:41,919
Yes.
- Yes.

1152
01:26:43,797 --> 01:26:45,256
Did I go against my will?

1153
01:26:45,341 --> 01:26:46,382
Yes.
- Yes.

1154
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:52,221
On this boat ride, was I in chains?

1155
01:26:52,514 --> 01:26:53,556
Yes.

1156
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:56,225
When I arrived in America,
was I displayed in chains?

1157
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,352
Yes.
- Yes.

1158
01:26:57,436 --> 01:26:58,978
Am I the story of the Negro in America?

1159
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,104
No.

1160
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:02,065
Well then I must be King Kong.

1161
01:27:04,735 --> 01:27:05,777
Bravo!

1162
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:07,362
lmpressive.

1163
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:11,616
Now, since I answered correctly, you
all need to finish your drinks.

1164
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:13,493
Cheers.

1165
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:19,957
Now, who is next?

1166
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:21,959
Well, Major...

1167
01:27:23,587 --> 01:27:29,175
...I don't mean to be rude. But
the four of us are very good friends.

1168
01:27:30,302 --> 01:27:32,011
And we haven't seen
each other in quite a while.

1169
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:35,681
So, Major...

1170
01:27:36,266 --> 01:27:37,433
...I am afraid...

1171
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:39,769
...you are intruding.

1172
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:43,856
I beg to differ, Captain.

1173
01:27:45,609 --> 01:27:50,613
It's only if the Fräulein considers
my presence an intrusion...

1174
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:53,116
...that I become an intruder.

1175
01:27:58,497 --> 01:28:00,289
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?

1176
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:02,708
I didn't think so.

1177
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:08,047
It's simply the captain
is immune to my charms.

1178
01:28:23,147 --> 01:28:24,480
I am just joking.

1179
01:28:25,524 --> 01:28:29,152
Just joking. Of course I'm intruding.

1180
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:33,489
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen,
and I will bid you and the Fräulein adieu.

1181
01:28:34,324 --> 01:28:37,034
Eric has a bottle of
thirty-three-year-old whiskey.

1182
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:38,327
From the Scottish Highlands.

1183
01:28:39,371 --> 01:28:40,496
What do you say, gentlemen?

1184
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,249
You're most gracious, Major.

1185
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:46,169
Eric! The thirty-three. And new glasses!

1186
01:28:46,753 --> 01:28:49,797
You don't want to contaminate the
thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

1187
01:28:49,882 --> 01:28:50,923
How many glasses?

1188
01:28:51,008 --> 01:28:51,716
Five.

1189
01:28:51,758 --> 01:28:52,592
Not for me.

1190
01:28:52,676 --> 01:28:54,177
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.

1191
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,012
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.

1192
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,014
Three glasses.

1193
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:35,259
Frau von Hammersmark.

1194
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,261
Thank you.

1195
01:29:39,973 --> 01:29:42,767
A thousand year German Reich!

1196
01:29:43,143 --> 01:29:44,644
A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!

1197
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,614
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.

1198
01:30:00,035 --> 01:30:01,118
Did you hear that?

1199
01:30:03,205 --> 01:30:04,997
That was the sound of my Walther.

1200
01:30:05,707 --> 01:30:07,458
Pointed right at your testicles.

1201
01:30:11,004 --> 01:30:13,464
Why do you have your
Walther pointed at my testicles?

1202
01:30:14,967 --> 01:30:17,802
Because you've just given
yourself away, Captain.

1203
01:30:18,971 --> 01:30:21,055
You're no more German than that scotch.

1204
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:31,524
Well, Major.

1205
01:30:31,608 --> 01:30:32,650
Shut up slut.

1206
01:30:33,652 --> 01:30:34,694
You were saying?

1207
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:42,785
I was saying that makes two of us.

1208
01:30:44,037 --> 01:30:47,164
I've had a gun pointed at your
balls since you sat down.

1209
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:50,835
That makes three of us.

1210
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:55,006
And at this range,
I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.

1211
01:30:56,842 --> 01:30:59,218
Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.

1212
01:31:00,178 --> 01:31:03,389
What's going to happen, Major...

1213
01:31:04,516 --> 01:31:07,184
...you're going to stand up
and walk out that door with us.

1214
01:31:07,352 --> 01:31:08,352
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1215
01:31:08,437 --> 01:31:09,729
I don't think so.

1216
01:31:10,022 --> 01:31:11,188
I'm afraid you and I...

1217
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:13,524
...we both know, Captain...

1218
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:17,194
...no matter what happens to anybody else
in this room...

1219
01:31:17,613 --> 01:31:20,197
...the two of us aren't going anywhere.

1220
01:31:23,076 --> 01:31:27,705
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm
and his famous friends.

1221
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:32,209
If any of you expect to live,
you'll have to shoot them too.

1222
01:31:33,712 --> 01:31:36,839
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.

1223
01:31:38,133 --> 01:31:39,508
How sad.

1224
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:48,066
Well, if this is it,
old boy,

1225
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:51,653
I hope you don't mind if I
go out speaking the King's.

1226
01:31:52,779 --> 01:31:54,697
By all means,
Captain.

1227
01:32:00,745 --> 01:32:04,374
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good Scotch.

1228
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:08,586
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

1229
01:32:13,675 --> 01:32:17,303
I must say,
damn good stuff, sir.

1230
01:32:20,598 --> 01:32:23,434
Now, about this pickle

1231
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:26,813
we find ourselves in.

1232
01:32:29,232 --> 01:32:32,318
It would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

1233
01:32:32,402 --> 01:32:34,279
And what would that be?

1234
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:35,989
Stiglitz.

1235
01:32:36,072 --> 01:32:37,490
Say auf Wiedersehen
to your Nazi balls.

1236
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:15,987
You outside.
Who are you?

1237
01:33:16,571 --> 01:33:18,239
British? American?

1238
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,116
What?

1239
01:33:20,908 --> 01:33:22,452
We're American.

1240
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:24,203
What are you?

1241
01:33:24,537 --> 01:33:26,497
I'm a German, you idiot.

1242
01:33:26,831 --> 01:33:29,542
Speak English
pretty good for a German.

1243
01:33:29,626 --> 01:33:30,835
I agree.

1244
01:33:32,128 --> 01:33:33,630
So let's talk.

1245
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:35,757
Okay, talk.

1246
01:33:36,466 --> 01:33:37,925
I'm a father.

1247
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:42,096
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.

1248
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:44,140
Five hours ago.

1249
01:33:44,766 --> 01:33:49,020
H is name is Max. We were in
here drinking, celebrating.

1250
01:33:49,854 --> 01:33:53,274
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. It's not my fault!

1251
01:33:53,358 --> 01:33:55,485
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.

1252
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:58,655
What's your name,
soldier?

1253
01:33:58,738 --> 01:33:59,989
Wilhelm.

1254
01:34:00,865 --> 01:34:04,410
Now, is there anybody alive
on our side?

1255
01:34:04,494 --> 01:34:06,287
No.
I'm alive!

1256
01:34:08,498 --> 01:34:09,874
Who's that?

1257
01:34:12,669 --> 01:34:14,671
Is the girl
on your side?

1258
01:34:16,214 --> 01:34:17,465
Which girl?

1259
01:34:17,548 --> 01:34:19,968
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.

1260
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:23,179
Yeah, she's ours.

1261
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:25,264
Is she okay?

1262
01:34:28,267 --> 01:34:29,310
Wilhelm!

1263
01:34:30,561 --> 01:34:32,188
She's been shot.

1264
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:34,774
But she's alive.

1265
01:34:38,695 --> 01:34:40,196
Okay, Wilhelm.

1266
01:34:41,197 --> 01:34:43,616
What do you say
we make us a deal?

1267
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:46,327
What's your name?

1268
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:47,537
Aldo.

1269
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:50,665
Okay, Wilhelm,
here's my deal.

1270
01:34:50,915 --> 01:34:54,544
You let me and one of my men come
down there and take the girl away.

1271
01:34:54,627 --> 01:34:57,171
No guns. No guns me,
no guns you.

1272
01:34:57,255 --> 01:35:00,800
And we take the girl and
leave. It's that simple, Willi.

1273
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:03,636
You go your way,
we go ours.

1274
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,597
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

1275
01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:10,685
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?

1276
01:35:15,106 --> 01:35:16,190
Aldo.

1277
01:35:17,442 --> 01:35:19,068
I'm here, Willi.

1278
01:35:20,695 --> 01:35:22,447
I want to trust you.

1279
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,698
But...

1280
01:35:24,616 --> 01:35:26,117
But how can I?

1281
01:35:28,328 --> 01:35:30,330
What choice you got,
son?

1282
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,254
Okay, okay.

1283
01:35:39,839 --> 01:35:41,049
Aldo,

1284
01:35:42,133 --> 01:35:43,760
I'm going to trust you.

1285
01:35:44,636 --> 01:35:45,637
Come down.

1286
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:04,572
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine
gun? I thought we had us a deal?

1287
01:36:04,656 --> 01:36:06,908
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

1288
01:36:06,991 --> 01:36:08,534
Not so fast.

1289
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:11,204
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.

1290
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:12,997
And a Mexican standoff
ain't trust.

1291
01:36:13,498 --> 01:36:16,000
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.

1292
01:36:16,668 --> 01:36:19,796
You got guns on us. You
decide to shoot, we're dead.

1293
01:36:19,879 --> 01:36:23,174
U p top, they got grenades. They
drop them down here, you're dead.

1294
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:25,635
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

1295
01:36:25,718 --> 01:36:27,387
No trust,
no deal.

1296
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:44,862
All right, Aldo.

1297
01:36:46,531 --> 01:36:47,657
Fine.

1298
01:36:51,035 --> 01:36:54,455
J ust take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

1299
01:37:06,551 --> 01:37:09,971
Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell
him to go play with his dogs.

1300
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:26,070
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.

1301
01:37:26,154 --> 01:37:27,947
Few questions
about what?

1302
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:30,617
About I got three men
dead back there.

1303
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,494
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

1304
01:37:33,578 --> 01:37:37,540
The British officer blew his German
act and the Gestapo major saw it.

1305
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,877
Before we get into
who shot John,

1306
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:45,840
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

1307
01:37:50,762 --> 01:37:53,181
I can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,

1308
01:37:53,264 --> 01:37:55,934
that the Nazis being there
must look odd.

1309
01:37:56,017 --> 01:37:58,519
Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.

1310
01:37:58,603 --> 01:38:00,605
It's called suspicious.

1311
01:38:04,901 --> 01:38:06,694
Everybody needs
to calm down.

1312
01:38:06,778 --> 01:38:09,447
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

1313
01:38:10,823 --> 01:38:13,785
You met the sergeant
yourself. Willi.

1314
01:38:13,868 --> 01:38:15,703
You remember him,
don't you?

1315
01:38:15,787 --> 01:38:16,788
Yeah, I remember him.

1316
01:38:16,871 --> 01:38:20,625
H is wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

1317
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,418
He had just become
a father!

1318
01:38:22,502 --> 01:38:26,339
H is commanding officer gave him and
his mates the night off to celebrate.

1319
01:38:29,717 --> 01:38:35,574
The Germans being there was either a
trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

1320
01:38:36,057 --> 01:38:37,809
It couldn't be both.

1321
01:38:48,027 --> 01:38:49,904
How'd the shooting start?

1322
01:38:49,988 --> 01:38:52,490
The Englishman
gave himself away.

1323
01:38:52,573 --> 01:38:54,200
How'd he do that?

1324
01:38:55,451 --> 01:38:57,662
He ordered three glasses.

1325
01:38:58,871 --> 01:39:00,790
We order three glasses.

1326
01:39:00,999 --> 01:39:02,959
That's the German three.

1327
01:39:03,835 --> 01:39:05,628
The other looks odd.

1328
01:39:06,212 --> 01:39:08,548
Germans would
and did notice it.

1329
01:39:17,181 --> 01:39:19,267
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

1330
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,936
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

1331
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,938
What was the next step?

1332
01:39:24,188 --> 01:39:25,398
Tuxedos.

1333
01:39:26,065 --> 01:39:28,818
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

1334
01:39:28,901 --> 01:39:31,696
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

1335
01:39:33,698 --> 01:39:36,951
But going as members
of the German film industry,

1336
01:39:37,368 --> 01:39:40,538
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.

1337
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,209
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

1338
01:39:46,419 --> 01:39:48,838
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?

1339
01:39:48,921 --> 01:39:50,548
Hand me my purse.

1340
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:02,852
Lieutenant Hicox
was going as my escort.

1341
01:40:04,187 --> 01:40:08,191
The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.

1342
01:40:09,317 --> 01:40:10,985
You still get us
in that premiere?

1343
01:40:11,069 --> 01:40:14,238
You speak German better
than your friends? No.

1344
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:16,866
Have I been shot? Yes!

1345
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:22,246
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.

1346
01:40:23,247 --> 01:40:25,667
Least of all,
by tomorrow night.

1347
01:40:38,554 --> 01:40:41,849
However, there's something
you don't know.

1348
01:40:43,935 --> 01:40:48,022
There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.

1349
01:40:49,816 --> 01:40:54,904
One, the venue has been changed from
The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1350
01:40:55,446 --> 01:40:58,616
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.

1351
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,661
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

1352
01:41:01,744 --> 01:41:05,456
It probably has something to
do with the second development.

1353
01:41:05,832 --> 01:41:07,125
Which is?

1354
01:41:11,421 --> 01:41:14,007
Der Führer is attending
the premiere.

1355
01:41:14,876 --> 01:41:16,126
I've been rethinking my position...

1356
01:41:17,837 --> 01:41:24,468
...in regards to your
Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."

1357
01:41:26,012 --> 01:41:27,846
As the weeks have gone on...

1358
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:31,350
...and the Americans are on the beach...

1359
01:41:32,852 --> 01:41:35,354
...I do find myself thinking more and more...

1360
01:41:36,147 --> 01:41:37,481
...about this Private Zoller.

1361
01:41:38,816 --> 01:41:40,943
This boy has done something tremendous for us.

1362
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:43,987
And I'm beginning to think...

1363
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:48,200
...my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

1364
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,376
Fuck a duck!

1365
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:00,887
What are you thinking?

1366
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,349
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old U ncle Adolf

1367
01:42:04,432 --> 01:42:06,309
makes this horse
a different color.

1368
01:42:06,392 --> 01:42:08,061
What is that
supposed to mean?

1369
01:42:08,144 --> 01:42:10,063
It means you getting us
in that premiere.

1370
01:42:10,146 --> 01:42:13,066
I'm probably going
to end up losing this leg.

1371
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:16,069
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.

1372
01:42:16,152 --> 01:42:19,030
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

1373
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,202
Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.

1374
01:42:24,285 --> 01:42:26,329
He's going to wrap it up
in a cast,

1375
01:42:26,412 --> 01:42:28,539
and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

1376
01:42:28,623 --> 01:42:31,292
That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?

1377
01:42:31,376 --> 01:42:34,671
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

1378
01:42:34,754 --> 01:42:36,547
But I see your point.

1379
01:42:36,798 --> 01:42:40,301
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

1380
01:42:40,385 --> 01:42:43,680
and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.

1381
01:42:45,181 --> 01:42:48,434
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,

1382
01:42:48,518 --> 01:42:53,898
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

1383
01:42:54,732 --> 01:42:56,985
We both speak
a little Italian.

1384
01:42:57,068 --> 01:42:59,570
With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.

1385
01:43:01,322 --> 01:43:04,784
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

1386
01:43:05,576 --> 01:43:08,413
Germans don't have
a good ear for Italian.

1387
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:16,170
So you mumble Italian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?

1388
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:18,047
That's about it.

1389
01:43:21,884 --> 01:43:22,885
That sounds good.

1390
01:43:22,969 --> 01:43:25,346
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?

1391
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,265
No, that sounds good.

1392
01:43:28,099 --> 01:43:32,020
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

1393
01:43:33,021 --> 01:43:34,063
Who does what?

1394
01:43:34,147 --> 01:43:38,318
Well, I speak the most
Italian, so I'll be your escort.

1395
01:43:38,401 --> 01:43:41,529
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.

1396
01:43:41,613 --> 01:43:44,616
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.

1397
01:43:45,158 --> 01:43:46,284
I don't speak Italian.

1398
01:43:46,367 --> 01:43:49,746
Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1399
01:43:49,829 --> 01:43:51,372
In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?

1400
01:43:59,123 --> 01:44:00,957
You've moved up in the world.

1401
01:44:03,127 --> 01:44:05,128
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.

1402
01:44:06,464 --> 01:44:10,467
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

1403
01:44:15,973 --> 01:44:16,973
And that one's name is...

1404
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,141
...Wilhelm Wicki.

1405
01:44:18,935 --> 01:44:21,812
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who
immigrated to the United States...

1406
01:44:22,063 --> 01:44:24,981
...when things began turning sour
for the Israelites.

1407
01:44:25,108 --> 01:44:27,818
They are the two German-born
members of the Basterds.

1408
01:44:28,486 --> 01:44:32,322
They've been known to don German uniforms,
to ambush squads.

1409
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,741
What brings you all the way out here?

1410
01:44:40,998 --> 01:44:42,499
But that doesn't look like this.

1411
01:44:45,837 --> 01:44:46,920
This is odd.

1412
01:45:03,187 --> 01:45:04,438
It would appear somebody's missing.

1413
01:45:05,314 --> 01:45:06,690
Somebody fashionable.

1414
01:45:08,526 --> 01:45:09,526
Everybody out!

1415
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:26,209
"To Max, with love."

1416
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:32,924
Bridget von Hammersmark.

1417
01:47:19,031 --> 01:47:20,323
Remember... in English.

1418
01:47:20,748 --> 01:47:21,749
Yes.

1419
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:23,827
Action.

1420
01:47:24,203 --> 01:47:25,370
But how do we get it developed?

1421
01:47:26,664 --> 01:47:29,207
Only a suicidal idiot like
us would develop that footage.

1422
01:47:30,042 --> 01:47:32,043
And suppose someone
would develop the footage...

1423
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:34,337
...how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack?

1424
01:47:34,672 --> 01:47:38,174
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.

1425
01:47:38,926 --> 01:47:40,010
And we make them do it...

1426
01:47:40,678 --> 01:47:41,803
...or we kill them.

1427
01:47:45,683 --> 01:47:47,517
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.

1428
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,103
You either do what the fuck we tell you...

1429
01:47:50,187 --> 01:47:52,105
...or I'll bury this axe
in your collaborating skull.

1430
01:47:52,189 --> 01:47:53,273
I'm not a collaborator.

1431
01:47:53,357 --> 01:47:55,525
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?

1432
01:47:55,651 --> 01:47:56,693
Yes.

1433
01:47:56,777 --> 01:47:59,195
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans...

1434
01:47:59,363 --> 01:48:01,114
...we'll go and silence them.

1435
01:49:41,132 --> 01:49:42,424
Jannings, come on, show the ring.

1436
01:49:43,008 --> 01:49:44,300
Come on, come on. There you go!

1437
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:49,264
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.

1438
01:49:49,348 --> 01:49:52,475
Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!

1439
01:49:52,643 --> 01:49:55,979
But I believe after the premiere today,
we have a new candidate.

1440
01:50:17,168 --> 01:50:18,293
Ah, Emmanuelle...

1441
01:50:19,336 --> 01:50:23,047
...l'd like you to meet the
greatest actor in the world...

1442
01:50:23,549 --> 01:50:24,632
...Emil Jannings.

1443
01:50:25,009 --> 01:50:28,511
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.

1444
01:50:28,971 --> 01:50:30,054
You have a beautiful cinema.

1445
01:50:42,485 --> 01:50:43,526
Thank you, Hermann.

1446
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,512
Fräulein von Hammersmark.

1447
01:51:15,059 --> 01:51:16,726
Colonel Landa, it's been years.

1448
01:51:17,728 --> 01:51:19,687
Dashing as ever, I see.

1449
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:24,609
So what's happened to your lovely leg?

1450
01:51:25,402 --> 01:51:29,864
A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

1451
01:51:30,533 --> 01:51:32,575
Save your flattery, you old dog.

1452
01:51:33,077 --> 01:51:37,705
I know too many of your former conquests
to fall into that honey pot.

1453
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:39,249
Seriously, what happened?

1454
01:51:40,417 --> 01:51:43,878
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add...

1455
01:51:45,256 --> 01:51:46,756
...at mountain climbing.

1456
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:49,133
And this is the result.

1457
01:51:49,385 --> 01:51:50,385
Mountain climbing?

1458
01:51:50,469 --> 01:51:52,595
That's how you injured your leg
- mountain climbing?

1459
01:51:52,721 --> 01:51:54,305
Believe it or not, yes it is.

1460
01:52:18,122 --> 01:52:21,583
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don't mean to
laugh at your misfortune.

1461
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:23,459
It's just... - mountain climbing?

1462
01:52:24,837 --> 01:52:29,799
I'm curious, Fräulein, what could have ever compelled
you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

1463
01:52:32,803 --> 01:52:35,013
Well, I shan't be doing it again,
I can tell you that.

1464
01:52:36,974 --> 01:52:38,850
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.

1465
01:52:39,518 --> 01:52:42,103
When were you climbing this mountain,
last night?

1466
01:52:43,647 --> 01:52:44,981
Very good eye, Colonel.

1467
01:52:45,983 --> 01:52:47,650
It happened yesterday morning.

1468
01:52:48,193 --> 01:52:50,028
And where in Paris is this mountain?

1469
01:52:53,866 --> 01:52:56,326
No, I'm just teasing you, Fräulein.

1470
01:52:56,535 --> 01:52:59,287
You know me, I tease rough.

1471
01:52:59,496 --> 01:53:01,039
So, who are your three
handsome escorts?

1472
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,502
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.

1473
01:53:07,171 --> 01:53:08,963
They're friends of mine from Italy.

1474
01:53:10,049 --> 01:53:15,219
This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.

1475
01:53:16,889 --> 01:53:19,974
A very talented cameraman,
Antonio Margheriti.

1476
01:53:21,352 --> 01:53:24,479
And Antonio's camera assistant
Dominick Decocco.

1477
01:53:26,357 --> 01:53:31,861
Gentlemen, this is an old friend,
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

1478
01:53:33,197 --> 01:53:34,238
Hello.

1479
01:53:34,907 --> 01:53:36,866
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure...

1480
01:53:37,201 --> 01:53:41,079
...the friends of our cherished star, admired
by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture...

1481
01:53:41,497 --> 01:53:45,500
...are naturally going to be under my personal
protection for the duration of their stay.

1482
01:53:49,046 --> 01:53:50,088
Thank you.

1483
01:53:51,014 --> 01:53:52,549
Gorlomi?

1484
01:53:52,549 --> 01:53:52,813
Am I saying it correctly?
Gorlomi?

1485
01:53:52,813 --> 01:53:53,883
Am I saying it correctly?

1486
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,928
Yes - 'er, correct.

1487
01:53:59,264 --> 01:54:01,391
Say it for me once please?

1488
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,728
Gorlomi.

1489
01:54:04,728 --> 01:54:05,895
I'm sorry, again?
Gorlomi.

1490
01:54:05,895 --> 01:54:08,281
Gorlomi.

1491
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,857
Once more?

1492
01:54:12,785 --> 01:54:14,537
Gorlomi.

1493
01:54:14,738 --> 01:54:16,239
What's your name again?

1494
01:54:17,081 --> 01:54:18,916
Antonio Margheriti.

1495
01:54:20,285 --> 01:54:21,369
Again?

1496
01:54:21,461 --> 01:54:23,178
Margheriti.

1497
01:54:23,372 --> 01:54:27,125
One more time, but let me
really hear the music in it!

1498
01:54:30,595 --> 01:54:31,930
Margheriti.

1499
01:54:32,297 --> 01:54:33,097
And you?

1500
01:54:33,097 --> 01:54:33,381
And you?
Dominick Decocco.

1501
01:54:33,381 --> 01:54:34,098
Dominick Decocco.

1502
01:54:34,223 --> 01:54:36,601
Dominick Decocco.

1503
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:40,596
Well, my two cameraman friends
need to find their seats.

1504
01:54:41,306 --> 01:54:43,599
Let me see your tickets.

1505
01:54:45,978 --> 01:54:50,148
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your
friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing...

1506
01:54:50,274 --> 01:54:51,733
...for a star of your status.

1507
01:54:52,443 --> 01:54:56,154
0023 and 0024.

1508
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:59,449
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.

1509
01:56:19,905 --> 01:56:22,240
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.

1510
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:38,881
I have to go down and socialize
with these Hun pigs.

1511
01:56:39,716 --> 01:56:40,925
Let's go over it again.

1512
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:44,428
Reel one is on the first projector.

1513
01:56:45,556 --> 01:56:46,597
Reel two...

1514
01:56:46,723 --> 01:56:47,723
...is on the second.

1515
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,017
The third one is on the spool.

1516
01:56:52,396 --> 01:56:54,564
And the fourth one is ready to go.

1517
01:56:57,359 --> 01:56:58,943
Okay, the big sniper battle
in the film...

1518
01:56:59,278 --> 01:57:01,571
...begins around the middle
of the third reel.

1519
01:57:02,406 --> 01:57:04,448
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.

1520
01:57:05,242 --> 01:57:07,118
Somewhere towards the end
of the third reel...

1521
01:57:07,244 --> 01:57:08,786
...go down and lock the doors
of the auditorium.

1522
01:57:09,413 --> 01:57:11,747
Then take your place behind the
screen and wait for my cue.

1523
01:57:14,334 --> 01:57:15,793
Then burn it down.

1524
01:57:27,598 --> 01:57:28,598
Take your seats.

1525
01:57:28,682 --> 01:57:30,600
The show is about to begin.

1526
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:34,312
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.

1527
01:57:35,272 --> 01:57:36,272
We'll see you later.

1528
01:57:36,356 --> 01:57:37,440
Not so fast.

1529
01:57:38,609 --> 01:57:39,775
A glass of champagne...

1530
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,862
...to toast "Nation's Pride."

1531
01:57:50,495 --> 01:57:53,289
My Fräulein, may I have a word
with you in private?

1532
01:57:55,167 --> 01:57:56,292
Certainly.

1533
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:57,501
Excuse us.

1534
01:58:10,182 --> 01:58:11,641
Have a seat, my Fräulein.

1535
01:58:16,563 --> 01:58:17,647
May I?

1536
01:58:24,655 --> 01:58:26,239
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me...

1537
01:58:26,323 --> 01:58:28,741
...to set up camp in her office
for the time being.

1538
01:58:37,709 --> 01:58:39,168
Let me see your foot.

1539
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:41,504
I beg your pardon?

1540
01:58:42,506 --> 01:58:43,923
Put your foot in my lap.

1541
01:58:49,179 --> 01:58:50,930
Hans, you embarrass me.

1542
01:59:22,212 --> 01:59:27,049
Could you please reach into
the right pocket of my coat...

1543
01:59:27,426 --> 01:59:28,926
...and give me what you find in there.

1544
02:00:03,754 --> 02:00:04,795
May I?

1545
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:25,783
What's that
American expression?

1546
02:00:25,867 --> 02:00:28,286
"If the shoe fits,
you must wear it. "

1547
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:35,493
What now, Colonel?

1548
02:01:26,753 --> 02:01:28,087
The guy in the white smoking jacket.

1549
02:01:31,766 --> 02:01:36,354
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

1550
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:38,481
Bunch of shithead fuck.

1551
02:01:41,401 --> 02:01:42,944
Fuck you, too!

1552
02:01:45,571 --> 02:01:49,701
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of
bitches! Get your hands off me.

1553
02:01:50,201 --> 02:01:53,705
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you! Get off!

1554
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,336
Hmm.

1555
02:02:00,537 --> 02:02:01,787
Clever.

1556
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,709
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1557
02:02:06,877 --> 02:02:08,210
He should arrive any minute.

1558
02:02:09,546 --> 02:02:10,588
Thank you, Hans.

1559
02:02:12,265 --> 02:02:13,600
You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...

1560
02:02:13,758 --> 02:02:14,800
Let go.

1561
02:02:17,854 --> 02:02:20,148
As Stanley said
to Livingstone,

1562
02:02:20,231 --> 02:02:22,400
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,
I presume?

1563
02:02:23,318 --> 02:02:24,694
Hans Landa.

1564
02:02:26,863 --> 02:02:29,240
You've had
a nice long run, Aldo.

1565
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:32,994
Alas, you're now
in the hands of the SS.

1566
02:02:33,077 --> 02:02:34,621
My hands to be exact.

1567
02:02:34,704 --> 02:02:38,416
And they've been waiting
a long time to touch you.

1568
02:02:42,295 --> 02:02:44,088
Caught you flinching.

1569
02:02:48,301 --> 02:02:50,511
Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

1570
02:03:06,361 --> 02:03:07,362
Utivich?

1571
02:03:07,445 --> 02:03:08,863
Is that you,
Lieutenant?

1572
02:03:08,947 --> 02:03:10,031
Yeah.

1573
02:03:10,615 --> 02:03:12,700
Do you know
what happened to Donny?

1574
02:03:12,784 --> 02:03:13,910
Omar?

1575
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:15,620
The woman?

1576
02:03:15,703 --> 02:03:16,955
No, I do not.

1577
02:04:03,501 --> 02:04:07,046
Tell me, Aldo, if I were
sitting where you're sitting,

1578
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,090
would you
show me mercy?

1579
02:04:13,678 --> 02:04:14,804
Nope.

1580
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:18,725
What is that English
expression about shoes and feet?

1581
02:04:18,808 --> 02:04:22,353
"Looks like the shoe is on the other
foot. " Yeah, I was just thinking that.

1582
02:04:22,596 --> 02:04:23,679
You may leave us.

1583
02:04:25,223 --> 02:04:26,265
But stay alert outside.

1584
02:04:35,408 --> 02:04:38,286
So you're Aldo the Apache.

1585
02:04:39,412 --> 02:04:40,622
So you're The Jew Hunter.

1586
02:04:40,705 --> 02:04:42,415
I'm a detective.

1587
02:04:42,498 --> 02:04:44,375
A damn good detective.

1588
02:04:44,709 --> 02:04:46,294
Finding people
is my specialty,

1589
02:04:46,377 --> 02:04:48,796
so naturally, I worked for
the Nazis finding people.

1590
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,008
And, yes, some of them
were Jews. But Jew Hunter?

1591
02:04:53,343 --> 02:04:55,219
J ust a name that stuck.

1592
02:04:55,678 --> 02:04:58,473
Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.

1593
02:04:59,933 --> 02:05:03,102
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

1594
02:05:03,186 --> 02:05:05,688
Aldo the Apache
and the Little Man?

1595
02:05:06,773 --> 02:05:08,900
What do you mean
the Little Man?

1596
02:05:08,983 --> 02:05:10,777
Germans' nickname for you.

1597
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:13,905
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

1598
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:18,826
And as if to make my point, I'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.

1599
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:21,329
I mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

1600
02:05:21,412 --> 02:05:23,206
as your reputation
would suggest.

1601
02:05:23,289 --> 02:05:24,832
Where's my men?

1602
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:27,710
Where's
Bridget von Hammersmark?

1603
02:05:30,588 --> 02:05:33,758
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.

1604
02:05:36,261 --> 02:05:38,763
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,

1605
02:05:38,846 --> 02:05:40,848
you get what you pay for.

1606
02:05:42,267 --> 02:05:47,272
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...

1607
02:05:47,355 --> 02:05:49,274
How you know our names?

1608
02:05:49,857 --> 02:05:51,442
Lieutenant Aldo,

1609
02:05:53,319 --> 02:05:54,737
if you don't think
I wouldn't interrogate

1610
02:05:54,821 --> 02:05:58,199
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

1611
02:06:00,618 --> 02:06:04,205
we simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.

1612
02:06:04,289 --> 02:06:05,873
No, I guess not.

1613
02:06:06,082 --> 02:06:11,212
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.

1614
02:06:14,382 --> 02:06:16,134
As of this moment,

1615
02:06:16,217 --> 02:06:21,055
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

1616
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:25,310
Double-zero 23 and double-zero
24, if my memory serves.

1617
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:29,480
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.

1618
02:06:29,564 --> 02:06:32,817
And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot,

1619
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,403
as of this moment,
is still a go.

1620
02:06:35,486 --> 02:06:38,823
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1621
02:06:38,906 --> 02:06:40,158
However,

1622
02:06:42,035 --> 02:06:45,163
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,

1623
02:06:45,246 --> 02:06:48,082
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

1624
02:06:50,501 --> 02:06:55,715
If they're still here, and if they're
still alive, and that's one big if,

1625
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:58,843
there ain't no way you're
going to take them boys

1626
02:06:58,927 --> 02:07:00,553
without setting off
them bombs.

1627
02:07:00,637 --> 02:07:02,388
I have no doubt.

1628
02:07:02,472 --> 02:07:05,767
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1629
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:08,770
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1630
02:07:08,853 --> 02:07:10,939
for what you've done
to his big night.

1631
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:14,484
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1632
02:07:14,567 --> 02:07:17,612
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

1633
02:07:17,695 --> 02:07:20,281
And you need all four
to end the war.

1634
02:07:21,950 --> 02:07:25,119
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

1635
02:07:25,203 --> 02:07:27,538
you may very well
get all four.

1636
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:33,628
And if you get all four,
you end the war

1637
02:07:34,879 --> 02:07:36,130
tonight.

1638
02:07:37,507 --> 02:07:39,050
So, gentlemen,

1639
02:07:39,759 --> 02:07:42,971
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1640
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:47,725
So, the way I see it,

1641
02:07:47,809 --> 02:07:52,021
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,

1642
02:07:52,689 --> 02:07:54,274
if I do nothing,

1643
02:07:54,691 --> 02:07:57,402
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.

1644
02:07:57,485 --> 02:07:58,736
Wouldn't you agree?

1645
02:07:59,404 --> 02:08:00,738
I guess so.

1646
02:08:03,324 --> 02:08:05,326
How about you,
Utivich?

1647
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:07,036
I guess so, too.

1648
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:13,835
Gentlemen,
I have no intention

1649
02:08:13,918 --> 02:08:17,005
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and
killing Goring and killing Bormann,

1650
02:08:17,088 --> 02:08:19,841
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1651
02:08:19,924 --> 02:08:23,678
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

1652
02:08:25,763 --> 02:08:29,309
If you want to win
the war tonight,

1653
02:08:30,935 --> 02:08:33,104
we have to make a deal.

1654
02:08:36,107 --> 02:08:37,859
What kind of deal?

1655
02:08:37,942 --> 02:08:40,486
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1656
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:45,116
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has
a commanding officer.

1657
02:08:46,117 --> 02:08:47,452
A general.

1658
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:49,787
I'm betting for...

1659
02:08:51,497 --> 02:08:53,416
OSS would be my guess.

1660
02:08:57,337 --> 02:08:59,797
That's a bingo!

1661
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,303
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo. "

1662
02:09:05,386 --> 02:09:07,263
You just say, "Bingo. "

1663
02:09:07,347 --> 02:09:09,599
Bingo! How fun.

1664
02:09:12,018 --> 02:09:15,104
But I digress. Where were we?
Yeah! Make a deal.

1665
02:09:15,647 --> 02:09:20,068
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

1666
02:09:20,151 --> 02:09:24,322
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

1667
02:09:24,656 --> 02:09:26,991
Get me someone on the other end
of that radio

1668
02:09:27,075 --> 02:09:30,119
with the power of the pen
to authorize my,

1669
02:09:30,203 --> 02:09:33,122
let's call it, the terms of my
conditional surrender.

1670
02:09:33,206 --> 02:09:35,625
If that tastes better
going down.

1671
02:09:36,417 --> 02:09:37,669
You know,
where I'm from...

1672
02:09:37,752 --> 02:09:39,629
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?

1673
02:09:39,712 --> 02:09:41,756
Maynardville,
Tennessee.

1674
02:09:41,839 --> 02:09:44,300
I've done my share
of bootlegging.

1675
02:09:44,509 --> 02:09:48,179
U p there, if you engage in what the federal
government calls illegal activity,

1676
02:09:48,263 --> 02:09:50,390
but what we call just a man trying to
make a living for his family

1677
02:09:50,473 --> 02:09:54,894
selling moonshine liquor, it behooves
oneself to keep his wits.

1678
02:09:56,854 --> 02:10:00,275
Long story short, we hear a story
too good to be true,

1679
02:10:00,942 --> 02:10:02,193
it ain't.

1680
02:10:04,028 --> 02:10:06,781
Sitting in your chair, I would probably
say the same thing,

1681
02:10:06,864 --> 02:10:11,577
and 999,999 times out of a million,
you would be correct.

1682
02:10:13,579 --> 02:10:17,166
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

1683
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:21,129
fate reaches out
and extends its hand.

1684
02:10:27,969 --> 02:10:29,929
What shall
the history books read?

1685
02:10:56,789 --> 02:11:00,001
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.

1686
02:11:01,419 --> 02:11:03,046
Sarge, that tower...

1687
02:11:22,607 --> 02:11:24,525
The tower stands!

1688
02:11:26,769 --> 02:11:27,811
Gum?

1689
02:11:31,658 --> 02:11:34,160
Psst! Psst!

1690
02:12:14,984 --> 02:12:16,068
It's time.

1691
02:12:17,862 --> 02:12:20,655
I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.

1692
02:14:04,269 --> 02:14:06,437
So when the military history
of this night is written,

1693
02:14:06,521 --> 02:14:10,191
it will be recorded that I was part
of Operation Kino

1694
02:14:10,275 --> 02:14:13,069
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

1695
02:14:13,152 --> 02:14:17,198
Anything I've done in my guise
as an SS Colonel

1696
02:14:17,282 --> 02:14:20,326
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

1697
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:23,121
to establish my cover
with the Germans.

1698
02:14:23,329 --> 02:14:26,624
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1699
02:14:26,708 --> 02:14:29,669
in Hitler and Goebbels'
opera box that assured their demise.

1700
02:14:30,703 --> 02:14:33,371
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1701
02:14:33,456 --> 02:14:34,831
He should arrive any minute.

1702
02:14:36,292 --> 02:14:37,292
Thank you, Hans.

1703
02:14:46,811 --> 02:14:49,814
By the way, that last part
is actually true.

1704
02:14:49,897 --> 02:14:54,819
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.

1705
02:14:55,153 --> 02:14:57,572
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor

1706
02:14:57,655 --> 02:15:01,618
for my invaluable assistance in the toppling
of the Third Reich.

1707
02:15:03,036 --> 02:15:06,122
In fact, I want all the members of
Operation Kino

1708
02:15:06,205 --> 02:15:09,167
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1709
02:15:09,542 --> 02:15:13,254
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

1710
02:15:13,546 --> 02:15:16,758
And I would like
the United States of America

1711
02:15:16,841 --> 02:15:20,929
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket Island

1712
02:15:21,012 --> 02:15:24,265
as a reward for all the countless lives
I've saved

1713
02:15:24,349 --> 02:15:26,684
by bringing the tyranny
of the National Socialist Party

1714
02:15:26,768 --> 02:15:30,396
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

1715
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:35,652
I look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

1716
02:15:36,527 --> 02:15:38,738
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.

1717
02:15:41,950 --> 02:15:43,159
Yes, sir.

1718
02:15:43,242 --> 02:15:46,996
Colonel Landa will put you and Private
Utivich in a truck as prisoners.

1719
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:51,459
Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.

1720
02:15:51,542 --> 02:15:56,130
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa
and his man will surrender to you.

1721
02:15:56,214 --> 02:15:58,758
You will then take over
driving of the truck

1722
02:15:58,841 --> 02:16:02,220
and bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

1723
02:16:02,303 --> 02:16:03,429
Yes, sir.

1724
02:16:03,513 --> 02:16:04,973
Over and out.

1725
02:16:29,488 --> 02:16:32,824
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?

1726
02:16:33,743 --> 02:16:37,120
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.

1727
02:17:44,647 --> 02:17:45,688
Who is it?

1728
02:17:46,023 --> 02:17:47,065
Fredrick!

1729
02:17:48,526 --> 02:17:49,567
Shit.

1730
02:17:54,156 --> 02:17:56,366
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.

1731
02:17:56,826 --> 02:17:58,326
That actor in the movie stinks.

1732
02:18:00,663 --> 02:18:01,746
What are you doing here?

1733
02:18:01,997 --> 02:18:03,039
I came to visit you.

1734
02:18:04,375 --> 02:18:05,417
Can't you see how busy I am?

1735
02:18:05,709 --> 02:18:07,210
Then allow me to lend an assist.

1736
02:18:08,504 --> 02:18:10,338
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.

1737
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:13,591
This is your premiere,
you need to be out there with them.

1738
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,846
Normally, you would be right.

1739
02:18:19,014 --> 02:18:20,348
And for all the other films I do...

1740
02:18:21,016 --> 02:18:23,852
...I intend to endure evenings like tonight,
in the proper spirit.

1741
02:18:26,021 --> 02:18:27,230
However, the fact remains...

1742
02:18:28,357 --> 02:18:30,442
...this film is based
on my military exploits.

1743
02:18:31,068 --> 02:18:34,696
And in this case,
my exploits consisted of killing many men.

1744
02:18:36,198 --> 02:18:38,199
Consequently, the part of
the film that's playing now...

1745
02:18:40,619 --> 02:18:42,036
...I don't like watching this part.

1746
02:18:43,873 --> 02:18:45,707
I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought...

1747
02:18:46,041 --> 02:18:48,251
...l'd come up here
and do what I do best...

1748
02:18:48,586 --> 02:18:49,711
...annoy you.

1749
02:18:50,713 --> 02:18:53,715
And from the look on your face,
it would appear I haven't lost my touch.

1750
02:18:55,384 --> 02:18:57,343
Are you so used to
the Nazis kissing your ass...

1751
02:18:57,428 --> 02:18:58,928
...you've forgotten what
the word "no" means?

1752
02:18:59,555 --> 02:19:01,473
No... you can't be here!

1753
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:02,724
Now go away!

1754
02:19:05,644 --> 02:19:06,728
Fredrick, you hurt me.

1755
02:19:07,062 --> 02:19:11,399
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.

1756
02:19:12,234 --> 02:19:14,068
Even if it's just physical pain.

1757
02:19:14,737 --> 02:19:16,613
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.

1758
02:19:17,656 --> 02:19:21,826
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy,
that if they could, would testify to that!

1759
02:19:24,455 --> 02:19:25,622
After what I've done for you...

1760
02:19:25,998 --> 02:19:28,082
...you disrespect me at your peril!

1761
02:19:28,417 --> 02:19:29,501
Lock the door.

1762
02:19:30,044 --> 02:19:31,085
What?

1763
02:19:32,379 --> 02:19:33,421
Lock the door.

1764
02:19:33,506 --> 02:19:34,589
We don't have much time.

1765
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:38,843
Time for what?

1766
02:19:39,762 --> 02:19:40,845
Forget it!

1767
02:19:41,096 --> 02:19:42,263
No, no, no... wait.

1768
02:19:43,933 --> 02:19:45,892
You want me to... lock the door?

1769
02:19:46,602 --> 02:19:47,769
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

1770
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:51,736
When I kill that guy,
you got 30 feet to get to that guard.

1771
02:21:51,819 --> 02:21:53,780
Can you do it?
I have to.

1772
02:22:24,018 --> 02:22:25,353
Champagne?

1773
02:22:47,116 --> 02:22:49,117
Extraordinary my dear,
simply extraordinary!

1774
02:22:49,618 --> 02:22:50,952
This is your finest film yet.

1775
02:22:52,955 --> 02:22:54,288
Thank you, my Führer.

1776
02:22:56,458 --> 02:22:57,500
Thank you.

1777
02:23:17,196 --> 02:23:19,907
Who wants to send
a message to Germany?

1778
02:23:20,742 --> 02:23:23,077
I have a message
for Germany.

1779
02:23:26,539 --> 02:23:28,791
That you are
all going to die.

1780
02:23:29,867 --> 02:23:31,200
Enough! Stop it!

1781
02:23:31,326 --> 02:23:32,368
Turn off the projector!

1782
02:23:32,545 --> 02:23:37,967
And I want you to look deep into the face of
the Jew who's going to do it!

1783
02:23:38,167 --> 02:23:40,042
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!

1784
02:23:40,053 --> 02:23:43,139
Marcel, burn it down.

1785
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,642
Oui, Shosanna.

1786
02:24:21,094 --> 02:24:23,221
My name
is Shosanna Dreyfus,

1787
02:24:23,596 --> 02:24:25,181
and this is the face

1788
02:24:27,141 --> 02:24:29,477
of Jewish vengeance.

1789
02:26:25,542 --> 02:26:28,002
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.

1790
02:26:35,144 --> 02:26:36,938
Hermann,
uncuff them.

1791
02:26:55,582 --> 02:26:59,586
I'm officially surrendering myself over
to you, Lieutenant Raine.

1792
02:27:00,712 --> 02:27:02,505
We're your prisoners.

1793
02:27:03,339 --> 02:27:05,049
How about my knife?

1794
02:27:11,014 --> 02:27:12,974
Thank you very much,
Colonel.

1795
02:27:13,057 --> 02:27:16,144
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands
behind his back.

1796
02:27:16,227 --> 02:27:18,438
Is that really
necessary?

1797
02:27:18,521 --> 02:27:20,607
I'm a slave
to appearances.

1798
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:25,278
Scalp Hermann.

1799
02:27:26,946 --> 02:27:28,615
Are you mad?

1800
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:30,742
What have you done?

1801
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:34,579
I made a deal with your general
for that man's life!

1802
02:27:35,663 --> 02:27:39,042
Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't
give a fuck about him. They need you.

1803
02:27:39,125 --> 02:27:41,085
You'll be shot for this!

1804
02:27:41,753 --> 02:27:45,256
Nah, I don't think so. More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.

1805
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:50,762
You know, Utivich and myself heard that
deal you made with the brass.

1806
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:52,972
End the war tonight?

1807
02:27:54,390 --> 02:27:55,934
I'd make that deal.

1808
02:27:56,017 --> 02:27:57,852
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

1809
02:27:57,936 --> 02:27:58,937
I'd make that deal.

1810
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:01,522
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.

1811
02:28:02,273 --> 02:28:05,401
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

1812
02:28:05,485 --> 02:28:08,863
Well, if you're willing to barbecue
the whole High Command,

1813
02:28:08,947 --> 02:28:11,950
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

1814
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:14,786
But I do have
one question.

1815
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:18,623
When you get to your little place
on Nantucket Island,

1816
02:28:18,706 --> 02:28:23,253
I imagine you are going to take off that
handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

1817
02:28:23,336 --> 02:28:24,671
Ain't you?

1818
02:28:28,633 --> 02:28:30,510
That's what I thought.

1819
02:28:31,261 --> 02:28:33,137
Now, that I can't abide.

1820
02:28:34,555 --> 02:28:36,849
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?

1821
02:28:36,933 --> 02:28:38,810
Not one damn bit, sir.

1822
02:28:40,436 --> 02:28:42,522
I mean,
if I had my way,

1823
02:28:43,022 --> 02:28:47,485
you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest
of your pecker-sucking life.

1824
02:28:48,987 --> 02:28:49,988
But I'm aware
that ain't practical.

1825
02:28:50,071 --> 02:28:53,116
I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.

1826
02:28:53,199 --> 02:28:54,325
So,

1827
02:28:55,285 --> 02:28:58,997
I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

1828
02:29:23,938 --> 02:29:26,065
You know something,
Utivich?

1829
02:29:26,441 --> 02:29:29,235
I think this just might be
my masterpiece.
