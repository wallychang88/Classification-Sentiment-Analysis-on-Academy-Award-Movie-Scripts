1
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,129
- You bringing Micky in?
- Yeah, he's gonna come.

2
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,964
He should be here as well.

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,966
You think he'll answer questions?

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,135
They said it was
gonna be both of us here.

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,140
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,852
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,812
- Right over here.
...interviews?

8
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,650
I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,

9
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,153
and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.

10
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,238
You know, I had a different
name and everything.

11
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,573
I mean, I don't know how many fights...

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,118
I'd done a hundred, more than that,
before I turned professional.

13
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,163
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,415
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

15
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,252
This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,296
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

17
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,467
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,052
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,638
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

20
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,016
In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.

21
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,435
I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.

22
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,354
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,190
They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.

24
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,943
Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,903
His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?

26
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,864
But we're very different fighters.

27
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,741
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

28
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,160
He's got... a thunderous,

29
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,330
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,791
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,293
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

32
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,546
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,493
Come on.

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,413
Dicky.

35
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,587
Would you come on?

36
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,590
Will you stop?
You gotta help me finish this.

37
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,385
Come on!

38
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,387
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,722
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,099
To see where this fight is headed.

41
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,270
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

42
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,773
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

43
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:17,529
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

44
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,450
The pride of Lowell is back!

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,370
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,623
Who wants some?!

47
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,229
Hey! I want a cut.

48
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,235
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

49
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,196
How are ya?

50
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,868
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

51
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,829
Lou! Hey, Lou!

52
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,207
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

53
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,879
Making my comeback.

54
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,008
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

55
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,597
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

56
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,015
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,026
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

58
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,195
HBO's making a movie on me!

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,781
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

60
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,706
Did you tap that?

61
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,458
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,504
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

63
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,840
Are you nuts?

64
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,718
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

65
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,138
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

66
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,056
You're doing well.

67
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,738
You're walking. Get on it.

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,584
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

69
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,170
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

70
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,881
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

71
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,217
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

72
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,095
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

73
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,305
You gotta pay them to shut up.

74
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,557
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

75
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,934
Yeah, come on, Micky.

76
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,439
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

77
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,608
You know where he is.

78
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,379
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,464
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

80
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,633
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

81
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,803
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,472
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,516
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

84
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,935
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

85
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,854
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

86
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,690
Don't. Just forget about him.

87
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,235
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

88
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,153
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

89
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,488
You want me to do that again?

90
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,157
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

91
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,327
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

92
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,747
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

93
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,583
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

94
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,293
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

95
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,756
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

96
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,967
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

97
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,261
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

98
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,762
Art, Art, where's the video at?

99
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,856
Tonight, my son is gonna surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

100
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,191
Believe me, I know it.

101
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,195
Sugar Ray might have
some trouble tonight.

102
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,657
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,

103
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,035
a young man who can punch,
and I would like to say at this time

104
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,496
that physically
they're just about equal.

105
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,268
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockdown.

106
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,396
This is unbelievable.

107
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,567
Eklund just walked over him!

108
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,737
Nobody seems
to know what's happening!

109
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,787
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

110
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,541
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

111
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,710
training Micky right now?

112
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,380
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!

113
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,050
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!

114
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,719
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

115
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,429
I didn't park it. You did.

116
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,431
- I didn't park it.
- Check your pockets for the keys.

117
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,934
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

118
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,853
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

119
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,772
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

120
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,024
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

121
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,279
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

122
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,473
Hey.

123
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,683
Hey!

124
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,602
Quacka!

125
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,314
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

126
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,484
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

127
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,031
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

128
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,286
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

129
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,912
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

130
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,499
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

131
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,460
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

132
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,878
OK.

133
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,839
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

134
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,675
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

135
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,969
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

136
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,515
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

137
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,517
I think we got all the bases covered.

138
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:07,063
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

139
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,024
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

140
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,443
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

141
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,944
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

142
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,697
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

143
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,282
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

144
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,409
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

145
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,161
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

146
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,631
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

147
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,052
And again! One, two, three, four...

148
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,221
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

149
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,391
There you go! There you go!

150
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,735
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

151
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,528
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

152
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,782
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

153
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,367
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

154
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,911
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

155
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,747
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

156
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,541
calling the fight for ESPN.

157
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,920
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

158
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,172
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

159
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,591
Hook!

160
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,802
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

161
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,428
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

162
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,681
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

163
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,558
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

164
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,851
Fuck.

165
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,605
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

166
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,357
That's your punch.

167
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,193
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

168
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,738
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

169
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,825
Hey, right there, Tar!

170
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,411
That's not helping, George!

171
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,705
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

172
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,707
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

173
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,292
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

174
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,214
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

175
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,590
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,511
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

177
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,723
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

178
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,850
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

179
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,226
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

180
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,480
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

181
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,942
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,363
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

183
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,324
Charlene! Charlene!

184
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,746
Hey, Charlene!

185
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,665
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

186
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,002
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

187
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,839
On the count of three... Three!

188
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,720
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

189
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,313
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,649
I told her all about you.

191
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,194
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

192
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,281
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

193
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,202
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

194
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,211
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

195
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,381
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

196
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,592
Thinks you're the greatest.

197
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,178
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

198
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,638
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

199
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,473
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

200
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,225
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

201
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,019
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

202
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,938
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

203
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,649
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

204
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,152
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

205
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,446
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

206
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,073
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

207
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,537
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

208
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,914
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

209
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,083
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

210
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,585
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

211
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,838
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

212
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,590
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

213
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,677
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

214
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,762
You be nice. OK?

215
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,556
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

216
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,392
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

217
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,978
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

218
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,063
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

219
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,233
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

220
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,444
Right? Right? Hey!

221
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,780
- Right.
- That's right!

222
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,448
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

223
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,451
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

224
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,705
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

225
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,291
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

226
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,793
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

227
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,587
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

228
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,463
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

229
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,216
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'?

230
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,052
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

231
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,264
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

232
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,474
Where did they find a guy like that?

233
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,476
He's no joke. Former world champ.

234
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,937
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,981
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

236
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,816
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

237
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,903
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',

238
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,655
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

239
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,449
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

240
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,784
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

241
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,204
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

242
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,916
And go head, body, head, body.

243
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,920
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

244
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,380
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

245
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,466
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

246
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,885
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

247
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,012
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

248
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,640
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

249
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,602
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

250
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,355
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

251
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,609
Are you married?

252
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,611
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

253
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,863
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

254
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,698
I'm not like that.

255
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,785
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

256
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,287
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

257
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,665
Come on. Let me take you out.

258
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,168
When?

259
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,671
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

260
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,565
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

261
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,152
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

262
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,468
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

263
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,762
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

264
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,766
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

265
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,102
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

266
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,770
It's not your day. Good-bye.

267
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,856
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

268
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,277
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

269
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,073
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

270
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,326
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

271
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,704
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

272
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,290
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

273
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,292
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

274
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,294
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

275
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,422
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

276
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,799
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

277
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,801
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

278
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,388
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

279
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,973
Good luck, Daddy.

280
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,477
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

281
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,146
Where is he?

282
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,274
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

283
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,618
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

284
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,997
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

285
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,000
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

286
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,419
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

287
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,297
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

288
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,840
You're already doing it without him.

289
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,510
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

290
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,638
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

291
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,849
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

292
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,895
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

293
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,030
Dicky.

294
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,743
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

295
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,831
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

296
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,711
I'm not here.

297
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,549
- Oh, no.
- What?

298
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,217
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

299
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,261
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

300
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,637
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

301
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,430
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

302
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,725
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

303
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,061
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

304
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,730
You know how important
this fight is to me.

305
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,899
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

306
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,109
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

307
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,194
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

308
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,405
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

309
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,448
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

310
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,284
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

311
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,911
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

312
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,581
What are you doing?

313
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,457
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

314
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,917
Why'd you make me do that to you?

315
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,294
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

316
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,962
I was on my way! Ma...

317
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,299
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

318
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,135
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

319
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,054
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

320
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,640
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

321
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,518
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

322
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,146
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

323
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,772
You got him, pal.

324
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,169
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

325
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,714
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

326
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,301
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

327
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,969
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

328
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,473
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

329
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,308
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

330
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,727
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

331
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,648
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

332
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,942
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

333
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,151
Yeah.

334
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,653
Micky, we can still have a fight.

335
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,572
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

336
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,907
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

337
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,909
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

338
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,828
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

339
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,122
He's the only guy I could find.

340
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,917
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

341
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,169
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

342
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,004
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

343
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,466
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

344
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,761
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

345
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,429
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

346
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,682
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

347
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,767
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

348
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,020
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

349
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:17,275
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

350
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,987
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

351
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,115
This guyjust got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

352
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,535
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

353
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,330
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

354
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,253
OK.

355
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,842
So, Lou... Come on, please.

356
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,928
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

357
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,513
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

358
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,559
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

359
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,687
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

360
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,315
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

361
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,234
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

362
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,945
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

363
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,238
- Scared?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,699
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

365
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,909
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

366
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,455
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

367
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,833
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

368
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,045
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

369
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,756
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

370
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,091
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

371
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,594
You watch from the outside, pal.

372
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:31,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

373
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,978
Holy shit.

374
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,439
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

375
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,274
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

376
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,027
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

377
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,987
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

378
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,407
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

379
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,159
That guy's no welterweight.

380
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,038
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

381
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,581
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

382
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,625
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

383
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,960
I don't care who that guy is...

384
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,421
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

385
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,799
You're Micky Ward.

386
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,930
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

387
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,474
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

388
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,644
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

389
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,521
Now it's big Mike...

390
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,941
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

391
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,027
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...

392
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,571
...six...

393
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,116
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

394
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,450
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

395
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,329
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

396
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,289
Hey, you, back off!

397
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,002
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

398
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,881
Ward, a respected fighter.

399
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,300
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

400
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,471
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

401
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,494
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,288
before we get started,
a lot of people have been asking

403
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,207
about the big night
of boxing on November 4.

404
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,626
Three world championship bouts...

405
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,713
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

406
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,551
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin', man?

407
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,887
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

408
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,599
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

409
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,935
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

410
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,062
I knocked Ray down.

411
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,898
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

412
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,400
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

413
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,569
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

414
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,071
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

415
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,116
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

416
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,744
Can I call ya?

417
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,581
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

418
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,417
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

419
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,753
My comeback. Right?

420
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,756
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

421
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,424
You don't be a stranger!

422
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,177
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

423
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,553
What's that?

424
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,181
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

425
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,350
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

426
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,270
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

427
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,357
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

428
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,859
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

429
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,529
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

430
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,241
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

431
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,742
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

432
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,120
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

433
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,789
What about my brother?

434
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,416
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

435
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,670
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

436
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,339
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

437
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,259
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

438
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,054
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

439
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,681
You should've given it up.

440
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,310
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

441
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,313
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

442
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,941
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

443
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,986
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

444
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,364
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

445
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,865
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

446
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,867
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

447
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,121
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

448
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,250
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

449
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,336
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

450
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,173
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

451
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,509
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

452
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,845
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

453
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:42,558
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

454
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,560
He didn't mention you.

455
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,189
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

456
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,609
That guyjust wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

457
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,153
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

458
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,031
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

459
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,992
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

460
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,369
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

461
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,246
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

462
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,497
That's right.

463
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,708
You guys can spar a little, right?

464
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,877
Where are they?

465
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,879
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

466
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,758
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

467
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,009
I love you!

468
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,053
Thank you.

469
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,221
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

470
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,559
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

471
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,894
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

472
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,688
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

473
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,359
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

474
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,861
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

475
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,113
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

476
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,657
What don't you wanna do no more?

477
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,283
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

478
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,704
- What are you?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

479
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:50,250
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

480
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,753
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

481
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,880
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

482
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,757
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

483
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,425
What do you think?

484
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,970
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

485
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,306
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

486
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,141
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

487
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,727
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

488
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,437
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

489
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,605
What are you talking about?

490
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,565
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

491
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,567
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

492
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,820
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

493
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,781
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

494
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,409
Come on, let's go inside.

495
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,828
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

496
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,455
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

497
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,374
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

498
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,058
Who is it?

499
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,207
I saw the shade move.

500
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,125
Micky, the shade is still moving.

501
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,504
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

502
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,507
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

503
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,884
why you didn't call me yesterday.

504
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,099
Why'd you stand me up last night?

505
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,479
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

506
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,147
'Cause you lost the fight?

507
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,900
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

508
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,819
How'd you know my house, anyway?

509
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,779
I asked my brother.

510
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,740
Your thing's coming off.

511
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,784
I mean your other thing.

512
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,579
You got any tape?

513
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,465
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

514
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,010
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

515
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,848
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

516
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,893
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

517
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,729
I never should've fought him.

518
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:02,526
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

519
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,445
Everybody said I could've beat him.

520
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,948
Who's everybody?

521
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,909
My mother, my brother.

522
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,623
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

523
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

524
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,033
- You look great.
- Thank you.

525
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,993
Got a nice house, too.

526
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,203
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

527
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,039
One of my old roommates lives in one.

528
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,582
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

529
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,834
- College.
- College. Wow.

530
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,629
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

531
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,673
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

532
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,343
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

533
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,054
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

534
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,307
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

535
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,600
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

536
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,894
- Yeah.
- For what?

537
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,356
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

538
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,817
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

539
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,862
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

540
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,197
You?

541
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,547
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

542
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,049
You come to this theater a lot?

543
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,134
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

544
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,304
- Yeah, like what?
- Belli Epi-que.

545
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,183
I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic." Belle Epic.

546
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,436
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.

547
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,438
Well, I never heard of it.

548
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,691
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

549
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,068
No, a guy from work.

550
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,070
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

551
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,530
Oh, cool.

552
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,589
Thank you.

553
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,685
That's the movie you wanted to see?

554
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,104
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

555
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,691
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

556
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,028
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

557
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,030
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

558
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,241
What's going on?

559
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,453
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

560
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,122
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

561
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,124
I... I like you.

562
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,003
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

563
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,589
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

564
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,300
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

565
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,260
You don't think I wanted to call you?

566
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:20,724
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

567
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,981
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

568
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,153
Don't say that about my family.

569
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,199
What else can I say
after what you told me?

570
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,409
I mean, look at your face.

571
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,204
Look at you.

572
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,981
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

573
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,484
and give us a fight that's fair.

574
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,403
My boy could've got killed last time.

575
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,157
Yeah, like what?

576
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,370
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

577
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,418
He's coming off a loss?

578
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,338
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

579
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,674
We got a great opportunity here.

580
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,093
We gotta go find Micky.

581
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,054
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

582
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,390
Jesus.

583
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,977
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

584
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,187
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

585
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,315
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

586
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,401
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

587
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,737
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

588
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,031
I heard she's into three-ways.

589
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,993
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

590
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,911
MTV...
What are you talking about?

591
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,246
Wild.

592
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,499
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

593
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,295
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

594
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,964
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

595
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,967
I've gotta go find Dicky.

596
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,561
Dicky!

597
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,321
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

598
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,825
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

599
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,662
Don't worry about it, Ma.

600
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,378
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

601
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,964
Hey, Alice...

602
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,008
Alice...

603
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,929
I started a joke

604
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:51,017
Which started the whole world cryin'

605
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:55,313
Oh, if only I'd seen

606
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,192
That the joke was on me

607
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,029
I started to cry

608
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:08,493
Which started
the whole world laughin'

609
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:12,414
Oh, if only I'd seen

610
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,875
That the joke was on me

611
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,713
I looked at the skies

612
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,719
Runnin' my hands over my eyes

613
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:31,558
And I fell out of bed

614
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,102
Hurting my head...

615
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,621
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

616
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,751
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

617
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,337
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

618
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,048
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

619
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,050
Be nice.

620
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,885
Don't use the nicknames.

621
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,680
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

622
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,433
Speaking of family...

623
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,072
Hello.

624
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,743
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

625
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,746
I've heard a lot about you.

626
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,831
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

627
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

628
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,127
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

629
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,383
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

630
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,302
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

631
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,974
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

632
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,561
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

633
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,979
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

634
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,816
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

635
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,944
Which is still... good money, Mick.

636
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,779
Yeah.

637
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,491
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

638
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,202
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

639
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,124
Like what?

640
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,755
What's best for you, sweetheart?

641
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,007
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

642
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,510
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

643
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,013
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

644
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,144
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

645
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:43,189
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

646
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,693
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

647
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,196
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

648
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,906
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

649
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,200
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

650
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,619
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

651
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,621
The whole routine.

652
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,999
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

653
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,542
Let him talk. Listen.

654
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,503
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

655
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,046
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

656
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,007
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

657
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,384
Mick, what's the problem?

658
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,221
- The problems.
- What problems?

659
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,641
- Problems...
- Like what?

660
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,896
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

661
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,274
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

662
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,110
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

663
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,074
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

664
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,786
I'm Charlene. We just met.

665
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,873
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

666
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,459
Hi, I'm Charlene.

667
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,919
Hi, I'm Charlene.

668
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,755
Hey, we're together!

669
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,885
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

670
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,887
What's she know about boxing?

671
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:01,017
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

672
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,686
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

673
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,442
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

674
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,027
Come on, Micky.

675
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,781
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

676
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:21,079
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

677
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,666
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

678
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,125
whatever the fuck that means.

679
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,669
- Skank.
- It's wild.

680
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:34,300
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

681
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,136
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

682
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,474
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

683
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,892
That's all she's talking about.

684
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,978
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

685
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,232
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

686
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,988
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

687
00:42:55,155 --> 00:43:00,618
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

688
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,620
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

689
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,747
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

690
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,668
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

691
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,716
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

692
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,682
So, you put in $200, right?

693
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,560
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

694
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,022
...and you got your 2,000.

695
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,364
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

696
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,074
Ten lucky ones.

697
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,662
You rip us off.

698
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,372
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

699
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,625
You give me $200.

700
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,754
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

701
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,548
Right? You understand? No?

702
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,056
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

703
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,353
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

704
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,522
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

705
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,359
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

706
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:18,029
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

707
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,490
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

708
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,326
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

709
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,411
White people do this
to other white people.

710
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,456
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

711
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,335
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

712
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,258
I mean, they didn't understand.

713
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,511
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

714
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,056
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but theyjust didn't understand

715
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,475
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

716
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,061
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

717
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,106
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

718
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,776
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

719
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,945
What's this movie about, again?

720
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,656
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

721
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,702
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

722
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,956
Fuck.

723
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,252
We gotta get Mick's money.

724
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,142
Yes! That was awesome!

725
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,168
Go. Right now.

726
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,132
Go, go, go...

727
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,230
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

728
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,025
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

729
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,569
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

730
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,321
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

731
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,492
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

732
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,328
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

733
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,997
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

734
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,375
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

735
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,297
What the fuck?!

736
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,133
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

737
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,054
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking!

738
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,088
Ta-da! What do you think?

739
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,926
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

740
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:31,055
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

741
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,266
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

742
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,229
Did you hear me?!

743
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:45,278
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

744
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,826
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

745
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,620
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

746
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,542
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

747
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,544
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

748
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,089
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

749
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,599
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

750
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,310
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

751
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,645
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

752
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,106
Now you're involved!

753
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,651
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

754
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,820
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

755
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,075
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

756
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,578
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

757
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,459
Move 'em out!

758
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,546
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

759
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,715
Don't tell me to come on.

760
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,675
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

761
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,178
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

762
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,389
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

763
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,725
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

764
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,020
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

765
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,313
What the fuck, man!

766
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,232
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

767
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,276
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

768
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,861
Look at his hands.

769
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,196
Shit.

770
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:16,661
Go home, folks. Good night!

771
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,059
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

Bail set at $25,000.
Case continued, two weeks from today.

778
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:15,302
- Come on.
- Judy, can I the file three-57?

779
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,597
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

780
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,353
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

781
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,646
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

782
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,064
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

783
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,942
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

784
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,987
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

785
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,613
You did it for me? What, this?

786
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,324
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

787
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,243
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

788
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,495
What are you
gonna do without me?

789
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,957
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

790
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,043
They should've just put me in the car!

791
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,755
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

792
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,313
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

793
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,900
Hey, Eklund!

794
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,651
Dicky!

795
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,613
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

796
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,657
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

797
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,035
Who is it?

798
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,544
I don't want to see you, Micky.

799
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,047
- Charlene...
- I can't take it.

800
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,092
I'm not gonna let you
or your family drag me down.

801
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,803
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

802
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,972
I don't need it anymore.

803
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,892
- That's fuckin' stupid.
- What? Why?

804
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,395
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

805
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,438
with their stupid bullshit.

806
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,734
What else can I do, Charlene?

807
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,403
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

808
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,321
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

809
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,241
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

810
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,743
Charlene...

811
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,245
Don't call.

812
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,414
Come on.

813
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,249
Don't call me, OK?

814
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,927
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin', man?

815
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,598
Poor fucker!

816
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,269
Hang in there, man!

817
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,188
Go, Dicky!

818
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,487
Hey, Dicky!

819
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,824
Hey, keep it quiet!

820
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,509
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

821
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,846
Good.

822
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,193
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

823
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:02,321
Right here in Lowell, Mass,
the story of Dick Eklund,

824
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,573
a once-promising boxer
who turned criminal...

825
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,881
Oh, look who it is.

826
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,886
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

827
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,346
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

828
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,351
Hey.

829
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,771
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

830
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,025
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

831
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,361
How you feeling? How's the hand?

832
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,823
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

833
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,618
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

834
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,955
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

835
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,165
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

836
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,167
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

837
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,836
What are yous looking at?

838
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,756
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

839
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,633
I gotta go.

840
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,428
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

841
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,639
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

842
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,896
Hollywood!

843
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,234
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

844
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,947
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

845
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,579
All right!

846
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,464
All right, get this started!

847
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,730
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

848
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,525
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

849
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,821
I used to live over there.
This town got good memories, right?

850
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,948
- Check it out.
- Fuck, yeah.

851
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,785
- This house here, this white house?
- Oh, yeah.

852
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,496
White, big fat guy.
First time I got my crack, over here.

853
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,790
Did you ever know that?
They smoke crack at the White House?

854
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,251
White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.

855
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,921
The first time I did crack, or whatever,
I was about 23

856
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,798
and a friend of mine gave me
a gram, or whatever.

857
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,883
Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.

858
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,512
Before that, I'd been doing
the Silver Mittens and stuff.

859
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,224
I was the only kid.
I'd be 12... I was shit... faced.

860
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,975
I'll tell ya how crack works.

861
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:43,107
When it enters your lungs...
When it enters your lungs...

862
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,985
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

863
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,280
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

864
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,492
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

865
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,161
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

866
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,414
OK, yeah, there's my boys
right there. Check 'em out.

867
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,126
- What kind of snake's that? Python?
- Yeah, check it out, man.

868
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,586
- It's not gonna bite me or something?
- He's cool.

869
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,716
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

870
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,928
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

871
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,471
I always dreamed about it...

872
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,226
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

873
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,273
Dicky... put Lowell on the map.

874
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,984
He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.

875
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:31,947
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockdown.

876
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,783
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

877
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,286
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

878
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,705
- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.

879
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,292
- That's a fuckin' lie!
- They said he's in trouble with drugs.

880
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,211
What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?

881
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,548
- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."

882
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,717
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

883
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,260
I thought he could make a comeback

884
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,221
- and make us proud, but he didn't.
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

885
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,515
Very disappointing,
very disgusting.

886
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,894
You brought the city of
Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.

887
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,812
- Hello?
- Jimmy?

888
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,565
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

889
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,318
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

890
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,153
I got it...

891
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,406
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

892
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,949
- What?
- Who you are.

893
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,243
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

894
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,622
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

895
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,166
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

896
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,751
She's a kid.

897
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,755
When you smoke crack, you know...

898
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,090
...you feel so much lighter.

899
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,469
You know, you feel young, like when
everything was in front of you,

900
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,971
everything was just...

901
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,142
...everything was... just...

902
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,186
...it was in front of you, you know?

903
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,940
And then...

904
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,776
...it fades and you
gotta get high again.

905
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,785
Your part in the movie
is gonna end with you going to jail.

906
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,707
What about little Dicky?
Who's gonna take care of him, huh?

907
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,463
You guys can't talk to 'em?

908
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,508
Oh, man...

909
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,219
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

910
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,346
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

911
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,015
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

912
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,979
Hey, hey, that is my life.

913
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,689
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

914
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,692
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

915
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,444
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

916
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,155
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

917
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,074
You fuckin' want some?!

918
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,910
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

919
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:48,333
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

920
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,503
But you know what?
Dicky was a street kid.

921
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,841
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

922
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,887
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

923
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,973
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

924
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,058
He's been doing this for years.

925
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,354
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

926
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,361
- What do you think?
- You think they set him up?

927
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,572
What do you think he was doing?

928
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,159
You know, gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie. Right?

929
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:29,124
Micky... Micky?

930
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,710
Shit. Micky...

931
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,639
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

932
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,017
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

933
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,853
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

934
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,355
It's like a beach ball.

935
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,488
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

936
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,198
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

937
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,285
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

938
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,454
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

939
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:40,333
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

940
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,212
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

941
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,298
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

942
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,300
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

943
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:54,973
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

944
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,642
But I'll only do it on one condition.

945
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:03,648
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

946
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,068
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

947
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,863
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

948
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,324
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

949
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,327
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

950
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,747
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

951
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,500
- Yeah. You laugh.
- You...

952
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,837
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

953
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:30,884
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

954
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,344
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

955
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,846
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

956
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,223
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

957
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,517
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

958
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,269
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

959
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,064
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

960
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,566
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

961
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,193
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

962
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,489
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

963
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,158
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

964
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,869
- Why can't you trust anybody with?
- I know people.

965
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,622
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

966
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,707
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

967
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:06,544
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

968
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,546
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

969
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,257
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

970
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,551
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

971
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:16,388
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

972
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,349
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

973
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,644
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

974
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,980
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

975
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,107
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

976
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:31,069
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

977
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,862
I don't want
another word outta you.

978
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,572
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

979
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,993
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

980
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,744
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

981
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,872
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

982
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,792
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

983
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,878
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

984
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,422
You're gonna get Charlene involved?

985
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:54,092
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I know where she lives.

986
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,719
What are you pickin' on her for?

987
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,763
She lives in that
yellow house on Stevens Street.

988
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,391
I'm gonna go talk to Micky,
sort this out for myself.

989
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,604
Yeah, sure. You go handle it
with your vigilantes. All of yous now.

990
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,856
This is wrong, Alice!

991
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,740
I got it!

992
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,700
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

993
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,202
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

994
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,788
Get in the car.

995
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,397
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

996
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,066
Micky!

997
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,737
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

998
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,447
Where are you?

999
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,409
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

1000
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,579
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

1001
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,333
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

1002
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,096
Hi.

1003
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,972
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

1004
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,265
Look at what?

1005
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,436
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

1006
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,106
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

1007
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,690
What are you doing, Mickster?

1008
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,193
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1009
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,030
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

1010
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,574
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

1011
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,954
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

1012
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,665
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

1013
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,209
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

1014
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,921
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

1015
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,465
I'm his mother. And his manager.

1016
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,884
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

1017
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,845
I'm not gettin' any younger.

1018
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,888
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

1019
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:07,559
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

1020
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:11,062
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

1021
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,064
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

1022
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,984
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

1023
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,695
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

1024
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,910
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

1025
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,373
Let her go!
Let her go!

1026
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,419
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

1027
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,423
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

1028
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,466
- Skank!
- Micky...

1029
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,222
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

1030
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,474
What'd she do to your nose?

1031
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,276
What is happenin'?
What is happenin' to everybody?

1032
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,778
I don't understand, sweetheart.

1033
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:49,661
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

1034
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,287
'Cause I don't.

1035
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,748
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

1036
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,086
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

1037
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,255
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

1038
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,966
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

1039
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:07,136
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

1040
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,558
Hey. Good luck.

1041
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,863
That's it!

1042
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,869
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1043
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,208
Visit for Dick Eklund.

1044
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,584
Dicky!

1045
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,045
Eklund, you got a visitor!

1046
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:09,384
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

1047
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,427
I know you know what I been doing.

1048
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:14,305
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

1049
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,058
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

1050
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,645
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1051
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,772
It's all good.

1052
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,192
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

1053
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,944
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

1054
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:32,031
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

1055
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,158
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

1056
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,620
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

1057
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,831
They don't care if he kills you.

1058
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:44,544
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

1059
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,340
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

1060
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:53,010
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1061
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:55,471
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

1062
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,350
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

1063
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,437
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

1064
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,355
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

1065
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,316
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

1066
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,735
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

1067
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:12,363
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

1068
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,158
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

1069
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,661
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

1070
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:22,039
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1071
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:23,916
I finally got a good thing going for me

1072
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,836
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

1073
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,047
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

1074
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:33,801
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1075
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,512
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1076
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,639
Yes, you are.

1077
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,850
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

1078
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:44,228
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

1079
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,771
Two minutes, Dicky.

1080
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,274
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

1081
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:52,195
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

1082
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:56,115
Hey... Mick, what is it?

1083
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,576
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

1084
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,745
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1085
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,538
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

1086
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:04,582
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

1087
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,754
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

1088
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,048
He's weak against the overhand right.

1089
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,551
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

1090
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,761
Fuck you, Dicky.

1091
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:20,014
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1092
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,225
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

1093
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,102
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1094
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,188
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1095
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,940
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1096
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,775
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

1097
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,403
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1098
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,114
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

1099
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,369
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1100
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,290
He knows I'm right.

1101
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:55,216
Ward's record: 29 wins,
seven losses so far, 20 KOs.

1102
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,678
He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,

1103
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:00,388
as JB pointed out.

1104
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:10,398
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1105
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:15,653
You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.

1106
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,572
There's Mike Toma,
the promoter of the fight,

1107
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,323
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1108
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,117
And he says that Sanchez is

1109
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:25,580
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

1110
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:39,760
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1111
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,597
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1112
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,766
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

1113
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,185
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

1114
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,980
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

1115
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,190
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

1116
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,401
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

1117
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:58,863
You can see his power.

1118
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,948
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

1119
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,034
How about taking points away from him?

1120
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,995
Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.

1121
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,663
The referee should just go
ahead and stop this fight.

1122
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:11,334
He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...

1123
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,544
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1124
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,796
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1125
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,550
Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.

1126
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,719
Doing that same old shit.

1127
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,180
They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.

1128
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,390
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1129
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,225
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1130
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:31,228
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

1131
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:32,980
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1132
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,192
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1133
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,694
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

1134
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:40,071
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

1135
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,740
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1136
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,201
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1137
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,953
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1138
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,246
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

1139
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,290
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1140
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,584
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1141
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:54,960
Come on, get your punches up...

1142
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,338
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

1143
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,674
Then you gotta do something, baby.

1144
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,467
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

1145
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:04,679
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

1146
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,888
All right, Micky.

1147
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,934
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

1148
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:13,854
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1149
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,982
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1150
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,443
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1151
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,404
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

1152
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,863
Come on, Micky, come on!

1153
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,825
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

1154
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,244
to change Sanchez's mind...

1155
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,079
And he's beginning to open up.

1156
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,790
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1157
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,375
and throw against a fighter...

1158
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,543
Time!

1159
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,045
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

1160
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,132
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

1161
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,598
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1162
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,976
Good boy!

1163
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,645
He's down on an uppercut!

1164
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,319
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...

1165
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,698
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

1166
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,826
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1167
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,870
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1168
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,789
Come on, head, body, head.

1169
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,085
This is not professional.

1170
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,004
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1171
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,174
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

1172
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:26,343
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

1173
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,346
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1174
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,974
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1175
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,310
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

1176
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,522
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1177
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:42,735
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1178
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,780
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

1179
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,865
...nine, ten!

1180
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,745
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

1181
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,876
Oh, Micky won!

1182
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,798
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

1183
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,968
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

1184
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,721
A brilliant win in the career
of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.

1185
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,183
Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,

1186
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,729
who had all but given away the first
half-dozen rounds of the battle.

1187
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,023
I think what Micky did was he recognized

1188
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,942
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1189
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:25,903
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1190
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,030
Theater of the unexpected.

1191
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,533
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1192
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,159
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1193
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,745
You can't make it up, folks.

1194
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,372
You hear what he said?

1195
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,207
He said, "You can't give up
in this game."

1196
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,252
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1197
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,087
and he went out and stopped it.

1198
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,465
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

1199
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,468
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':

1200
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:50,845
This thing is over.

1201
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,930
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1202
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,683
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1203
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,184
Theyjust wanted to get out of there.

1204
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,020
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1205
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,523
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1206
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,024
He just told me,

1207
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,735
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

1208
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:09,947
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1209
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:14,702
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1210
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,247
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1211
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,625
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1212
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,544
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1213
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,797
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1214
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,758
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1215
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,845
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

1216
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,471
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

1217
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:35,931
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1218
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:37,808
Where'd you get that?

1219
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,310
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1220
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,895
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1221
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,063
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1222
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,317
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1223
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:49,236
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1224
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,322
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

1225
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,867
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1226
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,952
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1227
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,495
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1228
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:01,165
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1229
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,669
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

1230
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,588
He's not even gonna be there.

1231
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,700
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1232
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:38,869
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1233
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:42,164
Good to see you!

1234
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,836
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

1235
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:50,297
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1236
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:55,052
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

1237
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,270
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1238
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,982
I got new teeth. Everything.

1239
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,441
How you think I look?

1240
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,735
- Good.
- Yeah?

1241
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:26,709
Cake and more cake.

1242
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:29,420
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

1243
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:32,172
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

1244
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,467
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1245
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:37,219
Quacka!

1246
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,892
Ma.

1247
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,867
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1248
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,582
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

1249
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,251
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1250
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,462
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

1251
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,262
How you doing, Dicky?

1252
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,766
Let's spar.

1253
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,442
Hey, Charlene.

1254
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,302
Welcome back!

1255
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,472
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

1256
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:06,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

1257
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:10,062
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1258
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,856
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1259
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:17,402
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1260
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,323
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1261
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,868
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

1262
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:27,955
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1263
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:33,502
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1264
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:37,131
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

1265
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,924
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

1266
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,429
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1267
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:58,026
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1268
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:05,325
You stickin' to that?

1269
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:11,331
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

1270
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,751
I don't know what else to say.

1271
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,011
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1272
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:31,727
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1273
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:35,939
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1274
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,774
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

1275
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:39,985
Mom, please?

1276
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,446
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1277
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,072
I know. We'll see him at home.

1278
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,722
- What the hell?
- Would you please pack it up?

1279
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,307
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1280
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,852
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1281
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,230
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

1282
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:19,608
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1283
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,740
That's nice. That's nice.

1284
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,325
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1285
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,410
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1286
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:31,995
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

1287
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:34,498
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1288
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,919
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1289
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,588
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1290
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:44,341
He don't want me to work with him.

1291
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,593
What're you talking about?

1292
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,804
That's not right.

1293
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:52,432
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1294
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,810
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

1295
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:57,312
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

1296
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,522
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1297
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,190
Take 'em home.

1298
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,694
Why don't you ask Micky?

1299
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,863
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

1300
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:08,949
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

1301
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,620
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1302
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,455
Hey, take him outside, all right?

1303
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,002
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1304
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,296
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

1305
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,964
Because it's true.

1306
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,550
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1307
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,719
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1308
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:31,763
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

1309
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:35,434
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1310
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:38,061
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1311
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,481
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1312
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:45,235
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1313
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:46,528
He's a junk bag!

1314
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,238
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1315
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,823
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1316
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,742
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1317
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,702
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1318
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,163
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1319
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,081
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1320
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,834
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1321
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,377
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1322
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:04,880
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1323
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,049
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1324
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,676
Not you, not you, and not you.

1325
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:13,013
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1326
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,723
I want Dicky back.

1327
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:18,185
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1328
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,771
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1329
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:24,608
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1330
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,276
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1331
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:30,364
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1332
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,157
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1333
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,950
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1334
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,535
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1335
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:39,289
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1336
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,083
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

1337
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,794
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1338
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,379
That's the way you love him?

1339
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,547
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1340
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,967
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

1341
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:53,804
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1342
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,434
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1343
01:30:00,269 --> 01:30:05,440
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

1344
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,653
Wanna spar with your brother?

1345
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,495
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1346
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,498
Watching that for years, huh?

1347
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,544
Micky, Micky!

1348
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:28,213
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1349
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:29,631
Micky!

1350
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,675
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

1351
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,343
Take that baby out of here.

1352
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,137
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1353
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,349
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1354
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:42,811
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1355
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:46,690
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

1356
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:50,360
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

1357
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,571
I know you think he's coming back.

1358
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,614
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

1359
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,451
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

1360
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,703
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1361
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,663
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

1362
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:04,875
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

1363
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,919
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

1364
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:09,421
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

1365
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:10,964
Come on, come on! George, please!

1366
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,216
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

1367
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,845
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

1368
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,556
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

1369
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,183
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

1370
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:24,102
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1371
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,729
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

1372
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,898
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

1373
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,276
I am your mother.

1374
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,737
Yeah, Ma.

1375
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:40,243
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1376
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,579
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

1377
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:48,084
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

1378
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,175
Dicky!

1379
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,718
Stay with him.

1380
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:01,431
Dicky... Dicky!

1381
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,939
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

1382
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:11,608
Dicky, wait, come on!

1383
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:15,904
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

1384
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,323
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

1385
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:48,353
Hey, Chan.

1386
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,569
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

1387
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:58,905
Hey, Dicky's back!

1388
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,657
Hey!

1389
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,910
Look at you!

1390
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:07,163
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

1391
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:10,834
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

1392
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,669
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

1393
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,338
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1394
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,467
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

1395
01:33:19,635 --> 01:33:21,928
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

1396
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,472
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

1397
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,271
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

1398
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,691
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

1399
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:42,157
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

1400
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,410
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1401
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:04,054
Charlene? It's Dicky.

1402
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:08,058
Get off my porch,
you piece of shit.

1403
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:12,062
How fuckin' dare you...

1404
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,689
...cocksucker...

1405
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,608
...fuckin'...

1406
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,363
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

1407
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,406
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

1408
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:26,576
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

1409
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,079
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

1410
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:30,747
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

1411
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:34,542
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

1412
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,419
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

1413
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:38,380
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

1414
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:41,758
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

1415
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,804
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

1416
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,108
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

1417
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,448
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

1418
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:06,741
Really, what makes you say that?

1419
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:10,370
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

1420
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,664
And you can't just
run away because of me.

1421
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,791
He don't deserve that. All right?

1422
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,419
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1423
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,380
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1424
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,465
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1425
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,259
But I want you to think about something.

1426
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,429
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

1427
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:29,139
That in my time, I never had.

1428
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,308
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

1429
01:35:32,476 --> 01:35:34,394
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

1430
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:36,521
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

1431
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:37,897
I came here to make things right.

1432
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,441
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

1433
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:43,862
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1434
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:48,116
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

1435
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:51,578
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

1436
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,747
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

1437
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,624
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

1438
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,168
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1439
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:01,129
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

1440
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,633
All right. I drank too much.

1441
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,844
I worked in a lot of bars.

1442
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,972
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

1443
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,516
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

1444
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:20,148
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1445
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:25,361
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1446
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,198
It's icing.

1447
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:35,705
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1448
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,791
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

1449
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,597
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1450
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:57,852
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1451
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:00,647
I will.

1452
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:06,986
Hey, Mick...

1453
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:12,826
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1454
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,746
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

1455
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,832
You were my hero.

1456
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,251
I was.

1457
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,337
I was.

1458
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,511
I'm sorry.

1459
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,263
You are?

1460
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:53,259
There's a press conference downstairs.

1461
01:38:54,136 --> 01:38:55,678
Come on, let's go.

1462
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,305
Spot of tea, mate!

1463
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,601
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.

1464
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:12,320
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.

1465
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,199
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1466
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:21,371
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

1467
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:23,790
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

1468
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,250
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

1469
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:27,669
a much better fighter.

1470
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:30,421
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

1471
01:39:30,589 --> 01:39:32,048
Thank you guys for the shot.

1472
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:36,302
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

1473
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:39,847
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

1474
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:42,058
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

1475
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:44,477
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

1476
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,145
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

1477
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:02,495
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1478
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:08,292
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1479
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:13,339
I can't see!

1480
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:18,261
Here I go again on my own

1481
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:23,516
Goin' down the only road
I've ever known

1482
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:29,439
Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone

1483
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:34,360
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- I made up my mind

1484
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:39,782
I ain't wasting no more time

1485
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:45,621
Here I go again on my own

1486
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:50,460
Going down the only road
I've ever known

1487
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:55,673
Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone

1488
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,800
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

1489
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,304
I made up my mind

1490
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:06,976
I ain't wasting no more time...

1491
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:13,191
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1492
01:41:13,358 --> 01:41:16,736
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

1493
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:22,909
Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.
He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.

1494
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:27,789
And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.

1495
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:32,710
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1496
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:35,505
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

1497
01:41:35,672 --> 01:41:38,508
who throws 70 punches per round.

1498
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:41,677
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

1499
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:43,805
a huge following here tonight.

1500
01:41:45,724 --> 01:41:50,186
Accompanied
by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.

1501
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:53,773
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1502
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:57,527
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

1503
01:41:57,694 --> 01:42:01,531
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1504
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:06,035
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1505
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,579
...dream of fighting.

1506
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:12,375
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1507
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,544
Seventeen KOs.

1508
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:28,432
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1509
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,603
Both of ya... shake hands!

1510
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:36,566
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

1511
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:39,068
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1512
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:44,824
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1513
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,909
Ward is a long ways from home.

1514
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:48,744
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1515
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:50,621
Well, the big challenge for Ward

1516
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:53,749
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1517
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:57,461
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1518
01:42:57,629 --> 01:43:00,047
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

1519
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:02,425
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

1520
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,093
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1521
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:07,638
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1522
01:43:07,806 --> 01:43:10,933
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1523
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,437
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1524
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,439
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1525
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,774
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1526
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:20,860
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1527
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,403
jabbing here and there.

1528
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:28,576
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1529
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:33,623
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1530
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,750
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1531
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:38,461
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1532
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,464
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1533
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,591
They trade shots at close range.

1534
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:47,303
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1535
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:52,767
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

1536
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,101
How about that?

1537
01:43:54,269 --> 01:43:55,478
Break!

1538
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,565
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1539
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:03,277
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

1540
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:07,198
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

1541
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:09,450
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1542
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:12,703
No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.

1543
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:20,002
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1544
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:23,506
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1545
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,299
surer of what he wants to do.

1546
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:28,094
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1547
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,137
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

1548
01:44:30,305 --> 01:44:31,389
than he is right now.

1549
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:33,349
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

1550
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:34,767
at what's going on now.

1551
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:38,562
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

1552
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:41,649
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

1553
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:43,985
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1554
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:47,113
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1555
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:51,617
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

1556
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:55,496
Punches like these make it seem...

1557
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:59,000
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1558
01:45:00,502 --> 01:45:02,378
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

1559
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:05,006
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1560
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:10,636
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

1561
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:15,266
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1562
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,686
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

1563
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:21,397
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

1564
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:25,109
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1565
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:28,404
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1566
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:32,074
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1567
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,410
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1568
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:36,579
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1569
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,457
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

1570
01:45:39,624 --> 01:45:40,875
That ain't fuckin' it!

1571
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:44,378
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1572
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:49,216
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

1573
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,137
Ward is out on his feet.

1574
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,265
Loser! Go back to America!

1575
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:59,769
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

1576
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,937
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1577
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:04,148
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

1578
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:07,401
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1579
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,240
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1580
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:15,451
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1581
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,578
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1582
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:21,957
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

1583
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:24,251
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1584
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:27,004
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1585
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:29,340
This is a survival mode...

1586
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:33,302
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1587
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,970
Never had to win, did I?

1588
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:38,307
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1589
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,435
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1590
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:44,355
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1591
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:46,440
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1592
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:48,359
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1593
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:50,528
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1594
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:52,571
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1595
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,741
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1596
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:58,828
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

1597
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:00,579
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1598
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,289
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1599
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:05,084
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1600
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,044
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1601
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:14,176
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1602
01:47:14,344 --> 01:47:17,054
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1603
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:19,807
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1604
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,602
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1605
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,690
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1606
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:30,443
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

1607
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:34,029
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1608
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:35,865
Come on!

1609
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:39,118
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

1610
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,162
Neary continues to pound away.

1611
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:49,378
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

1612
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:52,715
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

1613
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:56,177
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1614
01:47:56,344 --> 01:47:58,387
He backs Neary off.

1615
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:00,306
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1616
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,933
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1617
01:48:03,518 --> 01:48:05,060
"Come on, let's fight!"

1618
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:06,979
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

1619
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,398
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1620
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:12,234
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1621
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:14,361
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1622
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:16,864
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1623
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:20,576
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

1624
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,370
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1625
01:48:23,538 --> 01:48:27,208
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1626
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:29,919
First time in 23 professional fights

1627
01:48:30,086 --> 01:48:33,172
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1628
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,883
This is it, Micky!

1629
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:39,094
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

1630
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:45,935
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1631
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:48,854
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1632
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:52,691
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

1633
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,777
Neary down for the second time.

1634
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:56,946
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

1635
01:48:57,113 --> 01:49:01,534
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eight-round TKO!

1636
01:49:02,285 --> 01:49:03,577
He's done it again.

1637
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,539
He's done it again.

1638
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:11,669
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

1639
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:27,893
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1640
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,688
You fuckin' did it!

1641
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,365
Oh, you're the best!

1642
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:46,161
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1643
01:49:47,038 --> 01:49:48,539
I love you!

1644
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:22,364
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1645
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:26,452
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1646
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,870
- We.
- I tell ya...

1647
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:30,247
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1648
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:32,333
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

1649
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,877
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1650
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,921
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1651
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:39,882
Handin' it down to him.

1652
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:43,552
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

1653
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,264
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1654
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:19,254
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

1655
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:24,677
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

1656
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:28,013
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1657
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:31,600
It's been real, ain't it?

1658
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:35,145
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

1659
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:37,231
Just glad it's done, finally,

1660
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:40,442
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

1661
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,945
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

1662
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,948
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

1663
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,742
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

1664
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,452
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

1665
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,621
Thanks, everybody.
