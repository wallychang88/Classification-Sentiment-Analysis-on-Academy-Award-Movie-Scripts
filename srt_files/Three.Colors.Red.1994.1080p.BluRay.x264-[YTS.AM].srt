00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,708
THREE COLORS:
RED

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,160
Come here.

3
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,320
<i>320 04 86.</i>

4
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,600
<i>Leave your name and number
and I’ll get back to you.</i>

5
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,960
<i>Valentine?</i>

6
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,360
<i>Are you home?
Are you there?</i>

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
<i>I’ll call back later.</i>

8
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:33,655
Michel...
I was having breakfast.

9
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>First it was busy, now the machine.
Are you alone?</i>

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
Alone.

11
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
<i>All alone?</i>

12
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,840
All alone. They just called me
for a photo session.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,720
They want to see me.

14
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
When did you get back?

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>Yesterday. I called,
but you weren't home.</i>

16
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,040
<i>Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything:</i>

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,880
<i>passports, money, clothes, everything.</i>

18
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
So what happened?

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
<i>We found a nice guy
who put us up.</i>

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>The Embassy gave us money
and passports. We made it home.</i>

21
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
Michel?

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,640
I felt lonely last night.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,440
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,760
All night long,
I slept with your jacket.

25
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
I wanted to be with you.

26
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,825
<i>I can't now, Valentine.</i>

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,408
I know.
What's the weather like there?

28
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,640
<i>Typical English weather:
it's pouring.</i>

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,600
It rained here yesterday.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,815
Now it's sunny. It's springtime.

31
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,447
<i>What did you do last night?</i>

32
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:42,360
At the cinema.
I went to see "The Dead Poets Society".

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
<i>What a good movie!</i>

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes, I liked it a lot.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,160
<i>I'll call you tonight.</i>

36
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,869
I’ll be back at 7. I’ll stay in.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,800
<i>I’ll talk to you later.</i>

38
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,076
- Michel?
<i>- Yes?</i>

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
I miss you.

40
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,648
<i>Me too.</i>

41
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:56,820
Kisses.

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
<i>Personal weather reports.</i>

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,160
Hello.

44
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Lose?

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
<i>Take that out.</i>

46
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,040
Take your sweater.

47
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
<i>Tie it around your neck.</i>

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,960
<i>The sleeve too.</i>

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Like this?

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
<i>Give me a profile.</i>

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
No, don't smile.

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
<i>Be sad.</i>

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
<i>Sadder.
Think of something awful.</i>

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
<i>There.</i>

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,280
<i>Sad.</i>

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,200
<i>Now it's coming!
That's it!</i>

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,280
<i>Turn. And 6 and 7
on the bar.</i>

58
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,000
<i>And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4 and stretch,</i>

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,449
<i>and 6 and 7 and 8 and bend,</i>

60
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
<i>and 3 and 4 and arch,</i>

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,760
<i>and 6 and 7 and stretch,
and stretch and stretch.</i>

62
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,600
<i>Stretch out your chin,
your arm, your fingertips.</i>

63
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,960
<i>Stretch out your hand. Your neck.</i>

64
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,361
<i>Relax your toes.
Stretch.</i>

65
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,129
Good day.

66
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I almost fell!

67
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:06,553
<i>"General criminal law"</i>

68
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,926
<i>"POLICE ORGANIZATIONS"
Section 3:</i>

69
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:16,486
<i>"The powers of judicial procedure
conferred on certain judicial authorities."</i>

70
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,080
Excuse me...
The door was open.

71
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm sorry, I ran over your dog.

72
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,492
Rita. A German shepherd.

73
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,640
That's possible.

74
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
<i>She disappeared yesterday.</i>

75
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,289
She's in my car. Alive.

76
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,440
I don't know what to do.

77
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Should I take her to a veterinarian?

78
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
As you wish.

79
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,440
If I ran over your daughter...

80
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,297
-would you be so indifferent?

81
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,920
I have no daughter, Miss.

82
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,080
Go away.

83
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,689
<i>Don't close the door!</i>

84
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,837
She's fine.
We stitched her up.

85
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,662
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.

86
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,440
She'll need some rest.

87
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,220
She's pregnant.

88
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,040
<i>Will you take her
or leave her here?</i>

89
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
I'll take her.

90
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,280
<i>We'll help you carry her.</i>

91
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,880
<i>Marc?</i>

92
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,588
<i>Marc?</i>

93
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,360
<i>Are you alone?</i>

94
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,800
<i>No.</i>

95
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,843
Tell him something.
Come on.

96
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,510
Did you hear?
I have a dog.

97
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,560
<i>A dog?</i>
A dog. I ran her over.

98
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Michel, I'm sorry.

99
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,480
<i>That wasn't funny.</i>

100
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
No, it wasn't.

101
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
<i>I knew it was a joke.
As if I could see you laughing.</i>

102
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,351
Do you remember how we met?

103
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:44,545
<i>I remember...</i>

104
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,120
We're lucky I stepped
out during the break.

105
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,320
<i>That's true.</i>

106
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
<i>Valentine, return the dog.</i>

107
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,840
I tried.
The owner doesn't want it.

108
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,560
<i>Who is he?</i>

109
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,277
I hear an alarm.
Could be my car.

110
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
It is my car.

111
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
Wait for me to turn it off.

112
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
<i>I'm in a hurry.</i>

113
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,200
I understand.

114
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,320
Move.

115
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
<i>We could use these.</i>

116
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,520
<i>I'd say:
"In any situation, a breath of life".</i>

117
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,400
Which do you prefer?

118
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,080
I like this one.

119
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
Me too.

120
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
8 meters by 20.

121
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,440
Will they recognize you?

122
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Who?

123
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,360
Who are you thinking of?

124
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,760
Not you.

125
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,360
Well, that's a bad sign.

126
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,560
I think I know why I won.
Goodbye.

127
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,480
So long.

128
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,736
<i>"<b>DRUG</b> ...Continued from page One:
AFTER ZURICH, GENEVA!"</i>

129
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,160
You're back already?
The mailman left money for you.

130
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,720
Who sent it?

131
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,680
I have no idea.

132
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,480
Isn't that your brother?

133
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,920
Or someone who looks like him.

134
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,400
What a shame.
Does your family read this paper?

135
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't know. Thank you.

136
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,960
Goodbye.

00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:26,097
<i>Hello.</i>

138
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,360
Good morning. May I speak to Marie, please?

139
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:32,055
<i>Yes?</i>

140
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,760
It’s Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?

141
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,440
<i>Tonight, probably.</i>

142
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,347
Tell him to call me, any time.

143
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,939
I’ll let you go so you can run.

144
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,920
But don't run away, okay?

145
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
Promise?

146
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,200
Go on.

147
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:05,797
Rita...

148
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,043
Rita!

149
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,150
Excuse me.
My dog ran away.

150
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,680
Call her. She's yours.

151
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,052
Rita!

152
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
- Was it you?
- For the vet.

153
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,689
- You found my address?
- That was easy.

154
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
You don't know the price.

155
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,000
It cost 130 francs.

156
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,120
You sent me 600.

157
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
Wait here. I'll get the change.

158
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,240
What about Rita?

159
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,447
She's a very clever dog. Very.

160
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Take her.

161
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,316
- You don't want her?
- I want nothing.

162
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,840
Then, why not stop breathing?

163
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Good idea.

164
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
Have you stopped breathing?

165
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:57,496
Sir?

166
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,936
<i>If you don't come,
you'll never see me again.</i>

167
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
<i>But today is Sunday.</i>

168
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,920
<i>Yesterday was Saturday,
and you were with me.</i>

169
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,000
<i>Excuse me, Sir, I can't talk.
We're about to have lunch.</i>

170
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,660
<i>I'd ask one thing of you:
-Don't call me "Sir".</i>

171
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,160
<i>Speak to me like you did yesterday.
Call me Pierre. Or Pierrot.</i>

172
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,760
<i>Call me "My love".
Say: "My love..."</i>

173
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,672
<i>Please excuse me.
Let me pick up the phone in the other room.</i>

174
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,418
<i>Pierre?</i>

175
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:42,238
<i>Pierre, I'm alone.</i>

176
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,820
<i>I'm also alone. Far away from you.</i>

177
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:47,760
<i>And I want you to
come over. I don't want to be alone!</i>

178
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:48,849
<i>Pierre...</i>

179
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,553
<i>You'll see me tomorrow.
- I miss you.</i>

180
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,495
<i>You must understand...</i>

181
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,160
<i>I don't want to understand!
I think about you.</i>

182
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,200
<i>You're naked in front of the mirror.
But for someone else, not for me.</i>

183
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,107
<i>I want to kiss you.
I lean forward...</i>

184
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,980
<i>I touch your lips...</i>

185
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,819
What are you doing?
<i>This is my favourite...</i>

186
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm spying.

187
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,450
<i>What?</i>

188
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,583
I'm listening to my
neighbors' phone calls.

189
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:29,685
You cut it off just as it
was getting interesting...

190
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,101
<i>You don't find it entertaining?</i>

191
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,813
It’s disgusting.

192
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:37,658
Yes.

193
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,239
What's more, it's illegal.

194
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,560
Your 30 francs.

195
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,720
<i>One minute, Miss.</i>

196
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,640
You're convinced you are correct, right?

197
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,960
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Then why don't you do anything?

199
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,920
What?

200
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,280
<i>Can't I touch your scar?
Like yesterday?</i>

201
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,880
Go see this man.

202
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,080
Tell him someone listens
to his conversations.

203
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:26,156
And while you're at it,
tell him it's me.

204
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I will.

205
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,360
It’s that house.

206
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,209
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

207
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,199
- I would like to speak to Mr...
- My husband?

208
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:46,694
He's upstairs on the phone.
Please excuse me, I have to shut off the gas.

209
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,040
Come in, please.

210
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,299
<i>Have a seat.</i>
He'll be right down.

211
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,080
Caroline... Leave the phone.
Dad is talking.

212
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:27,076
Excuse me.

213
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:28,832
I'm at the wrong address.

214
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,520
<i>This is number 22.</i>

215
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm very sorry.

216
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,680
No problem.

217
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,640
Have a good day.

218
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,400
Goodbye.

219
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
I'll call you later.

220
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
You lost this.

221
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,640
<i>So? Did you tell him?</i>

222
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:48,454
No.

223
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,400
Would you like
something to drink?

224
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,960
No, I wouldn't.

225
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
<i>I came back...</i>

226
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,280
I came back to ask you something.

227
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,080
<i>Don't do this anymore.</i>

228
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,080
<i>I've done it all my life.</i>

229
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,440
What were you?

230
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,920
<i>A cop?</i>

231
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,480
Worse. A judge.

232
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,640
A judge?

233
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,680
<i>You've never seen one for real?</i>

234
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Would you like to try?
It makes...

235
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,865
<i>a lovely sound.</i>

236
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,000
<i>I don't know whether I was
on the good or the bad side.</i>

237
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,760
Here, at least, I know
where the truth is.

238
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,560
<i>It's a clearer view
than in a courtroom.</i>

239
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,600
No.

240
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,440
Everyone deserves a private life.

241
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,360
<i>Of course.</i>

242
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Why did you stop short?
Why didn't you tell him I'm spying?

243
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,200
Because he has a sweet wife?

244
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,960
<i>-Devoted to him?</i>

245
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,320
<i>And a beautiful little daughter who loves him?
-So you couldn't.</i>

246
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>Did you feel remorse?</i>

247
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,560
<i>-Or were you afraid to do harm?</i>

248
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,680
Maybe both.

249
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,360
Let me tell you;

250
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,720
It matters little whether I
spy - or you tell them.

251
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,560
Sooner or later,

252
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
<i>it'll be thrown out the window.</i>

253
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,930
<i>-Or, it'll be she who discovers everything.</i>

254
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>Someone will tell their daughter -
and there will be a living hell.</i>

255
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,414
What can we do about it?

256
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
<i>Why are you so quiet?</i>

257
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,640
Does this remind you of something?

258
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,440
- Yes.
<i>- What?</i>

259
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,880
-Say it.

260
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,291
A boy I know.

261
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,480
A boy you know who...

262
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:41,625
<i>What...</i>

263
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,920
found out his mother was a whore?

264
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,720
-Who learned...

265
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,320
he's not his father's son.

266
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,960
<i>He was fifteen.</i>

267
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,640
That man's daughter...

268
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:05,106
She knows too.

269
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,520
<i>Stay a minute.</i>

270
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,480
Why?

271
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
<i>The light is beautiful.</i>

272
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,520
<i>- Personal weather reports.</i>

273
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>- I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.</i>

274
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,080
<i>- I checked. The weather
will be fine to Chamonix.</i>

275
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,480
<i>From Chamonix to the tunnel,
it may snow.</i>

276
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:39,373
<i>And after the tunnel...
One minute...</i>

277
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,240
-I know the weather all over Europe.

278
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,615
<i>Up to Turin,
the weather will be fine.</i>

279
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,935
<i>Leave early to avoid the snow.</i>

280
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,760
<i>- This service is a great idea.</i>

281
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,400
<i>- Thank you. Goodbye.</i>

282
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,699
<i>- Personal weather reports, how may I help you?</i>

283
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,080
<i>- It’s me.</i>

284
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
<i>Did you get any sleep?</i>

285
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
<i>- A little.</i>

286
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,120
<i>I didn't tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.</i>

287
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,080
<i>It was really great.</i>

288
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
<i>We'd never made love so well,
so long.</i>

289
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,760
<i>- We learned something.
Me from you. You from me.</i>

290
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,960
<i>When I woke up, you were
still sleeping. Like a child.</i>

291
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,280
<i>- I'm older than you.</i>

292
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,400
<i>- One year!
- No, two.</i>

293
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,455
<i>- Okay. Two. But this morning, when I loooked
at you, I got scared.</i>

294
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:41,446
<i>What is this leading to?</i>

295
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,709
<i>- You sound a little down.
- No.</i>

296
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,480
<i>- Are you nervous
about your exams?</i>

297
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,120
<i>- No. About what I'm going to do.
Will it be enough?</i>

298
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,580
<i>- Why not go bowling?</i>

299
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,920
<i>- I've already opened all my books.</i>

300
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,000
<i>Perhaps you're right.
Do you have a coin?</i>

301
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,000
<i>- Yes.</i>

302
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,040
<i>- Flip it. Tails is bowling.
Heads is Penal Code.</i>

303
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,760
<i>- Tails. Bowling.</i>

304
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:09,455
<i>- I’ll work a couple of hours more,
then I’ll call you.</i>

305
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,440
<i>- Or I will.</i>

306
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,210
<i>I'll wait. If I go out,
it's just to buy cigarettes.</i>

307
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,224
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

308
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,640
<i>You didn't listen?</i>

309
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,080
<i>What a shame. It was romantic.</i>

310
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,800
I heard the beginning.

311
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
<i>They're in love.</i>

312
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,440
Yes.

313
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,920
<i>He hasn't met the right woman yet.</i>

314
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
How do you know?

315
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,920
I watch them from my window.

316
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,680
Do you think I'm a scoundrel?

317
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,720
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,320
Come look.

319
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,120
<i>That guy bought a telephone in Japan
that uses another wavelength.</i>

320
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,320
My radio can't pick it up.
Too bad.

321
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,160
I think he's responsible for most
of the heroin trade in Geneva.

322
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,760
We have nothing on him.

323
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
<i>He never takes risks.</i>

324
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,560
Do you like it?

325
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,560
Very much.

326
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,880
<i>I’ll call him.</i>

327
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
You have his phone number?

328
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,500
<i>-Hello?</i>
- You deserve to die.

329
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,491
What do I do?

330
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
Here's his phone number.

331
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,613
If you feel like saying mean
again, don't hesitate to call him.

332
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,575
<i>- At 10 o'clock, I turned off
the lights. I couldn't sleep.</i>

333
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,920
Next program.
-Not very interesting.

334
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,686
<i>I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.</i>

335
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
<i>It still does.</i>

336
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,480
<i>I haven't done the errands.</i>

337
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,775
<i>- I'm sorry, mother.
- I have no milk or bread.</i>

338
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,000
<i>- I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.</i>

339
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,175
<i>- I ate it all.</i>

340
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,560
<i>- You didn't eat 7 loaves in 4 days.
I'm sick of this!</i>

341
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,880
Go do her errands.

342
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,006
Maybe you'd feel better.

343
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,840
Maybe she's the one
who'd feel better.

344
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,680
Why did you pick up Rita?

345
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,880
Because I had run her over.

346
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>She was bleeding.</i>

347
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,158
Otherwise, you'd have felt guilty.

348
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,533
You'd have dreamt of a dog
with a crushed skull.

349
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,560
Yes.

350
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,120
So who did you do it for?

351
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,440
<i>Don't bother doing
that lady's errands.</i>

352
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,160
<i>She has everything she needs.</i>

353
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,920
<i>She wants to see her daughter.</i>

354
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,800
<i>She already came 5 times,</i>

355
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,520
<i>when her mother
faked a heart attack.</i>

356
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,360
After she dies,
I'll have to call the daughter.

357
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,086
She doesn't believe her any more.

358
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
You're mistaken.

359
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,720
<i>About what?</i>

360
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,840
About everything.

361
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,621
Everything.

362
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,175
People aren't bad.

363
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,360
<i>It's not true.</i>

364
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,840
Yes.

365
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,651
They may be weak sometimes...

366
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,815
The boy who learned
his father wasn't his father...

367
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
Was it your boyfriend or your brother?

368
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,535
My brother.

369
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
<i>How old is he?</i>

370
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,215
<i>16.</i>

371
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,760
How long
has he been shooting up?

372
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:59,465
How do you know?

373
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,760
It wasn't hard to guess.

374
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,920
I can only feel pity for you.

375
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,179
Maybe you don't know...

376
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,880
<i>Your dog is pregnant.</i>

377
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,200
It’s Valentine.

378
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,695
<i>Hello, darling.</i>

379
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,360
Mom, did Marc come?

380
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,520
<i>Two days ago. With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?</i>

381
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:45,760
Yes. Marie.

382
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,680
<i>We're all together.
They're watching TV.</i>

383
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,756
I'm sorry I can't be there.

384
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:52,861
Too bad.
It’s like old times.

385
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,720
<i>Your brother's a good boy.</i>

386
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,040
Can I talk to him?

387
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,720
<i>Marc!
He's coming.</i>

388
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,520
Call me, Mom.
I love you.

389
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,815
<i>Hi, Valentine.</i>

390
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,000
Thanks for going there.

391
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,800
<i>We're leaving tomorrow.
I can't stand it.</i>

392
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,920
Mom didn't see the paper?

393
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,720
<i>I don't think so.
She'd never believe it...</i>

394
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,855
You're right.
You should go home.

395
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
<i>Bye.</i>

396
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,000
Call me, Michel.

397
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,080
Please, call me.

398
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:27,768
Hello?

399
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,415
<i>Valentine?
Did you see the picture?</i>

400
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
The picture?

401
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,855
Is that you, Jacques?

402
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,200
<i>Isn't it amazing?
You didn't see it?</i>

403
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,415
I forgot.
I've had a hard day.

404
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,615
<i>Come meet us.
It'll relax you.</i>

405
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,418
Where?

406
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,760
<i>Not bad!</i>

407
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:53,448
<i>Valentine...</i>

408
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,015
I'm sorry to bother you...

409
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,827
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can't get in.

410
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:14,443
Those kids...

411
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:16,508
<i>Turks. Always trouble.</i>

412
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,600
I don't know.
They stuck chewing gum in my lock.

413
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,360
<i>Tweezers.</i>

414
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:32,392
Hello?

415
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,520
<i>It’s me.</i>

416
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,720
Hi, Michel...

417
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,800
<i>I just called.
There was no answer.</i>

418
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,482
Someone stuck chewing
gum in my lock.

419
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:42,280
I couldn't get in.
-I heard the phone.

420
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,169
<i>- Chewing gum?</i>
- Yes.

421
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,480
I did an ad for chewing gum.
It must be why.

422
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:52,006
<i>I told you not to do it.
They're using you!</i>

423
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:52,631
Michel...

424
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,200
<i>Forget it.</i>

425
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,844
<i>There was no answering machine.</i>

426
00:47:58,379 --> 00:47:58,929
No.

427
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,040
All I want is peace.

428
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,195
A life of peace and quiet.

429
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,620
<i>Life won't be peaceful with me.
You've chosen badly.</i>

430
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,880
<i>Did you meet someone?</i>

431
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,640
No. I'm waiting for you.

432
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,600
<i>Why didn't you answer before?</i>

433
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,440
I told you - I was at the door,
but I couldn't get inside.

434
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,720
<i>I understand.</i>

435
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,840
How are you?

436
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,040
<i>I'm going to Hungary next week.</i>

437
00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:31,576
<i>And what do you do?</i>

438
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,880
I'm going to bed.

439
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,960
<i>Go ahead!</i>

440
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,080
<i>Go on!</i>

441
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
Are you there?

442
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960
Michel, are you there?

443
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,072
All over again...

444
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:12,635
Hello.

445
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,800
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

446
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,520
No, I'm not.

447
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>Get into bed.</i>

448
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,120
<i>Are you in bed?</i>

449
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,560
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.

450
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,240
<i>No one is helping you?</i>

451
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,200
<i>Valentine. Are you there?</i>

452
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,120
No. Goodnight.

453
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,442
I knew you'd make it. Well done.

454
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,120
Did they ask the question?

455
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:54,599
From the book you dropped in the street?
The one you told me about...

456
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,840
You don't like it?

457
00:50:27,745 --> 00:50:29,647
Thank you very much.

458
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,023
I wonder... What'll will be the
first verdict I'll sign it with...

459
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,800
Civil procedure.

460
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:06,465
The inhabitants of the muncipality
of Pinchat - versus Joseph Kern.

461
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,637

Please enter.

462
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,660
Hello. I would like number 432;
Van den Budenmayer.

463
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:15,285
<i>- Did I pronounce it right?</i>
- Yes, that's correct.

464
00:52:16,662 --> 00:52:17,782
This one?

465
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:19,629
Yes.

466
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,200
I just sold the last one.

467
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,719
I'll have others this afternoon.
I can set one aside, if you want it.

468
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,680
Whose paper is this?

469
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,040
Yours.

470
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,460
<i>"Scandal in the district of Pinchat"...</i>

471
00:52:55,485 --> 00:53:01,485
<i><b>"RETIRED JUDGE SPYING"</b>
-"Listening to neighbors' phone conversations for years."</i>

472
00:53:12,507 --> 00:53:13,507
Good afternoon.

473
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,600
I came...

474
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,880
I saw the newspaper...

475
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,215
I want you to know
I didn't tell a soul.

476
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,600
I know.

477
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,308
No one. Not the police. No one.

478
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,640
<i>I know.</i>

479
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,280
<i>I know who it was.</i>

480
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,880
Who?

481
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,360
It was me.

482
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,920
<i>You asked me to.</i>

483
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,280
<i>Won't you come in?</i>

484
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,640
Let me show you something.

485
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,120
<i>- One, two, three, four, five, six.</i>

486
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:09,818
<i>Seven?</i>

487
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,840
<i>- Seven.</i>

488
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,118
<i>Won't you have some pear brandy?</i>

489
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,160
I've had it for ages,
but I've never had an occasion.

490
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,520
To my health.

491
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,320
Why did you do it?

492
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,840
Why I turned myself in?

493
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,120
Yes.

494
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,088
<i>I wanted to see your reaction
once you saw it in your paper.</i>

495
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,120
You suspected I'd come?

496
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,040
After our last conversation,
I thought so.

497
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,840
Why?

498
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,815
Do you expect something from me?

499
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,880
Yes.

500
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,510
The other day, before you left,
you mentioned pity.

501
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,358
Afterwards, I realized
it was disgust.

502
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,840
Will you sit down for a moment?

503
00:55:53,594 --> 00:55:55,298
Will you smile for me?

504
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,120
The day you left, you cried.

505
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:06,676
I cried.

506
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:12,077
And I shut off my radio.

507
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,840
<i>I sat down at my desk.</i>

508
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,680
<i>The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink,</i>

509
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,400
<i>so I took a pencil...</i>

510
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,920
and wrote letters to my
neighbours and to the police.

511
00:56:27,339 --> 00:56:29,226
I mailed them that evening.

512
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,520
While you were sleeping soundly.

513
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,680
I wasn't sleeping.

514
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:37,637
- I went bowling.
- Bowling?

515
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,895
Do you remember the
conversation of that couple?

516
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,480
The boy and the girl?

517
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:46,877
I remember.

518
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,935
They wanted to go too.

519
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,440
That same evening.

520
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,640
Maybe you were right next to them.

521
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,520
Maybe.

522
00:57:00,598 --> 00:57:02,158
You didn't like her.

523
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,332
It’s almost over.
I was right.

524
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,870
You seem happy about it.

525
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,150
Did you provoke it?

526
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,590
Yes or no?

527
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:36,667
Because of my eavesdropping
and informing thereof,

528
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,670
the woman has met another man.

529
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,430
Good day.

530
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,790
Since then, she's been alone.

531
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,870
I asked my brother
to go see her.

532
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,390
He stayed three days.

533
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,230
<i>In one week
I'm going to England indefinitely.</i>

534
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,565
<i>I'm abandoning them,
him and my mother.</i>

535
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,830
<i>Every day he gets a little worse.</i>

536
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:36,012
<i>I shouldn't leave.</i>

537
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,950
Leave. It’s your destiny.

538
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,590
You can't live your
brother's life for him.

539
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,750
I love him.

540
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,870
If only I could help.

541
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,630
You can.

542
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,110
Be.

543
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,670
What do you mean?

544
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,990
That's all: Be.

545
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,630
- Do you like flying?
- No.

546
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,430
Then take the ferry.

547
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,710
I've never taken one.

548
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,430
It's less expensive and healthier.

549
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,990
That's a good idea.

550
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,510
<i>Do you like it?</i>

551
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,750
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

552
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,390
I didn't know.

553
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,590
35 years ago today,
at about the same time, 5 o'clock,

554
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,630
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

555
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:50,430
One of my first big cases.
It was a tough time in my life.

556
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,950
I have since realized,
I made a mistake.

557
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,110
He was guilty.

558
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,750
I'm all out of bulbs.

559
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,190
What happened to him?

560
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,110
<i>I did my own investigation.</i>

561
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,578
<i>He's married, with three children.</i>

562
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,310
<i>And recently, a grandson.</i>

563
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,870
<i>He lives in peace.</i>

564
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,630
<i>So you did what you had to.</i>

565
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,870
<i>You even did well.</i>

566
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,430
Don't you understand?

567
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,790
<i>You saved him.</i>

568
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,590
Perhaps.

569
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,922
But how many others
have I have acquitted...

570
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,440
guilty ones?

571
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,270
Deciding what is true and
what isn't, now seems to me...

572
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,390
a lack of modesty.

573
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,470
Of vanity?

574
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,390
Of vanity.

575
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,670
Could I have a drop?

576
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,950
To you!

577
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,110
If I had to go to court...

578
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,190
-Are there still judges like you?

579
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,070
You won't go to court.

580
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:09,094
Justice doesn't deal
with the innocent.

581
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,790
See that?

582
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,470
It's the sixth window
they've broken.

583
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,651
Even though they've changed
the wavelength,

584
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:20,890
and I no longer can eavesdrop
on their conversations.

585
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,390
Where is the broom?

586
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,470
In the kitchen closet.

587
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,550
Put the stone on the piano.

588
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,990
You're not afraid?

589
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,270
<i>I wonder what I would
do in their place.</i>

590
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,470
<i>The same thing.</i>

591
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,670
Would you throw stones?

592
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,969
<i>In their place?
-Of course.</i>

593
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,150
And that goes for the one's I judged too.

594
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,190
Given their lives and
situations, I would steal,

595
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:33,150
I would kill, I would lie.
-Of course I would.

596
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:40,190
But I wasn't in their shoes - I was in mine.

597
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,430
Is there someone you love?

598
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:51,217
No.

599
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,630
<i>Have you ever loved?</i>

600
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:04,367
Yesterday I dreamt...

601
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:08,670
I dreamt of you.

602
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:14,550
You were 40 or 50 years old,

603
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,150
and you were happy.

604
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,310
Do your dreams come true?

605
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,190
It's been years since I
dreamt something nice.

606
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,190
Stay here!

607
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,190
I bought a ticket
for the ferry.

608
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:03,926
I arrive in England
next Wednesday.

609
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,150
At 7:30 a.m.

610
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,670
<i>Why the ferry?</i>

611
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,550
So I can visit my
mother near Calais.

612
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:18,350
<i>I’ll meet you at 8:00.</i>

613
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,870
<i>I'm happy you're coming.</i>

614
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,790
Michel, tell me...

615
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:26,070
Do you love me?

616
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:27,390
<i>I think so.</i>

617
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,590
You love me or you think so?

618
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,190
<i>It’s the same thing.</i>

619
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,350
The battery...

620
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:58,870
Auguste!

621
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,470
<i>Personal weather reports, may I help you?</i>

622
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:37,110
I've tried calling
for a few days.

623
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,830
<i>I was sick. I'm sorry.</i>

624
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:42,270
What will the weather be
on the English Channel next week?

625
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:45,830
<i>Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,
chilly in the morning.</i>

626
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,350
Why are you laughing?

627
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:50,390
<i>I intend to go there.
Or even farther.</i>

628
01:11:50,415 --> 01:11:51,575
For your work?

629
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:54,255
<i>No, for pleasure. On a yacht.</i>

630
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,870
A nice cruiser?

631
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,270
<i>Yes, very beautiful.</i>

632
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:58,590
Will you be closing?

633
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,150
<i>I'll have to.</i>

634
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,590
That's too bad.
This line was a good idea. Goodbye.

635
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,550
<i>We told you not to smile!</i>

636
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,830
<i>Be serious!</i>

637
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:48,390
Excuse me. Can you send an
invitation to this address?

638
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,790
Just one person?

639
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,190
Are you okay?

640
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,870
- So long.
- Have a good time.

641
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,780
So long.

642
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,345
Does anyone have make-up remover?

643
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:48,479
Here.

644
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,870
<i>Everyone noticed
that guy.</i>

645
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,990
<i>During the entire show
I kept staring at him.</i>

646
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,513
Good night, Valentine. Goodbye.

647
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,550
You came.

648
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,750
You knew the invitation
came from me?

649
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:37,150
I'd hoped so.

650
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:39,630
Did you look for me?

651
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,110
During the entire show.

652
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,670
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say goodbye.

653
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:49,990
Goodbye.

654
01:16:52,595 --> 01:16:57,035
I'd like you to tell me about
that dream you had. In detail.

655
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:01,407
You were 50 years old,

656
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,910
<i>and you were happy.</i>

657
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,590
In this dream...

658
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,310
was there someone else?

659
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,510
<i>There was.</i>

660
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,310
Who?

661
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:21,045
You woke up

662
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,983
and you smiled at someone
next to you.

663
01:17:24,644 --> 01:17:25,964
I don't know who.

664
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:29,793
That's what will happen?

665
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,351
In 20 or 25 years?

666
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,430
Yes.

667
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,750
What else do you know?

668
01:17:44,212 --> 01:17:45,087
Who are you?

669
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,870
A retired judge.

670
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,870
I feel something important
is happening around me.

671
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,111
And it scares me.

672
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,341
Is that better?

673
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,110
I used to come to this theatre often.

674
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,590
Where did you usually sit?

675
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,270
Where I sat today.

676
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,870
That's why you couldn't see me.

677
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:30,317
One day,
during the intermission,

678
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:33,790
the elastic holding my books broke.

679
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:39,070
One of them, a big
one, fell down...

680
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,470
somewhere around here.

681
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:47,163
It was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.

682
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,750
The book had opened to a certain
page. I read a few sentences.

683
01:18:51,364 --> 01:18:54,195
And that was the questions
they asked me during my exam.

684
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,590
Getting out of the house
did you good.

685
01:18:59,338 --> 01:19:00,938
I had to recharge the battery.

686
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,990
It was dead.

687
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,630
The storm.

688
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,990
Lousy coffee.

689
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,590
I was wondering...

690
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,270
-why you mentioned that sailor.

691
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,750
Do you know why?

692
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:50,030
Yes.

693
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,430
Because...

694
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:04,510
-there was something more important,
you didn't want to tell me.

695
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:11,350
About the woman that you loved.

696
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:16,851
She betrayed you.

697
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,430
She betrayed you,

698
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,910
and you never understood why.

699
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,470
And you kept on loving her.

700
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,870
How do you know all this?

701
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,350
It wasn't hard to guess.

702
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,310
What was she like?

703
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:51,750
She graduated two
years before me.

704
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,950
She was blond.

705
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,150
Delicate.

706
01:21:01,063 --> 01:21:04,333
Radiant.
-And with a long neck.

707
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:11,554
Her clothing was light-colored.
Her furniture too.

708
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:15,458
In the foyer there was a mirror,
with a white frame.

709
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,470
It was in that mirror,

710
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,352
one night,

711
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:24,782
that I saw her white legs spread...

712
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,910
-With a man between them.

713
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:34,312
Why...

714
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,030
did that happen?

715
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,030
Do you know?

716
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:43,433
This man,
whose name was Hugo Holbling...

717
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,470
-could offer her what she wanted.

718
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:53,350
They left.

719
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,430
I followed them.

720
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:01,430
I crossed France, the Channel...

721
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,950
I was...

722
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,070
humiliated.

723
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:12,230
Until the day she died
in an accident.

724
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:17,790
Since then,
I've never loved another woman.

725
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,030
Yes.

726
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,390
I stopped believing.

727
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:26,698
Or maybe, I have never found the woman...

728
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:33,590
Maybe you're the
woman I never met.

729
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,350
The story doesn't end there.

730
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,990
No.

731
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:42,430
A while ago,

732
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,790
I was given a difficult case.

733
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:48,645
On it was written the name
of the defendant:

734
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,190
Hugo Holbling.

735
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,750
- The same man.
- Yes.

736
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,110
He'd come back here.

737
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,470
I'm closing up.

738
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,775
Did you see a woman
with a bucket?

739
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,670
The storm flooded the wardrobe.

740
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,142
If you see her,

741
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:14,710
tell her I'm upstairs.

742
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,910
You shouldn't have taken the case.

743
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:24,670
I didn't want to.

744
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,464
At first I wanted to kill him.

745
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:36,673
I would have,
if it would have changed something.

746
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,990
Now,

747
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,790
he was waiting for my verdict.

748
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:48,430
He was building a covered
market - which caved in.

749
01:23:48,455 --> 01:23:50,375
Several people died.

750
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:54,790
I said he was guilty.

751
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,150
It was a legal sentence.

752
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:05,270
Afterwards, I asked for early retirement.

753
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,510
<i>Did you see her?</i>

754
01:24:11,043 --> 01:24:11,793
No.

755
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,270
I'm always running after her!

756
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,310
<i>Milana!</i>

757
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:23,052
<i>Milana?!</i>

758
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,630
<i>Ah, there you are! Give me the buckets.
They're heavy.</i>

759
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,870
You seemed to like
my pear brandy.

760
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:44,939
Thank you.
I have another favor to ask you.

761
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,430
I'll be gone two or three weeks.

762
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:49,861
I’ll come see you afterwards.

763
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,820
Please give me
one of the puppies.

764
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:58,870
Will the fashion show be on TV?

765
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:00,990
Probably.

766
01:25:01,313 --> 01:25:03,473
I better buy a TV.

767
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,870
I have one I never use.

768
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:08,907
My brother can bring it to you.
His name is Marc.

769
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:11,950
I'd like to meet him.
I’ll see you soon.

770
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,350
Be seeing you.

771
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,470
<i>Do you have your ticket?</i>

772
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,030
Where do I go?

773
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:48,030
This deck. That corridor.

774
01:26:50,228 --> 01:26:50,978
Welcome.

775
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:57,405
Excuse me, I'm lost. F38?

776
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:58,471
The deck above.

777
01:27:08,071 --> 01:27:08,921
<i>Welcome!</i>

778
01:29:44,617 --> 01:29:47,367
