1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,100
Although each of the world's countries

2
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
would like to dispute this fact,

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,800
we French know the truth:

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
The best food in the world
is made in France.

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,900
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,400
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,200
booked five months in advance.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,000
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,400
has made his competitors envious.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,800
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,100
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,300
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,700
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,700
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,500
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,100
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,000
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
This is me.

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
What's my problem?

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,800
First of all, I'm a rat.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,400
Which means life is hard.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,000
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,800
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,300
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,100
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,500
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,000
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

33
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,300
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

34
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,300
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,800
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,300
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
until Dad gave me a job.

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,600
Clean.

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
Clean.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
That's right. Poison checker.

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,600
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,400
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,700
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
Well, it made my dad proud.

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,900
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,600
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,300
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,100
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,700
This much I knew:

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,700
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,400
But to my dad...

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,600
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,300
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,300
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,900
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,900
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
but there's something about them.

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,700
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.

69
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,800
How can I describe it?

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
There is excellence all around you.

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,100
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Oh, Gusteau was right.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, mmm, yeah.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, amazing.

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,900
Each flavor was totally unique.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,200
But combine one flavor with another,

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,000
and something new was created.

79
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
So now I had a secret life.

80
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Hey, Emile. Emile.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I found a mushroom.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,900
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,500
He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,300
Why are you walking like that?

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
that we handle food with?

89
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,000
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,200
All the time.

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,800
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Well, go ahead.

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
What have you got there?

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Ah, oh, oh...

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,300
You found cheese?

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,200
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chèvre de pays!

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,900
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,900
And...

100
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,400
This rosemary! This rosemary

101
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,100
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'II... You know...

103
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,100
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,700
Emile!

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,700
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
We got to cook this.

109
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,800
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

110
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,000
The key is to keep turning it.

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,500
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
That storm's getting closer.

114
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
You got to taste this!

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,700
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,700
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

118
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,800
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

119
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,100
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

120
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

122
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,200
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,800
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

124
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,800
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,900
Saffron.
- Not good.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
Saffron.

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

128
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
I've been down here a million times.

129
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,200
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,300
You've been here a million times?

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

132
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,100
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

133
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

134
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,400
Wait. You read?

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,300
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

136
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,000
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

137
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,200
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
I don't like secrets.

139
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,700
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

140
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,100
while we read and cook.

141
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
Why do I let you?

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,600
What's taking those kids so long?

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

145
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,500
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

146
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,300
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.

147
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,900
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,400
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

149
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,500
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

150
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,200
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You must try things that may not work.

152
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,600
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

153
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,800
because of where you come from.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Your only limit is your soul.

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,300
What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Pure poetry.

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
But it was not to last.

158
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,800
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,500
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.

160
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,

161
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,400
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,

162
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,600
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.

163
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Gusteau is dead?

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Oh!

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
Oh! Oh!

166
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
Oh!

167
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,600
Run!

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,300
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,000
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,300
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

171
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Try to grab you.

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,300
Emile, swing to me.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
Let me through!
- The book.

175
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Let me through!
- The book.

176
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Excuse me. Move, move.

177
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,000
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

178
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,800
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,900
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

180
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,600
Push off. Come on.

181
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,800
Get hold!

182
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,500
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
Hey, wait for me!

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,800
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm coming!

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

189
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,800
Come on. Reach for it.

190
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
You can do it.

191
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
- Remy!
- Dad!

192
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,500
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

193
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
Guys, wait. Stop!

194
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,600
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

195
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,400
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
Dad?

197
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,300
Dad?

198
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
Which way?

199
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I waited

200
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
for a sound,

201
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,400
a voice,

202
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,200
a sign,

203
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,100
something.

204
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,700
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why do you wait and mope?

206
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,700
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

207
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,400
probably forever.

208
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,900
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

210
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are Ionely.

211
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

213
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,400
If you focus on what you've left behind,

214
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,900
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Now go up and look around.

216
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,900
Oh!

217
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
Champagne!

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you doing?

219
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm hungry.

220
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
I don't know where I am,

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

222
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

223
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,500
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,900
But I am hungry.

225
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
Food will come, Remy.

226
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,900
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

228
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Paris?

229
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,900
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

230
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,200
Wow.

231
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,700
It's beautiful.

232
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,500
The most beautiful.

233
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

234
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,900
You've led me to your restaurant.

235
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,200
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

236
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,700
I got to see this.

237
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,900
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,700
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

239
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
I need
more soup bowls, please.

240
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,200
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

241
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
I need two salmon, three
salade composée, and three filet.

242
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,600
Three orders
of salade composée working.

243
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,400
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

244
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,900
Three filet working. I need plates.

245
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,800
Fire seven.
Three salade composée up.

246
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,800
Don't mess with my mise!

247
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,200
Open down low.

248
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm getting buried here.

249
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,100
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

250
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

251
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.

252
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,800
Hey, boss, look who is here.

253
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

254
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

255
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

256
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,100
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

258
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
- My mother?
- Renata.

259
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,300
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

260
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

261
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,300
She died.

262
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Oh.

263
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

265
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
You know, afterlife-wise?

266
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,900
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

267
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,500
I think she hoped it would help me,

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
you know, get a job here.

269
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,700
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

270
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,900
Any son of Renata's is more than...

271
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

272
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,800
We have already hired him.

273
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,600
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

274
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,500
We needed a garbage boy.

275
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, garbage. Well...

276
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm glad it worked out.

277
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Uh...

278
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,700
I can't believe it.

279
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,100
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

280
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,400
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

281
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Which one is the chef?

282
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Oh! Uh...

283
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

284
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,700
Who is next in command?

285
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,600
The sous chef. There.

286
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,800
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

287
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,500
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

288
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,800
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

289
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,700
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

290
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,000
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

291
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
Oh, him? He's nobody.

292
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

293
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,900
No, he's a plongeur or something.

294
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,900
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

296
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
How do you know?
What do I always say?

297
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,900
Anyone can cook.

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

299
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,600
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

300
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,100
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

301
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,500
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

302
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,600
It's your restaurant. Do something.

303
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,900
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

304
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

305
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

306
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,100
Table five coming up,
right now.

307
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,300
Coming down the line.
Set.

308
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,100
Ah!

309
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Hot! Open oven!

310
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,400
Ah!

311
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Coming around.

312
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Ooh!

313
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,700
Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

314
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,900
Fire those soufflés
for table six, ja.

315
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,000
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

316
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,800
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

317
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,400
It has a wonderful finish.

318
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
Ooh!
- Ah!

319
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,000
Hmm.

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,200
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

321
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,400
Oui, chef.

322
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Remy! What are you waiting for?

323
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

324
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,700
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

325
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

326
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,700
Move it, garbage boy!

327
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,000
You are cooking?

328
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,700
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

329
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Where do you get the gall

330
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,600
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

331
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

332
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,900
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

333
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,500
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

334
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,800
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

335
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,000
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

336
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,600
Soup?

337
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Stop that soup!

338
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,900
No!

339
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,400
Waiter.

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,300
Linguini!

341
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,000
You're fired!

342
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,100
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!

343
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
She wants to see the chef.

344
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,700
But he...

345
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,000
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

346
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,200
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

347
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,400
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

348
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

349
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,900
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

350
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Someone is asking about your soup.

351
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,100
What are you playing at?

352
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,800
Am I still fired?

353
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,000
You can't fire him.
- What?

354
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,400
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

355
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,800
If she write a review to that effect

356
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

357
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,200
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

358
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,500
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

359
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,800
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

360
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,800
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?

361
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Anyone can cook.

362
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,500
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

363
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,100
He has taken a bold risk

364
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,600
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

365
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

366
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
who are we to deny him?

367
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,000
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,200
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

369
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,700
you shall be responsible for it.

370
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Anyone else?

371
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,100
Then back to work.

372
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,400
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

373
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,000
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

374
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Very close attention.

375
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,700
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

376
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,300
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

377
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,800
Rat!

378
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,800
- Rat!
Get the rat.

379
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

380
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

381
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

382
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,000
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

383
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
Do you know what would happen to us

384
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

385
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,000
They'd close us down.

386
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,500
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

387
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,700
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

388
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
Whoa!

389
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Doh!

390
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,200
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

391
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,400
They expect me to cook it again!

392
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,400
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

393
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,700
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

394
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

395
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,800
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

396
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,600
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

397
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,600
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

398
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,000
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

399
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,400
I need this job. I've lost so many.

400
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,900
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

401
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Did you nod?

402
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,600
Have you been nodding?

403
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,800
You understand me?

404
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,000
So I'm not crazy!

405
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,300
Wait a second, wait a second.

406
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't cook, can I?

407
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,800
But you...

408
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,300
You can, right?

409
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,000
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

410
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
Whatever you did, they liked it.

411
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,700
Yeah. This could work.

412
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,800
Hey, they liked the soup!

413
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,300
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

414
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,400
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

415
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,300
But we're together on this. Right?

416
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,500
Okay.

417
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,700
So this is it.

418
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,100
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

419
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,600
Not much.

420
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,400
It could be worse.

421
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,900
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

422
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

423
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Are you...

424
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,200
Is this a dream?

425
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,600
The best kind of dream.

426
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
One we can share.

427
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
But why here?

428
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,100
Why now?

429
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,700
Why not here?

430
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Why not now?

431
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
What better place to dream
than in Paris?

432
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,000
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

433
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh, no.

434
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

435
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

436
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Eggs, gone!

437
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,700
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

438
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,300
That's what I get for trusting a...

439
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,700
Hi. Is that for me?

440
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Mmm!

441
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,400
That's good. What did you put in this?

442
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Where'd you get that?

443
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,900
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

444
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,600
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

445
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
Come on, Little Chef!

446
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
"Though I, like many other critic,

447
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,400
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

448
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,100
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

449
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

450
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,800
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

451
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,700
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

452
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Well...

453
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,000
You know.

454
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,200
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

455
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,800
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

456
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,500
So let's do this thing!

457
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,800
I...

458
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,700
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

459
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,700
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

460
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,500
Soup.

461
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,300
You little...

462
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,600
Ow!

463
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,500
You son of a...

464
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
You got...

465
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,700
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

466
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,300
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

467
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,900
We've got to figure out something else.

468
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,200
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

469
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,000
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

470
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,800
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

471
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,100
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

472
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,500
Little Chef?

473
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,400
Oh, you're hungry.

474
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay. So let's think this out.

475
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,800
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

476
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
human.

477
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,600
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

478
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,800
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

479
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,000
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

480
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,100
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

481
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

482
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
We gotta communicate.

483
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,400
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

484
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,200
The rat! I saw it!

485
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,500
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

486
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,300
What are you doing in here?

487
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

488
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,900
Get out.

489
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,900
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

490
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,700
That was close. Are you okay up there?

491
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,400
Whoa!

492
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,600
How did you do that?

493
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,100
That's strangely involuntary!

494
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,200
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.

495
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,700
Okay.

496
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Huh?

497
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
Where are you taking me? Wait.

498
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
Whoa!

499
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,600
Wait. I'm sorry.

500
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,300
Whoa!

501
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,400
Okay.

502
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,600
Mmm-hmm...

503
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Okay.

504
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,300
Whoa!

505
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
Whoa!

506
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,600
À votre santé!

507
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
All right.

508
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,000
That should do it.

509
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,700
Mmm.

510
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

511
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,600
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

512
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,200
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

513
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,700
Listen, I just want you to know

514
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,600
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

515
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,100
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

516
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,600
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

517
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, I...

518
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,500
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

519
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

520
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,600
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

521
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,100
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

522
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,500
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

523
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Because, well, because you...

524
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,500
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

525
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,200
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

526
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,300
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

527
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Got it?

528
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Wow!

529
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,200
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

530
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Chine-easy.

531
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,000
- Excellent work, François, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

532
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,400
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

533
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,700
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

534
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,400
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

535
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,700
What are corn dogs?

536
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:58,900
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

537
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,200
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

538
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,600
Whip something up.

539
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,300
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

540
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,600
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

541
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,600
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

542
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
Get my lawyer!

543
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,400
Well, the will stipulates

544
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,300
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

545
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,700
no heir appears,

546
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,100
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

547
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
I know what the will stipulates.

548
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,500
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

549
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,700
There's not much resemblance.

550
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,300
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

551
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,600
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

552
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,000
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

553
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,300
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

554
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,300
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

555
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,900
Highly suspect!

556
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,900
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,600
- May I?
- Of course.

558
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,100
But the boy does not know.

559
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,600
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

560
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,700
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

561
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,700
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

562
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,300
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

563
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

564
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,300
Find out how much of this is real.

565
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,000
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

566
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,800
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

567
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,300
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

568
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,300
He knows something.

569
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,500
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

570
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,000
What are you doing?

571
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

572
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,900
No! You waste energy and time!

573
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

574
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,200
Well, Mommy never had to face

575
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,900
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

576
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,500
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

577
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,900
and all of the different cooking times,

578
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,200
but must arrive on the customer's table

579
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,400
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

580
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,200
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

581
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,000
What is this? Keep your station clear!

582
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,800
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

583
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,400
Messy stations slow things down.

584
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,800
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

585
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,600
I'll make this easy to remember.

586
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,200
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

587
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,600
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

588
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,400
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

589
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,600
Always return to this position.

590
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,300
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

591
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,300
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

592
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,000
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

593
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,900
I know the Gusteau style cold.

594
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,300
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

595
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,300
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

596
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,200
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

597
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,700
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

598
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,100
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

599
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,200
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

600
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,700
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

601
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,000
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

602
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,000
Listen.

603
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,000
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

604
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,300
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

605
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,300
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

606
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,200
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

607
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,100
Voilà! The best restaurant get first pick.

608
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,200
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

609
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,200
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

610
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,800
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

611
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,400
And then he get fired

612
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,300
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

613
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,100
Horst has done time.

614
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
LINGUINl: What for?

615
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,700
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

616
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,700
I defrauded a major corporation.

617
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,300
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

618
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,000
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

619
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,800
I killed a man with this thumb.

620
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

621
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,600
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

622
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,200
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

623
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,300
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

624
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,900
So you see.

625
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,400
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

626
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,900
- We?
- Oui. You are one of us now, oui?

627
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,700
Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

628
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,500
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

629
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,200
For taking it.

630
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,200
Huh?

631
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,200
The rat!

632
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

633
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,000
Have you decided this evening?

634
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,100
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

635
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,800
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

636
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,000
I know about the foie gras.

637
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,900
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

638
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,100
What does the chef have that's new?

639
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,700
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

640
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Yes. What do I tell them?

641
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,600
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

642
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,000
What are you blathering about?

643
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,200
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

644
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,800
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

645
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,700
This is simple.

646
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,900
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

647
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,700
something we haven't made
in a while...

648
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,600
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

649
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,300
They are asking for food from Linguini?

650
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,200
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

651
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,800
Were we saying that?

652
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,600
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

653
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,300
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

654
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,500
Something definitely off menu.

655
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,500
Oh, and don't forget to stress

656
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,100
- its Linguini-ness.
- Oui, chef.

657
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,300
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

658
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,700
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread à la Gusteau.

659
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,500
- Colette will help you.
- Oui, chef.

660
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,400
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

661
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,300
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

662
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,200
Gusteau himself said so.

663
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,600
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

664
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,300
"Sweetbread à la Gusteau.

665
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,900
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

666
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

667
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,600
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

668
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,500
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

669
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,900
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

670
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,600
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

671
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

672
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,000
Veal stomach?

673
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,500
Oh!

674
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,700
Okay.

675
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,100
I'll be right back. Where...

676
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,400
Hey, I got to... Hey!

677
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,800
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

678
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,100
Let's see, over here...

679
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
I'll be back.

680
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,700
Thank you.

681
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,000
Excuse me. I'm going to...

682
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,700
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

683
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,500
I'm going to pick that up.

684
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,800
I got some of that spice.

685
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,900
Okay.

686
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,300
What are you doing? You're supposed

687
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,700
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

688
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,100
This is the recipe.

689
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

690
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,900
What else have you...
You are improvising?

691
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,500
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

692
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,800
You're right. I should listen to you!

693
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,100
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

694
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,800
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

695
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,900
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

696
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,300
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

697
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,100
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

698
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,500
- The special?
- Come get it!

699
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,200
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

700
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,600
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

701
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,900
Sorry.

702
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,400
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

703
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

704
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,200
- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.

705
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,100
Good. What? How could he change it?

706
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,300
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

707
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Ow!

708
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
They love it!

709
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,300
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

710
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,200
I have seven more orders!

711
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,900
That's wonderful.

712
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,700
I'd like one of those.

713
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,800
Special order!

714
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,600
What is that?

715
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,000
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

716
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,800
To Linguini.

717
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,500
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?

718
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Drink now, there's plenty.

719
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,700
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

720
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
We really did it tonight.

721
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,000
Dah!

722
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,300
Got your toque!

723
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,700
Oh, seriously now.

724
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,500
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

725
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,300
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

726
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,200
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

727
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,300
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

728
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,100
He's gotten all he needs.

729
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,800
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

730
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,800
Good for you.

731
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,900
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

732
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,100
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

733
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,400
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

734
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,500
not to appreciate
this '61 Château Latour.

735
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,800
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.

736
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,600
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

737
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,300
- Remy!
- Emile?

738
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,600
I can't believe it! You're alive!

739
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,200
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

740
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,300
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

741
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,500
And what are you eating?

742
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,200
I don't really know.

743
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,500
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

744
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,300
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

745
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,900
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

746
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,800
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

747
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,100
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

748
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,400
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

749
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,300
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

750
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,000
So, where did you train, Linguini?

751
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,400
Train? All right.

752
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,100
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

753
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,500
- It's not.
- I knew it!

754
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,400
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

755
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,100
Monday was my first time.

756
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,000
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

757
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,300
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

758
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,700
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

759
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Do you like animals?

760
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,600
What?
Animals? What kind?

761
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,300
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

762
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,500
rats.

763
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,100
I brought you something to...

764
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,300
No, no, no, no!

765
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,200
Spit that out right now!

766
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,300
- Don't just work it down!
- Too late.

767
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,800
Here.

768
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,500
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

769
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
- See?
- Not really.

770
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,400
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

771
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,500
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

772
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,700
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

773
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

774
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,900
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

775
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,100
Okay.

776
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,000
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

777
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

778
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,000
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

779
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,000
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

780
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,000
being combined
into infinite combinations.

781
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,200
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

782
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,700
I think...

783
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,400
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

784
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,900
But that was interesting.

785
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,800
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

786
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,300
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

787
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,700
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

788
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,300
- Yeah! But...
- What?

789
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,400
Thing is, I kind of have to...

790
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
What do you "have to"
more than family?

791
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,300
What's more important here?

792
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,000
Well, I...

793
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

794
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,400
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

795
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,400
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

796
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,000
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

797
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,700
Nopety nopety no.

798
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,500
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

799
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,900
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

800
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,400
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

801
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,600
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

802
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,300
If you're going to name a food,

803
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,300
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

804
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,700
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

805
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,000
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

806
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,400
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

807
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,200
My son has returned!

808
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:33,700
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

809
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,700
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

810
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,300
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

811
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,900
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

812
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,100
Yeah, well, about that...

813
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,000
You look thin. Why is that?

814
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,600
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

815
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,300
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

816
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,500
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

817
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,200
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

818
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,200
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

819
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,800
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

820
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,700
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

821
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,800
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

822
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,500
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

823
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,800
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

824
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,200
We're not birds. We're rats.

825
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,200
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

826
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,300
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

827
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,500
Maybe that's a good thing.

828
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,000
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

829
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,300
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

830
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,900
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

831
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,100
I want to add something to this world.

832
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,300
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

833
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,100
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

834
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,900
I've been able to
observe them

835
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,900
at a close-ish sort of range.

836
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,300
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

837
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,000
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

838
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,500
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

839
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,500
You know, I'm going to stay here.

840
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,800
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

841
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,000
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

842
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,100
Is that a problem?

843
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,800
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

844
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,600
We're here.

845
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,200
Take a good long look, Remy.

846
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,000
Now, this is what happens

847
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,700
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

848
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,100
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

849
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,500
We must live carefully.

850
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,700
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

851
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,800
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

852
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,000
- No.
- What?

853
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:25,000
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

854
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,200
Can only be more of this?

855
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,600
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

856
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,000
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

857
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,600
And it starts when we decide.

858
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,500
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

859
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,700
Hey! Yeah.

860
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,000
Stop it.

861
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,600
Good morning.

862
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,300
Good morning.

863
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,800
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

864
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,500
That's big.

865
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,400
That's big. What did he say?

866
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
What?

867
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,500
What, you can't tell me?

868
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,400
Oh!

869
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,200
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

870
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,700
Oh, I see how it is.

871
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,400
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

872
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,300
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

873
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,900
Wake up. Wake up.

874
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,000
I thought you were different.

875
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,700
I thought you thought I was different.

876
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,500
I thought...

877
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,700
I didn't have to help you!

878
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,200
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

879
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,400
But...

880
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,900
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

881
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,200
My mistake.

882
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,200
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

883
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,300
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

884
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,400
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

885
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,800
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

886
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,700
At least not without your help.

887
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,200
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

888
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,400
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

889
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,600
When I added that extra ingredient

890
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,600
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

891
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,900
that wasn't me either.

892
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,900
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

893
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,800
I would've followed the recipe.

894
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,300
I would've followed your advice.

895
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,200
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

896
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,500
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

897
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,200
But I...

898
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,900
Don't do it.

899
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,300
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

900
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,600
- I have a...
- What? You...

901
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,900
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

902
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,300
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

903
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,600
Little...

904
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,900
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

905
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
A tiny chef?

906
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,600
Yes. Yes. He's...

907
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,600
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

908
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,000
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

909
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,100
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

910
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

911
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,300
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

912
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,500
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

913
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,300
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

914
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,000
No! No!

915
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,800
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

916
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,800
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

917
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,000
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

918
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,600
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

919
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,600
What? What? Spit it out.

920
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,100
It's come back. It's popular.

921
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,000
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

922
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,200
My last review condemned it

923
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,900
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

924
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,200
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

925
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:02,000
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

926
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,900
"Monsieur Boyardee."

927
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Touché.

928
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,500
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

929
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,600
- The last word.
- Yes.

930
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,000
Then tell me, Ambrister,

931
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,900
how could it be popular?

932
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

933
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,600
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

934
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,000
He is Gusteau's son.

935
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:33,000
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

936
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,400
The boy knows!

937
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

938
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,000
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

939
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,600
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

940
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,700
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

941
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,500
Yes. He's consorting with it.

942
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,100
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

943
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,800
- The rat.
- Exactly!

944
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,700
Is the rat important?

945
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,100
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

946
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,500
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

947
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,300
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

948
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,900
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

949
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,800
Ooh!

950
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,000
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

951
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,300
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

952
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,500
But, oh, no!

953
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,900
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

954
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:30,600
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

955
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,700
Huh?

956
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,400
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

957
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,900
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

958
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,400
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

959
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,200
What are you so worried about?

960
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,500
Isn't it good to have the press?

961
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,200
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

962
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,700
Not if they're over his face!

963
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,900
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

964
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

965
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,100
The deadline passes in three days.

966
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,100
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

967
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,300
and no one will ever know.

968
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,300
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

969
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,900
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

970
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,500
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

971
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,400
- No, no, no.
- LINGUINl: What?

972
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,800
Try this. It's better.

973
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,000
Well, because you...

974
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,100
Whoa!

975
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,300
Rat!

976
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,000
Disgusting little creatures.

977
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,900
I was reminded
how fragile it all was.

978
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,900
How the world really saw me.

979
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,700
And it just kept getting better.

980
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,400
Remy!

981
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,300
Remy!

982
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,700
Psst! Psst!

983
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,300
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

984
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,000
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

985
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,000
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

986
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,000
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

987
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,900
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

988
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,100
I didn't think you meant them.

989
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,300
Look, I'm sorry.

990
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,800
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

991
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,500
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

992
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,900
Wait here.

993
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,000
It's locked?

994
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Hmm...

995
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,900
Remy, what are you doing in here?

996
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,800
Okay. Emile shows up with...

997
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,800
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

998
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,100
Yeah, it's a disaster.

999
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,800
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

1000
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,800
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1001
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,100
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1002
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,000
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

1003
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,800
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

1004
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

1005
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,100
Or microwave burritos?

1006
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,300
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

1007
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,100
About as French as a corn dog!

1008
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Coming soon!

1009
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,400
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

1010
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,100
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

1011
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,900
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

1012
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,400
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

1013
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,500
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

1014
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,900
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

1015
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Here it is.

1016
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,700
Hey. Your will!

1017
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,500
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

1018
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,500
Linguini?

1019
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,100
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

1020
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,000
This used to be my office.

1021
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,800
He's your son?

1022
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,700
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

1023
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,800
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

1024
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,800
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1025
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,700
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1026
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,700
No! No! The rat!

1027
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,600
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

1028
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,100
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!

1029
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,000
You!

1030
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,800
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1031
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1032
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,800
Cheers, ja.

1033
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,400
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

1034
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,600
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1035
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,200
What is the secret to your genius?

1036
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,900
LINGUINl: Secret? You want the truth?

1037
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:53,000
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1038
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,500
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

1039
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,500
No.

1040
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,400
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1041
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,000
How did you find out?

1042
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,400
Well, some part of me just knew.

1043
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,200
The Gusteau part?

1044
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:12,300
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1045
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,100
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1046
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,800
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1047
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,600
Health Inspector.

1048
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,300
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1049
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,600
It's taken over my...

1050
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,100
Gusteau's restaurant.

1051
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,300
Gusteau's, eh?

1052
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,600
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1053
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,800
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!

1054
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,700
Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

1055
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,900
But the rat!
You must...

1056
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,500
It stole my documents.

1057
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,300
It's past opening time.

1058
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,800
He should have
finished an hour ago.

1059
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,000
Bonjour, ma chérie.
Join us.

1060
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,200
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1061
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,700
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1062
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,400
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1063
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,700
- It's him.
- Ego?

1064
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,800
Anton Ego!

1065
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,300
Is that Ego?

1066
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,500
I can't believe it.

1067
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,900
- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.

1068
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,500
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1069
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,300
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1070
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,600
as you are new to this game.

1071
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,100
- Game?
- Yes.

1072
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,300
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1073
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,500
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1074
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,800
You're Anton Ego.

1075
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,300
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1076
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,900
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1077
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,500
I don't like food. I love it.

1078
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:02,200
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1079
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,500
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1080
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,700
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1081
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,500
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1082
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,700
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1083
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,100
Don't give me that look.

1084
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,400
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1085
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:35,000
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1086
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,300
And that's another thing.

1087
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,300
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1088
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,000
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

1089
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,600
All right, that's it!

1090
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,500
You take a break, Little Chef.

1091
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,800
I'm not your puppet,

1092
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,000
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1093
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,900
The rat is the cook.

1094
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,700
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1095
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,900
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1096
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1097
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,500
You stupid...

1098
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,200
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1099
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,600
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1100
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,600
I'm sorry, Remy.

1101
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,700
I know there are too many guys.

1102
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,800
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1103
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,700
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1104
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,900
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1105
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,900
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1106
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,200
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1107
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,700
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1108
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,800
Little Chef?

1109
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,100
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1110
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,800
Oof!

1111
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,400
Little Chef?

1112
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,400
Little Chef?

1113
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,800
Hey, Little Chef.

1114
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,200
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1115
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,500
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1116
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,900
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1117
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,800
Look, I don't want to fight.

1118
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,700
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1119
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:53,200
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1120
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,600
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1121
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,600
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1122
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,400
people will be disappointed.

1123
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,400
It's weird.

1124
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,400
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1125
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,300
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1126
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,200
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1127
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,500
is because of you.

1128
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,800
I haven't been fair to you.

1129
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,400
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1130
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,300
You've been a good friend.

1131
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,500
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1132
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,800
What is this?

1133
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,900
What's going on?

1134
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
What...

1135
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,400
Hey...

1136
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,300
You're...

1137
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,500
You're stealing food? How could you?

1138
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,700
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1139
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,200
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1140
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,700
And don't come back

1141
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,200
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1142
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,600
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1143
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,600
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1144
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,800
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1145
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,700
Steal all you want.

1146
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,700
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1147
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,800
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1148
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,700
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1149
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,600
Come in!

1150
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,000
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1151
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,000
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1152
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,800
Attention.

1153
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,700
Attention, everyone.

1154
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,100
Tonight is a big night.

1155
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,200
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1156
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,400
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1157
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,000
And he's going to order something.

1158
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,700
Something from our menu.

1159
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,500
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1160
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,400
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

1161
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,200
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1162
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,500
I'm hungry!

1163
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,300
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1164
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,400
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1165
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,900
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1166
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,400
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1167
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:51,200
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1168
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,800
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1169
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,400
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1170
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,400
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1171
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,300
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1172
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,400
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1173
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,400
Yeah! Let's...

1174
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,000
Okay.

1175
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,400
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1176
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,600
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1177
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,500
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1178
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,400
Au revoir, rat!

1179
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,300
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1180
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,000
Yes, I think I do.

1181
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,600
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1182
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,800
you know what I'm craving?

1183
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,100
A little perspective.

1184
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:01,400
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1185
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,300
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1186
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,300
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1187
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,600
I am...

1188
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,500
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1189
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,900
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1190
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,600
I'll make you a deal.

1191
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,800
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1192
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,900
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1193
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,800
I'm afraid I...

1194
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,900
Your dinner selection?

1195
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:39,400
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1196
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,900
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1197
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,600
I will have whatever he is having.

1198
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,900
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1199
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,100
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1200
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,200
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1201
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,200
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1202
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,900
You are free.

1203
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,500
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1204
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,900
As you are.

1205
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,600
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1206
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,100
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1207
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,900
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1208
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1209
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:33,100
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1210
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
Why do I need to pretend?

1211
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,900
But you don't, Remy.

1212
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,300
You never did.

1213
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,300
No. My other left!

1214
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,300
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1215
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,800
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1216
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,100
Dad!

1217
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,300
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1218
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,900
I love you guys!

1219
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,000
Where are you going?

1220
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,600
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1221
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:16,300
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1222
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,800
It's your recipe.

1223
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,000
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1224
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,000
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1225
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:34,200
Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!

1226
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,300
Where's my order?

1227
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,800
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1228
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,900
This is what they're ordering.

1229
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,400
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1230
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,200
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1231
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,300
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1232
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,500
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1233
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,000
I don't know what I did.

1234
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,800
We need to tell
the customers something.

1235
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,800
Then tell them... Tell them...

1236
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,100
Huh?

1237
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,300
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1238
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1239
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,500
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1240
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:09,900
Rats!

1241
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,200
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1242
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,300
Don't touch him!

1243
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,000
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1244
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,600
I know this sounds insane, but...

1245
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,300
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1246
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,200
But that doesn't mean it's not

1247
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,500
the truth.

1248
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,400
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1249
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,100
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1250
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:45,300
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1251
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,600
He's been controlling my actions.

1252
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,200
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1253
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,500
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1254
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,500
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1255
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,400
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1256
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

1257
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:10,400
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1258
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,300
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1259
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:18,900
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1260
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,000
What do you say? You with me?

1261
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Dad.

1262
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,000
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1263
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,300
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1264
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,500
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1265
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,500
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1266
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,400
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1267
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,500
This really means that much to you?

1268
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,500
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1269
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:50,700
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1270
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,300
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1271
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,700
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1272
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,600
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1273
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,300
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1274
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,900
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1275
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,700
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1276
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,400
We need someone to wait tables.

1277
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,700
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1278
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,100
Please, take all of the time you need.

1279
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,800
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1280
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,500
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1281
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,900
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1282
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,500
Easy with that sole meunière.
Less salt. More butter.

1283
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,700
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1284
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,400
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1285
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,300
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composée.

1286
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,500
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1287
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:46,800
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1288
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,300
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1289
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,400
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1290
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,600
Sorry.

1291
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,400
Colette, wait! Colette.

1292
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:03,900
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1293
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,500
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1294
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,100
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1295
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,700
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1296
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,800
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1297
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,200
What? I am making ratatouille.

1298
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,800
Well, how would you prepare it?

1299
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,000
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1300
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,400
Mmm.

1301
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,700
No, it can't be.

1302
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,900
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1303
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,600
I can't remember the last time

1304
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,000
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1305
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:28,700
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1306
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,900
of having my waiter be the chef.

1307
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:34,100
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1308
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,600
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1309
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,200
Excuse me a minute.

1310
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,200
You must be the chef...

1311
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,400
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1312
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,600
until all the other customer have gone.

1313
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,800
So be it.

1314
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,000
At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.

1315
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:30,200
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.

1316
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,800
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.

1317
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,700
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...

1318
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,500
Thank you for the meal.

1319
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,500
... and leaves without another word.

1320
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,700
The following day his review appears.

1321
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:02,300
In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1322
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,800
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1323
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,900
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1324
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:16,500
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1325
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:23,600
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1326
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,700
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1327
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,100
than our criticism designating it so.

1328
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:35,600
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1329
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,000
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1330
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:44,700
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1331
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,400
The new needs friends.

1332
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,200
Last night,
I experienced something new,

1333
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:56,400
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1334
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,200
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1335
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:02,800
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1336
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,600
is a gross understatement.

1337
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,200
They have rocked me to my core.

1338
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,400
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain

1339
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:18,500
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1340
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:25,000
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.

1341
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:29,200
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1342
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:33,700
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1343
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:37,600
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1344
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:41,500
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1345
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,500
who is, in this critic's opinion,

1346
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,800
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1347
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,900
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1348
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:54,300
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1349
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,200
It was a great night.

1350
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,100
The happiest of my life.

1351
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:02,700
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.

1352
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,000
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,

1353
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,500
and of course they ratted us out.

1354
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,500
The food didn't matter.

1355
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,000
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,

1356
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,100
oh, man, the restaurant was closed

1357
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,000
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1358
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,000
But don't feel too bad for him.

1359
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:23,600
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1360
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,500
- He seems very happy.
