12 June 1940

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
German armies approach the Seine. Rouen becomes a war zone.

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The civilian population flees in panic.

14
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,278
You're taking <i>too much</i>, Mme. Fleury.

15
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,392
Why, you'll be back in a few days!

16
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,955
That's easy for you to say. They are alone.

17
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
You do not have to worry about anyone.

18
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
In 1914, everybody ran away, too.

19
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,470
But our brave soldiers held

20
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
at the battle of the Marne

21
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,358
- and they will hold again. - Indeed.

22
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Your husband at the front believes...

23
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,356
Anyway, with General Weygand, we can't lose.

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,873
I believe we'll win.

25
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,719
- Absolutely. - Yes, yes.

26
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,877
The car still isn't there.

27
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,400
Don't worry. He'll come.

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,358
He should have arrived at 10pm. It's midnight.

29
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,400
It's detouring around the jammed streets.

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
You can't get through.

31
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
The streets are completely blocked.

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Look at that.

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Everyone's panicky.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,870
- Excuse me. - What is it?

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,400
Excuse me, I can no longer

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,277
wait alone over there.

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,358
Where's the cart?

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,956
Come, madame. Sit down.

39
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,356
This has been going on for hours now,

40
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,351
getting closer, getting louder.

41
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,273
Surely they are already very close.

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Do you hear the cannons?

43
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,356
Now you are not so scared.

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,400
The shots are coming from our artillery.

45
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,960
- Not so loud. - Because of the children?

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,278
Are Pierre and Marie-Louise ready?

47
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,118
Pierre is already in the country

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,470
and Marie-Louise is dressed in bed.

49
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
When it's time to drive, I will wake her.

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,116
Poor child.

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,470
Don't drive. That's nonsense.

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,354
I'm telling you, we'll get there.

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
We should have gone yesterday.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,630
I saw a truck full of refugees,

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,797
their village completely burned.

56
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,354
You could still do it,

57
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
be free from the rubble.

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
The Germans will invade, certainly.

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
They're coming. I can't stay any longer.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,355
Where do you want to go?

61
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,400
It doesn't matter. Somewhere.
Away from here.

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Let's at least get our luggage down.

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,355
I'll help you.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
How silly women are!

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Thinking about escaping. That's madness.

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,358
Just like 1914. There's nowhere to go.

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,875
You have to hold them back.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:53,000
[bombing continues]

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
[whistle of incoming bomb]

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:38,000
[bombs continue to fall]

71
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Two years of war!

72
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Two years of worries, misery, fear, and hunger.

73
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,358
ROUEN. JUNE 4, 1942

74
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,197

<i>EVACUATION INSTRUCTIONS</i>

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,038
At Rue de la Rampe?

81
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,958
There are still some free apartments

82
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,400
across from the cemetery.

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,279
In the new block? That's safe.

84
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,039
And who pays for the move? The Reich?

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,628
I'll stay where I am.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Friends of ours have moved away.

87
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,356
Four days later, it happened:

88
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,351
a single bomb, and 38 people die.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,797
Catch up, little one.

90
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,276
The line's long today.

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,789
Oh yes. I hope we can go home to Mama.

92
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,400
Where is she?

93
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,356
She works in the factory.

94
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Where they make bombs?

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,630
Like the ones that fall from the sky.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,956
And you look after your brother

97
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,400
while Mama works?

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,197
Yes. He is very happy.

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,195
Here, Madame.

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
You're still here, little one.

101
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
You probably like it in Rouen.

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
My Mama signed me up,

103
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,356
but the waiting list is very long.

104
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,195
So I have to wait, you understand.

105
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,355
Of course. Here.

106
00:08:26,350 --> 00:09:08,350

Pierre! Marie-Louise! Come!

110
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:54,350
[aircraft engine noise]

111
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,000
Marie-Louise! Pierre!

Marie-Louise! Pierre!

[bombs whistling]

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,000
[explosions]

117
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,630
Don't be afraid. I'm with you.

[explosions]

119
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,398
Marie-Louise, my God. Come, fast!

121
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,550
I'm choking! I'm choking!

[explosions as bombs continue to fall]

123
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,631
That wasn't far. 300 meters at most.

124
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,631
300 meters? Then we'd all be dead.

125
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:48,630
[explosions continue]

126
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,400
No! Did you turn off the gas?

127
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,356
Yes, I turned it off.

128
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,400
I'd even take the tax return, if it was on fire.

129
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,356
Go away.

130
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,469
Marie-Louise, don't cry. Look here.

131
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,119
This letter came today.

132
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,400
- You can go. - I want to go, too.

133
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,356
I want to visit Papa.

134
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,397
She can't go to Germany.

135
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,400
She has to go to Switzerland.

136
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,119
Come on, don't cry.

137
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,358
You'll see. There is peace in Switzerland.

138
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,354
Soon, you'll leave here.

00:12:50,354 --> 00:14:08,350

Don't be sad, my child.

I'm always with you.

142
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,354
I'm always with you...

<i>Help The Children</i>

144
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,796
Get some rest.

145
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,799
The children have been on a long journey.

146
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,355
Like hundreds of others, 

147
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,400
they arrived yesterday in Geneva.

148
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,198
Today they traveled through half of Switzerland.

149
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
They're tired, so let's get things done

150
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,198
as quickly as possible.

151
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,789
- Is everything ready? - Yes.

152
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,799
Sister, the children should come here.

153
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
Come, children, one by one.

154
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,639
What's your name?

155
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,354
Hello, little one. Hello, Claude.

156
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,794
Hello, Madame.

157
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,197
This is Madame Meyerhans.

158
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,119
But that's too much for today.

159
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,400
Hello, my child. Did you travel well?

160
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,356
We are very happy about your visit.

161
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,358
Are you hungry?

162
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,354
That's Robert.

163
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,354
My husband wanted a girl.

164
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,955
Maybe we can swap.

165
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,190
Men are always proud when they have a boy.

166
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,628
Is anyone here?

167
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,353
Unfortunately, Dorli Gugolz

168
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,034
has the measles as of this morning.

169
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,958
Thanks.

170
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,355
You'll have to wait.

171
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,039
Bring it back.

172
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,350
See if we can call someone else to come.

173
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,353
Hello, Marguerite.

174
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,879
It will not take long.

175
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,719
The child of your host family

176
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,275
got sick this morning.

177
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,355
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,949
Don't be sad, dear. Everything will be all right.

179
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,114
Are you tired, Marie-Louise?

180
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,555
Hello, Jacques.

181
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,353
Good day, sir.

182
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,353
Did you find someone?

183
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,637
Mr. Bänninger, I feel bad for her.

184
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,355
She is so sad.

185
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,352
I would like to take her to my house.

186
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Come, Marie-Louise.

187
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,198
- And your father? - I'll handle it.

188
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,799
Good, that's alright.

189
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, my child, that's Miss Rüegg.

190
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,118
She'll take you.

191
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,356
You will feel very comfortable with her.

192
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,874
Thank you, sir.

193
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,400
If you have trouble at home,

194
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,400
we'll find someone else. Just go.

195
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,358
- You don't need me any more? - No.

196
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,390
Come, Marie-Louise. Give me the suitcase.

197
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,400
We're nearly home.

198
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,355
Give me the note.

199
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,035
You don't need that any more.

200
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Here we are.

201
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,799
Come in.

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,551
That's Barry. Don't worry, he doesn't bite.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Anna? Anna?

204
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Päuli, is my sister there?

205
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
She's on the veranda.

206
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,356
- Please come. - Yes.

207
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,359
This is Marie-Louise Fleury from Rouen.

208
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,356
My sister, Mademoiselle Anna.

209
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,400
- Well? - Hello, Mademoiselle.

210
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
- Who is she staying with? - With us.

211
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,472
- Is this...? - Yes, a French child.

212
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,400
Coming to us? In our house?

213
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,789
And we didn't know about it.

214
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,956
Where are you from?

215
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,038
What's your name? How old are you?

216
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,198
Listen, she needs rest.

217
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
The journey took her two days, and

218
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
she is dead tired.

219
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,630
Bring her to the guest room.

220
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,558
Has she eaten anything?

221
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,400
I can make something right now.

222
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
No, she ate in Zürich.

223
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,470
At most, a glass of watered-down milk

224
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,558
so it doesn't make her sick.

225
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,400
Come, my dear. We'll plump you up.

226
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,710
Omelette with applesauce and honey for breakfast.

227
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,479
We still have enough of it.

228
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,796
She doesn't understand German.

229
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,357
She understands me, right? Come here.

230
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,278
This is your room. You stammer, huh?

231
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,391
You certainly don't have that at home.

232
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,718
Tomorrow we'll go shopping

233
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,400
and on Sunday we'll take a walk in the woods.

234
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Barry will come, too. That's him.

235
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,868
You will definitely like it here.

236
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,956
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,039
I'm not "ma'am," I'm Päuli!

238
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,198
Come, sit down.

239
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,630
I'll help you undress.

240
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,353
Papa didn't say a word about this.

241
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,036
True. He may not realize it yet.

242
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
How so?

243
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,118
She was left behind,

244
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,356
so I brought her with me.

245
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
- Papa doesn't know about her? - Not yet.

246
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,356
Hedi, it doesn't work that way.

247
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,478
You should have asked him. You know how he is.

248
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,400
He'll see it my way.

249
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,709
I'll tell him when dinner is ready.

250
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,400
We'll see.

251
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,789
It won't hurt us to do

252
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,559
something for this little girl.

253
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Here, this will do you good.

254
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,356
Thank you, ma'am, but I'm not hungry.

255
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,954
As you wish.

256
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,198
She's so skinny. You should see her arms.

257
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,358
- Move, Barry. - Come on, let's go.

258
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,275
Are these your parents?

259
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,400
What are they doing now?

260
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Mama works in the factory, since the war started.

261
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
- And Papa... - And Papa?

262
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,038
Papa's in Germany.

263
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
He's a prisoner of war.

264
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
This is my little brother, Pierre.

265
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,355
You love him.

266
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,874
Oh yes, ma'am. He is sweet.

267
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,960
- You're Catholic? - Yes.

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,719
We are Protestants,

269
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,354
but that doesn't change anything.

270
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,352
Päuli will pray with you.

271
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
She will pray with her.

272
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,789
Sure. I am Catholic, too.

273
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,400
We go to church together.

274
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,038
We have to stick together.

275
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,879
And now, sleep well.

276
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,276
Sleep as long as you like.

277
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,389
To turn on the light,

278
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,557
just press the button.

279
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,354
But the shutters must remain closed

280
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,035
because of the blackout.

281
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,391
- Will there be airplanes? - No, no.

282
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,352
Don't be afraid,

283
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,116
there are no bombings here.

284
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,549
Good night!

285
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,355
Sleep well, Marie-Louise.

286
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Of course the children are completely scared

287
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
- because of the planes. - Right.

288
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
She's from Rouen.

289
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,358
- Was it attacked? - Certainly.

290
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,389
If you can imagine that - these kids.

291
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,400
Such a dear child, a little angel.

292
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
What is Mr. Rüegg saying?

293
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,799
He doesn't know about her yet.

294
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,388
Mr. Rüegg knows nothing?

295
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
[soft crying sounds]

296
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,356
- Should we...? - No, leave her.

297
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,400
of course she's homesick.

298
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,709
We'll come back later.

299
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,116
She'll calm down.

300
00:23:41,110 --> 00:24:02,110
♫

301
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,197
Hello.

302
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,470
Miss Anna, Mr. Rüegg is here.

303
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,354
Then please set up the soup course.

304
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,468
Well, Marie-Louise, my father is here.

305
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,035
We'll introduce you to him now.

306
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,275
Greet him in a friendly way,

308
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
and don't worry, even if he's a bit grumpy.

309
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,358
- You will like him. - Yes, ma'am.

310
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,400
- Where are you going? - Down. Father is here.

311
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,277
No, it's too early.

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,549
I couldn't say anything.

313
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
He still doesn't know?

314
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,356
There's always so much going on, on Saturday.

315
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,400
I have to write twenty letters

316
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,277
since we had the salad.

317
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
What can I do?

318
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,034
I'll tell him at lunch.

319
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Go back to your room and play.

320
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,960
We'll call you.

321
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,400
Don't come down, and be very quiet, ok?

322
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,960
Tell Päuli, so she won't blab.

323
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,548
I have to set the table.

324
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Barry, come.

325
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,358
Come, Barry. Be quiet.

326
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,039
Shake, Barry!

327
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,358
Shake, Barry. Good dog.

328
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,630
Go get the ball!

329
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,356
Look!

330
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,275
Yes?

331
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,356
What are you doing here?

332
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,038
Where are you going?

333
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,273
Have you forgotten how to talk?

334
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Excuse me, sir, I would like...

335
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,958
What?

336
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,356
- You speak French? - Yes, sir.

337
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,875
I was told not to come down.

338
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,639
Where do you live?

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,798
14 Rue de Lessard, 2nd floor.

340
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,196
Where? In Lausanne?

341
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,359
- No, sir, in Rouen. - What the...?

342
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,400
Are you one of the French children

343
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,356
who arrived yesterday?

344
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,351
Yes, sir.

345
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,957
And where do you live now?

346
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,719
With Miss Anna

347
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
and Miss Hedi and Päuli.

348
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,029
- Here? - No sir, upstairs.

349
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,868
- Since when? - Since last night.

350
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,389
No?

351
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,559
Come in!

352
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,875
Come!

353
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,354
What's your name?

354
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,193
Marie-Louise.

355
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,277
- Dinner's ready! - Yes!

356
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,356
Marie-Louise, sit down

357
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,399
and stay here until I call you

358
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,355
- Do you understand? - Yes, sir.

359
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,119
- Hello, Father. - Good day.

360
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,353
- Hello, Father. - Good day.

361
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,354
Noodle soup.

362
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,868
- Do you need something? - No.

363
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,198
- What is it? Did you have trouble? - Yes.

364
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
- In the factory? - Yes.

365
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,958
Ugh. bad?

366
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,400
They tried a new lubricant on our looms today.

367
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
We're in short supply.

368
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Without informing me, behind my back.

369
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,358
I can't stand that.

370
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Afterward, when things went wrong,

371
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,356
they came and wanted to apologize.

372
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,354
But for me, afterward is too late.

373
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,798
- You rang? - Yes.

374
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,355
Set another place, please.

375
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,190
I think it's time the French child

376
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
who has been in my house since yesterday

377
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,960
should come to the table.

378
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,550
She's waiting in there.

379
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,388
Here!

380
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,478
Listen to me, Father. It was stupid.

381
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,558
It was an impulse, and

382
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,797
I wanted to tell you last night.

383
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,037
I don't need an explanation.

384
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,350
Discussing it is unnecessary.

385
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,277
That's enough.

386
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,356
Eat your soup.

387
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,352
Come see how lovely it is up here!

388
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,356
Oh, that's high up!

389
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:30,440
You can hang your things there,

390
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,635
but don't go near the edge.

391
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,877
We have to take care of our clothes,

392
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,958
because of the rationing.

393
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,400
Mr. Rüegg says, in the pretty dress,

394
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,470
I look like a Swiss girl.

395
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,558
Yes! Stay up here and

396
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,353
I'll get your other clothes.

397
00:30:46,000 --> 00:31:05,000
♫

398
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:28,000
[airplanes approach]

399
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,353
Päuli, Päuli! Open the door!

400
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,358
Päuli, they're coming!

401
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,352
Päuli, they're coming!

402
00:31:44,350 --> 00:32:07,350
[airplane engines overhead]

403
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:19,350
[airplane engine noise recedes]

404
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,630
For God's sake, what's wrong with you?

405
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
What's wrong, my dear?

406
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,879
What's wrong?

407
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,355
Look!

408
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,636
I don't understand what you mean.

409
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,353
Look!

410
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,795
Those are just planes, silly girl

411
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,354
Come.

412
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,638
- Hello. - Is this necessary?

413
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,353
The doctor says yes.

414
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,351
- Hello. - Good day.

415
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,955
Can she have a private room?

416
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,639
We don't decide that.

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,710
The children are sent to the general ward.

418
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,718
That's what I want to avoid.

419
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,196
I'll call the doctor in charge.

420
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,196
What are they doing with you?

421
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,391
What about your things?

422
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,352
What's going on with you, Marie-Louise?

423
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,351
Will you say something?

424
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,358
She's been like this for an hour.

425
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,198
Stay here. There are lots of people out there.

426
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,356
I'll go with you.

427
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,709
Come back soon!

428
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,400
Miss Rüegg, what about the French child?

429
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,278
She was so frightened this morning

430
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
by the planes.

431
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,118
She thought we were being bombed?

432
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
A nervous shock?

433
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,188
Yes, and the malnutrition.

434
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,198
Nervous shock? A <i>child?</i>

435
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Because of a few planes?

436
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,038
The marvels of science.

437
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Imagine how the children are doing there

438
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,356
if a few propellers

439
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,353
can send a girl like her to the hospital.

440
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,400
We don't do enough for these children.

441
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,400
Leave me alone with your charity.

442
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,789
They bring the children here, feed them,

443
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,355
make them feel warm and safe,

444
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:21,240
and three months later

445
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,719
you send them back to hell.

446
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,354
We can't change that.

447
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,794
I know.

448
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,957
- In a thousand years we'll say - No.

449
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,400
we are just as guilty

450
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,356
because we couldn't prevent it.

451
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,352
That's why we have to help,

452
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,352
not just the rich people with big houses.

453
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,556
The working people are enough.

454
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,558
You, maybe? Or me?

455
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,399
Should I or my tenants

456
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,352
bring a child home?

457
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,114
No, you'd have to find another way.

458
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,197
For example, we could...

459
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,118
We can't do anything.

460
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,355
I know.

461
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,799
Bye, Schibli!

462
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,356
Seriously, listen!

463
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,113
Marie-Louise, a visitor for you.

464
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,356
Hello, my child.

465
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,549
How are you?

466
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,196
Say hello to the director.

467
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Have a seat.

468
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,868
Thanks, I won't stay long.

469
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,400
So, I was told you go home in a few days?

470
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,551
Yes, we're happy with how Marie-Louise is doing.

471
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,400
- She's pale. - It will pass.

472
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,038
On the other hand, I find it sad

473
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,118
that she never laughs.

474
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,356
A child. Imagine that.

475
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,876
I brought you something.

476
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,037
Thank you, sir.

477
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,391
She's probably homesick.

478
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,354
She draws her house all day long.

479
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,356
Show him what you drew today.

480
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,355
This is where I live.

481
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,557
This is the kitchen.

482
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,034
The living room.

483
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,400
The bedroom.

484
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,949
That must be a really great apartment.

485
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,355
So? She doesn't laugh.

486
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,400
It's a good drawing.

487
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,358
- I can't draw that well. - But.

488
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,478
This is a little masterpiece.

489
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,116
My art teacher always tweaked my ears, like this,

490
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,620
because I didn't pay enough attention.

491
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,352
So!

492
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,354
- Thanks. - You can keep it.

493
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, thank you.

494
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
A gift?

495
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,868
I have to go, unfortunately.

496
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,800
I hope you can come back to us soon.

497
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,355
We'll throw you a party.

498
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,352
Goodbye, Sister Martha.

499
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,630
It's only an idea right now,

500
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,355
but I think it's a good idea.

501
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,789
Right. Put it in my office.

502
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,796
But I hope we could do something.

503
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,355
I don't want to put obstacles in your path,

504
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,477
but in my opinion you should

505
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,558
deal with the problem at the source.

506
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,389
You can't keep putting Band-Aids on it.

507
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,716
We have to do what we can.

508
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,400
That's how you wanted it.

509
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,356
It has to get much worse

510
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,193
before people will understand.

511
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,278
The first thing you have to do

512
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,278
is hunt down those who are guilty.

513
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Nobody speaks against them.

514
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,470
It would be 30 extra minutes of work a day.

515
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,600
Schibli says it can be spread over two shifts

516
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,114
of fifteen minutes each.

517
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,356
That would work.

518
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,355
Two months?

519
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,193
How many children could come?

520
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,469
About 30, they say.

521
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,637
I thought about a hundred.

522
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,039
A hundred! Thirty is better than none.

523
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,628
Where would they stay?

524
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,353
In a chalet.

525
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,353
And our children?

526
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,715
We toil and struggle

527
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,799
to buy them shoes and clothes.

528
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,278
The French children are starving.

529
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,356
It would mean every shift we work

530
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,476
would be 15 minutes longer every day.

531
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,274
With the extra money, we could bring

532
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
30 French children to Switzerland

533
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,391
and care for them here.

534
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,957
Even Baumann realized it would work.

535
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
Here's what I don't understand:

536
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,950
Each child costs 111 francs per month.

537
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,400
With 30 children, that's a total of 10,000 francs.

538
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,038
We can't do that.

539
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,960
Half that cost would be too much.

540
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,110
If you think Mr. Rüegg agrees, you're naive.

541
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,197
You know he won't agree.

542
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Come on.

543
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
It's impossible. I guarantee it.

544
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,198
Here's my problem.

545
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,392
Once the factory starts getting the overtime,

546
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,400
they'll want to keep it forever.

547
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,550
They'll have to talk to us first.

548
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,400
- You? - Why not?

549
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,628
You're against it?

550
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,560
Yes, though it's not the kids' fault.

551
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,353
Thanks.

552
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,355
Thank them, if you agree.

553
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,868
You probably want to know what's going on here.

554
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,400
Is there a referendum?

555
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,358
No more than the adjustment for inflation.

556
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,353
This is something special, Mr. Rüegg.

557
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
May I explain?

558
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,359
We have an idea. We thought...

559
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,356
Now I'm curious.

560
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,400
Get it out of your head.

561
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Let me explain.

562
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,358
I understand. Discussion is superfluous.

563
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,708
I can't submit that to the board of directors.

564
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,718
- Post? - Another letter.

565
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,350
It's well meant, but not well thought out.

566
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,353
Take up a collection. I'll participate.

567
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,351
Most of the workers have already signed.

568
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,033
Then tell them...

569
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
- Someone's waiting for you. - How so?

570
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,356
I want my time off.

571
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,273
See who it is first.

572
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,469
Ah.

573
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,354
Anna brought her two hours ago.

574
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,874
She wanted to pick you up.

575
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,390
So? Entirely of your own choice?

576
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,358
Ah, Marie-Louise, that's nice of you.

577
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,557
You're well again!

578
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,276
Sorry, Miss Rüegg.

579
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,879
He just doesn't listen.

580
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,719
The matter is dismissed.

581
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,354
You're being naive.

582
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,193
Did you think that would work right away?

583
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,799
Even I had to think twice.

584
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,798
How do I explain it to him?

585
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,116
You can't explain anything to Father.

586
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Just try to make sure he understands your idea.

587
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,277
One moment.

588
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,400
We'll go in and I'll show him your idea could work

589
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
- And then? - Then, it'll work.

590
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,630
To celebrate your return home

591
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,355
I have a present for you.

592
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,356
But you have to look for it.

593
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,638
Go on. Look.

594
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,876
That is "cold." Do you know what that means?

595
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,354
"Cold" means there is nothing near you.

596
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,354
When you're near, I'll say "warm."

597
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,400
"Warm" means <i>chaud</i> in French. Got it?

598
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,358
- Yes. - Then look.

599
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,353
Cold.

600
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,115
Freezing cold.

601
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,639
It's snowing!

602
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,271
Even colder!

603
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,956
I'm shivering with cold!

604
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,549
You're at the North Pole!

605
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,356
The ice is slowly melting.

606
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,272
Cold.

607
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,277
Cold?

608
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,958
A bit warmer.

609
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,799
Warmer, warmer.

610
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,195
Lukewarm. Warm.

611
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,958
The sun burns!

612
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,355
Cold.

613
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,351
You're in the heart of Africa!

614
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,875
Watch out, or you'll burn yourself!

615
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,477
Excuse me. Hedi, imagine.

616
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,868
She laughed!

617
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,450
Well, Marie-Louise. Do you like it?

618
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
Oh, yes sir. Thank you.

619
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,868
- Did you see? - Yes.

620
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,400
- What? - Mr. Schibli is very unhappy.

621
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,470
You should at least hear him out.

622
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,400
I know. It's impossible.

623
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,470
Nothing is impossible!

624
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,957
Just badly thought out.

625
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,400
Until everything was organized...

626
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Do you have any ideas?

627
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,278
The very idea of something...

628
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,355
Do you have beds for the kids?

629
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,555
Laundry? Dishes?

630
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,036
I thought you could rent those.

631
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,038
Of course. It takes time, though.

632
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,356
Rent?

633
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,357
Hedi is right. It needs organization.

634
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,400
The Town Council could take over.

635
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,356
They could act as sponsor.

636
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,356
Someone would have to manage it,

637
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,400
up in the chalet.

638
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,278
Mr. Bänninger would be willing.

639
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,400
A retired teacher would be good. He has time.

640
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,356
And me.

641
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,353
That'd leave me without a secretary!

642
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,399
Miss Schäfer would like to help.

643
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,036
But when I was in the Women's Help Service,

644
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,400
the board was a problem.

645
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,118
Don't worry about that.

646
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,119
I'll send them a memo.

647
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,400
- Do you like it? - Oh, yes sir.

648
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Do you think we could talk about it?

649
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,949
Of course.

650
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,400
First, it needs a name.

651
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,356
You're right. Maybe -

652
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,356
Wait, I've got it.

653
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,354
Yes. That sounds good.

654
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,400
"Fifteen Minutes Overtime"

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,358

WELCOME

665
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,192
It has to be up there.

666
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
You won't see it just yet.

667
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,470
Only when we approach Vitznau.

668
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,559
- When will we get there? - Don't be impatient.

669
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,400
Hedi is already with the children.

670
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
She's doing it right.

671
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,550
Thanks for the invitation,

672
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,400
even though it was a detour.

673
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,392
We must show her Switzerland.

674
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,035
Otherwise she'll tell everyone

675
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,356
there's nothing here but factories.

676
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,638
Look, Marie-Louise.

677
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,195
That's the Tell Chapel.

678
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,710
William Tell is the Swiss national hero.

679
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,400
You know William Tell, yes?

680
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,958
Yes. I know.

681
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,470
- Did he kill the bad guy there? - No.

682
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,353
That was in Hollow Alley.

683
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,353
There, he jumped from the boat and escaped.

684
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,351
Ah, got it.

685
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,628
Slow down - stop!

Look, a school trip!

688
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,350
I've done this very trip so often with my students.

689
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,879
The story of William Tell is true, right?

690
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,400
Of course. He lived like .. who ...

691
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,278
- Like Joan of Arc. - I agree.

692
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,868
You're right.

693
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,400
Let the kids believe in William Tell.

694
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Even if it's just a story.

695
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Don't say that.

696
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,630
The latest research says

697
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,355
it happened pretty much that way.

698
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,350
No, really? That's interesting.

699
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,355
- So, then everything is true? - Yes.

700
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,358
That makes me very happy.

- Look how high that is! - Oh yes.

704
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,709
She's already become well-acclimated.

705
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
Do you see that meadow in the middle of the forest?

706
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
- Where the sun shines? - Yes.

707
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,355
What's that?

708
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,353
That's the Rütli.

709
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,398
There, the bravest men of three <i>cantons</i>

710
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,354
swore to drive out the tyrant.

711
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,351
Feel the heat?

712
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,353
Yeah, the sun's shining a bit.

713
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
For me, it feels like that

714
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,391
when we approach the Rütli.

715
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,960
How nice!

716
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,356
Our homeland is beautiful, isn't it?

717
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,033
Very.

718
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,358
She's probably never seen anything like it.

719
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,356
It's time for the kids to eat!

720
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,275
Look what I've found!

721
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
- Is that silver? - I don't know.

722
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,400
Andre bothers me all the time!

723
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,355
That's not true!

724
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,400
My sweater is ruined.

725
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,789
We'll fix it later. Go eat!

726
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,354
The kids are lovely. Really nice.

727
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,549
Watch out!

728
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,115
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

729
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,719
That may be a villain.

730
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,399
That's just Andre.

731
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,352
He's naughty, you understand?

732
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,351
It looks that way.

733
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,352
Big Snake is looking for her victim!

734
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,356
Not so fast.

735
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,954
It tastes better if you eat slowly.

736
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,278
- Water, please! - Later.

737
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,356
Andre, take this off while you eat.

738
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,476
- No! - You'll get it back later.

739
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,356
George, sit down.

740
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,278
Come, Marie-Louise, sit with the others.

741
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,791
No, thanks. We'll eat downstairs in the hotel.

742
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,277
You aren't staying for dinner? Too bad.

743
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,400
you'd rather eat with me, right?

744
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,358
The hotel has ice cream for dessert.

745
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,469
Mr. Bänninger?

746
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,637
Be careful. Don't spoil her.

747
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,870
Remember, she has to go back to France soon.

748
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,800
- And? - I don't want to get involved,

749
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,798
but the more you spoil her,

750
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,400
the harder the change will be for her.

751
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
We know.

752
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
As long as she's here, she should be happy,

753
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,709
these three months, anyway.

754
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,355
No, beat that idea out of your head.

755
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,400
There are no exceptions.

756
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,278
We can't take her from her parents.

757
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Thousands of others also would want to come.

758
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,628
We want to see

759
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,195
if we could appeal. If she could stay.

760
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
- A longer stay. - Thanks.

761
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,799
Goodbye, sir.

762
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,798
Goodbye.

763
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,550
Mr. Bänninger was angry, right?

764
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,354
He's just an old teacher, you know.

765
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,354
We still eat our ice cream for dessert.

766
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,879
Happy birthday.

767
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,196
We are not so bad.

768
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,356
We eat potatoes every day.

769
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,272
They are wonderful.

770
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
Pierre wishes you well, too.

771
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,356
Hugs and kisses from your mama.

772
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,353
Your mother would have sent a gift

773
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,400
- But that isn't allowed. - Yes.

774
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Look here.

775
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,400
That brooch works well with this dress.

776
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,118
It's beautiful.

777
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,353
That's for me. Come along, Päuli.

778
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,357
You're disappointed, right?

779
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,960
The last birthday with Mama was nice.

780
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,470
She gave me roller skates.

781
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,478
You know, you can't send anything

782
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,956
from the occupied zone.

783
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,400
Not even letters.

784
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,871
Your mama is thinking of you today.

785
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,357
She and Pierre are only talking about you.

786
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,196
You think so, Anna?

787
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,549
I'm sure, sweetie.

788
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,790
I painted this brooch for you.

789
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,196
A little memento.

790
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,358
To my little Swiss mama.

791
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,630
Put it on the piano stool.

792
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,400
On the desk.

793
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,358
No, on the piano stool, I said!

794
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,353
That way, you can turn it.

795
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,114
- What is it? - Hands off!

796
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,400
- Is it nice? - Look at it!

797
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,400
No, leave that to her.

798
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,358
- Good, then. - No, stay, Mr. Schibli!

799
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,956
You created this lovely work. - Hands off!

800
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,628
Come.

801
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,350
Come.

802
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,630
Take the cover off.

803
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,355
- Me? -Yes, you.

804
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Ah, our house!

805
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,400
- A dollhouse! - Great, father.

806
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,400
You stammer, huh?

807
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
It's okay, sweetie.

808
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,400
It's done with love.

809
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Good day, Miss Rüegg.

810
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,709
I don't know who you make more happy,

811
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,400
Father, or her.

812
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,631
- It's really great. - Look here.

813
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,718
You can turn it around

814
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,390
and open that. See?

815
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,558
and if you push here, the light goes on.

816
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,399
Incredible!

817
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,194
This is our apartment in Rouen.

818
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Wonderful!

819
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,118
It brings tears to my eyes.

820
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,389
Look, the living room!

821
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,273
Look, Päuli, the kitchen.

822
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
I've never seen anything like it, even in museums

823
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,356
Here's the bedroom.

824
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,400
Mama, Pierre, and I sleep there.

825
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,198
I built it from your drawings.

826
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,356
Mr. Rüegg gave me the blueprints.

827
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,353
Very nice, Mr. Schibli. Perfect.

828
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,860
You will let me know how much I owe you for it?

829
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,400
It's out of the question. - Why?

830
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,039
It was an official assignment.

831
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
I did it for her sake.

832
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,470
Think of it as thanks in turn

833
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,400
for participating in our action.

834
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,356
We'll talk about it over coffee.

835
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,400
Will you stay for dinner?

836
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,038
- Sure.

837
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,799
Discussion is superfluous.

838
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,400
Päuli, set a place for Mr. Schibli.

839
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,356
- Do we still have any vermouth? - Yes.

840
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,400
Anna! Through the window, you

841
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
can see the ships on the Seine.

842
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,470
Even the piano is there.

843
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,400
Oh, Miss Anna, this is amazing!

844
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,710
Too bad she can't take it back to France with her.

845
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,355
We hope she can come back next year.

846
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,350
I am glad to see you again.

847
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,875
You used to come more often.

848
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,117
- I always liked it. - Nice...

849
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,277
Now you're a stranger?

850
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,957
I wasn't in the factory before...

851
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,400
but I don't have to explain that to you.

852
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I understand.

853
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,631
Although, lately...

854
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,719
Father has become more sociable.

855
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,355
That's because of her.

856
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,550
This is great.

857
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,393
- Come for an aperitif! - Yes, Father, come.

858
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,479
Come eat, sweetheart.

859
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,354
Päuli, the house is fantastic.

860
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,034
Come wash your hands.

861
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,358
- We'll play the entire afternoon!

862
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
This is the Swiss Telegraphic Agency.

863
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
First, the war news. After heavy airstrikes yesterday,

864
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Reuters reports that scouts crisscrossing Rouen

865
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
found Rouen still in flames hours after the bombing.

866
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
All targeted military targets have been reached...

867
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:34,000
♫

868
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,475
Elise Masson, born in Valence on July 23, 1870,

869
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,400
died on 22 August 1942.

870
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,039
I wanted to live,

871
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,197
to experience peace.

872
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,359
Henri Laine, cabinetmaker, born in St. Malo

873
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:51,391
on March 17, 1904, died on August 22, 1942.

874
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,632
I leave a wife and three children.

875
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,400
Jeanne Thomas, seamstress, born in Rouen on

876
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,396
December 3, 1918, died on August 22, 1942.

877
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,957
I was to be married a month from now.

878
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,276
Goodbye, Marcel!

879
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,196
Pierre Fleury, born in Rouen

880
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:27,556
on May 12, 1937, died on August 22, 1942.

881
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Now it is completely dry.

882
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,119
We can bring it to Monsieur Rüegg.

883
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,356
Not today.

884
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,956
You have a visitor. Mr. Schibli is here.

885
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,960
- You're in for the night. - But.

886
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,117
It's late. Get in bed.

887
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,358
- Will he like it? - Why, surely.

888
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,352
You painted the flowers and everything so beautifully.

889
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,398
The beautiful flower is from Miss Anna.

890
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,796
But the others are from you.

891
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,275
Come to bed.

892
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
We'll put them on his desk,

893
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,356
so he'll see them before breakfast

894
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,351
as a surprise. - Right now.

895
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,353
It's too late now. Come, we pray.

896
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,117
God in heaven, above all things,

897
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,358
thank you for all the good things you give us,

898
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,400
the goodness that you are,

899
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
deliver us from evil.

900
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,470
Dear God, protect Mama and Papa

901
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,796
and my little brother Pierre.

902
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,354
Lord, bless them

903
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,478
and protect them from evil. Amen.

904
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
What do you have?

905
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,358
Nothing. Nothing, sweetie.

906
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,356
Sleep well.

907
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,358
Miss Anna, she's in bed.

908
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,355
Thanks, Päuli. I'm going upstairs.

909
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,350
I'm surprised a telegram got out of the occupied zone.

910
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,400
It went to the Swiss legation.

911
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,038
I inquired there.

912
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,400
It's terrible.

913
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
She doesn't know yet?

914
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,400
I don't know if we should tell her.

915
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,550
We can't let her go home,

916
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,400
not without knowing.

917
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,358
- When must she go? - In two weeks.

918
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,353
Let's ask Mr. Bänninger what it means.

919
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,956
I'd better go home.

920
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,400
The billing can wait.

921
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,359
I don't feel like it now.

922
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,356
Hedi will not believe it.

923
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,709
We don't know what to do.

924
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,469
Exactly.

925
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,959
Her mother now lives with a sister.

926
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,358
How can we know that?

927
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,796
That's the question.

928
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,358
Do we tell Marie-Louise? And when?

929
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,400
It's so easy to say "tell her gently"

930
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,868
That's what my daughter means.

931
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,119
I don't know. I have to think about it.

932
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,631
It's a terrible blow for her.

933
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,278
In any case, you have to tell her

934
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,868
before she returns to France.

935
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,356
You'll come down on the day she returns?

936
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,358
Maybe a day early?

937
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,710
It's not clear from the telegram.

938
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,400
It just says the house in Rouen

939
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,789
is completely destroyed

940
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,391
and her little brother Pierre is dead.

941
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,119
Mr. Bänninger, I'll call you right back.

942
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,278
For God's sake, Marie-Louise.

943
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,115
What is it? What is it about Pierre?

944
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,400
- What does <i>destroyed</i> mean? - Listen.

945
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,709
What does <i>destroyed</i> mean?

946
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,868
- Is she with you? - No, why?

947
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,708
Where can she be? She's not in her room.

948
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,039
For God's sake, has she heard anything?

949
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,876
MARIE-LOUISE DEPARTS

950
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,038
Drink your milk, Marie-Louise.

951
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,630
Does she have everything, Päuli?

952
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,400
There are only a few details left.

953
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,879
Don't cry.

954
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,629
Look at how she controls herself.

955
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,356
Are we <i>sure</i> she has to go?

956
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,400
I don't know anything else.

957
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,870
Mr. Bänninger has been sitting with her for 15 minutes.

958
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,400
She was nice to you.

959
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,400
It's so nice here. It will be difficult

960
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,879
to get settled at home.

961
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,400
I don't blame you.

962
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,356
Such a child is like an animal.

963
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,400
It gets used to the house,

964
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,277
gets used to the people,

965
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,356
but eventually has to go to work.

966
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,400
Do you think I haven't thought about her staying?

967
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,789
Rouen's a danger zone. If she had to go back there

968
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,355
I'd say to keep her here.

969
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,352
But her mother's out in the country now,

970
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,400
and she should be safer there.

971
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,278
A tiny bit of luck, that.

972
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Take another child,

973
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,799
one that's in extreme danger,

974
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,400
and then three months later

975
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
send him or her back into hell?

976
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,197
Like Marie-Louise?

977
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,109
And this is what we call humanity.

978
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400
If we can only do half measures,

979
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
maybe it's better to do nothing.

980
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,400
Be quiet. She can hear you.

981
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,356
Hundreds and thousands of children

982
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,272
die in Europe.

983
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,400
They starve. Suffocate in air-raid shelters.

984
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,356
Torn apart by bombs.

985
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,114
And we who have been spared, barely manage

986
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,356
to rescue a few thousand

987
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,715
for three months at a time.

988
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,638
Why don't we rescue more,

989
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,400
as many as we can accommodate,

990
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,630
and let them stay until the war is over?

991
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,630
I understand that it's difficult.

992
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,468
But if it's this important

993
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,354
there has to be a way.

994
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,400
Switzerland could do more.

995
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,197
Much more.

996
01:11:18,197 --> 01:11:21,400
That'd be great.

997
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,550
Don't just invite the kids to visit, but

998
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,478
offer them asylum.

999
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,115
There's more to do.

1000
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
Humans are slow to act.

1001
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,470
Even your eyes weren't opened

1002
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,400
until you saw it for yourself.

1003
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,960
Now, many more families have told us

1004
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,356
they, too, can take in French children.

1005
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,400
It was said there weren't enough trains.

1006
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,400
The trains have to do other things, too:

1007
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,470
transport troops, weapons, supplies.

1008
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,400
Do you know how hard it was to bring

1009
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,358
hundreds of kids from Serbia?

1010
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,197
People fear angering their neighbors.

1011
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:05,356
A doctor opened his chalet in Mürren

1012
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,796
to 16 kids.

1013
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,400
And your workers?

1014
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,119
No one guided them. They found a way.

1015
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,355
We can learn from that.

1016
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,400
Mr. Schibli received several requests

1017
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,355
from large farms.

1018
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,796
You want to do something more,

1019
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,000
more than fifteen minutes of overtime.

1020
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
But Father, what happens now?

1021
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,400
We have to go.

1022
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,719
It's time.

1023
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,356
The committee let me decide

1024
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,875
because I was familiar with the case.

1025
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,390
But I won't do anything against Mr. Rüegg.

1026
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,558
- She could stay? - Yes.

1027
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,469
Yes, but ... what are we still discussing?

1028
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,356
Mr. Bänninger is against it.

1029
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,273
What do you mean, Anna?

1030
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,400
Have we heard about Marie-Louise's mother?

1031
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,400
The Red Cross has inquired.

1032
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,400
She can take Marie-Louise.

1033
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,470
She expects to take Marie-Louise back.

1034
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,638
In that case, we have

1035
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
nothing left to decide.

1036
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,400
If we think it's so hard to let Marie-Louise go,

1037
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,358
how do you think her mother feels?

1038
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,356
Well, then, Marie-Louise...

1039
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,198
Goodbye, Marie-Louise.

1040
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,958
Be well. Be safe.

1041
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,192
Goodbye, my dear.

1042
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
Mr. Rüegg, I don't want to go.

1043
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,118
I cannot go!

1044
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,400
Why can't I stay, Mr. Rüegg?

1045
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,469
Listen, Marie-Louise.

1046
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,354
Don't you want to see your mother again?

1047
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,795
Of course. But why not bring her here, too?

1048
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,878
We'd be happy here.

1049
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,356
In Rouen we'll die, like Pierre.

1050
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,875
Calm down.

1051
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
Sister, take her in.

1052
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,355
Come on, we have to get in.

1053
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,556
You can wave from the window.

1054
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,354
- Goodbye, Marie-Louise. - I don't want to go!

1055
01:15:29,350 --> 01:16:00,000
♫

1056
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
[train crossing signal]

1057
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,400
Sit down, kids!

1058
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,400
We'll come to the nearest train station soon.

1059
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,630
You too, yes.

1060
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,709
- This is reserved.

1061
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,355
I'll move, then.

1062
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Are these French children?

1063
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,550
- Yes. They're going home. - Poor things.

1064
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,353
Have an apple.

1065
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,352
Thank you, sir.

1066
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,799
Slowly, slowly!

1067
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,400
Yes, you get one too.

1068
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,277
One at a time.

1069
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,356
This one's good, too.

1070
01:17:13,000 --> 01:19:11,000
♫

1071
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,400
Now they should be in Langenthal.

1072
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,358
5:20pm, Burgdorf.

1073
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,718
5:43pm, Bern.

1074
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,359
At half past eight they arrive in Geneva.

1075
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,358
- Are you going into the office today? - No.

1076
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,960
They can work without me.

1077
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,354
Could we have given her more?

1078
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,719
More food? More things to help?

1079
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,355
We gave as much as we were allowed.

1080
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,400
I can still hear her

1081
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,278
running down the stairs, laughing.

1082
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,356
You have to accept she's gone.

1083
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,356
That's easy for you to say.

1084
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,628
I know I shouldn't

1085
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,356
have gotten so involved with her.

1086
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,799
You're better off

1087
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,358
because you're letting it hurt you less.

1088
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,118
Yes, Father.

1089
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,355
What are you doing?

1090
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,114
Leave the track immediately!

1091
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,356
There are trains here!

1092
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,352
Don't let me catch you here again!

1093
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,353
Hey, little one!

1094
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,719
- Mr. Rüegg. - Yes -

1095
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,355
Mr. Bänninger wants to speak to you.

1096
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,799
Yes, Mr. Bänninger.

1097
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,400
I just want to tell you something.

1098
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,358
Don't be scared.

1099
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,198
I just got a call,

1100
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,630
from the train ... so ...

1101
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,356
- Your Marie-Louise. - What about her?

1102
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,351
Everything is alright.

1103
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,558
She probably didn't know what to do

1104
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,400
and got out.

1105
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,392
- Of the train? - No, the station.

1106
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,118
She ran away?

1107
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,958
Yes, in a way,

1108
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,958
but we found her.

1109
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,958
I came ahead, to tell you.

1110
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,356
- They'll bring her to you. - Who?

1111
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,195
- The person who found her. - Oh, my God.

1112
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,035
So, Herr Rüegg,

1113
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,868
Your little runaway is back.

1114
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,038
An unexpected reunion, right?

1115
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,358
Don't cry. You're home now.

1116
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,277
- What have you done? - Forgive me!

1117
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,400
I won't do it again.

1118
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,472
I won't do it again. Forgive me.

1119
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,353
I will never do it again.

1120
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,356
I'll never do it again.

1121
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Calm down now.

1122
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,356
I would put her to bed now.

1123
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,273
I agree. Come, Päuli.

1124
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,470
She just followed the train back.

1125
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,558
Yes. Home.

1126
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,039
I said yes, such a child is like an animal.

1127
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,277
Yes, and now?

1128
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,460
Thinking about it, the only solution I see:

1129
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,353
tonight, she should sleep here

1130
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,716
and tomorrow she can come to the chalet with me.

1131
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,559
She can recover there.

1132
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,355
Fine.

1133
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,358
Make way for your new comrade.

1134
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,352
Andre, listen!

1135
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,353
What honor!

1136
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,400
- Aren't you hungry? - No, thanks.

1137
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,400
Being around other kids will be good for her.

1138
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,400
I wouldn't have come along.

1139
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,400
That was very nice of you.

1140
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,550
It will make her transition easier.

1141
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,400
- She's not eating. - She probably isn't hungry.

1142
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,197
Maybe she's scared.

1143
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,400
Tell me: are you going to eat that?

1144
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,400
- No? Then give it to me. - No!

1145
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,868
You don't seem to understand

1146
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,357
that my word is law here. Give it to me!

1147
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,118
Andre!

1148
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,034
Come down immediately! This is dangerous.

1149
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,355
- Who owns the plate? - Marie-Louise!

1150
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,272
Take him!

1151
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,400
That's enough!

1152
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,470
In with you! No dessert for you!

1153
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,479
Oh, you don't want to? I'll take that.

1154
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,359
Sit down. Not a peep from you. Understand?

1155
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,876
You make my life difficult.

1156
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,400
- What's going on? - You should spank him.

1157
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,358
He took Marie-Louise's plate.

1158
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:24,350
Say, kid, why are you acting like such a girl?

1159
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,400
Why did you not beat her?

1160
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,799
She's weak.

1161
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,116
She wouldn't have put up a fight.

1162
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,958
Me, beat up a girl?

1163
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,400
Where do you think?

1164
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,358
Oh, you don't want to be a kid any more.

1165
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,477
You think you're a man already?

1166
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,400
If you are, then you have to think carefully

1167
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,400
about what you do.

1168
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,359
Finally, someone who understands me.

1169
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,352
You'd be fine with him.

1170
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,351
Take the kid home with you.

1171
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,400
- Which? - That's a great idea.

1172
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,400
That would do us a huge favor.

1173
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,628
I like that.

1174
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,718
Seriously: he's not malicious,

1175
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,798
but we don't have enough time for him.

1176
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,355
He needs individual attention.

1177
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,636
- You're crazy. - Yes, Father!

1178
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,400
Anna would be happy

1179
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,400
and it would bring life to our house.

1180
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,400
I agree. Listen to Andre.

1181
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,868
Do you want to go with this gentleman

1182
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,639
and live with his family for a while?

1183
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,276
With him? Why not, if I can help.

1184
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,197
Stop. Nothing will come of it.

1185
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,470
I've already heard about your house,

1186
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,956
and all its comforts.

1187
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,355
It would be a great honor.

1188
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,400
Do you have a ping-pong table?

1189
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,358
Andre, you should be very happy.

1190
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,400
That goes without saying.

1191
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,389
You know me.

1192
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,400
Discussion is superfluous. I have to go.

1193
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,400
The train leaves in ten minutes.

1194
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,958
- Where's my hat? - Below.

1195
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,469
Goodbye.

1196
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,358
Don't go. There will be tears if you do.

1197
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,198
That's better. Goodbye, Hedi.

1198
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,358
- Goodbye. - Thanks.

1199
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,469
Eat something.

1200
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,115
The others are eating well.

1201
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,400
I'm ready, sir.

1202
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,400
What?

1203
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,400
Courage! I hope your experiences with me

1204
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,038
won't be too bad.

1205
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,356
That's nice. Take him with you.

1206
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,556
You'll enjoy it.

1207
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,354
In God's name.

1208
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,273
I take it as a kind of punishment.

1209
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,719
Come!

1210
01:28:03,710 --> 01:29:00,000
♫

1211
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,400
We made this album together.

1212
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,190
Last week, in the evening, with the kids.

1213
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,400
A good memory for later.

1214
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,277
Also for the kids.

1215
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,275
It was a good start

1216
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,630
but they didn't finish it.

1217
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,356
If no more children can come,

1218
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,400
you should keep the ones that are here.

1219
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,356
They don't want to stay.

1220
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,355
Look.

1221
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,354
<i>"When everything is reborn with hope"</i>

1222
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,356
That's what Marie-Louise wrote.

1223
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,119
<i>"I'd like to see Normandy again."</i>

1224
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,860
Do the kids know the Nazis have occupied France?

1225
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,400
You know what they can expect:

1226
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,400
hunger and misery.

1227
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,400
But they still want to go home.

1228
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,119
They want to go back where they came from.

1229
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,356
They'll have a very hard time.

1230
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,719
But I think... or better, I <i>hope,</i>

1231
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,356
that the children who survive this war

1232
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,356
will rebuild their countries,

1233
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,556
not just houses and cities.

1234
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,196
Something bigger. Something more important.

1235
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,356
You understand me.

1236
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,119
- Do you want to go? - Yes.

1237
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,351
See you at the station tomorrow.

1238
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,400
- Mr. Rüegg is coming too. - With Andre.

1239
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,038
The good Andre.

1240
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,400
- He destroyed half the house? - Nearly.

1241
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,709
Luckily, Hedi is traveling to Geneva.

1242
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,400
Otherwise he'd pull the emergency brake

1243
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,392
or dismantle the engine.

1244
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,709
- Mr. Bänninger. - Until tomorrow.

1245
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,195
- Mr. Bänninger. - Yes.

1246
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,356
Marie-Louise.

1247
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,400
You can't sleep?

1248
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,400
I can sleep a long time on the train.

1249
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,400
The ride isn't that bad.

1250
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,356
You'll have company.

1251
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,400
Tomorrow evening, you'll be in Geneva

1252
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,356
and the day after tomorrow, at home.

1253
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,358
Yes, my mama will pick me up.

1254
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,390
She writes that she will come to the station.

1255
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,873
When she says it,

1256
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,958
you can count on it.

1257
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,351
I know.

1258
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,472
Do you look forward to the journey this time?

1259
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,354
Yes, like all the other kids.

1260
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,359
Now you really need to sleep.

1261
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,396
Mr. Bänninger.

1262
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,400
This time I won't run away.

1263
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,549
Promise.

1264
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,119
- Everything ready? - Yes, sir.

1265
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,400
- Are they all here? - Yes.

1266
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
- Nothing forgotten? - No, sir.

1267
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,038
Good. Let's go.

1268
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,400
Mr. Bänninger, thank you for everything,

1269
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
and for the holiday

1270
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,356
we were able to spend here.

1271
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,353
Very good, kids, very good.

1272
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,355
Listen, kids.

1273
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,557
We still have time.

1274
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,390
You don't have to say thank you,

1275
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,354
but I have something to tell you.

1276
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,352
You're going home now.

1277
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,352
What will you do when you are home?

1278
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,352
What will you do then?

1279
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,119
We have to obey our parents.

1280
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,352
Good. That's right.

1281
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:34,400
Above all, love your siblings and parents.

1282
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,400
You've experienced hard times.

1283
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,870
Help them with their suffering and grief.

1284
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:49,390
Tell your parents we wish the war would end soon

1285
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,354
and that peace would reign again.

1286
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,036
Let's finish with a little song.

1287
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,358
What should we sing? Any ideas?

1288
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,400
- No one? Marie-Louise? - <i>"Ma Normandie."</i>

1289
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,278
Good. We'll sing that.

1290
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:16,196
<i>When everything is born again</i>

1291
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,400
<i>in the hope that winter flees</i>

1292
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,790
<i>and France's sky shines magnificently</i>

1293
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,357
<i>When the sun returns more gently</i>

1294
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,389
<i>When nature becomes green again</i>

1295
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,275
<i>The swallows find their hoard</i>

1296
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,392
<i>I like to see my Normandy</i>

1297
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:43,709
<i>The country of my birth</i>

1298
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:48,400
<i>I saw the green of Helvetia</i>

1299
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,552
<i>and its chalets and glaciers</i>

1300
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,549
<i>I know Italy's sky</i>

1301
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,356
<i>Venice, and its gondoliers</i>

1302
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,398
<i>At every home I greeted</i>

1303
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,355
<i>I said to myself: it is not a place</i>

1304
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,030
<i>As beautiful as my Normandy</i>
<i>As beautiful as my Normandy</i>

1305
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,871
<i>the land of my birth."</i>

1306
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,551
- Pity. - It's a shame.

1307
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,115
Everything worked perfectly.

1308
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,195
Our workers were enthusiastic.

1309
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,039
We bought the house

1310
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,400
and no children are allowed to come.

1311
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,400
It's still good, Mr. Bänninger.

1312
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,400
The war won't last forever.

1313
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,958
How happy will the people be

1314
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,400
in those ruined cities

1315
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,960
if they can send us their children.

1316
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,400
True. You're right.

1317
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,470
Then we're ready.

1318
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,356
For those who will come in the future.

1319
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,355
Come on!

1320
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,879
- Let's get the kids to Geneva. - Yes.

1321
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,470
- Hello, Hedi. - Good day, Father.

1322
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,789
Hello, Anna. Hello, Andre.

1323
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,391
Look, Andre, and Mr. Rüegg?

1324
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,400
Actually, we got along quite well.

1325
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,868
I'm happy. Forgive me again

1326
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:18,198
for breaking your central heating.

1327
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,391
Let's not talk about it any more. It's fixed.

1328
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,273
Thank you, sir.

1329
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,356
Go!

1330
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,351
Mama writes that she's fine

1331
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,351
and can hardly wait to see me.

1332
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,796
It will be good to see your mama again.

1333
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,354
Oh, yes.

1334
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,118
Thank you for everything, Mr. Rüegg.

1335
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,719
Thank you, Miss Anna.

1336
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,798
Goodbye, Mr. Schibli.

1337
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,036
Many thanks, Mr. Schibli.

1338
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,355
Wait, there's something else.

1339
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,400
Did you notice that your bicycle valve

1340
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,799
was wide open every morning?

1341
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,354
The Velo valve? Yes.

1342
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,355
- That was me. - Why?

1343
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,960
Jealousy. I like Miss Anna, too.

1344
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,358
Don't worry. You can have her.

1345
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,400
Listen, friend. You're totally crazy.

1346
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,400
Me and Anna?

1347
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,391
Do you think I don't have eyes in my head?

1348
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,400
Discussion is superfluous.

1349
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,197
A girl once told me

1350
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,879
that love overcomes every obstacle.

1351
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,355
Andre, in with you!

1352
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:24,390
- At least in France! - Salut, Andre!

1353
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,278
Again, thanks for everything!

1354
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,400
I don't say goodbye, I say "until we meet again."

1355
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,630
- Until we meet again!

1356
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,709
Long live Switzerland!

1357
01:38:48,000 --> 01:39:29,000
♫
