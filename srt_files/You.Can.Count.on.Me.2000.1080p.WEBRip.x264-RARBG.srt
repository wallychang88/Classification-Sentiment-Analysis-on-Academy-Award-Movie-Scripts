00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,268
It's nice.

Well, you know,
it's pretty much

175
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,445
I had a very similar
reaction to it.

00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,162
Uh...

177
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,204
Uh...

178
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,473
Can I get that
money from you?

00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:49,076

Yeah.

183
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,545
Can you borrow
some more
from your brother?

184
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,481
Well, that would involve
speaking to him.

185
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,653
Well, I'm definitely
gonna be gone

186
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,156
for a couple
of days, Sheila.
I mean...

187
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,859
Why do you have
to stay for so long?

188
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:16,598
Because my sister
is not a bank, okay?
I can't just show up...

189
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,867
You seem to think
my brother's a bank.

00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,571
Can we just cut
the puerile crap?

191
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,944
I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can, okay?

I'll call you tonight.

you'd been to Alaska?

245

and I got on
the wrong bus.

dressed up, too.

been lately, Terry?

Uh, no,
I haven't been...

269
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,554
I got a postcard
from you from Alaska.

270
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,592
Yeah, yeah.
I was out there
for a little while.

271
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:04,927
That was in
the fall, Terry.

272
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,698
Yeah. I know.
I've been out of touch.

273
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,134
I was a little worried.
I mean...

274
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,704
I've been to a lot
of different places.

275
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:13,044
Uh, I was down in Florida
for a little while.

276
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:16,183
Uh, I was doing some
work in Orlando.

277
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:18,054
Man, I've been
all over the place.

278
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:23,732
Well, I wish you
had just let me know
you were okay.

279
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:26,303
Yeah, I didn't realize
it had been so long.

for a while?

Well, I don't know.

283
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:40,699
Uh, I got all these things
I got to do back in Worcester.

284
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,837
Oh.

285
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,574
So I'm probably
not gonna be able

286
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,343
to stay for more
than a day or so.

287
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:49,149
Oh.

288
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,786
I mean, I'm trying
to keep to
a schedule of sorts.

289
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:51,988
Mmm-hmm.

290
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:54,392

291
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,196
I just...
That's all right.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

292
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:59,269
It's a very worthy story,
but I won't trouble
you with it right now.

294
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,197
Are you
expecting someone?

295
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,069
Who would I
be expecting here?

296
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,873
You just keep
looking around,
that's all.

297
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,644
I was just, you know,
actually wondering

298
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:22,115
if we could get some more
refreshments, actually.

299
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:36,443
I actually gotta confess
to you, Sammy,

300
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:40,051
that the reason that
you may not have heard
from me for a while

301
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:42,021
is that...

302
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:46,496
I've been unable
to write on the account
of the fact that

303
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:52,743
I was in jail
for a little while.

304
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:55,949
You were what?

305
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:58,855
I served a little time,
I guess, down in Florida.

306
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,993
It was just for...
It was for bullshit.
What?

307
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,830
It was for bullshit.
What did you do?

308
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,234
I didn't do anything.
Does it occur to you
that maybe I was wronged?

309
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,171
No! Oh, my God!
Well...
Would you please...

310
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,476
Please let me tell
you what happened.
What happened?

311
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,313
I got into a fight in
a bar down in Florida.

312
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:14,219
Which I was not the one
who instigated it at all.

313
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:15,889
Then they worked up
all this bullshit
against me

314
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,559
and threw me in the pen
for three months.

315
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,864
I didn't write you 'cause
I didn't want you
to get all upset about it.

316
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,066
I just figured that
you would figure

317
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,402
I was on the road
for a little while.

318
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,805
It was stupid.
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,776
I didn't mean
to make you worry.

320
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:27,780
But you wanna
know what?

321
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,149
I can't run around
doing stuff

322
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,986
or not doing stuff
because it's gonna
make you worry.

323
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:33,424
Because then I come back here,
I tell you about
my fucking traumas,

324
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:35,161
and I get this wounded
little, "I've let you down"
bullshit

325
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,330
over and over again.

326
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,537
It just cramps me.
I just wanna get
out from under it.

327
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,173
And now I'm back
in this fucking hole

328
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,408
explaining myself
to you again.

329
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,578
Will you please stop
cursing at me?

330
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:44,914
I realize that
I'm in no position

331
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,684
to basically say
anything ever,

332
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:48,087
but it's not like
I'm down there

333
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,557
in some redneck bar
in Florida,

334
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:51,828
I'm having an argument
with some
stripper's boyfriend

335
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:54,032
and I suddenly say to myself,
"Hey, this would be
a great time

336
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,301
"to really stick it to Sammy

337
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,771
"and get myself locked up
for a few months."

338
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,342
Hey! You don't write me
for six months.

339
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:01,012
I don't know
where you are!
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,583
I don't know if
you're alive or dead!

341
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,486
I'm sorry.
And then you show up
out of nowhere.

342

than you at everything,

kind of insulting.

Can I say something here?

1032
01:09:03,178 --> 01:09:07,086

come talk to you
because it's her opinion

what you're looking for

been looking for it.

1035
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:12,764

do anything

the same thing I told her,

1039
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,312
which is that as
far as I'm concerned,

1040
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:22,818
the only way she can help you
is by her example,

a model for you

to me, I guess,

it's important?

have said yes.

engaged to you

speaking to me?

I'm really sorry that
you're so mad at me,

1529
01:36:48,371 --> 01:36:51,144
but I only did what I
thought I had to do.

1530
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:54,585
And I just hope you
don't stay mad at me
for the rest of your life.

cut this out!

you're talking about.

to be sorry!

where I'm going.

I do. I'm going
back to Worcester.

and see that girl.

what happens there,

1630
01:44:20,509 --> 01:44:23,114
I'm gonna try and see
if there's some work
for me out west.

1631
01:44:23,114 --> 01:44:24,884
And if there is,
I'm gonna go out
there this summer

and I'm gonna
make some money.

01:44:26,186 --> 01:44:29,159
And if there isn't,
I'll figure something
else out.

01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:32,533
Maybe I'll stay
in the east.
I don't know.

beautiful,
and it just...

1637
01:44:38,979 --> 01:44:41,183
It made me feel good.

1638
01:44:41,183 --> 01:44:42,987
And before things
got so messed up,

1639
01:44:42,987 --> 01:44:45,391
I was doing
pretty well out there.

stay here, Sammy.

I don't want
to live here.

1643
01:44:55,646 --> 01:44:58,284
