1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,830
Ten-hut!

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,830
Be seated.

3
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,460
Now, I want you to remember...

4
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,670
that no bastard ever won a war...

5
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,010
by dying for his country.

6
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,560
He won it...

7
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,400
by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.

8
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,940
Men...

9
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,860
all this stuff you've heard
about America not wanting to fight...

10
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,240
wanting to stay out of the war...

11
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,740
is a lot of horse dung.

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,370
Americans...

13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,250
traditionally love to fight.

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,750
All real Americans love
the sting of battle.

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
When you were kids...

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,890
you all admired
the champion marble shooter...

17
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,680
the fastest runner, big-league
ball players, the toughest boxers.

18
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,810
Americans love a winner...

19
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,940
and will not tolerate a loser.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,690
Americans play to win all the time.

21
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,860
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed.

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,910
That's why Americans have never lost
and will never lose a war...

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,460
because the very thought
of losing...

24
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,000
is hateful to Americans.

25
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,710
Now...

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,090
an army is a team.

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,430
It lives, eats, sleeps,
fights as a team.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,600
This individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap.

29
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,930
The bilious bastards who wrote
that stuff about individuality...

30
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,600
for the Saturday Evening Post...

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,610
don't know anything more about real
battle than they do about fornicating.

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,070
Now we have the finest food
and equipment...

33
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,410
the best spirit...

34
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,120
and the best men in the world.

35
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,580
You know...

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,460
by God, I actually pity those poor
bastards we're going up against.

37
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,920
By God, I do.

38
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,050
We're not just going to shoot
the bastards...

39
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,510
we're going to cut out
their living guts...

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,600
and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks.

41
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,770
We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.

42
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,860
Now...

43
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,990
some of you boys...

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,490
I know are wondering...

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,280
whether or not you'll chicken out
under fire. Don't worry about it.

46
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,830
I can assure you...

47
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,540
that you will all do your duty.

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,880
The Nazis...

49
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
are the enemy.

50
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,470
Wade into them!

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,140
Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,560
When you put your hand...

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,480
into a bunch of goo...

54
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,440
that a moment before was
your best friend's face...

55
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,400
you'll know what to do.

56
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,200
There's another thing
I want you to remember.

57
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,660
I don't want to get any messages
saying we are "holding our position."

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,620
We're not "holding" anything.
Let the Hun do that.

59
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,460
We're advancing constantly. We're not
interested in holding on to anything...

60
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,510
except the enemy.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,510
We're going to hold on to him
by the nose and kick him in the ass.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,970
We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time...

63
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,930
and we're going to go through him
like crap through a goose!

64
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,480
Now...

65
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,070
there's one thing...

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,440
that you men will be able to say
when you get back home.

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,570
And you may thank God for it.

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,990
Thirty years from now when you're
sitting around your fireside...

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,710
with your grandson on your knee...

70
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,250
and he asks you:

71
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,960
"What did you do in the great
World War II?"

72
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,090
You won't have to say:

73
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,220
"Well...

74
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,600
I shoveled shit in Louisiana."

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
All right, now, you sons of bitches...

76
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,940
you know how I feel.

77
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,030
I will be proud...

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
to lead you wonderful guys
into battle anytime...

79
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,370
anywhere.

80
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,210
That's all.

81
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,670
The Arabs need food and clothing.

82
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,010
They strip our dead before
we can even bury them.

83
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,140
Looks like the reports were
pretty accurate.

84
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,100
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition...

85
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,190
twenty-five 40mm guns,
three self-propelled 105s.

86
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,150
Not counting mortars, machine guns,
rifles...

87
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,910
pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
GI socks.

88
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,490
One thousand, eight hundred men.

89
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,340
Our people salute you, general...

90
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,680
for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of Africa...

91
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,600
and for your enlightened
administration of our country.

92
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,150
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.

93
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,900
Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia
fighting the Germans.

94
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,830
"The lions in their dens
tremble at his approach."

95
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,550
I appreciate that, Excellency.

96
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,780
Magnificent!

97
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,900
I wish our troops looked that good.

98
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,980
Tell me, general,
what do you think of Morocco?

99
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,480
I love it, Excellency.

100
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,240
It's a combination
of the Bible and Hollywood.

101
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,160
BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine?
CARVER: Yes, sir.

102
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,960
For the American Army to take
a licking like that...

103
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,790
the first time at bat
against the Germans...

104
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,880
Up against Rommel, what we need
is the best tank man we've got.

105
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,430
Somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.

106
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,350
- Patton?
- Possibly.

107
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,970
God help us.

108
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,440
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

109
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,550
Lieutenant...

110
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,050
where is the duty officer?

111
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,510
Sir...

112
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,430
- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?

113
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,600
Guess he needed a shave.

114
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,150
We got a new commanding general
due today.

115
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,090
Who the hell is kicking me
in the butt?

116
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,300
Oh, sorry, sir.

117
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,890
- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.

118
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,680
Well...

119
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,940
Get back down there, son.

120
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,400
You're the only son of a bitch here
who knows what he's trying to do.

121
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,230
Yes, sir.

122
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,740
- Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.

123
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,790
We were all under the impression
you wouldn't be here until 0900.

124
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,950
Yes, I gathered that.

125
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,500
- You know my boy, Dick Jenson.
- Yes.

126
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Brad, tell me.

127
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,840
- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.

128
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,590
Meanwhile, I have to stay here
as an observer...

129
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,800
but I report directly to Ike.

130
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,430
You're spying.

131
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,350
Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.

132
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Tell me, Brad...

133
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,610
what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.

134
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,360
Apparently, everything went wrong.

135
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,280
We'd send over a 75mm shell,
the krauts would return an 88.

136
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,660
Their tanks are diesels.

137
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,450
Even when we managed to hit one
they kept on running. Our tanks...

138
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,790
The men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."

139
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,630
One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.

140
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,210
I warned them about the tank.

141
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,130
I talked to one of the
soldiers about the half-tracks.

142
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,880
I asked them if the machine-gun
bullets pierced the armor.

143
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,760
And he said, "No, sir.

144
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,270
They just come through one side
and rattle around a bit."

145
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,480
I understand they had a little trouble
coordinating the air cover.

146
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,150
The trouble was no air cover.

147
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,860
- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.

148
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,950
Bedell?

149
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,540
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here.

150
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,750
I need a good number-two man, I want
to make Brad my deputy commander.

151
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,880
You clear it with Ike?

152
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
All right, thanks, Bedell.

153
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,430
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower
anymore, you're working for me.

154
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,100
- Okay?
- Fine, okay.

155
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,810
Dick. You got those stars?

156
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,730
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them on.

157
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,030
What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.

158
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,960
I know, but it doesn't become official
until it's approved by the Senate.

159
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,830
Well...

160
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,170
they have their schedule
and I have mine.

161
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,590
George...

162
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,010
if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy...

163
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,430
I believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks...

164
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,770
and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.

165
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,820
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.

166
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,530
You know...

167
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,990
I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.

168
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,910
Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

169
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,170
It was green leather,
it had red stripes...

170
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,210
and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.

171
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,420
And topped off
by a gold football helmet.

172
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,970
The Army rejected it, of course.

173
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,550
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

174
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,390
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

175
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,600
George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.

176
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,770
Some of our boys
were just plain scared.

177
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,640
That's understandable.

178
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,650
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.

179
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,610
I can remember...

180
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,400
when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of...

181
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,110
a bullet coming
straight for my nose.

182
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,450
I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose...

183
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,990
was more horrible
than any other possibility.

184
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,660
Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.

185
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,880
You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?

186
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,170
Blind man could see it in a minute.

187
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,340
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.

188
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,180
Why should they fight like soldiers?

189
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,720
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.

190
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,730
In about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys...

191
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,600
into fanatics, razors.

192
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,310
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.

193
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,860
I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.

194
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,220
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?

195
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,550
Have all my officers
finished breakfast?

196
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,850
We're open from 6 till 8.

197
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,560
Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.

198
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,270
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.

199
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,270
But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.

200
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,190
From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6:15.

201
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,860
Where are your leggings?

202
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,870
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.

203
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,120
You're a soldier.

204
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
$20 fine.

205
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,460
Gentlemen...

206
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,380
from this moment any man...

207
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,720
without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie...

208
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,800
Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform...

209
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,680
is going to be skinned.

210
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,640
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.

211
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,550
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

212
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,430
Doctor.

213
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,720
Sir.

214
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,180
I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.

215
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,770
Yes, sir, we do.

216
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,520
Get them out of here.

217
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,150
One has developed a serious infection.

218
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,570
I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.

219
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,190
Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.

220
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,320
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.

221
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,870
There'll be no "battle fatigue."
That's an order.

222
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,410
Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.

223
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,750
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

224
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,170
Yes, sir.

225
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,710
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?

226
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,670
I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.

227
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,800
Start.

228
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,050
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.

229
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,060
Well...

230
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,060
then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.

231
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,820
And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.

232
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,620
Hold it.

233
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,750
Turn right, here.

234
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The battlefield is ahead.

235
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,500
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.

236
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,380
He was out here yesterday.

237
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,300
It's over there. Turn right, damn it.

238
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,300
It was here.

239
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,300
The battlefield was here.

240
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,400
The Carthaginians
defending the city...

241
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,940
were attacked by three
Roman legions.

242
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,990
They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.

243
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,160
Arab women...

244
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,750
stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.

245
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,380
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...

246
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,720
2000 years ago.

247
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,770
I was here.

248
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,440
You don't believe me.

249
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,860
You know what the poet said:

250
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,410
"Through the travail of ages

251
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,200
It's the pomp and toils of war

252
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,210
Have I fought and strove and perished

253
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,340
Countless times upon the star

254
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,050
As if through a glass and darkly

255
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,810
The age-old strife I see

256
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,980
Where I fought in many guises
Many names

257
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,310
But always me."

258
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
You know who the poet was?

259
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,240
Me.

260
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,960
<font color=00FF40>Sir, the interrogation reports onthe American prisoners...

261
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,680
<font color=00FF40>captured in our victory at Kasserine.

262
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,350
<font color=00FF40>They are not very good soldiers,these Americans.

263
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,440
<font color=00FF40>I'm not so sure...

264
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
<font color=00FF40>after only one battle.

265
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,030
<font color=00FF40>Their tanks were no match for our guns.

266
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,660
<font color=00FF40>And neither was their leadership, sir.

267
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,620
<font color=00FF40>At Kasserine they were notunder American command.

268
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,370
<font color=00FF40>They were under theBritish General Anderson.

269
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,510
<font color=00FF40>British commanders and American troops...the worst of everything!

270
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,180
<font color=00FF40>I remind you that Montgomeryis a British Commander.

271
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,810
<font color=00FF40>And he has driven us halfway across Africa.

272
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,600
<font color=00FF40>Anyway, we have met the Americansfor the first time and defeated them.

273
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,650
<font color=00FF40>I'm optimistic.

274
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,820
<font color=00FF40>You can afford to be an optimist, I can't.

275
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,580
There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.

276
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,880
We've concentrated on the flank...

277
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,050
draw strength from the British.

278
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,550
It appears now that we could...

279
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,680
split the African corridor.

280
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,390
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

281
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,680
I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved...

282
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,180
for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

283
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,310
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.

284
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,020
They're entitled to have their hero.

285
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,530
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.

286
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,030
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?

287
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,620
You have anybody in mind?

288
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,200
Air Vice-Marshal Conningham
is here with General Buford.

289
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,870
Excuse me, gentlemen...

290
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,090
while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.

291
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,840
Harry.

292
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,340
How are you?

293
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,760
George. Good to see you.

294
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,760
- You know Arthur Conningham.
- Sir Arthur.

295
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,520
Delighted to see you.

296
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,730
I've heard so much about you.

297
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,320
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here...

298
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,660
and Ike thought we should fix it.

299
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,950
No, no. No misunderstanding.

300
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,040
We're supposed to have Allied
air cover and we don't.

301
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,000
German planes are strafing my troops.

302
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,420
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.

303
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,300
Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car...

304
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,260
ran my ass into a ditch.

305
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,640
My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy...

306
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,600
everywhere in the Mediterranean.

307
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,890
When I complained about air cover...

308
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,940
you said our troops
were not battle-worthy.

309
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,020
You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi...

310
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,190
for lack of success on the ground.

311
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,160
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.

312
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,030
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.

313
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,830
And I promise you one thing, general:

314
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,330
You will see no more German planes.

315
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,680
We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.

316
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,300
Damn door won't open!

317
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,320
By God, that's enough!

318
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,500
Get that thing out of here!

319
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,720
Come on, you bastards,
take a shot at me on the nose!

320
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,470
Get back in here, George! We need
a corps commander, not a casualty.

321
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,120
How'd you manage to stage that?

322
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,580
I don't know...

323
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,880
but if I could find
the Nazis flying those things...

324
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,170
I'd give them each a medal.

325
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,160
Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.

326
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,660
Awfully cold, sir.

327
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,650
Rommel's out there somewhere,
waiting for me.

328
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,280
Yes, sir.

329
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,610
You know...

330
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,040
if I had my way, I'd send
that genius son of a bitch...

331
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,000
an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter:

332
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,130
A challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert.

333
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,250
I'll deliver it.

334
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,510
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.

335
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,100
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...

336
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,060
then we'd button up and do battle,
just the two of us.

337
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,440
That battle would decide
the outcome of the war.

338
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,400
It's too bad jousting's
gone out of style.

339
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,360
It's like your poetry, general.

340
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,240
It isn't part of the 20th century.

341
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,950
You're right, Dick.

342
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
The world grew up.

343
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,210
Hell of a shame.

344
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,090
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard
put around this area.

345
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,800
If we don't, the Arabs will dig
them up for their clothes.

346
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,430
Yes, sir.

347
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,010
Our graves aren't gonna disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.

348
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,810
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.

349
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,020
God, how I hate the 20th century.

350
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,300
<font color=00FF40>Captain Steiger reporting, General.

351
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,560
<font color=00FF40>Come with me, Steiger.

352
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,740
<font color=00FF40>Field Marshal Rommel...I hope you are feeling better...

353
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,870
<font color=00FF40>Captain Steiger has been assignedto research General Patton.

354
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,130
<font color=00FF40>Very well. What do you have for me?

355
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,840
<font color=00FF40>General Patton comes froma military family.

356
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,260
<font color=00FF40>His grandfather was a heroof the American Civil War.

357
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:32,350
<font color=00FF40>He was educated at theVirginia Military Institute and West Point.

358
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
<font color=00FF40>You're not telling me anythingabout the man.

359
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,440
<font color=00FF40>He writes poetry and believesin reincarnation.

360
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,150
<font color=00FF40>He's one of the richest officersin the American Army.

361
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,950
<font color=00FF40>He prays on his knees,but curses like a stable boy.

362
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,700
<font color=00FF40>He has one standing order."Always take the offensive, never dig in".

363
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,260
<font color=00FF40>In 15 minutes we meet with the Führer.

364
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,550
<font color=00FF40>He will want to know how you planto deal with Patton's forces.

365
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,310
<font color=00FF40>I will attack and annihilate him!

366
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
<font color=00FF40>Before he does the same to me.

367
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,670
General.

368
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,380
General?

369
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,140
We intercepted a German radio message.

370
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,220
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going
to hit us near El Guettar.

371
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,940
Rommel, huh?

372
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,340
All my life...

373
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,560
I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.

374
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,320
Now I'm going to do it.

375
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,620
Look.

376
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,530
Battalion strength at least.

377
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,030
They haven't spotted our positions yet.

378
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,080
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.

379
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,080
Wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire.

380
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,350
Commence firing.
Fire at will.

381
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,480
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.

382
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,170
What a hell of a waste
of fine infantry.

383
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,690
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,130
Sir, I can't raise him.

385
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,880
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's
where we hold them by the nose...

386
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,960
and kick them in the ass.
Go on.

387
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,920
Put him in my car.

388
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,410
Rommel...

389
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,620
you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!

390
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,900
Captain Richard N. Jenson
was a fine boy.

391
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,940
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.

392
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,370
I am terribly sorry.

393
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,880
There are no coffins here
since there is no wood.

394
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,630
We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard...

395
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,220
but we will not fire the volleys as
people would think an air raid was on.

396
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,870
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair
in a letter to his mother.

397
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,660
He was a fine man...

398
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,960
and a fine officer.

399
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,040
And he had no vices.

400
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,680
I shall miss him a lot.

401
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,070
I can't see the reason
such fine young men get killed.

402
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,240
There are so many battles
yet to fight.

403
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,720
Battle-weary, but
victorious, American GIs and Tommies...

404
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,430
of the British 8th Army meet in
an Allied victory celebration...

405
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,260
at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.

406
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,890
For the first time in this war,
Broadway and Piccadilly join hands.

407
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,900
Meanwhile, General Montgomery,
hero of El Alamein...

408
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,070
continues to lead his
victorious British 8th Army...

409
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,450
in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.

410
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,370
<font color=00FF40>It is obvious
that North Africa will soon be lost.

411
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,240
<font color=00FF40>We must now anticipatethe enemy's next move.

412
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:50,750
<font color=00FF40>I shall expect a staff report within 24 hours.That will be all.

413
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,090
<font color=00FF40>Steiger, you have said nothing.

414
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,100
<font color=00FF40>I wasn't asked anything.

415
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,810
<font color=00FF40>I'm asking you now.You think Patton will attack Sardinia?

416
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,310
<font color=00FF40>And why not?

417
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,770
<font color=00FF40>Patton, sir... is a military historian.

418
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,030
<font color=00FF40>He knows that Sicily, not Sardinia,has always been the key to Italy.

419
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,870
<font color=00FF40>If Patton has his way he will attackSicily at Syracuse, as the Athenians did.

420
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:29,080
<font color=00FF40>Steiger, this is the twentieth century!

421
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,960
<font color=00FF40>But you must understand, sir...Patton is a sixteenth-century man.

422
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,250
<font color=00FF40>May I read an example?

423
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,380
<font color=00FF40>"On a dark street in New York 1922,wearing white tie and tails...

424
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,510
<font color=00FF40>"Patton saw three men pushinga young girl into the back of a truck.

425
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,220
<font color=00FF40>"He leaped out of his car,produced a revolver...

426
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,980
<font color=00FF40>"and forced the men at gunpointto release the girl".

427
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,940
<font color=00FF40>It turned out that the girl was thefiancée of one of the men.

428
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,320
<font color=00FF40>They were merely helpingher into the truck.

429
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,040
<font color=00FF40>What could be more revealing?

430
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,120
<font color=00FF40>I don't know what you’re talking about.

431
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:17,000
<font color=00FF40>Don Quixote encounters six merchantsof Toledo and saves Dulcinea's virtue!

432
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,960
<font color=00FF40>Who the devil is Dulcinea?

433
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,960
<font color=00FF40>Don't you see, sir?

434
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,720
<font color=00FF40>Patton is a romantic warriorlost in contemporary times.

435
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,220
<font color=00FF40>The secret of Patton is the past.

436
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,020
<font color=00FF40>He'll urge an attack on Sicilybecause that's what the Athenians did!

437
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:44,410
General Bradley's done
a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.

438
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,950
He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.

439
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,620
Good. Very good.

440
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,420
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.

441
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,760
- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?

442
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:05,680
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.

443
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,600
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.

444
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,230
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?

445
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,610
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.

446
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,570
Also, Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin...

447
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,150
because things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.

448
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,070
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.

449
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,870
I'm my favorite general,
and I don't like to be told...

450
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,750
that some second-stringer
is up against me. Then I lose face.

451
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,130
Who the hell are you, anyway?

452
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,890
General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.

453
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,850
Codman. I pulled your name off
the list because I know your family.

454
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,220
I'm glad you did, sir.

455
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,150
Rommel is the best the krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.

456
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,310
Now my own G2 section is telling
me he wasn't even there.

457
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,780
But, general, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.

458
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,200
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. Isn't that true?

459
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,910
Codman...

460
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,710
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,840
I have a plan
for the invasion of Sicily.

462
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,010
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.

463
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,880
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander.

464
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,590
Get to him before Montgomery does.

465
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,100
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.

466
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,890
By that I mean...

467
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,270
- purely political.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,320
I want the finest food, the best wine
available. Everything, "comme il faut".

469
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,820
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

470
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,600
Thank you.

471
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,100
George, this is really splendid wine.

472
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,600
Thank you, Arthur.

473
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,980
Thank you.

474
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:26,650
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War...

475
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,530
415 B.C.

476
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,700
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy."

477
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,460
He knew that Syracuse was the
jugular of the island.

478
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,500
Old Alcibiades always went
for the throat.

479
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,840
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.

480
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,260
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.

481
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,760
Now, according to my plan...

482
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,010
General Montgomery will land here.

483
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,730
I'll hit the beaches here,
take Palermo.

484
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,360
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...

485
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,280
take Messina and cut off
the German escape route.

486
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,240
Yes...

487
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,700
It looks like an interesting plan.

488
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,370
Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.

489
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,410
To the conquest of Sicily.

490
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,660
To Sicily!

491
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,750
George, you'd have made a great
marshal for Napoleon...

492
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,670
if you'd lived in the 18th century.

493
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,300
But I did, sir. I did.

494
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,880
Morning. Is General Smith in?

495
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,210
- I believe he's in the lavatory.
- Thank you.

496
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,100
- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.

497
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,270
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of
thought to the Sicily operation.

498
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,650
Yes?

499
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,150
I assume we're alone.

500
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,780
Georgie Patton has already
discussed his plan with Alexander.

501
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:31,150
I realize that...

502
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,320
but I have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster.

503
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,780
Oh?

504
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,660
Bedell, look.

505
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,170
This is Sicily.

506
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,840
Now then, according to Patton's plan...

507
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,550
I will attack Syracuse here.

508
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,260
And he would attack Palermo up here.

509
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,850
Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.

510
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,810
And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.

511
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,730
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...

512
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,190
is this.

513
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,190
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

514
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,110
But the Americans...
The Americans will land here, at Gela.

515
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,370
I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.

516
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,540
After all, Messina is the key.

517
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:25,370
It's the reason for invading Sicily.

518
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,130
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

519
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,880
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

520
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,470
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?

521
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,430
That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily...

522
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,560
should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

523
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,310
George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

524
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,610
Ike has turned it down.

525
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,400
Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time...

526
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:00,200
and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

527
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,960
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.

528
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,790
There's nothing there
but a beach.

529
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,050
Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.

530
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,840
Where does Montgomery land?

531
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:18,340
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

532
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,890
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

533
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,560
I see.

534
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,900
In other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.

535
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,940
Ike had to consider all points of view.

536
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,490
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.

537
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,870
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.

538
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,370
No...

539
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,120
I've been in the Army 30 years.

540
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,920
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir."
And I do my best to carry it out.

541
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,140
This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American...

542
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,560
and starts being an Ally.

543
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:16,770
<font color=00FF40>Here's the gangster Patton,landing at Gela with his Seventh Army.

544
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,860
<font color=00FF40>This film was captured after the landing.

545
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,660
<font color=00FF40>I didn't realize he was so tall.

546
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,080
<font color=00FF40>Over six feet.

547
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,590
<font color=00FF40>He's constantly givingpersonal commands.

548
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,890
<font color=00FF40>Obviously they now have two prima donnas in Sicily...Montgomery and Patton!

549
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,310
<font color=00FF40>There's another three-star general.

550
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,320
<font color=00FF40>General Bradley... Commanderof the American II Corps.

551
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,530
<font color=00FF40>He looks like a common soldier.

552
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,530
<font color=00FF40>He is most capable, yet unpretentious.

553
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,320
<font color=00FF40>Unusual for a general.

554
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,410
<font color=00FF40>Sorry...

555
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,880
I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.

556
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:19,720
It's true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.

557
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,880
However, if we're...

558
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,550
Perfectly clear.

559
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,850
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

560
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,810
But this order from
General Alexander...

561
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,900
directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

562
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,650
Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug... slug, mind you...

563
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:42,660
his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?

564
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,120
Yes, sir.

565
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,410
Messina, Bell.

566
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,080
Messina...

567
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,160
is the heart of it. If they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

568
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:55,790
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!

569
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,800
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

570
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,380
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

571
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:04,640
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if it's the last thing I ever do!

572
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,350
Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

573
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,600
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.

574
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,520
Now, that road was assigned to me.

575
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,070
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.

576
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,450
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.

577
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:32,620
You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?

578
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

579
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,790
Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps...

580
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,380
would be out of a job.

581
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,010
Free for you to go into Palermo.

582
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,380
Who said anything about Palermo?

583
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,720
I can read a map.

584
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,270
Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?

585
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,190
That's a reconnaissance in force.

586
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,360
George...

587
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,610
are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains...

588
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,030
with heavy resistance?

589
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,570
Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

590
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,450
General...

591
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,500
I just follow my orders.

592
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,290
Like the simple old soldier I am.

593
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,790
General Bradley.

594
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,960
Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.

595
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,550
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.

596
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,680
Repeat. Stop, immediately."

597
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:33,600
That's what you think it says.

598
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,940
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

599
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,730
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

600
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,150
That'll take half a day at least.

601
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,440
Yes, sir.

602
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,240
Now, Brad.

603
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,410
Where were we?

604
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,000
We were talking about a simple...

605
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,880
old soldier.

606
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,780
Look at that, gentlemen.

607
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,950
Compared to war...

608
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,710
all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.

609
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,840
Let's go, sergeant.
Move out!

610
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,550
Give me that helmet.

611
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,930
Come on, let's get out of here!

612
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,530
What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?

613
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,450
I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.

614
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:09,960
Afternoon, Padre.

615
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,800
These men are here from the
States, looking over our program...

616
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,840
for the spiritual welfare
of the men.

617
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,760
We'll take you right into Palermo.

618
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,180
Col. David toured us around
your quarters...

619
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:24,150
and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?

620
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,190
I sure do.

621
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,360
Every goddamn day.

622
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,770
<font color=00FF40>Sir, the Americans have taken Palermo!

623
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,480
<font color=00FF40>Damn!

624
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,800
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

625
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:55,800
Damn!

626
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,860
Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.

627
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:19,030
First the Phoenicians...

628
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:23,000
the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.

629
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,000
Then came the Arabs...

630
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,790
Spaniards, Neapolitans.

631
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,460
Now comes...

632
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,550
the American Army.

633
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,720
This is from General Alexander, sir...

634
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:47,190
reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.

635
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,900
Send him a message, Cod.

636
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,440
Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.

637
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,570
Let me ask you a question
for a change.

638
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,740
You've just come from Washington.

639
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,490
How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?

640
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,960
The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance...

641
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,590
while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.

642
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,590
Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Göring division?

643
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,260
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

644
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,590
The people at home
are interested in you.

645
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,050
They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.

646
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:05,390
They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse...

647
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,270
would carry a pearl handle.

648
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,140
What about your language?

649
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,480
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.

650
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,570
What do your troops feel about that?

651
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:18,190
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.

652
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:22,700
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.

653
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,780
Ernie calls him "The GI General."

654
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:28,120
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

655
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,620
What's your feeling about Montgomery?

656
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:33,040
He's the best general the English have.

657
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:36,880
He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.

658
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:40,220
He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?

659
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,550
Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

660
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,760
Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners...

661
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,810
didn't have enough latrine.

662
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,440
They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.

663
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:56,070
If I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague...

664
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,610
let's forget about it.

665
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,860
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.

666
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,360
I'm gonna beat that...

667
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,450
gentleman to Messina.

668
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:17,130
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?

669
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,630
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.

670
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,920
This report might interest you.

671
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:25,760
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans...

672
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:29,350
while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

673
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,350
Well!

674
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,310
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.

675
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,320
He's not going to get Messina.

676
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:41,940
That's reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.

677
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:52,790
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1st Division is bogged down.

678
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,670
You're bogged down too.

679
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,210
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.

680
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,800
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.

681
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:07,390
Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.

682
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,770
Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea...

683
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:18,440
to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.

684
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:21,070
You want me to do a land-based attack.

685
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,610
Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11th.

686
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,070
I don't think we can make it
by the 11th.

687
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,200
- Hell, it's only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.

688
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,410
Hm.

689
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,750
Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.

690
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,710
I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.

691
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,420
I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

692
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,720
Excuse me, sir.

693
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:51,100
I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.

694
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:56,100
You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.

695
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:59,900
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.

696
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:04,440
If we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.

697
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:08,610
Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.

698
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,410
- What's the matter?
- All we're saying is...

699
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:14,290
not to rush in until we're ready.

700
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,330
Give him an extra day.

701
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,960
Just one more day.

702
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,290
The landing is on.

703
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,960
We're going to Messina.

704
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:25,720
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.

705
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,430
- What's so important about that?
- General Truscott...

706
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,390
if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation...

707
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,270
I'll find somebody who can.

708
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:41,560
General, it's your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.

709
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,900
This match will not be postponed.

710
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,320
Any questions?

711
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,290
No, sir.

712
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,250
You're a very good man, Lucian.

713
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,380
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

714
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,840
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:

715
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:08,720
"L'audace, l'audace!
Toujours l'audace!"

716
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,640
Go on, have a drink.

717
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,890
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.

718
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,030
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.

719
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,410
You're not going, so forget about it.

720
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,580
You believe Truscott's right?

721
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,700
No.

722
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,960
But you're gambling
with those boys' lives...

723
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,750
just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.

724
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,340
If you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't...

725
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,140
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.

726
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:58,930
He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.

727
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:04,560
He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.

728
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,650
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.

729
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,450
I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.

730
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,950
You do it because...

731
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,710
you love it.

732
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,600
The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.

733
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,480
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.

734
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:48,230
I can't break through to the coast.

735
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,440
I'm going down there myself.

736
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,920
Colonel!

737
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,750
How did he get over there?

738
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,920
What the hell are you waiting for?

739
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:15,680
Looking for a place to ford, general.

740
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,890
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

741
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:22,560
I've done that. Down there
this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

742
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,900
Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!

743
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:31,110
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.

744
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,290
Move it! Let's go!

745
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,680
- What's holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.

746
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,020
Planes!

747
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,850
Come on, move it!

748
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,670
Pull up over there.

749
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:41,600
- Come on.
- What's going on here?

750
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,720
Sir, these mules...

751
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:43,970
Jackasses!

752
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:48,810
You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!

753
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,940
No. No.

754
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,580
Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!

755
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:55,670
We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!

756
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,010
Nobody's getting any air support!

757
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:01,430
Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.

758
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,930
Major!

759
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,050
- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.

760
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,600
- Your name?
- Walker.

761
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,520
You're now commanding officer.

762
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,140
You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.

763
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:13,350
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.

764
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:27,760
50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.

765
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:06,340
Please take me home.
Take me home.

766
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,890
Please take me home.
Take me home.

767
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,830
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts."
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.

768
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,640
Hi, how are you, son?

769
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,310
Where are you from, Gomez?

770
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,610
California, sir.

771
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,440
Me too.

772
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,820
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.

773
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,700
Well...

774
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:14,290
this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.

775
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,620
Didn't have any head either.

776
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,580
You get well quickly, son.

777
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,040
What's the matter with you?

778
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,920
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

779
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,340
What did you say?

780
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,760
It's my nerves, sir.

781
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,140
I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.

782
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,520
Your nerves?

783
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,320
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

784
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,070
Shut up!

785
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,660
I won't have
a yellow bastard crying...

786
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,370
in front of these
brave, wounded men.

787
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,170
Shut up!

788
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,630
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.

789
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,600
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.

790
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:20,760
You're going back to the front,
my friend.

791
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:25,640
You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.

792
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:29,770
Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.

793
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:34,320
I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!

794
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:38,070
Send him up to the front!

795
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,450
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

796
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,710
I won't have cowards in my army.

797
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,700
I had to kick a few butts...

798
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:30,130
but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.

799
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,500
Have you seen the casualty lists?

800
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,800
Yes, I've seen them.

801
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,380
What's the word from the coast road?

802
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:40,470
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.

803
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,140
Let's get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.

804
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:47,310
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.

805
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,650
General Bradley...

806
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:54,360
it's time to consider how many
casualties we'd have...

807
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:57,950
if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.

808
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,580
Forward, march!

809
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,930
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.

810
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:53,230
Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.

811
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,900
Forward, march!

812
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:40,820
You wanted to see me, George?

813
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,400
Got a letter here from Ike.

814
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,290
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.

815
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:04,760
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.

816
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:07,510
I was struck by that fact because...

817
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,970
"Despicable." First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.

818
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:18,560
Well, at least it's a personal
reprimand, it's not official.

819
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:22,320
The man was yellow. He should've
been tried for cowardice and shot.

820
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:26,950
People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.

821
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,660
I ruffled his pride a bit.
What's that compared to war?

822
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:35,410
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...

823
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:40,000
since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.

824
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,130
Dirty bastard!

825
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:46,720
They got me holding a little GI
and kicking him with an iron boot.

826
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,430
You see that, what's on my boot?
A swastika.

827
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:52,970
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!

828
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,900
"You will apologize to the soldier
you slapped...

829
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:05,780
to all doctors and nurses present
in the tent at the time...

830
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:09,070
to every patient in the tent
who can be reached...

831
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:12,870
and last but not least
to the 7th Army as a whole...

832
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:16,120
through individual units,
one at a time."

833
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:22,790
God, I...

834
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,130
feel low.

835
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,680
Oh, God...

836
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:36,810
Thou art my God.

837
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:39,890
Early will I seek Thee.

838
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,650
My soul thirsteth for Thee.

839
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:48,360
My flesh longeth for Thee
in a dry and thirsty land.

840
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:52,200
So as I have seen Thee
in the sanctuary.

841
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:55,620
My soul followeth hard after Thee.

842
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:00,620
But those that seek my soul
to destroy it...

843
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:04,290
shall go into the lower parts
of the earth.

844
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,210
They shall fall by the sword.

845
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:12,220
They shall be apportioned for foxes.

846
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,390
But the king shall rejoice in God.

847
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,680
Everyone that sweareth by him
shall glory.

848
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,770
But the mouth of them
that speak lies...

849
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,730
shall be stopped.

850
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:35,280
Ten-hut!

851
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,700
At ease.

852
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:54,760
I thought I'd stand up here
and let you people see...

853
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:00,810
if I am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think I am.

854
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:08,320
I assure you I had no intention...

855
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:13,110
of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the...

856
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,360
soldier in question.

857
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:22,960
My sole purpose was to try
to restore in him...

858
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:26,250
some appreciation of his
obligations as a man...

859
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,590
and as a soldier.

860
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:33,670
If one can shame a coward...

861
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:39,810
I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.

862
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,930
This was on my mind.

863
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,770
Now, I freely admit...

864
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,070
that my method was wrong...

865
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,240
but I hope you understand
my motive...

866
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,740
and will accept this...

867
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,030
explanation...

868
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,160
and this...

869
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,500
apology.

870
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:12,130
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!

871
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,140
Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.

872
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,390
What poll?

873
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,770
The fan mail.

874
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,810
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.

875
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:32,570
And that 11% of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

876
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:36,530
But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.

877
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:40,280
"I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.

878
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:44,200
From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why...

879
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,120
but we want you to know
we're for you.

880
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,170
Keep going, and God bless you."

881
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,590
Keep going, huh?

882
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,210
Where?

883
01:36:56,970 --> 01:37:01,260
I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. It's New Year's.

884
01:37:01,470 --> 01:37:03,640
You didn't celebrate at all
last night.

885
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,860
I'm sick of sitting around this...

886
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:16,320
royal doghouse.

887
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,490
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.

888
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:24,910
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.

889
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,540
Cod.

890
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:33,170
I've been relieved.

891
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:38,470
They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.

892
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,180
I don't believe it.

893
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,180
Happy New Year.

894
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,270
Just a minute, sir.

895
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,860
Since they're sure to give you
another command...

896
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:00,570
isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?

897
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:04,990
You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?

898
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,790
It's possible. I know it's been
discussed from time to time.

899
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:13,500
The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.

900
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,550
Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle of wine.

901
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:21,340
No, Sir Cod...

902
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:25,180
but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.

903
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:36,270
- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.

904
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,570
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.

905
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,110
Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?

906
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,740
All the time, sir.

907
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:48,950
Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.

908
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,330
Lucky for us we got them.

909
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:55,750
Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse captains?

910
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,750
That's what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.

911
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,590
Why are you up so late, George?

912
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,510
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.

913
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,060
I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.

914
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,980
Sleeping pill!

915
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:22,570
- What's going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.

916
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:26,070
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?

917
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:31,500
About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.

918
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:34,620
Oh.

919
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:37,130
Oh, yeah.

920
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,760
I just thought you might be
feeling kind of low, sir.

921
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:02,780
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.

922
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,070
Yeah. Thank you, George.

923
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,870
One little dog face.

924
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:13,540
One measly little slap.
That's what done it.

925
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:18,210
Ah, George.

926
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:23,010
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.

927
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:44,130
(PATTON SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

928
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:55,730
He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.

929
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,040
And to the people of the Resistance...

930
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:17,250
who risk their lives
to help destroy the Germans.

931
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:27,220
"France will be free again.
I give you my word."

932
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,620
"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth...

933
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:03,210
I will someday land in France to
liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."

934
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:10,510
General, the reporters would like
a word with you.

935
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,350
- Good afternoon.
- General.

936
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,600
Can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to Corsica?

937
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:20,650
General Eisenhower ordered me here.

938
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:25,230
You wrote the mother of the boy you
slapped, "The rat should've been shot."

939
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,820
- Is that true, general?
- No comment.

940
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,530
Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested...

941
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:33,700
you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign...

942
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,200
but it was killed
due to the incident.

943
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:39,500
- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?

944
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:42,540
Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.

945
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:43,880
Interview concluded.

946
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:46,840
You plan on slapping
any soldiers there, general?

947
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,110
<font color=00FF40>Malta?

948
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,360
<font color=00FF40>Yes, sir.

949
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,120
<font color=00FF40>Malta as a base...

950
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,620
<font color=00FF40>then southern Greece.That is possible.

951
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:15,660
<font color=00FF40>Get me Field Marshal Keitel.

952
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,620
In 1528, these forts
were defended by...

953
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:25,710
400 Knights of Malta
and 800 mercenaries...

954
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:30,380
against a force of 40,000 Turks.

955
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:32,470
Codman.

956
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:38,310
- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.

957
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:42,480
Not even a response about
the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?

958
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:44,150
No, sir.

959
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:48,530
Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.

960
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:56,240
Looks like you boys have hitched
your wagon to a falling star.

961
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,330
Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.

962
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:04,170
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.

963
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:08,960
We want to stay with you, no matter
what duty you're assigned to.

964
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:15,850
Up in London, they're planning
the invasion of Europe.

965
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:20,640
I've trained my mind,
body and spirit for that.

966
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:23,350
What, in God's name, am I doing here?

967
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,110
All right.

968
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,400
Let's get on to Cairo.

969
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,530
See if the pyramids
are still standing.

970
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:39,120
There is only one reason
for him to be in Cairo.

971
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,790
<font color=00FF40>To confer with the Greek andYugoslav governments in exile.

972
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:46,710
<font color=00FF40>Let the Italians garrison Italy,it's their country.

973
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:51,760
<font color=00FF40>We'll need our German troops toreinforce Crete and the Greek coast...

974
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:54,220
<font color=00FF40>if Patton strikes from Egypt!

975
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,690
<font color=00FF40>I have some new information, sir.

976
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:09,110
<font color=00FF40>Patton is under severe criticism.He may even be court-martialed.

977
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,570
<font color=00FF40>He slapped an enlisted man.

978
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,120
<font color=00FF40>You believe their newspapers?

979
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,700
<font color=00FF40>Would they sacrifice their best commanderbecause he slapped a soldier?

980
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:57,410
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.

981
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,780
Whoever found it has a genius
for cloak and dagger.

982
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,430
Who picked this cathouse?

983
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,560
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.

984
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,770
To spite me, that son of a bitch.

985
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:29,770
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?

986
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,230
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.

987
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,320
Would you excuse us, please?

988
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:38,700
Let me put you straight about Ike.

989
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:42,240
We hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions.

990
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:45,540
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.

991
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,870
At times, I do wonder whether
he isn't a limey at heart.

992
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,880
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.

993
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:57,260
Ike's trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.

994
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:59,550
- It's a hell of a job.
- I understand.

995
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:04,140
You have an important assignment
connected to the Normandy invasion.

996
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:08,600
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan
and there's a number of flaws in it.

997
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:13,560
You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.

998
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:16,900
I've drawn up an alternate plan
to land at Calais...

999
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:21,450
following an air bombardment...
- Will you just listen for a change?

1000
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,410
Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone...

1001
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,290
wanted Patton
with a rope around his neck.

1002
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,670
We're gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover.

1003
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,010
That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.

1004
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,840
We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there...

1005
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:45,930
so that they can't be used
against us at Normandy.

1006
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:48,100
Is that all I'm good for?

1007
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:52,520
We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you.

1008
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:54,810
All fictitious, of course.

1009
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,940
Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft...

1010
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:00,440
simulated radio traffic.

1011
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:05,280
The Germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort.

1012
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,620
Their agents will spot you soon...

1013
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:10,450
then we can move you to Knutsford.

1014
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:13,960
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1015
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:18,170
Frankly, George, you're on probation.

1016
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,460
Take my advice and behave yourself.

1017
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:22,130
Remember...

1018
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:25,470
your worst enemy
is your own big mouth.

1019
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:24,320
Look at this nasty-faced
son of a bitch. Ready for combat.

1020
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:27,200
I'll call him William
as in "the Conqueror."

1021
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:31,490
- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.

1022
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,450
Good afternoon.

1023
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,920
Watch this, Cod.

1024
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:42,670
- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.

1025
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:55,980
I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?

1026
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:59,310
That's quite all right, madam.

1027
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:01,610
This way, sir.

1028
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,360
Your name isn't William.

1029
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,860
It's Willie.

1030
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:12,370
My dear friends.

1031
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:16,960
General George S. Patton, Jr.,
has accepted our invitation...

1032
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,750
to say a few words to you...

1033
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,750
on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony.

1034
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:31,140
General Patton is not here
in an official capacity...

1035
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:33,970
and I have assured him
most earnestly...

1036
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:36,640
that nothing he says
will be quoted.

1037
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:43,110
May I present General Patton.

1038
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,790
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.

1039
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:58,960
My dear ladies.

1040
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,460
Until today...

1041
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:06,840
my only experience
at welcoming has been...

1042
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:12,220
to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.

1043
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,310
At this I have been
quite successful...

1044
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,690
since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command...

1045
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,520
have, to date, killed or captured...

1046
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:26,360
some 170,000 of our enemies.

1047
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:40,250
I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value...

1048
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:43,460
because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw...

1049
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:47,380
that the British and the Americans
are two peoples...

1050
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:51,300
separated by a common language.

1051
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:59,020
Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world...

1052
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,560
the better we know each other...

1053
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,650
the better we will do it.

1054
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:08,400
The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.

1055
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:10,530
I think that a club like this...

1056
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:14,240
is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.

1057
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:20,500
Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies...

1058
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,340
and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are...

1059
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:33,970
then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous...

1060
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,140
and force this war
to a quick termination.

1061
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:46,150
And then I'll get the chance to go
to the Pacific and kill Japanese.

1062
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:06,210
All over the nation...

1063
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:10,420
mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton's statement...

1064
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:13,470
that Britain and America
will rule the post war world.

1065
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,630
That Russia will have no say.

1066
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,140
Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.

1067
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:23,100
This man has insulted
our Russian allies...

1068
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:26,230
implying Anglo-American world rule.

1069
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,570
In my opinion, he should be
severely disciplined.

1070
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,860
This time I didn't do a damn thing.

1071
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,780
They promised there
wouldn't be any reporters.

1072
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:37,280
I made a few remarks off the record.

1073
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,950
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

1074
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:44,000
You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.

1075
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:47,500
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.

1076
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:53,170
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.

1077
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,470
Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.

1078
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,640
I have no political ambitions.

1079
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:01,890
All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.

1080
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:04,180
Well, it's out of our hands now.

1081
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:07,730
Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.

1082
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:13,150
Now it's up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy...

1083
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,400
or he sends you home.

1084
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:19,570
He's a good man.

1085
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:22,280
At least he's a fair man.

1086
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:24,580
I'll let it sit with him.

1087
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,050
George...

1088
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,600
our war is over.

1089
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:46,060
Over, sir?

1090
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:50,020
It's just a question of waiting
for the orders now.

1091
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,410
I feel I'm...

1092
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:05,450
I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.

1093
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:11,290
But this last incident is...

1094
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:16,090
so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect...

1095
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:20,260
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.

1096
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,550
Yes, sir.

1097
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:25,770
The last great opportunity
of a lifetime...

1098
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:30,480
an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?

1099
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:32,100
No, sir.

1100
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:34,400
God will not permit this to happen!

1101
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:39,450
I am going to be allowed
to fulfill my destiny!

1102
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:46,330
His will be done.

1103
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:02,470
In the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted...

1104
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:05,390
a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way...

1105
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:08,640
for allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches...

1106
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:12,440
and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.

1107
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:32,830
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.

1108
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:37,000
And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.

1109
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:41,380
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

1110
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,970
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.

1111
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:48,890
But they don't listen to me.

1112
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:54,560
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.

1113
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:57,230
Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.

1114
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:00,570
Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.

1115
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:05,490
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.

1116
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:09,330
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.

1117
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:13,500
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

1118
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:17,250
I'm gonna play the game.

1119
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,750
If I forget, you remind me.

1120
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:24,880
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.

1121
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,970
Yes, sir.

1122
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:50,330
Welcome to France, sir.

1123
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:53,000
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?

1124
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,460
Right this way, sir.

1125
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:35,250
Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.

1126
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,500
How are you?

1127
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:39,460
You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.

1128
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:42,210
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.

1129
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,210
Best of everything, old boy.

1130
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:49,840
By the way...

1131
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:53,760
intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.

1132
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,850
Rommel.

1133
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:03,270
Hi, how are you, George?

1134
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:07,570
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.

1135
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:13,620
Well. My, my.

1136
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:15,540
Isn't this plush?

1137
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:18,750
Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.

1138
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,250
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.

1139
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,800
Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.

1140
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:28,220
That's right.

1141
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:33,010
We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.

1142
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,680
Do I get it?

1143
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:36,970
I'll be honest with you.

1144
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:38,890
I've had reservations.

1145
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:42,810
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.

1146
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:46,980
You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought...

1147
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:50,450
well, it might be a problem for us.

1148
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:52,620
It wouldn't bother me.

1149
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,830
There's one other thing.

1150
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,040
We're different kinds of people.

1151
02:02:57,290 --> 02:03:00,120
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

1152
02:03:00,330 --> 02:03:04,840
With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.

1153
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:09,510
Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

1154
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:13,260
Brad...

1155
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:17,720
I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.

1156
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:20,560
For God's sake, get me in this fight.

1157
02:03:22,190 --> 02:03:25,650
The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.

1158
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,530
I gotta get back in the war!

1159
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:30,950
Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.

1160
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:33,490
First thing you know,
it'll be over and...

1161
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:38,080
I'll...

1162
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:43,290
keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.

1163
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:47,880
I give you my word.

1164
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,090
George...

1165
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,430
I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.

1166
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,680
I'd like your opinion.

1167
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:01,310
We've been slugging through
hedgerow country...

1168
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,690
half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.

1169
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,480
I want to use this road.

1170
02:04:06,690 --> 02:04:08,480
The Saint Lô-Periers road.

1171
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:11,400
Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.

1172
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:15,280
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.

1173
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:17,490
Then seven divisions will follow.

1174
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:22,910
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.

1175
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:24,960
What do you think?

1176
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:31,670
I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

1177
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,380
George...

1178
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:41,270
Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.

1179
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,140
He what?

1180
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:48,190
Why, that dirty...!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1181
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:50,440
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

1182
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:54,860
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

1183
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:56,870
<font color=00FF40>What's this activity near Coutances?

1184
02:04:57,450 --> 02:05:00,910
<font color=00FF40>Enemy armored forces drivingthrough our defenses at Lessay.

1185
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,340
<font color=00FF40>"American tanks moving rapidly,slicing through to the rear areas".

1186
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:09,760
<font color=00FF40>This sounds like Patton, Field Marshal.

1187
02:05:10,090 --> 02:05:11,260
<font color=00FF40>Patton is in England.

1188
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,010
<font color=00FF40>Do we know this?

1189
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,600
<font color=00FF40>The landing in Normandy ismerely a diversionary maneuver.

1190
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:21,890
<font color=00FF40>The real invasion will comeat Calais and Patton will lead it.

1191
02:05:22,190 --> 02:05:26,860
<font color=00FF40>The Führer says that the Fifteenth Armyis not to be moved to Normandy.

1192
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:30,150
<font color=00FF40>Those men are sitting on the beach atCalais throwing pebbles at each other...

1193
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:33,910
<font color=00FF40>while our men are beingslaughtered in Normandy.

1194
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:38,450
<font color=00FF40>The Fifteenth Army is waiting forPatton at Calais and he will land there.

1195
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,920
<font color=00FF40>You seem perfectly willing toaccept this nonsense, Jodl.

1196
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
<font color=00FF40>Why?

1197
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:53,300
<font color=00FF40>Because I am not preparedto dispute the Führer.

1198
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:50,140
George could have the courtesy
to tell us where he's going.

1199
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:06,910
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?

1200
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,330
Berlin.

1201
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:12,460
I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

1202
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:57,290
Hold it. Hold it!

1203
02:07:58,420 --> 02:07:59,800
This place isn't on the map.

1204
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:02,930
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.

1205
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:17,230
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.

1206
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:18,630
Atten-hut!

1207
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:20,920
Hold it!

1208
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:28,840
Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.

1209
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:32,810
Let's move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.

1210
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:35,940
Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.

1211
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:38,650
All right, get up off your ass.
Let's go now!

1212
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:52,240
That's it.
That's the way to move.

1213
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:55,330
Good boy. All right, come on.

1214
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,830
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
That's it!

1215
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,960
That's it! Gun it!

1216
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,460
Gun that thing!

1217
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:05,550
Okay, come on.

1218
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:08,470
Watch it!

1219
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:11,600
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.

1220
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:14,100
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

1221
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:16,810
That's it.

1222
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,890
Come on, now.

1223
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,480
- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.

1224
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:30,030
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.

1225
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:34,370
Now come on! Hold it!

1226
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:37,870
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

1227
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:44,590
That's it. Come on.

1228
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:46,210
Good boy.

1229
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:50,630
- Hold it up there.
- General!

1230
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:53,220
General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.

1231
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:56,350
Okay. Come on!

1232
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:01,850
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

1233
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:12,070
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

1234
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,450
George this drive has been
magnificent...

1235
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,580
but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.

1236
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:23,960
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.

1237
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:28,010
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.

1238
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:31,880
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.

1239
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:35,140
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.

1240
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:37,220
By God, it is Montgomery.

1241
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:41,390
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.

1242
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,690
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

1243
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:47,320
Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.

1244
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:49,240
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

1245
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:53,700
You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.

1246
02:11:53,950 --> 02:11:55,870
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.

1247
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:57,740
George, I can't do it.

1248
02:11:57,990 --> 02:11:59,910
The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.

1249
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:02,330
They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.

1250
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:05,380
It's crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.

1251
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:08,630
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.

1252
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,880
Why did you pick me to command?

1253
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:13,180
I didn't pick you.

1254
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:16,510
Ike picked you.

1255
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:22,350
George, you have performed
brilliantly.

1256
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:24,480
You are loyal, dedicated.

1257
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:27,570
You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.

1258
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:31,530
George, you're a pain in the neck.

1259
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,490
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

1260
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:40,200
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

1261
02:12:40,450 --> 02:12:41,950
I owe you a lot.

1262
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:46,750
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.

1263
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,300
What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.

1264
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:18,910
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

1265
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:21,160
The point tank has run out too.

1266
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:25,120
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

1267
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:27,000
Yeah, I know.

1268
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,080
Were you in command here, captain?

1269
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,670
I was in command.

1270
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:38,510
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.

1271
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:43,590
Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.

1272
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,770
We started 11:00 last night.

1273
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:51,310
Finished a couple hours ago.

1274
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:57,980
This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.

1275
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:48,240
I had a dream last night.

1276
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:53,660
In my dream it came to me...

1277
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:57,210
that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.

1278
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:01,800
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

1279
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:05,130
Now I have precisely
the right instrument...

1280
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:10,140
at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.

1281
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:11,770
The Saar?

1282
02:17:11,970 --> 02:17:14,100
This will change too, very quickly.

1283
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:16,940
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.

1284
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:20,020
A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.

1285
02:17:20,230 --> 02:17:23,070
All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.

1286
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,030
Right now, the weak spot is here.

1287
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:32,040
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.

1288
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:35,790
What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?

1289
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:39,790
Fixed fortifications, huh?

1290
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:43,090
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

1291
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:47,380
When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome...

1292
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:49,600
anything built by man
can be overcome.

1293
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:57,060
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?

1294
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:00,610
The carts.

1295
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:05,610
They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.

1296
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:11,450
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.

1297
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:14,580
Then I remembered...

1298
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:20,840
that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

1299
02:18:21,710 --> 02:18:23,550
How cold it was.

1300
02:18:26,970 --> 02:18:30,640
They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.

1301
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:33,760
Napoleon was finished.

1302
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:38,770
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.

1303
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:41,690
Only the snow.

1304
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,150
Look at this, Cod.

1305
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:57,330
I love it.

1306
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:03,590
God help me, I do love it so.

1307
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:09,260
I love it more than my life.

1308
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:21,730
Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.

1309
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:27,230
The Allies march into the city
after four years of Nazi occupation.

1310
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,490
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...

1311
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:33,070
under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...

1312
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,120
gets an unforgettable welcome...

1313
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:37,660
as they enter their beloved Paris.

1314
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:44,670
In a powerful drive to the north...

1315
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:48,460
General Montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the French coastal towns...

1316
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:51,130
of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.

1317
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:54,640
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.

1318
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,400
Meanwhile, the main body
of Patton's army...

1319
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:06,940
resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.

1320
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,940
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.

1321
02:20:10,190 --> 02:20:14,910
It seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into Germany.

1322
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:26,790
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.

1323
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:35,680
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.

1324
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:37,100
I'm on my way to Germany.

1325
02:20:37,390 --> 02:20:39,970
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.

1326
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:45,350
I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

1327
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:47,310
Brad, you can't do that.

1328
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:50,650
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.

1329
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:53,700
There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.

1330
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:56,240
No, I don't know how serious it is...

1331
02:20:56,490 --> 02:21:01,000
but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

1332
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:02,460
Be there at 11:00.

1333
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,330
Yes, sir.

1334
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:48,130
There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume...

1335
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:51,050
that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.

1336
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:56,470
The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.

1337
02:21:57,380 --> 02:22:01,100
The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.

1338
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:06,980
Therefore I believe that's exactly
what they're going to do.

1339
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:51,730
I want you to start making
contingency plans...

1340
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:53,690
for pulling out
of our eastward attack.

1341
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:56,860
Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.

1342
02:22:58,650 --> 02:23:00,490
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

1343
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,830
I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.

1344
02:23:04,030 --> 02:23:05,950
From Diekirch, due north.

1345
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:10,500
From Orléans to Bastogne.

1346
02:23:10,710 --> 02:23:14,250
From Neufchâteau against the German
left flank.

1347
02:23:34,570 --> 02:23:36,900
We've identified four German armies:

1348
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:42,160
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.

1349
02:23:42,700 --> 02:23:44,700
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

1350
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:47,830
They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.

1351
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:51,170
And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.

1352
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:54,090
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...

1353
02:23:54,290 --> 02:23:58,260
has the 101st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.

1354
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:05,350
Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.

1355
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:09,930
If we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.

1356
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:13,270
If they take it,
we're in serious trouble.

1357
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:16,770
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...

1358
02:24:16,980 --> 02:24:20,240
and relieve the 101st
before they're torn to pieces.

1359
02:24:22,490 --> 02:24:24,820
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

1360
02:24:25,070 --> 02:24:27,450
At any rate, not for some weeks.

1361
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,160
What about you, George?

1362
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:33,500
I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.

1363
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:39,130
I'd give myself some leeway.

1364
02:24:39,710 --> 02:24:41,840
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.

1365
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:46,220
You're in the middle of a fight now.
It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

1366
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:48,810
My staff's already working
out the details.

1367
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:54,150
Frankly, I don't see how
it's possible.

1368
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,650
Not in this kind of weather.

1369
02:24:57,270 --> 02:25:00,110
I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.

1370
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:03,110
Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.

1371
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:04,700
But what about your men?

1372
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:09,330
You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.

1373
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:10,870
I trained these men.

1374
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:13,040
They'll do what I tell them to do.

1375
02:25:13,290 --> 02:25:17,000
We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.

1376
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:22,300
I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.

1377
02:25:22,550 --> 02:25:26,430
And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.

1378
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:32,430
Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.

1379
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,770
He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.

1380
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:37,560
Of course he would.

1381
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:41,070
Cause he's never realized that's
what we're in business for.

1382
02:26:59,310 --> 02:27:01,770
General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.

1383
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:03,650
You know what he said?

1384
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:06,030
What?

1385
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,030
He said, "Nuts."

1386
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:11,490
Keep them moving, colonel.

1387
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:14,080
A man that eloquent has to be saved.

1388
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:34,220
This is where it pays off.

1389
02:29:34,590 --> 02:29:36,220
The training and discipline.

1390
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:39,430
No other outfit in the world.

1391
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:43,810
Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.

1392
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:48,190
Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.

1393
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:52,070
God! God, I'm proud of these men!

1394
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:21,850
Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.

1395
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:24,310
101st Airborne's barely holding on.

1396
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:28,900
We need damned air cover. If we had
decent weather, we might make it.

1397
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:31,400
General Mason, sir.

1398
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,130
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.

1399
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:53,090
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.

1400
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:55,170
Yes, every last one you can find.

1401
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:56,720
Good evening, general.

1402
02:30:56,970 --> 02:31:00,180
I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.

1403
02:31:00,430 --> 02:31:02,390
There goes our air cover.

1404
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:05,310
We may have to wait
for better weather.

1405
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:10,440
Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.

1406
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:14,190
Going to keep moving.

1407
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,240
Is that clear?

1408
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:21,870
We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!

1409
02:31:22,910 --> 02:31:25,200
If we're not victorious...

1410
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:29,500
let no one come back alive.

1411
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:42,970
You know something, general?

1412
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:47,520
Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.

1413
02:31:49,270 --> 02:31:51,480
It isn't important for them to know.

1414
02:31:53,020 --> 02:31:55,230
It's only important for me to know.

1415
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:05,660
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.

1416
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:08,500
I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans...

1417
02:32:08,750 --> 02:32:11,080
with supreme command,
no gasoline...

1418
02:32:11,290 --> 02:32:13,290
and now this ungodly weather.

1419
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:15,630
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.

1420
02:32:16,670 --> 02:32:18,010
A weather prayer, sir?

1421
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:21,300
Yes, let's see if you can't get God
working with us.

1422
02:32:21,550 --> 02:32:24,010
Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.

1423
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:26,510
I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.

1424
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:29,640
I don't know how this
will be received, general.

1425
02:32:29,890 --> 02:32:32,810
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.

1426
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:36,190
I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty...

1427
02:32:36,440 --> 02:32:39,650
if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.

1428
02:32:39,940 --> 02:32:42,570
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.

1429
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:44,660
Yes, sir.

1430
02:33:15,310 --> 02:33:18,230
"Almighty and most merciful Father...

1431
02:33:19,150 --> 02:33:21,610
we humbly beseech Thee...

1432
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:24,070
of Thy great goodness...

1433
02:33:24,990 --> 02:33:28,450
to restrain this
immoderate weather...

1434
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,000
with which we've had to contend.

1435
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:37,000
Grant us fair weather for battle.

1436
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:39,920
Graciously hearken to us...

1437
02:33:41,050 --> 02:33:43,260
as soldiers who call upon Thee...

1438
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:46,220
that armed with Thy power...

1439
02:33:46,590 --> 02:33:49,560
we may advance
from victory to victory...

1440
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:52,140
and crush the oppression...

1441
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,940
and wickedness of our enemies...

1442
02:33:55,140 --> 02:33:57,440
and establish Thy justice...

1443
02:33:58,270 --> 02:34:01,610
among men and nations.

1444
02:34:04,990 --> 02:34:06,240
Amen."

1445
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:23,130
Weather's perfect.

1446
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:27,260
Cod, get me that chaplain.

1447
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:30,510
He's in good with the Lord
and I want to decorate him.

1448
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:00,500
Hiya, general!

1449
02:35:38,370 --> 02:35:41,000
Supported by medium bombers
and fighter bombers...

1450
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:43,790
flying sorties
against German positions...

1451
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,670
elements of the 3rd Army...

1452
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:48,470
spearheaded by the
4th Armored Division...

1453
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,260
drive into Bastogne...

1454
02:35:50,470 --> 02:35:52,970
to relieve its 18,000 defenders...

1455
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:54,850
on the day after Christmas.

1456
02:35:55,970 --> 02:35:59,270
During this operation,
3rd Army moved farther and faster...

1457
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:01,940
and engaged more divisions
in less time...

1458
02:36:02,190 --> 02:36:05,900
than any other army in the history
of the United States.

1459
02:36:14,330 --> 02:36:16,000
<font color=00FF40>This is the end...

1460
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:17,910
<font color=00FF40>the end.

1461
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:26,960
<font color=00FF40>Hurry, Steiger. I want everything destroyed.Papers, maps, everything!

1462
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:31,260
<font color=00FF40>Everything will be destroyed, General,that I can promise you.

1463
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:36,520
<font color=00FF40>I'll never let the Russians take me!I'll kill myself, like the Führer!

1464
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:40,980
<font color=00FF40>He, too, will be destroyed.

1465
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:45,270
<font color=00FF40>The absence of war will kill him.

1466
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:50,240
<font color=00FF40>The pure warrior...

1467
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:55,740
<font color=00FF40>a magnificent anachronism...

1468
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,220
Excuse me, sir.

1469
02:39:23,470 --> 02:39:26,230
General Katkov would like to know
if you'll join him...

1470
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:29,230
to drink to the surrender
of Germany.

1471
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:31,860
My compliments to the general.

1472
02:39:32,110 --> 02:39:35,280
Please inform him that I do not care
to drink with him...

1473
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:38,200
or any other Russian
son of a bitch.

1474
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:40,910
Sir...

1475
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,950
I cannot tell the general that.

1476
02:39:44,410 --> 02:39:45,910
You tell him that.

1477
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:47,790
Tell him word for word.

1478
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:12,810
The general says he thinks that...

1479
02:40:13,060 --> 02:40:14,940
you are a son of a bitch too.

1480
02:40:20,530 --> 02:40:23,570
Okay. I'll drink to that.

1481
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:25,580
One son of a bitch to another.

1482
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:10,500
Is it true that Roosevelt,
before he died...

1483
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:12,920
promised you
a command in the Pacific?

1484
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:17,920
Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't
think there's much chance of that.

1485
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:20,380
Doug MacArthur
doesn't want me up there.

1486
02:41:20,590 --> 02:41:23,760
We're told of "wonder weapons"
the Germans were working on:

1487
02:41:24,010 --> 02:41:26,470
Long-range rockets,
push-button bombing...

1488
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:29,140
weapons that don't need soldiers.

1489
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:30,810
"Wonder weapon"?

1490
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:34,190
My God, I don't see
the wonder in them.

1491
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:38,940
Killing without heroics. Nothing
is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed.

1492
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:43,110
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.

1493
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,990
No generals.

1494
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:48,950
Only those that are left alive
and those that are left...

1495
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:50,620
dead.

1496
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,910
I'm glad I won't live to see it.

1497
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:56,790
It's said you're still
using former Nazis in key positions.

1498
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,210
Despite the denazification policy.

1499
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:02,510
Well, if I'm supplied
with trained personnel...

1500
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:04,380
I'll get rid of the Nazis.

1501
02:42:04,630 --> 02:42:08,600
Until then, I'll use them to keep
the railroads and telephones working.

1502
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:12,100
After all, didn't most
ordinary Nazis join the Party...

1503
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:16,690
in about the same way Americans
become Republicans or Democrats?

1504
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:18,480
Yes, that's about it.

1505
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:26,570
You agree that national policy be made
by civilians, not by the military?

1506
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:30,160
Of course. But the politicians
never let us finish.

1507
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:33,580
They always stop short and leave us
with another war.

1508
02:42:34,370 --> 02:42:36,710
You thinking about our Russian allies?

1509
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:45,670
Did you say if you found your army
between the Germans and the Russians...

1510
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:47,800
you'd attack in both directions?

1511
02:42:48,050 --> 02:42:50,260
No, I never said that.

1512
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:52,770
I never said any such thing.

1513
02:42:53,390 --> 02:42:54,980
But I wish I had.

1514
02:43:09,530 --> 02:43:13,620
Sir, there's a call on your line from
supreme headquarters, General Smith.

1515
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:20,040
Bedell?

1516
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:22,380
Ike is furious.

1517
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:27,220
How could you compare Republicans
and Democrats to the Nazi Party?

1518
02:43:27,470 --> 02:43:29,590
And the statement
that you refuse to denazify...

1519
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:32,600
has the Russians, the British,
everybody, screaming.

1520
02:43:33,010 --> 02:43:35,730
Well, the hell
with the Mongoloid Russians.

1521
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:38,980
We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.

1522
02:43:39,230 --> 02:43:41,060
They gonna dictate policy too?

1523
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:43,480
George, don't be a fool.

1524
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:47,030
The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.

1525
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:51,700
The war shouldn't be over. We should
stop pussyfooting about the Russians!

1526
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:55,830
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why
not do it now, when the army's here?

1527
02:43:56,330 --> 02:44:00,000
Instead of disarming Germans let's
get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.

1528
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,960
You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.

1529
02:44:03,210 --> 02:44:04,920
I don't care. I'll tell you...

1530
02:44:05,170 --> 02:44:07,260
we've been fighting
the wrong people.

1531
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:10,970
You and I don't have to get involved,
you're so soft about it.

1532
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:14,510
Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them...

1533
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:16,640
and make it look like their fault!

1534
02:44:17,100 --> 02:44:20,350
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!

1535
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:22,270
Well, I'm no diplomat.

1536
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:25,190
I'm a combat soldier.
That's all they understand.

1537
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:29,200
Get Ike to give me the word,
and I'll kick them back to Russia!

1538
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:41,000
Shall I call the artist back, sir?

1539
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:44,750
Oh, the hell with it.

1540
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:49,970
Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!

1541
02:44:50,930 --> 02:44:52,470
Don't you know that?

1542
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:42,560
Field Marshal Montgomery,
his majesty is prepared...

1543
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:46,270
to receive the next chief
of the imperial general staff.

1544
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,870
Thank you.

1545
02:46:01,790 --> 02:46:03,370
Thank you.

1546
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:05,670
Take care of yourself.

1547
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:07,130
George.

1548
02:46:20,310 --> 02:46:23,180
Well, gentlemen...

1549
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:28,190
all good things
must come to an end.

1550
02:46:30,570 --> 02:46:33,400
And the best thing
that's happened to me...

1551
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:35,910
in my life...

1552
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:39,870
has been...

1553
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,250
uh...

1554
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,750
the honor...

1555
02:46:47,250 --> 02:46:50,290
and privilege...

1556
02:46:52,510 --> 02:46:54,670
of commanding the 3rd Army.

1557
02:46:57,470 --> 02:46:58,760
Goodbye...

1558
02:46:59,970 --> 02:47:01,560
and God bless you.

1559
02:47:28,210 --> 02:47:30,130
Brad...

1560
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:32,960
they've taken the 3rd Army
away from me.

1561
02:47:33,210 --> 02:47:34,460
I know.

1562
02:47:35,130 --> 02:47:38,050
I thought we could have dinner
together tonight.

1563
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:42,760
Thank you, Brad.

1564
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:45,350
That's damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.

1565
02:47:52,730 --> 02:47:55,280
Right now, I think I'll take
Willie for a walk.

1566
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:04,540
George, look out!

1567
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:14,460
After all I've been through...

1568
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:17,340
imagine getting killed
by an oxcart.

1569
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:23,430
No, Brad, there's only one proper way
for a professional soldier to die.

1570
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:27,680
That's from the last bullet
of the last battle of the last war.

1571
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:32,060
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.

1572
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:35,610
In our drive across Europe,
we liberated...

1573
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:37,900
12,000 cities and towns...

1574
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:40,990
and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.

1575
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:44,990
I sense from now on, just being
a good soldier won't mean a thing.

1576
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:50,040
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be
diplomats, administrators, you name it.

1577
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:51,870
God help us.

1578
02:48:57,090 --> 02:49:00,220
George, I want to say one thing.

1579
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:04,390
You've done a magnificent job
here in Europe.

1580
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:06,600
That's right, George.

1581
02:49:07,390 --> 02:49:12,520
That soldier you slapped did more to
win the war than any other private.

1582
02:49:15,610 --> 02:49:17,320
I'll see you for dinner.

1583
02:49:17,690 --> 02:49:19,190
Six-thirty?

1584
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:37,460
For over a thousand years...

1585
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:40,720
Roman conquerors
returning from the wars...

1586
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:45,680
enjoyed the honor of a triumph,
a tumultuous parade.

1587
02:49:46,510 --> 02:49:50,600
In the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals...

1588
02:49:50,850 --> 02:49:52,770
from the conquered territories...

1589
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:57,770
together with carts laden with
treasure and captured armaments.

1590
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:02,570
The conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot...

1591
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:06,120
the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him.

1592
02:50:07,030 --> 02:50:09,790
Sometimes, his children,
robed in white...

1593
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:13,580
stood with him in the chariot,
or rode the trace horses.

1594
02:50:14,670 --> 02:50:17,630
A slave stood behind the conqueror...

1595
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:20,500
holding a golden crown...

1596
02:50:21,210 --> 02:50:24,050
and whispering in his ear
a warning...

1597
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:26,550
that all glory...

1598
02:50:27,050 --> 02:50:28,890
is fleeting.
