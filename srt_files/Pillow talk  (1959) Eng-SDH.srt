00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,608
Don't ever do that again.

351
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,088
Mr. Allen,
we made an agreement.

352
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,525
You were on my time.

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,080
All right, so I overlapped
by a few measly minutes.

354
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,969
What am I supposed to do
when somebody calls me?

355
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,008
Be as rude as you are?

356
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,490
Have you anything
else to say?

357
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,211
Yes. Get off
my back, lady.

358
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,489
Stop living vicariously
in what you think I do.

359
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,164
There are plenty of warm
rolls in the bakery.

Now, just a minute, my boy.

frighten songwriters with it.

381
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,889
The trouble with you is
you're prejudiced against me

382
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,406
because I'm part
of a minority group.

383
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,484
What minority group?

384
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,485

what this show means to me.

through college together.

You worked your way through. You've
become an important songwriter.

392

You've had a couple
of big Broadway hits.

393
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,407
You started out with nothing

394
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,847
and you've really made
something out of yourself.

395
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,968
Me, I started out in college
with $8 million

396
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,486
and I've still
got $8 million.

to get ahead.

I've been through
three marriages with you.

You're like a fighter.

she is the loveliest,

she's the most talented
person I've ever met.

408

That's what you said when
you married that stripper.

409
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,651
She was not a stripper.
She was an exotic dancer.

Well, I don't know
for sure.

She claims she doesn't
want to marry me.

Why?

Jonathan,

468
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,244
before a man gets married, he's
like a tree in the forest.

469
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,604
He stands there independent,
an entity unto himself.

470
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,971
And then he's chopped down,
his branches are cut off,

471
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,121
he's stripped of his bark

472
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,885
and he's thrown into the river
with the rest of the logs.

473
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,361
Then this tree is
taken to the mill.

474
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,962
And when it comes out,
it's no longer a tree.
