1
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,486
Ten-hut!

2
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,349
Welcome home, Mr. President.

3
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,977
Over here, Mr. President!

4
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,228
Good to be home.

5
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,524
Thank you.

6
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,037
- What do you got?
- Let's go over it again.

7
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,707
Who do I see first this morning?

8
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,500
You've got Mr. Crenshaw at 11:30.

9
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,795
I can't do two things at once, you know?
I got NSC at 2:30.

10
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,089
- That'll only take half an hour.
- With Syria?

11
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,216
You've got that radio address
to go over...

12
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,179
...and the Legal Counsel speech
at the Monroe tomorrow night.

13
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,098
- The Monroe?
- Welcome home, Mr. President.

14
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,100
Yes, sir, the Monroe Hotel.

15
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,269
Have you got someone to double
for me there?

16
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,396
- We're working on it, sir.
- Good.

17
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,942
Try to find someone
who looks like me this time.

18
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,320
That last guy was a joke.

19
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,075
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...

20
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,494
...the President of the United States.

21
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,801
God bless you. Thank you.

22
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,721
Welcome to Durenberger's, Mr. President.

23
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,598
Thank you, one and all.

24
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,310
Let me just say,
from one chief executive to another...

25
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:51,941
...that there is no Chevrolet
like Durenberger's Community Chevrolet.

26
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,859
Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,154
- Mom, that's not the president, is it?
- I sure hope not.

28
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:02,451
I have the feeling that when people
find out about the $500 cash rebate...

29
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,663
...on all Geo Storms
and Geo Storm convertibles...

30
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,082
...that you're going to be even busier
than I am.

31
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,251
You said it, Mr. President.

32
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,047
See, I could veto this Simpson-Gardner
thing if I wanted to, but I don't want to.

33
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,258
Do you know why I don't want to?

34
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,219
It's got homeless shelters...

35
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,429
...Head Start centers...

36
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,639
."and, uh""

37
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,266
Hot lunches.

38
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,017
Hot lunches for little kiddies.

39
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,273
If I kill it, I'm gonna look like a prick.

40
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,692
I don't want to look like a prick.

41
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,568
I want you to look like pricks.

42
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,698
But, sir, we've tried to kill it.

43
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,907
Twice.

44
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,869
I don't think so, Howard, no.
If you'd killed it, it would be dead.

45
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,913
When I kill something...

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,873
...it always dies.

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,917
- Doesn't it, Bob'?
- Always did.

48
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,422
Mr. President, with the work your wife
has done with the homeless--

49
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,424
My wife.

50
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,633
Norman.

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,012
I don't want you to do this
because you're forced to.

52
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,806
I want you to do this
because you want to.

53
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,560
I want you to do it
because it's the right thing to do.

54
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:14,189
I want you to do it because you're acting
in the best interests of your country.

55
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,403
Well, I think that's it.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,168
- 6:30?
- Oh-ho!

57
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,129
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll see you then.

58
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,089
- How are you? Having fun?
- Hey.

59
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,259
Yes. Good to see you.

60
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,635
Ask me how I did.

61
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,138
- How did it go? Yeah?
- I killed them. It was great.

62
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,474
- See what you can do in here.
- Okay, what's up?

63
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,934
Hey. How are you, Mabel? Hi, Jennifer.

64
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,605
Mabel says it's too far on the bus.
Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her.

65
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,900
And Lola's been in your office crying
for almost an hour.

66
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,151
Lola, what happened?

67
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,321
Oh, Mr. Kovic, it's not my fault.
I learn on the IBM, okay?

68
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,114
- Yeah.
- Then they put me on the Wang.

69
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,953
Don't worry. We'll think of something.

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,748
Yeah. So tonight's the big night.

71
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,334
Yeah. It's some big secret.
He won't tell me.

72
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,960
Can't get out of it.

73
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,755
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna fix it.

74
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:23,175
Honey, call, uh, Murray.
Tell him we're on our way, okay?

75
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,386
It's Wednesday.
Everybody works on Wednesday.

76
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,055
Can I borrow your--? Thanks.

77
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,517
Don't cry. Murray.

78
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,977
Dave, I can't hire anybody else. I can't.

79
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,438
Murray, she flies on an IBM.

80
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,442
I don't have enough work
for the people you already gave me.

81
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,278
She's got three kids.
Her husband's a diabetic. Diabetic?

82
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,410
Just a short-term thing.
Straight temp job.

83
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,623
Please? Murray. Murray.

84
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,458
I'll see what I can do.

85
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,255
Thanks.

86
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,716
You feel okay about this?

87
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,385
Not yet.

88
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,220
You Will.

89
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,347
Do you want to go play some ball?

90
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,559
It's the middle of the afternoon.
I'm working.

91
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,228
Me too. Okay, well, um, thanks, Murray.

92
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,438
I'll see you tomorrow.

93
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,983
- Bye, Lola, Kate, Adriana, Pam.
- Bye, Dave.

94
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,737
<i>And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet</i>

Mr. Kovic?

112
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,712
I'm Duane Stevenson
with the United States Secret Service.

113
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,423
We're with the federal government.

114
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,885
I... I swear I thought
that was a legitimate deduction.

115
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,013
See, I do impersonations,
so I use that television with my work.

116
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,891
Mr. Kovic,
we're not here about your taxes.

117
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,646
On occasion, for security purposes...

118
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,982
...the Secret Service hires someone
to double for the president...

119
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,653
...at public functions
in exposed situations.

120
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,489
Your government needs your help.

121
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,410
Really?

122
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,044
I like it.

123
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,546
You look just like him.

124
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,214
- You think?
- Mm-hm.

125
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,132
And the coloring...

126
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,636
- Coloring is excellent.
- You really cut his hair this short?

127
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,138
- It's a perfect match.
- Doesn't come over the ears?

128
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,058
- You understand what you'll be doing?
- Uh, yeah. You want me to wave.

129
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,020
Wave from the door,
come down the stairs, get into the limo.

130
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,565
You know, if you want me
to do other stuff, uh, I can.

131
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,775
- If you want me to talk--
- Don't say a word.

132
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,068
Right.

133
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,782
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

134
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,516
Thank you all.

135
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,351
Thank you.

136
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,730
Is there a lawyer in the house?

137
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,066
You know...

138
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,235
...just now as I was coming
to the podium...

139
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,237
...I spotted my old friend,
Jordan Blankfort.

140
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,408
Now Justice Blankfort...

141
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,288
...who I haven't seen
since our law school days back at Yale.

142
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,666
You know, just seeing him makes me...

143
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,712
...kind of nostalgic
for those innocent days back then.

144
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,006
About the worst thing we ever did...

145
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,634
...was hoist somebody's underwear
up a flagpole.

146
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,805
<i>We need standardized parole criteria...</i>

147
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,352
<i>...that will guarantee a prisoner
will not be returned to the street...</i>

148
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:48,273
<i>...until he has paid his debt to society.</i>

149
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,154
<i>We need a judiciary
that is sensitive to the needs...</i>

150
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,364
Okay, let's go.

151
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,953
...of <i>the average American,
because that's what we were founded on.</i>

152
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,624
The dreams...

153
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,209
...the dreams of a few...

154
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,419
...struggling pilgrims...

155
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,339
...who imagined a system of laws...

156
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,300
...of the people, by the people...

157
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:20,180
...and for all the decent people
of this land! God bless you!

158
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,682
God bless America!

159
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,754
Hey-

160
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,090
Let's move it up a half hour.

161
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,802
You have the trade negotiations.
It needs to be handled.

162
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,144
He's here.

163
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,814
They weren't very enthusiastic.

164
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,524
Of course, they're lawyers.

165
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,198
Jesus Christ.

166
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,773
You're a very handsome man.

167
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,816
Thank you, Mr. President.

168
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,028
Just get rid of the grin.
You look like a schmuck.

169
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,115
He's all right.

170
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,036
Wish me luck.

171
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,746
- Call me if there's a war.
- Heh.

172
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,750
Move him out.

173
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,381
You're on.

174
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,881
Okay, you ready?

175
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,082
Mr. President?

176
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,794
President Mitchell!

177
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,847
God bless you! God bless America!

178
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,148
Thank you very much!

179
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,458
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it.
I got carried away.

180
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,753
I was pretty good though, wasn't I?

181
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:28,678
I guess something important must be going
on for the president to go through all this.

182
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,515
Something top secret.

183
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,878
Baby?

184
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,845
Hon?

185
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,812
Mr. President?

186
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,205
Doesn't look very good.
They say it hit both sides of his brain.

187
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,249
If he makes it,
he's gonna be a vegetable.

188
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,251
- I can't believe he'd do this.
- I know.

189
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,753
- Where's the girl?
- She's a little upset right now.

190
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,965
- We got her upstairs in the laundry room.
- Some nightmare.

191
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,259
Bob.

192
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,929
At some point,
we're gonna have to call the vice-president.

193
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,974
- Don't call the vice-president.
- What?

194
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,934
Just don't call him, Al.

195
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,270
- The guy's in a coma, Bob.
- I don't give a shit.

196
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,190
- Bob.
- This is mine, Al. It's all mine.

197
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,235
I made him. I built him.

198
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,572
And no Boy Scout is gonna come in here
and take it away from me...

199
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,034
...just because he happens
to be vice-president of the United States.

200
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,346
You know, uh...

201
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,143
...if you guys want to do something for his
birthday, uh, I've got some great birthday stuff.

202
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,854
I do this thing, uh...
My friends love this.

203
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,776
The president and the first lady are going
to Club Med, for their vacation...

204
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,653
Yeah.

205
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,822
Oh, sir.

206
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,495
What?

207
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,332
What?

208
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,710
What?

209
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,089
Back to the cottage.

210
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,216
What?

211
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,972
We'll start by going on television.

212
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:22,560
We'll admit he had a stroke,
but we'll say it was a mild stroke.

213
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,562
- A mild stroke?
- Yes.

214
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,691
And he ought to be up and around again
sometime soon.

215
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,984
Up and around?

216
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,862
How?

217
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,328
You know...

218
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,247
...I'm not scared.

219
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,876
I think I've been pretty cooperative.
I'd just like to know where we're going.

220
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,840
Nice.

221
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,479
Dave. I'm Alan Reed,
White House communications director.

222
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,524
And this is Bob Alexander,
our chief of staff.

223
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,694
We met earlier at the hotel tonight,
remember'?

224
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,071
Can I get you something to drink?

225
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,991
You sure? Coke, mineral water?
Something like that?

226
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,617
I'm fine.

227
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,832
But Dave, something has come up
and I think we need to talk about it.

228
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,169
I'm so sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to talk...

229
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,380
...but I saw the crowd and I got excited--
- Heh.

230
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,674
No, no, no,
we're not upset with you, Dave.

231
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,844
We think you did a terrific job.

232
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,804
Don't we, Bob?

233
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,683
- Terrific.
- In fact, we think you did such a good job...

234
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,352
...that we would like to...

235
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,354
...extend things a little.

236
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,106
- Extend things?
- Yes.

237
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,900
Extend them.

238
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,612
Come here.

239
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,165
Try it out.

240
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,672
- Try it out?
- Go ahead.

241
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,646
How's that feel?

242
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,897
Well, very nice.

243
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,276
Dave...

244
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,240
...the reason we invited you here tonight
is because...

245
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,034
...something has happened
to the president.

246
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,078
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

247
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,789
I know, it's difficult for all of us...

248
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,292
...but sometimes we need to put
our personal feelings aside and focus...

249
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,336
...on the good of the country.

250
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,632
What happened?

251
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,551
It's actually kind of serious, Dave.

252
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,931
I'm afraid the president's
not in very good shape.

253
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,934
- Will he be all right?
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,394
- Probably.
- We think so.

255
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,020
Yes.

256
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,397
Oh.

257
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,358
Dave.

258
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,570
Sometimes we need our friends...

259
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,990
...and even our enemies, to feel...

260
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,158
...safe and secure.

261
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,203
We need them to feel
like they can go to bed at night...

262
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,291
...knowing that President Mitchell
is fully in control.

263
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,919
We need them to feel like...

264
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,006
...he's sitting right here...

265
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,465
...in this chair.

266
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,343
Hey-

267
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,345
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

268
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,307
Wait a minute. Uh...

269
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,103
What about the vice-president?

270
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,855
Vice-president?

271
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,443
We didn't want to have to tell you this...

272
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,034
...but the vice-president
is mentally unbalanced.

273
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,788
- No.
- I'm afraid so.

274
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,333
- Really?
- Yes.

275
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,294
- Crazy?
- Certifiable.

276
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,218
How much do you usually get paid?

277
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,596
I don't know.

278
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,306
Depends. Uh...

279
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:32,435
Usually it's a barter kind of thing.

280
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,188
Is this legal?

281
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,649
Dave.

282
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,528
Have you ever driven through a red light,
huh?

283
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,406
You know, on an empty road...

284
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,576
...when there's nobody around
and you know it's safe?

285
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,329
I'm not sure. I might have.

286
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,039
Well, let's say...

287
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:57,043
Let's say your mother
is in the car and you...

288
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,545
...have to get her to the hospital.

289
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,131
You'd do it then for sure, wouldn't you?

290
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,425
Yes, I guess I would.

291
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,928
Now, let's say...

292
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,763
...the whole country...

293
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,681
...is in the car.

294
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,185
The entire United States of America.

295
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,397
- In the car?
- In the car.

296
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,690
I see what you mean.

297
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,151
Dave.

298
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,071
The country is sick.

299
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,158
And you're gonna get it to the hospital.

300
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,746
These are the private quarters.

301
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,000
The president's bedroom is on that side,
the first lady's is over there.

302
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,461
- First lady?
- Don't worry, you won't even see her.

303
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,046
They barely talk anymore.

304
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,382
- You're kidding.
- It happens.

305
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,306
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

306
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,480
- Hmm.
- You all right?

307
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,358
- It's very nice.
- Come this way.

308
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,027
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.

309
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,364
We'll be back to get you first thing
in the morning.

310
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,284
The Secret Service man
is right outside the door.

311
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,786
Good night, Mr. President.

312
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,621
Good night.

313
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,040
Sleep tight.

314
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,381
Thank you.

315
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,149
Whoa.

316
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,116
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Uh, nothing. Good night.

317
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,173
Nothing.

318
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,799
Good night.

319
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,370
At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell,
coming home from the Monroe Hotel...

320
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,498
...where he was giving a speech
to the American Legal Counsel...

321
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:44,710
...suffered what doctors describe
as a minor circulatory problem of the head.

322
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,548
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.

323
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,093
Doctors report that he should be up
and back to his normal schedule soon.

324
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,721
Now, let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.

325
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,683
The president has complete use
of his faculties...

326
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,352
...and retains full executive authority.

327
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,603
Any questions?

328
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,273
<i>The White House classifies
the president's condition...</i>

329
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,109
<i>...as a slight circulatory problem
of the head.</i>

330
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,610
<i>While technically a stroke...</i>

331
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,322
<i>...White House spokesmen say the
president's condition is far from serious...</i>

332
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,700
<i>...and he should be up and about
sometime soon.</i>

333
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,287
Do you know how many different kinds
of laws we've broken?

334
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,457
It's simple, Alan.

335
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,502
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.

336
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,672
We dig up some dirt on him
and then we force him to resign...

337
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,341
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.

338
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,385
The whole thing
takes a couple of weeks.

339
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,264
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?

340
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:42,310
- I was a senator, you know?
- Oh, I know.

341
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,229
And when our poor president
has another stroke...

342
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,565
...of course this time
much more serious...

343
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,443
...our newly appointed VP becomes...

344
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,361
Jeez.

345
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,071
What about containment, Al?

346
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,282
Thanks.

347
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:03,331
Okay. We got the nurses for 50 grand
apiece, and the doctors for 100.

348
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,876
- The older guy wanted head of the CDC.
- Is that everybody?

349
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,545
Duane's guys,
he's got them all under control.

350
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,464
Good. What about her?

351
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,798
Her?

352
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,509
Oh, the first lady?

353
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:20,473
She was giving a speech at Bryn Mawr.
I managed to catch her before she left.

354
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,849
And?

355
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:26,604
I told her his blood pressure went up
after a little incident at the hotel.

356
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,939
She seems to hate him now
more than ever.

357
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,399
Fine.

358
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,695
Everybody else is buying
the "minor stroke" story.

359
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,909
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.

360
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,912
These are amazing results.
I must say, Mr. President...

361
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,914
...even for a man with a minor stroke...

362
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,917
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.

363
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,585
Oh, that's great.

364
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,545
I'm feeling much better.

365
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,799
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.

366
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,093
Your ECG is completely normal...

367
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,055
...and, uh, your blood pressure
has even gone down.

368
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:04,100
Have you been exercising recently?

369
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,062
Yes. I mean...

370
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,940
...bicycling and, uh...

371
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,316
...weight lifting.

372
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,402
Looking after the diet. Uh...

373
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,989
Polo, climbing.

374
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,284
Like that.

375
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,955
Well, judging by these tests,
I see no reason why you can't, uh...

376
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,249
...return to work
within the next couple days.

377
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,458
- Great.
- Good.

378
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,751
Good.

379
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,002
Good.

380
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,717
- Uh, Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

381
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,643
Hold it.

382
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,689
- Remember everybody's name, faces?
- Yeah.

383
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,399
Keep it simple.

384
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,235
Course. Watch.

385
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,950
- Morning, ladies.
- Mr. President.

386
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,160
Diane.

387
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,287
- Good to see you.
- Well, welcome back, sir.

388
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:09,457
Good to be back. Just a false alarm.
Nothing to be worried about.

389
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,251
- Clara.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

390
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,919
- Nice to see you.
- You too, sir.

391
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,630
- It's good to be alive, isn't it'?
- Yes, sir.

392
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,840
Randi.

393
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,968
Oh, good morning, Mr. President.
I was really worried.

394
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,845
- I didn't know what was going on.
- Heh.

395
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,930
I'm so glad that you're feeling better.

396
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,766
- Why didn't you call me?
- Well, uh...

397
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,976
- You really had me worried.
- I'm fine. Well...

398
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,686
I was really worried.

399
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,438
- What's with her?
- Don't worry.

400
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,899
She's emotional.
She's attached to the president.

401
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,568
- Remember, you are the president.
- Ah.

402
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,945
Okay, let's get back to work.

403
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,532
Sick time is done. Let's call the-- Whoa.

404
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,537
False alarm. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

405
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,290
He's okay.

406
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,793
Let's go over it again, huh?

407
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,754
You met a girl. You fell in love.

408
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,215
- And we're going away on a holiday.
- For a month.

409
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,884
- A month?
- Right. Don't embellish.

410
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,846
Um, do I need to dial nine?

411
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,016
As soon as we sat down...

412
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,519
...he pulls out this ring
and I got so emotional...

413
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,272
...that I had to ask the waiter
to bring over another napkin.

414
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,066
Hang on.

415
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,736
Kovic Temps.

416
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,948
Oh, hi, Dave. Where are you?

417
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,703
You met who?

418
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,500
You're going where?

419
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,336
Cancun?

420
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,966
Oh, I think that's great.

421
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,553
She's very special. She's beautiful.
She's a princess.

422
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,682
She's, uh, really exotic and wonderful.
Uh...

423
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,351
She's, uh... She's Polynesian.

424
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:56,188
Well, half Polynesian
and, uh, half American.

425
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,690
She's, uh, Amnesian.

426
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,233
Hang UP-

427
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,485
Uh, she has a hang-up
about the royalty thing.

428
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,488
- Hang up the phone.
- Don't talk about that when you meet her.

429
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,783
I gotta go now. The plane's leaving.
Call you later. Bye.

430
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,827
It worked.

431
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,415
He's in love.

432
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,293
Thank God.

433
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,295
President continued his convalescence...

434
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,797
...resting in the White House
for the second day.

435
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,050
His personal physician pronounced him
in perfectly good health.

436
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,219
I have examined him thoroughly...

437
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,432
...and I don't believe that I have ever seen
the president in better shape.

438
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,227
<i>The president was able to
attend to some official business on Wednesday...</i>

439
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,189
<i>...and continues to be briefed
on all areas of national concern.</i>

440
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,400
The upper house and the lower house.

441
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:45,654
Senators are elected to six-year terms
and congressmen are elected to two.

442
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,031
Judiciary?

443
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,325
Veterans Affairs?

444
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,785
- Mark Davis.
- Agriculture.

445
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,538
Agriculture? Uh, uh, uh...

446
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,832
Cows, cows, calves, Metcalf.

447
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,626
Lawrence Metcalf. He's right there.

448
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,046
<i>So confident is the
White House about the president's recovery...</i>

449
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:06,425
...that the vice-president has been sent
on a 12-nation African goodwill tour.

450
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,053
This is Sander Vanocur
at the White House.

451
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,221
First thing we'll go over
is the mannerisms.

452
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,557
Alan has worked out
a sort of training program.

453
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,976
- Great.
- This is the briefing room.

454
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:19,229
It's where the president
holds most of his press conferences.

455
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,398
This may seem a bit strange at first...

456
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,694
...but, uh, even professional politicians
have trouble getting used to the--

457
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,780
A teleprompter.

458
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,533
- A teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
- No, I don't think so.

459
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,789
As I was saying, nobody expects you
to be Bill Mitchell overnight.

460
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:40,084
The most important thing
to remember is his general presence.

461
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,543
- Presence.
- Right.

462
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,504
Now, whenever he stands
at a podium...

463
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,716
...President Mitchell always has one hand
in the pocket of his coat.

464
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,512
That's at a press conference. Otherwise,
they're almost always on the podium.

465
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,973
Um, I'm not certain about that.

466
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,599
Remember the convention speech?

467
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,936
"An America,
stronger than the one we were given.

468
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:02,022
An America,
prouder than the one we found."

469
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,776
Right on the podium.
Except on "America," he points.

470
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,736
You know, that is very good.

471
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,279
Oh, I love that speech.

472
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,656
Thanks. I wrote it.

473
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,866
- You did?
- Yeah.

474
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,702
It's great.

475
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,997
"Somewhere, there is a distant light..."

476
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,917
...guiding us through this rocky shoal.

477
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:26,046
America isn't what we say here tonight.

478
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:31,260
It's in the faces and the smiles
of a Sunday afternoon.

479
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,429
It's in the gentle kindness...

480
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,472
...of the family kitchen...

481
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,891
...as we gather together...

482
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,186
"...when the sun goes down."

483
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,610
Can I keep this?

484
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,412
- Thought I wasn't gonna see her.
- It's five minutes.

485
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,914
She walks in, you wave to the press,
she leaves.

486
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,001
The first lady. I mean, uh,
couldn't I start with a cousin?

487
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,129
She hardly ever sees him.
She won't have a chance to tell.

488
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,839
Stop whining.

489
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,800
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.

490
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,344
All right.

491
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,097
We're ready for Mrs. Mitchell.

492
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,352
As soon as she comes in,
we'll move you out to the balcony.

493
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,732
All you have to say is,
"Thanks for doing this, Ellen."

494
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,817
- "Thanks for doing this, Ellen."
- Exactly.

495
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,696
She doesn't always like this stuff.
It might soften her up.

496
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,948
"Thanks for doing this, Ellen."

497
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:42,831
Why can't you die from a stroke
like everybody else?

498
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,048
What are you staring at?

499
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:57,012
Uh, ah, Mrs. Mitchell,
we're gonna do it right out here.

500
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,224
Who was she?

501
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:04,103
Another patriotic secretary?

502
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,146
Hmm?

503
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,316
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

504
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,777
Go to hell, Bill.

505
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,198
- I think we can get started now.
- Oh.

506
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,660
You can tell these two pit vipers
that this is the last one of these...

507
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,954
...I'll be doing for a while.

508
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,664
Okay.

509
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,293
You're doing just fine.

510
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,310
Wave.

511
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,105
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

512
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,940
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

513
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,317
- Mr. President, how are you feeling?
- Fine.

514
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,028
- Fine.
- Ready to get back to work?

515
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,948
You bet.

516
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,449
You bet.

517
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,742
I'm out of here.

518
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,161
Shit.

519
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,873
Will you be making decisions?
Are you back in charge?

520
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,167
- Mr. President.

GO, go!

523
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,683
Don't you have anything to say to me?

524
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,689
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

525
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,651
You don't change, do you, Bill?

526
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,575
She hates me.

527
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,535
Yes.

528
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,456
Wave to the camera. Wave to the camera.

529
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,272
Okay. Okay.

530
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,900
Here we go. First off,
we're gonna talk to Ted...

531
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,278
...on the, uh, new
Land Management Legislation.

532
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,239
- Ted.
- Yes, sir.

533
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,575
I think if you refer to Item 3
on the memorandum...

534
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,411
...you'll be delighted to notice that the...

535
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,956
Mr. President, slip your arms in there...

536
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,209
...and the machine will do everything
your arms do.

537
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,218
I once caught a fish...

538
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,638
...this big.

539
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,724
This is great.

540
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,107

Everybody!

We gotta <i>go</i>
DAVE: Yeah!

544
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,780
<i>Aye-yi-yi-yi</i>

545
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,366
Good boy!

546
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,618
Whoa! Ha, ha.

547
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,955
Got you!

548
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,500
This guy has had a rebirth.
This is a different fella in the White House.

549
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,211
It doesn't happen often, Bob,
but you're right.

550
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,756
There's a transformation. Don't know
what they're putting in the water.

551
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,259
Nothing to do the water
or anything else you drank.

552
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,388
He has faced death in the eye
and been transformed by it.

553
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,474
- Your boss looks better since the stroke.
- Thanks, Mr. Speaker.

554
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,101
- He's doing well.
- Thanks.

555
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,811
- Tell him I send my best.
- I will.

556
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,896
- Good luck.
- Good to see you.

557
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,568
Let me ask you a question now
right off the bat.

558
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,237
What is with President Mitchell lately,
huh?

559
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,240
Has this guy been having too many
Happy Meals for lunch or what?

560
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,786
Let's talk a little bit about desserts.

561
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:54,291
What you don't want to do
is eat doughnuts.

562
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,500
No doughnuts.

563
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,211
Thank you, Arnold.

564
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,048
Arnold, thank you so much.

565
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,342
- Want to Indian-wrestle?
- Heh.

566
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,052
Whoa!

567
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,514
<i>Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch...</i>

568
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,975
<i>...the President of the United States.</i>

<i>From the nation's capital,
The McLaughlin Group.</i>

570

571
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,686
...on major issues of the day.

572
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,147
Here's the moderator, John McLaughlin.

573
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,567
Issue one, the new Bill Mitchell.

574
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,569
Two weeks after his brush with death...

575
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,447
...the president is suddenly bounding
around the country...

576
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,866
...with the energy
of a high-school track star.

577
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,077
Is this merely overcompensation...

578
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,831
...or the indefatigable greatness
of a truly great man?

579
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,332
Freddie Barnes?

580
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,919
<i>John, the illness just crystallized
his thinking about his own presidency.</i>

581
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,004
<i>He realized he didn't have
to be a zombie.</i>

582
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,465
<i>He can show some life,
even act like a child.</i>

583
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,718
<i>He's showing the strength of character
he did after he got elected.</i>

584
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,972
<i>"BARNES". The guy got sick, right?
He recovered from his illness.</i>

585
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,057
<i>He is now rejuvenated.</i>

586
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,561
<i>McLAUGHLIN: On a political rehabilitation

00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,482
<i>It's an eight. The zombie is gone.</i>

589
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,734
<i>It's a three. The zombie will return.</i>

590
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,528
<i>- Chris.
- I think it's 86.</i>

591
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,991
<i>- He's still out to lunch, but looking good.
- ". The answer is eight.</i>

592
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,104
So the, uh...

593
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,858
...first lady and the president...

594
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,779
What is that?
How long has that been going on?

595
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,531
I can't say.

596
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,409
You mean, you don't know
or you can't say?

597
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,703
I can't say.

598
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,749
Ah, can't say.

599
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:32,634
So, uh, your job is to protect the president
all the time? That's your whole job?

600
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,261
Yes.

601
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,432
- Have a gun?
- Yes.

602
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,686
Ever use it?

603
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,146
Not yet.

604
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,367
You know, I've always wondered
about you guys.

605
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,287
The way they say you'd take a bullet
for the president.

606
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,496
What about it?

607
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,040
Is that really true?

608
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,377
I mean, would you let yourself be killed
to save his life?

609
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,753
Certainly.

610
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:18,471
So that means now you would
get killed for me too.

611
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,155
It would be wonderful for you
and great for the president.

612
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,533
I'm sorry, the only time that I have available
is the 25th.

613
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,952
- You out of your mind?
- That's the best I can do.

614
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,288
I'm gonna get back to you.
I gotta go. Bye.

615
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,749
You scheduled a whole day
with the first lady?

616
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,084
- It's a homeless shelter.
- Oh, excuse me.

617
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,377
It's gonna be great.

618
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,297
Caring about his wife,
spending time on her favorite issues.

619
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:56,217
I don't want him caring about his wife.
What about the vice-president?

620
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,762
The vice-president?

621
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,390
Well, you, uh, remember that First Liberty stuff
we almost got nailed on?

622
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,975
Yeah.

623
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,063
I just dumped it on him instead.

624
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,024
- When does it break?
- Couple of days.

625
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:14,110
Look at Dave's tracking polls.
They'll burn up in your hands.

626
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,530
Seventy-three percent with seniors,
84 with working mothers.

627
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,033
Alan, we still gotta control this guy.

628
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,837
Why are you doing this, Bill?

629
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,047
What?

630
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:37,384
Since when do you care
about the homeless?

631
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,803
- I care about the homeless.
- Oh, yeah.

632
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,806
I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.

633
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:14,087
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. President.

634
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:19,300
Good morning, kids. How are you?
Thank you for that nice welcome.

635
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,348
They're all kids.

636
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:29,310
That's right, Bill. Kids are homeless too.

637
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,729
- Where are the parents?
- Hi.

638
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:35,066
A lot of them are in shelters,
but some of them are still out on the street.

639
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,901
Shake hands with the president.

640
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,904
- Hi, there.
- How are you?

641
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,990
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Hello.

642
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,743
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

643
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,369
How do you do?

644
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:50,165
One of the things that happens
when kids become homeless...

645
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,542
...is they start
to lose communication skills.

646
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,086
So here at Helping Hand,
they play a lot of games...

647
00:45:55,253 --> 00:46:00,216
...that encourage the kids to relate
to each other and to express themselves.

648
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,803
Oh, no, poor Joe.

649
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,682
He has no hair.

650
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,852
Oh, no, poor Joe.

651
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,479
He has no--

652
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,147
Eyes.

653
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,691
Right. Very good.
Very good. Let's try one more.

654
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,444
Everybody together now.
Everybody pay attention.

655
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,072
Here we go. Oh, no, poor Joe.

656
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,033
- He has no--
CHILDREN: Feet.

657
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,704
Great, great, great. All right.

658
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,918
Hi, there.

659
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,004
What's your name?

660
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,299
- David.
- David?

661
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,218
Great name.

662
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,306
What are you doing over here, David?

663
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,308
Nothing.

664
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,021
Hey, guys. Not now, okay?

665
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,148
Thanks.

666
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:04,113
Don't you like playing games
with the other kids?

667
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,032
No.

668
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,744
Do you like magic?

669
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,329
It's okay.

670
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,206
Okay.

671
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,999
Watch this.

672
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:21,756
Where'd it go?

673
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,550
The answer is in this riddle.

674
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:26,511
What can run all day
without ever getting tired?

675
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,763
Do you know?

676
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,015
I'll give you a hint.

677
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,101
It's not your ear.

678
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:34,978
And it's not your mouth.

679
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,313
My nose.

680
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,524
Your nose. Exactly.

681
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,943
And look, oh, there it is.

682
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,279
See? It was there all the time.

683
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,572
It went up in the air.

684
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,952
And fell on my nose.

685
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,080
Yeah.

686
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,458
Is the first lady still there?

687
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,419
Mm-hm.

688
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,212
Does she look mad?

689
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,799
- Hmm, not really.
- Good.

690
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,720
First cover of <i>Time</i> magazine
and I need a shave.

691
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,098
Tough little moment with the dog.

692
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,017
Here you are on the cover.

693
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,685
- Oh, yeah?
- Front page.

694
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:17,979
- That's you right behind me.
- Where, what?

695
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,064
See? Okay, here's me.

696
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,274
Now look over here.

697
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,986
You see those 20 guys and then, bing,
there you are right behind the machine.

698
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,488
- That's me?
- Yeah, looking very strong and, uh...

699
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,198
...forbidding.

700
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,493
Have you ever thought
about wearing a sweater?

701
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,746
Just kind of blend in more. Um...

702
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,833
Stand up. There you are again,
coming off the helicopter.

703
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,045
Sweaters make my neck look too thick.

704
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,964
Really? You got a sweater vest?
You could wear a tie.

705
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,175
Think a sweater vest
would look good on me?

706
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,474
Do you have the paperwork
on Simpson-Gardner?

707
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,518
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah, hold on. It's right here.

708
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,688
- Just came in.
- I think he's gonna veto it.

709
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:18,498
Bill Mitchell...

710
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,629
...votes no.

711
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:35,974
<i>Hail to the chief
He's the one we all say "Hail" to</i>

712
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,478
<i>We all say "Hail"
Because he keeps himself so clean</i>

713
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:45,817
<i>He's got the power
That's why he's in the shower</i>

714
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,235
<i>And he's just</i>

715
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,113
I can't believe you would do
something like this.

716
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,364
- Not even you.
- Aah!

717
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,866
How could you?

718
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,828
- How could I what?
- Don't patronize me.

719
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,705
I'm not one of your little bimbos.

720
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,542
And turn around.

721
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:05,503
I'm talking to you.
Will you please turn around?

722
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,341
Turn around.

723
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,766
You know, if you want
to be the same old selfish...

724
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,810
...bastard, um...

725
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,771
...go ahead. I've gotten used to that.

726
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,859
But don't put on this "man of the people"
routine and then do something like this.

727
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,986
I don't understand.

728
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,739
You know very well
that was not a Works Bill you vetoed.

729
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,283
That would've given
those children homes.

730
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:40,079
When I think of that spectacle you put on
with the little boy and the magic trick.

731
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,665
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with the magic trick?

732
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:46,002
It was some magic.
You made their funding disappear.

733
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,171
Look, if there's been some mistake--

734
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,672
There's no mistake, Bill.

735
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,133
When you veto their funding,
that's not a mistake.

736
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,928
When you hurt someone intentionally,
that is not a mistake.

737
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,431
Look...

738
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,184
Ellen. Ellen!

739
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:11,527
Ellen. Ellen. Ellen.

740
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:17,283
Call Bob. Call Alan.
Tell them I want to see them now.

741
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,202
But it's 10:30 at night.

742
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,995
You got it.

743
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,545
What the hell is this?

744
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,672
What the hell is this?

745
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,091
<i>The New York Times.</i>

746
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,593
No, this.

747
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,638
"President vetoes Works Bill."

748
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:39,889
We vetoed that?

749
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,307
No.

750
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,184
We didn't veto anything.

751
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:47,188
Dave, these things get awfully complicated
sometimes, and I think you have to--

752
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,731
That shelter was in this bill.

753
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,526
- Take care of this.
- Believe me, Dave, if we could have--

754
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,319
Lots of shelters were in this bill.

755
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,822
- Listen, you little shit.
- Dave. Dave.

756
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,826
The budget is a very complicated thing.
Even I don't understand it sometimes.

757
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,495
Occasionally, we have to make some cuts.
And in order--

758
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,497
- But we went there.
- Dave.

759
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,875
- We saw those kids.
- Yes, you did.

760
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,546
And if you can find a way to cut
$650 million from the federal budget...

761
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,673
...you can keep your lousy shelters.

762
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,510
Okay.

763
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:21,556
Oh, and by the way...

764
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,475
...don't you ever send for me again.

765
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,914
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see the president.

766
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,291
Is that right?

767
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,750
He asked me to come.

768
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,671
- And your name?
- Blum. Blum. Murray Blum. B-L-U-M.

769
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,548
- Come on, Dave.
- Sit down. It's okay.

770
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,175
- Sit down.
- I don't want to sit.

771
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,719
- I don't want to. Please.
- Murray, come on.

772
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,387
Okay, fine.

773
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,640
This place is probably bugged.

774
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,394
It's not bugged. It's okay, Murray.

775
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:16,444
You could get in so much trouble
if they find out.

776
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,696
- With who?
- The government.

777
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,907
I'm the government.

778
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,327
Wild, huh?

779
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:29,248
Murray, I can't tell you the whole story.
It's kind of a national emergency thing.

780
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,209
You've gotta help me cut the budget.

781
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,087
You gotta cut the budget?

782
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:38,925
Yeah. About $650 million.

783
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,386
You look hungry.

784
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,724
Diane, could you come in here
for a minute?

785
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,893
Just watch.

786
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:53,064
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Yes, uh, we need two copies of the budget.

787
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:56,484
And, uh, could you arrange for dinner for two
in the dining room?

788
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,693
Right away, sir.

789
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,238
And we have work to do
so we're not to be disturbed.

790
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,573
- I understand, sir.
- Oh, and, uh...

791
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,827
Do you think they could, uh, rustle up some
fresh bratwurst and some hot mustard?

792
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,622
- I think that can be arranged.
- Thanks, Diane.

793
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,670
- I love bratwurst.
- I know.

794
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,673
Dave, I've been over this a bunch
of times. It doesn't add up.

795
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:23,928
Who does these books? If I ran my
business this way, I'd be out of business.

796
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,683
So, what can we do?

797
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:32,103
I see a lot of places you could save,
but I can't make those choices.

798
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,689
I'm not the president. I mean...

799
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:39,360
You know, I mean, I'm not, uh, the one,
you know, pretending to be the president.

800
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,028
Ah.

801
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,655
I understand.

802
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,575
Let me give it a try.

803
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,663
- You?
- Yeah.

804
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,374
Let me try.

805
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,627
- Okay. You want to try?
- Yeah.

806
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,964
All right. All right.
Here's something right here.

807
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,299
Look at that.

808
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,397
Good morning, Bob. How are you?

809
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,940
All right.

810
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:19,525
Good morning.

811
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,652
Drew.

812
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,530
It's a work of art.

813
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:30,077
Look at this. "Vice-president's office linked
to S&L scandal." Alan, you're a genius.

814
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,495
We're on our way.

815
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,414
Say, what's with the cameras?

816
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,833
Hundredth cabinet meeting.
It'll be a nice touch.

817
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,293
- Oh, right.
- Morning.

818
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,462
Good morning.

819
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,881
Morning.

820
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,175
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

821
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:46,344
- How is everyone?
- Fine, thank you.

822
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,887
Good, ahem.

823
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,311
Okay. Before we get started, uh...

824
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,356
- ...I'd like to go over the budget.
- Budget?

825
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,484
- Do we have anything on the budget today?
- No, I don't think so.

826
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,571
Now, I, uh...

827
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,908
I think I've found some ways to put back
the homeless section...

828
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,785
...of the Simpson-Gardner Works Bill.

829
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,163
Mr. President, I don't believe
that's on your agenda today.

830
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,708
No, it's a last minute change, Bob.

831
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:25,466
Uh, now, uh, the way I see it,
we need $650 million in order to, uh...

832
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,551
...keep the project.

833
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,721
Now, some of this can be done.

834
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,848
- Uh, through simple changes...
- it's all right.

835
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,184
...in our cash management.

836
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,852
Uh, for example...

837
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:40,731
...uh, according to the OMB,
we've got, uh, 17 defense contractors...

838
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,942
...who are delinquent in their contracts.

839
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:44,443
Uh, now, is this true, Frank?

840
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,529
Uh, I believe so, yes.

841
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,156
So even though they're late...

842
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,117
...we keep paying them on time?

843
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,786
Well, in a sense...

844
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,749
Yeah.

845
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,585
Okay, now,
instead of giving them money...

846
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,671
...for something they haven't finished...

847
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,757
...we could hold back that cash,
stick it in interest-bearing--

848
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,342
Mr. President.

849
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,512
Yes.

850
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,060
Nothing.

851
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,481
Great.

852
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,608
Uh, like I was saying, if we took that cash...

853
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,319
...and stuck it
in even an ordinary savings account...

854
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:31,198
...we'd be making
$23 million a month in interest.

855
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,076
Well, technically, that's true, but, uh...

856
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,661
Oh.

857
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,124
I suppose it's true.

858
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,835
Okay. Okay.

859
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:46,213
Okay, so that's $23 million...

860
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,010
...times 12 months.

861
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,679
Okay. Good.

862
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:54,930
Uh...

863
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:58,934
Unfortunately, money management's
only gonna get us halfway to our goal.

864
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,770
In order to get the rest of the money,
we're gonna have...

865
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,565
...to start making some tough choices.

866
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:05,858
Uh, the Commerce Department.

867
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,527
Yes, Mr. President?

868
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:13,491
Uh, you're spending $47 million
on an ad campaign...

869
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:17,077
..."to boost consumer confidence
in the American auto industry."

870
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,871
Yes, sir, uh...

871
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,750
It's designed to bolster
individual, uh, confidence...

872
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:26,045
...in a previous domestic
automotive purchase.

873
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:29,256
So we're spending $47 million
so that somebody can feel better...

874
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,383
...about a car
that they've already bought?

875
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:35,554
- Yes, but I wouldn't categorize it that way.
- No, no, I'm sure that's important...

876
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,600
...but I don't want to tell some 8-year-old
kid he's gotta sleep in the street...

877
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,937
...because we want people
to feel better about their car.

878
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,024
Do you want to tell him that?

879
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,403
No, sir.

880
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,740
No, I sure don't.

881
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,785
Of course not.
Well, then, that's another 47 million.

882
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:01,413
So this is good. We're doing good.
We're doing real good. We're on our way.

883
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,750
Okay, let me just add that, uh,
to the tally here.

884
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,253
That'll be plus 47...

885
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,963
Nine.

886
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,258
Five, carry the one...

887
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:16,095
...makes $656 million...

888
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:19,139
...which means we can keep the program.

889
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,819
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you for your help.

890
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,487
Well done.

891
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,155
Thanks.

892
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,575
Thank you.

893
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,876
Uh, excuse me.

894
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,420
Um...

895
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,422
- Mrs. Mitchell.
- What is it, Jeff?

896
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:55,301
You're not gonna believe
what your husband just did.

897
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:00,931
I'm gonna kill him.

898
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,518
You can't kill a president.

899
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,812
He's not a president.
He's an ordinary person.

900
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:08,439
I can kill an ordinary person.

901
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:10,941
- Bob.
- I can kill 100 ordinary people.

902
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,651
Bob.

903
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,778
He's only doing what you told him to do.

904
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,155
What I told him to?

905
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:19,950
I heard you. You said, "Cut $650 million
off the federal budget..."

906
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,703
...and you can keep your shelters."
- I didn't mean it.

907
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,581
Why would I want
to save a homeless shelter?

908
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,041
He was only doing his job.

909
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,002
His job? His job? It's not his job!
It's my job!

910
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,503
Bob.

911
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,131
Will you calm down'?

912
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,843
Was he on the Trilateral Commission?
Was he a senator?

913
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,721
Was he in "Who's Who"
nine years in a row? Hello, Judy.

914
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,681
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi.

915
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,517
<i>- I'll</i> destroy him. I'll shred the bastard.
- Don't do this.

916
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,729
- I'll look him away for good.
- Then we'll all go to jail together.

917
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,910
What do you mean by that?

918
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,205
Just what you think I mean.

919
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,667
Are you threatening me?

920
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:14,254
Well...

921
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,383
Yeah.

922
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,593
I guess I am.

923
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,517
Thanks, Murray.

924
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,519
You did great.

925
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:38,320
Hey, maybe you can come back sometime.
We can go to, uh, Camp David or something.

926
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,447
- Camp David?
- Yeah.

927
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,618
Get out of here as fast as you can.

928
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:08,851
Come on, seven.

929
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,229
Come on, number six.

930
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,996
We both lose.

931
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:30,789
We both lose.

932
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,961
I saw your light was on, so I just...

933
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:39,339
Mind if I sit down?

934
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,717
Uh...

935
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,178
No. Please.

936
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,182
Would you like, uh...

937
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,768
No, thanks.

938
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,239
That was quite a thing you did today.

939
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,035
Anyone would've done that.

940
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,287
I don't think so.

941
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,539
You helped a lot of people.

942
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:19,213
You know...

943
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,132
...it kind of reminded me...

944
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,303
...of that thing you did a long time ago
in the state legislature.

945
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,306
Oh, yeah.

946
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,475
Hmm, me too.

947
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,979
You weren't in the state legislature.

948
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,987
Hi, I'm Ellen Mitchell.

949
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,156
Who are you?

950
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,540
Look, I'll make this easy on you.

951
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,751
I never see him anymore.

952
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,505
I barely know him anymore.

953
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,467
I'd just kind of like to know where he is.

954
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,184
This could get me into a lot of trouble.

955
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,380
Open it, please, Duane.

956
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:54,892
Oh, my God.

957
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,852
I'm sorry, you're not allowed in here.

958
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:00,647
- Mr. Alexander left strict instructions.
- I'll explain it to you later.

959
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:05,861
Oh, no.

960
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,848
What happened?

961
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:36,975
It was a stroke.

962
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,312
It's pretty bad.

963
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,110
I don't understand.

964
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,322
Is he going to...?

965
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,034
I'm sorry.

966
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,888
You're leaving?

967
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,475
I'm not the first lady anymore.

968
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,228
I shouldn't be here.

969
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,188
Where are you going?

970
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,528
Home.

971
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,322
Where's home?

972
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,909
Look, can we stop with the 20 questions?

973
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,620
Because I'm really not in the mood.

974
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,506
Souvenirs. Towels and stuff.

975
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,426
You're leaving too?

976
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,223
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

977
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,476
Heck, I even thought I was helping.

978
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,584
You know...

979
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:28,795
...you make this little deal
with yourself that...

980
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,631
...you can put up
with all the other women...

981
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,342
...and you can even do
without a life.

982
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,972
You can even do without children...

983
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,351
...because you believe
in what you're doing and you think...

984
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:48,565
You thought you had a chance
to help people.

985
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,907
How are you gonna get home?

986
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:59,993
Um...

987
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,165
I don't know. I hadn't really...

988
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,334
...thought it out that far.

989
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,090
Are you sure this goes somewhere?

990
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,093
They say LBJ used it all the time.

991
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,927
Duane said he'd leave a car
right over there.

992
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,476
When did you, uh, first know?

993
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,436
I mean, about me?

994
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,274
In the car, I think.

995
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,027
On the way to the shelter,
you looked at my legs.

996
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,240
Bill stopped looking a long time ago.

997
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,245
I thought maybe it was in the shower, heh.

998
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:28,790
No.

999
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,221
Oh, my God.

1000
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,765
- What?
- Police.

1001
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,231
- What'd you do?
- I don't know.

1002
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:04,242
- See your driver's license, sir?
- Here, sir.

1003
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,411
And registration.

1004
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:11,958
- Um...
- No, uh, I, uh, must've left it at home.

1005
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,461
Step out of the car, please.

1006
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,175
- Both of us?
- Yes, both of you, please.

1007
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:29,100
Well, you may not be aware...

1008
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:32,812
...but there is a posted "No left turn" sign
just down the block here.

1009
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,439
You went right through it.

1010
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:36,816
Oh.

1011
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,486
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- Oh, my gosh.

1012
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,947
Oh.

1013
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,782
We're look-alikes.

1014
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:46,201
Heh, we don't look like each other,
but I mean--

1015
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:50,247
I know what you think. People hire us
to impersonate the president and first lady.

1016
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,749
- We work out of an agency.
- You sure look like him.

1017
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,377
Thanks. We work very hard at it.
I mean, uh, she...

1018
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:58,088
She got her hair cut to look--
Perfect match.

1019
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,258
We just, uh, played the Sapperstein wedding.
They loved us.

1020
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,261
We did... We did our, uh,
Club Med routine...

1021
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:08,348
...where the first lady and the president
go to Club Med, and there's Bill Mitchell.

1022
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,685
He's like,
"At 0700, I want an hour of volleyball.

1023
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:15,981
And then at 0830, I want a complete
briefing on the whole surf situation."

1024
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:20,318
And then the big finale
at, uh, the Talent Club.

1025
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,946
<i>The sun will come out tomorrow</i>

1026
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,448
<i>Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow</i>

1027
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,700
I'm okay.

1028
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:31,496
<i>There'll be sun
Just thinkin' about tomorrow</i>

1029
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:34,291
<i>Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow</i>

1030
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,919
<i>Till there's none tomorrow</i>

1031
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:44,551
<i>Tomorrow, I love you
Tomorrow, it's only</i> a <i>day away</i>

1032
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:51,224
Tomorrow, tomorrow, we love you, tomorrow

1033
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:57,564
<i>You are only a day away</i>

1034
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:03,611
Thank you. Thanks.
We haven't worked out the final harmony.

1035
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,864
- This is a full-time job?
- Uh, yeah, lately.

1036
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:08,450
Lately, it's been, uh, pretty much full-time.

1037
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,953
Mr. and Mrs. Kovic,
I'm not gonna give you a ticket.

1038
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,330
You're not?

1039
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,666
I think you ought to save
all the money you have.

1040
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:19,502
- Not gonna give a ticket.
- Right.

1041
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,171
- Says we should save.
- Thank you.

1042
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,548
Thanks. That's very funny, heh.

1043
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,383
- Listen, you're very good.
- Right.

1044
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,304
- But she needs a lot of work.
- Yes, I know. She's kind of new at it.

1045
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:30,513
Now, you drive safely, huh?

1046
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,558
Thank you. Thank you, officer.
Thank you very much.

1047
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,393
Okay.

1048
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,239
Uh, I'm not sure I'm this hungry.

1049
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:51,868
Wait. This is a very special sandwich.

1050
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,335
This is good.

1051
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:01,544
What's in it?

1052
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:03,671
That's a secret.

1053
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,927
You have a lot of secrets.

1054
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:10,637
L guess.

1055
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,357
So, what do you do the rest of the time?

1056
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:24,442
You mean,
when I'm not running the country?

1057
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,236
Mm-hm.

1058
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:30,615
I run a temp agency.
You know, secretaries and stuff.

1059
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,993
- You mean, you find people jobs?
- Yes.

1060
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,703
Hmm.

1061
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,455
Is that funny?

1062
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,333
It's just more than most people
do around here.

1063
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:44,546
Don't get carried away.
I'm not that good at it.

1064
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,297
And your family?

1065
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,800
I mean, I assume you're married.

1066
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:51,886
I was.

1067
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,596
Once.

1068
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:55,974
It didn't take.

1069
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:05,984
You know, Dave--

1070
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,236
It is Dave, isn't it?

1071
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,323
I can't keep all of this a secret.

1072
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,201
Yeah, I know.

1073
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:19,873
I liked doing it though.

1074
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,419
I mean, not the fancy stuff
with all the helicopters...

1075
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:26,754
...and the TV cameras...

1076
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,842
...but I liked saving that shelter.

1077
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,180
I liked helping people
that I hadn't even met before.

1078
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:40,810
Just then, I felt like I wasn't
pretending anymore.

1079
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,274
I don't think you were pretending.

1080
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:00,622
What would you do
if you were still in there?

1081
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,878
I mean, if you had one more chance
to be president...

1082
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:09,422
...what would you do then?

1083
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,392
Lots of things.

1084
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,122
Excuse me. You can't stop here.

1085
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,625
Look, there's no visitors at--

1086
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,295
- Hi.
- Mr. President?

1087
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:57,303
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't realize that--
- Just getting a little fresh air.

1088
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,097
Certainly, sir.

1089
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:01,766
I was wondering, if you don't mind,
how did you get--?

1090
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:04,310
The president wanted some ice cream.

1091
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:34,048
You make a nice president, Dave Kovic.

1092
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,050
Thanks.

1093
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,847
See you.

1094
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,155
We are delighted you're visiting
the White House.

1095
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,532
Let's keep moving, folks. We're walking.

1096
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,410
A million visitors go through
the White House every year...

1097
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:05,330
...making it the most frequently
toured home in the country.

1098
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,832
We're walking, we're walking
and we're stopping.

1099
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:10,501
Whatever changes
from one administration to the next...

1100
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,962
...the White House always maintains
its dignity.

1101
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,255
We're walking.

1102
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:17,634
He's walking. He's Bob Alexander,
our White House chief of staff.

1103
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,010
I can't believe it!

1104
01:17:19,177 --> 01:17:21,596
What an honor, really, for all of you.
We're walking.

1105
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:25,099
Forty-two presidents and their wives
have lived in the White House.

1106
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,484
I had nothing to do with this.
He called it himself. I swear to God.

1107
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,829
What do you think you're doing?

1108
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,290
You mean, the press conference?

1109
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:52,752
I, uh, have a couple of ideas I wanted
to share with the country.

1110
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:55,546
Share?

1111
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,423
Share?

1112
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,634
You don't call a press conference.

1113
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,178
I call a press conference.

1114
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,972
You're nothing. Do you understand?

1115
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:06,933
You're nobody.

1116
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,893
I'm not nobody.

1117
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,770
You're lint!

1118
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,689
You're a flea!

1119
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,316
You're a blip!

1120
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,027
Well...

1121
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:19,946
...maybe I am.

1122
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:22,365
But you're fired.

1123
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:25,535
What?

1124
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:28,913
I said you're fired. Go on, get out of here.

1125
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,290
- Oh, I'm fired?
- Yup.

1126
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,000
You're fired.

1127
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,171
- Fine.
- Fine?

1128
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,424
Fine.

1129
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,969
The whole press corps is right out there.

1130
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:45,930
Should I go tell them?
Or did you want to?

1131
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:52,311
Darling, they're waiting in the Press Room.
I really think you ought to get in there.

1132
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:53,688
Oh.

1133
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:55,398
Bob.

1134
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:58,609
I'm sorry. I thought we were alone.

1135
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,788
I'd like your resignation on my desk
by the time I get back.

1136
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,173
Don't touch anything on that desk.

1137
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,300
- How are you?
- How you doing?

1138
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,801
Hi.

1139
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,137
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- It's the vice-president.

1140
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,222
- What could it be?
- The ex-vice-president.

1141
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,392
He'll be a prison reformer
in Denver in a year.

1142
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:34,061
Okay, they're coming. Let's go.

1143
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:41,861
Good luck.

1144
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:52,997
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

1145
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:54,457
I, uh...

1146
01:19:56,042 --> 01:20:00,171
I'd like to begin
with an announcement that, uh...

1147
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,174
...may come as a surprise
for many of you.

1148
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:04,467
I've, uh...

1149
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:08,221
...asked Bob Alexander to resign
as White House chief of staff.

1150
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:15,937
Over the last few months, Bob and I
have come to believe in different things.

1151
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:21,776
He thinks this country's fine and we
should go about doing business as usual.

1152
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,322
I just don't feel that way.

1153
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:28,991
Not anymore.

1154
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,411
Because, hey, things aren't fine.

1155
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:36,207
We've got so many problems, that we don't
even want to look at them anymore.

1156
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:39,544
They just blend together
into this great, big noise...

1157
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,630
...and pretty soon we can't even
hear ourselves think.

1158
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:45,174
But that's not even the worst part.

1159
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,051
The worst part is that we...

1160
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,429
We feel we can't do anything about it.

1161
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:53,808
And that's a tragedy...

1162
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:55,560
...because we can.

1163
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:02,608
But we don't know where to start.
Maybe that's what it is.

1164
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,111
But I have an idea...

1165
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:07,238
...of where we can start.

1166
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,201
From today...

1167
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,789
...I'm gonna make it the responsibility
of this government...

1168
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:19,709
...to find a job for every American
who wants one.

1169
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,717
Have you ever seen the look
on somebody's face...

1170
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:30,553
...the day that they finally get a job?

1171
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,556
I've had some experience with this.

1172
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,183
They look like they could fly.

1173
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:40,855
And it's not about the paycheck. It's about
respect. It's about looking in the mirror...

1174
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:44,358
...and knowing that you've done
something valuable with your day.

1175
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:48,571
And if one person could start
to feel that way, and then another person...

1176
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:53,284
...then pretty soon all these other problems
we're facing may not seem so...

1177
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,244
...impossible.

1178
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,837
You don't really know
how much you can do until you...

1179
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:07,465
...stand up and decide to try.

1180
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:19,644
That's it. So let's get to work. Thank you.

1181
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,187
Mr. President.

1182
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,482
Thank you, Mr. President.

1183
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:27,985
In the boldest initiative yet
of the new Bill Mitchell administration...

1184
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:31,864
...the president has proposed a
comprehensive full employment program...

1185
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:34,951
...unparalleled since the days of FDR.

1186
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,955
The proposal brought swift reaction,
here on Capitol Hill.

1187
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:44,043
President Mitchell's right. Putting people
to work is what we ought to be doing.

1188
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,754
Better to have a job
than collecting a welfare check.

1189
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:51,175
We're here trying to carry the water for him.
I've carried water.

1190
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:54,136
And then now to say this.
This guy's out to lunch.

1191
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,555
He's, you know... Somebody's--

1192
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,891
The lights are on, but nobody's home.

1193
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:03,270
I love it. It's great.
All we've gotta do is cut Star Wars.

1194
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:07,358
I want to look at Mitchell's proposal.

1195
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:11,362
Like the program I presented
when I ran for president.

1196
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,907
Has the president taken leave
of his faculties? I ask you, Eleanor Clift.

1197
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:17,201
This is the definition
of modern leadership.

1198
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:20,538
Set out a bold goal and you don't say
how you're going to get there.

1199
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:23,040
They tried this in Russia
and wrecked the country.

1200
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,126
I wonder if the Communists got him.

1201
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,670
If you look at a photograph
of Bill Mitchell...

1202
01:23:27,837 --> 01:23:30,256
...taken before the stroke
and one right after...

1203
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,717
- What?
- ...you will see distinct differences.

1204
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,802
Are you saying this is a conspiracy?

1205
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,346
<i>Yes, I am saying this is a conspiracy.</i>

1206
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,348
<i>Do you think you're a little paranoid?</i>

1207
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,059
<i>No. Have you compared the photographs,
Larry?</i>

1208
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:08,252
Pfft, this is crazy.

1209
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:14,425
The U.S <i>.News</i> hammered us,
but they're always tough on that.

1210
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:16,886
- Rosenthal loved us in The <i>Times.</i>
- Oh, that's good.

1211
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,555
Mr. President,
Mr. Nance is waiting for you inside.

1212
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,432
- Ah. Who?
- The vice-president.

1213
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,687
- The vice-president.
- Oh, the--

1214
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,898
Nance. I thought--

1215
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,942
Uh, get my, uh, I want my ears checked.
Would you do that?

1216
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,154
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Ever since the stroke I get a little--

1217
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,699
Oh, my God.

1218
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,139
Mr. President...

1219
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,810
- ...these are a gift from the King of Togo.
- Oh.

1220
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,895
- Fertility beads.
- Ah.

1221
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:11,232
These are from the people of Burundi.

1222
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,566
Oh.

1223
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,735
Thank you.

1224
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,071
They know hats in Burundi. Look at this.

1225
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,827
Mr. President,
may I speak frankly with you?

1226
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,788
Yes, please. Sit down.
It's good to see you.

1227
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:33,295
I know we haven't always gotten along.
I know we've disagreed politically.

1228
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:37,174
And I suppose I know
what you think of me personally.

1229
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,971
But I've always tried to respect
the role you wanted me to play.

1230
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:46,767
When I've disagreed with this
administration, I've kept it to myself.

1231
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,105
When you wanted my support,
you always had it.

1232
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:52,773
Yes.

1233
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,233
Damn it, Bill.

1234
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,153
How could you do something like this
to me?

1235
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:02,324
- Do what?
- Come on, we're not children.

1236
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,120
I didn't have anything to do with this
First Liberty nonsense and you know it.

1237
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:11,041
- First Liberty.
- All I've got is my integrity, Bill.

1238
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,543
Okay?

1239
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,254
That's all I have left.

1240
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:18,215
Now, I don't know why you've turned
your attack dogs on me.

1241
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,010
- They're not my attack dogs.
- What?

1242
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:23,554
I'll take care of this.

1243
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:26,348
- We made it up.
- What do you mean, you made it up?

1244
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,310
Well, we had to, Dave.
The guy's a Boy Scout.

1245
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:31,353
But, Alan, this is wrong.

1246
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,105
Wrong?

1247
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,942
Oh, I know. It looks awfully bad
and I'm really embarrassed...

1248
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,277
...but it was Bob's idea.

1249
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,206
Have you spoken to the president?

1250
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,344
When I first began to look into the
allegations...

1251
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,597
...concerning First Liberty Savings
and Loan...

1252
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:10,893
...I thought the wrongdoing
was restricted to the vice-president's office.

1253
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,146
I think you better take a look at this.

1254
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:21,028
<i>But as I began to investigate,
I realized that this pattern of corruption...</i>

1255
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,447
<i>...extended much higher.</i>

1256
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:28,244
<i>I was saddened to discover at least 15
separate acts of intervention...</i>

1257
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,829
<i>...by this administration...</i>

1258
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:35,376
<i>...most with the full knowledge
of the president, and all of them illegal.</i>

1259
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:39,421
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- Federal regulators were influenced...</i>

1260
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,548
<i>...records were destroyed...</i>

1261
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:43,509
<i>...and pressure was brought to bear...</i>

1262
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:46,470
<i>...in some cases...</i>

1263
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:50,015
<i>...by President Mitchell himself.</i>

1264
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:53,018
- Now he's making stuff up about me.
- He's not.

1265
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,731
He's not?

1266
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,110
You mean, I did all that?

1267
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:03,862
You didn't. Bill Mitchell did.

1268
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,292
This is a mistake.
We shouldn't be doing this right now.

1269
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,960
I can't go into hiding.

1270
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:23,382
What are you hiding?

1271
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,931
Mr. President,
what did you know and when did you know it?

1272
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,145
When will you have a confession?

1273
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,731
Will you answer these allegations?

1274
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,733
When will you make a statement?

1275
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,985
Is this job stuff just a smoke screen?

1276
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:46,155
Mr. President, did you commit the crime?

1277
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:51,452
Mr. President, I don't know any other way
to put it. This dog just won't hunt.

1278
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:55,331
We may be able to hold off on this
First Liberty thing for a little while...

1279
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,125
...but if you've been running around
with this new jobs--

1280
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:00,377
Just put us on a spit
and bring in the sauce.

1281
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,172
- If you could just wait for a couple months.
- Yeah, wait.

1282
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,049
- Yeah.
- No.

1283
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:07,176
No, I don't want to wait a while.
We can't.

1284
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:09,928
Mr. President,
I understand how you feel...

1285
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,890
...but we're talking about obstructing
federal regulators...

1286
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:15,017
...violating election laws.

1287
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:18,520
I got people up on the Hill
talking impeachment.

1288
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,106
What is with President Mitchell lately,
huh?

1289
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:25,778
I know the president's supposed to serve
four years, but now it may be 15 to 20.

1290
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:31,950
But we make fun of the president. We
knock the president. But it's a tough job.

1291
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:36,580
<i>Take today. The president woke up,
broke the law, got caught, he pardoned himself.</i>

1292
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,123
<i>That is a full day.</i>

1293
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,712
<i>- Oh, and now political action groups--
- Mr. President.</i>

1294
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,506
- May I come in?
- Oh, heh.

1295
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,886
A dirty business we're in, sometimes.

1296
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:52,471
Yeah.

1297
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,142
Mr. President...

1298
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:01,522
...whatever happens, I just wanted you
to know that I think your jobs program is...

1299
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,107
...a wonderful idea.

1300
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,736
Thanks.

1301
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:10,114
Not many people are gonna
pay much attention now, but...

1302
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:13,575
Thanks.

1303
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,417
Uh, uh...

1304
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:23,919
Would you like to...

1305
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,296
...sit down for a minute?

1306
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,341
Sure.

1307
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:39,393
Do you ever, uh...

1308
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,936
Ahem.

1309
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,313
...think back to how you got started?

1310
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,568
Um, heh...

1311
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,736
I was a shoe salesman.

1312
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:52,948
But not very happy about it.

1313
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:57,286
One day, my wife says to me:

1314
01:30:57,453 --> 01:31:00,205
"Why don't you try running for office?"

1315
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,916
You know? You talk about it all the time.

1316
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,585
"Why don't you just go do it?"

1317
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,837
So I tell my boss...

1318
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:09,590
...I have a dentist appointment...

1319
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:13,385
...and I go down
to the Registrar of Voters...

1320
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:15,345
...on my lunch break.

1321
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,974
Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.

1322
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:22,352
- Really?
- My wife was my campaign manager.

1323
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:28,150
We had a budget of $2000
with advertising.

1324
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,782
How about you?

1325
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,869
- Me?
- Yeah.

1326
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:42,080
How did you get started?

1327
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,877
Kind of the same way.

1328
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:01,433
Vice-president's a good man, isn't he?

1329
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,232
Yes.

1330
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,194
He's a very good man.

1331
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:20,911
I don't want to lose you.

1332
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:42,558
The president has requested this rare,
joint session of Congress...

1333
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:47,020
...so he can personally answer
the allegations raised by Bob Alexander...

1334
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,522
...his former chief of staff.

1335
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:52,025
<i>Frankly, it's hard to recall
the last time both houses of Congress...</i>

1336
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:55,529
<i>...convened without so much of an idea
of what the president plans to say.</i>

1337
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:58,448
<i>So one would speculate
that it's about the charges...</i>

1338
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,659
<i>...against the vice-president
and president..</i>

1339
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:04,955
<i>Those rumors have been circulating
on Capitol Hill now for several weeks.</i>

1340
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,709
It's time to go. Better get inside.

1341
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:10,586
- It's all set with Duane?
- All set.

1342
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:11,795
Everything's here.

1343
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:13,380
Okay, let's go.

1344
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,468
Relax.

1345
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,345
Right.

1346
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,390
- Enjoy the moment.
- Right.

1347
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,896
- Hello, Ben.
- Big day, Bob.

1348
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:32,441
- Thanks for coming. Come on in.
- I wouldn't miss it.

1349
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:34,818
- You know the Claghorns?
- Of course. Of course.

1350
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,528
Hey, Bob, what do you think?

1351
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,239
Put that away.
Let's wait till the speech first.

1352
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:43,952
The House will be in order.

1353
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,788
The House will be in order.

1354
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:54,338
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

1355
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,124
Thank you. Thank you.

1356
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:32,959
Shh, Shh, shh...

1357
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:34,628
Here it comes.

1358
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,257
Mr. Speaker.

1359
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,635
<i>Vice-President.</i>

1360
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:44,096
<i>Members of the Congress.</i>

1361
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:46,723
<i>Fellow Americans.</i>

1362
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:52,646
I wish I could be here today
under different circumstances.

1363
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:58,026
There are a lot of things about this country
that we should be discussing.

1364
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:00,779
But I realize that's not possible now.

1365
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:06,326
As all of you know, my former chief of staff
has implicated me in a scandal...

1366
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,996
...involving
the First Liberty Savings and Loan.

1367
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:14,710
Once people start talking about a scandal,
it's hard to talk about anything else.

1368
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:16,962
So fine, let's talk about it.

1369
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:20,966
Bob Alexander has accused me of...

1370
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:24,678
Let me read this to make sure I get it right.

1371
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,556
"Illegally influencing
government regulators..."

1372
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:30,600
...on behalf
of major campaign contributors...

1373
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,812
...interfering with an ongoing
Justice Department investigation...

1374
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:38,358
"...and violating federal election laws
in the area of campaign finance."

1375
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,610
Okay, let's get right to the guts of it.

1376
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:43,405
Each one of these charges
is absolutely true.

1377
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,160
Die, you pond scum.

1378
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:51,872
I'm the president, and as they say,
the buck stops here.

1379
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:57,377
So I take full responsibility
for every one of my illegal actions.

1380
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,131
But, you see, that's not the whole story.

1381
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:06,344
And I think each one of you
is entitled to the whole truth.

1382
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:09,639
I have here written proof...

1383
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:16,855
...in the form of notes,
memoranda and personal directives...

1384
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:21,359
...proving that Bob Alexander
was also involved...

1385
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:25,405
...in each one of these incidents,
and in most cases, planned them as well.

1386
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:29,326
Alan.

1387
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:35,499
Now, allegations of wrongdoing have also
been made against Vice-President Nance.

1388
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:38,293
Now, as this evidence will prove,
at no time...

1389
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:41,630
...and in no way was the vice-president
involved in any of this.

1390
01:36:41,797 --> 01:36:43,548
<i>Bob just made all that up.</i>

1391
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:48,261
Vice-President Nance...

1392
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:52,182
...is a good and decent public servant...

1393
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:57,145
...and I'd like to apologize for any pain
this may have caused him or his family.

1394
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:14,412
And while we're on the subject...

1395
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:19,084
...I'd like to apologize
to the American people.

1396
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:21,086
You see...

1397
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:25,507
...I forgot that I was hired
to do a job for you...

1398
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:28,510
...and it was just a temp job at that.

1399
01:37:28,677 --> 01:37:30,637
I forgot that I had 250 million people...

1400
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:34,683
...who were paying me
to make their lives a little bit better.

1401
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:37,102
<i>And I didn't live up
to my part of the bargain.</i>

1402
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:39,563
<i>See...</i>

1403
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:43,400
I think there are certain things
you should expect from your president.

1404
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:48,321
I had to care more about you
than I do about me.

1405
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:51,324
I had to care more about...

1406
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:56,663
I had to care more about what's right
than I do about what's popular. Uh...

1407
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:02,586
I ought to be willing to give up
this whole thing...

1408
01:38:03,253 --> 01:38:05,297
...for something I believe in...

1409
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:08,925
...because if I'm not...

1410
01:38:12,012 --> 01:38:13,972
If I'm not--

1411
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:21,771
If I'm not--

1412
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:25,650
If I'm not, then...

1413
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:28,653
...maybe I don't belong here in the first--

1414
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,617
Get a doctor! Move it!

1415
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:39,539
Clear the aisle. Clear the aisle.

1416
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,250
<i>Calm yourselves.</i>

1417
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:43,561
Let's get him out of there.

1418
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,355
Quickly. Quickly.

1419
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,447
- Mitchell's that way.
- Stay back.

1420
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:19,472
Well?

1421
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:21,766
Well?

1422
01:40:25,395 --> 01:40:27,439
You okay getting home?

1423
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:30,442
Yeah, it's not far.

1424
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:34,904
Take care.

1425
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,948
Dave.

1426
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,662
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1427
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:55,008
Thanks, Duane.

1428
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:08,790
<i>The stroke hit at 8:42</i> p.m...

1429
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:13,044
<i>...just as the president was concluding
his remarks to a joint session of Congress.</i>

1430
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:15,130
<i>Spokesman of the First Naval Hospital...</i>

1431
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:18,174
<i>...have confirmed
it was a massive edema.</i>

1432
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:21,845
<i>And unlike his previous stroke,
it has left the president fully incapacitated.</i>

1433
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:25,014
<i>The nation mourned
as President William Harrison Mitchell...</i>

1434
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:29,018
<i>...was laid to rest at Arlington National
Cemetery early this morning.</i>

1435
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,604
<i>After lingering in a coma
for almost five months...</i>

1436
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:34,607
<i>...the president succumbed Thursday
at 4:20 p.m.</i>

1437
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:38,278
<i>In</i> a <i>bittersweet ceremony in
the capital, Vice-President Gary Nance...</i>

1438
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:43,158
...was <i>officially sworn in today
as the 45th president of the United States.</i>

1439
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:47,829
<i>Under the terms of the 25th Amendment,
Nance has been acting with full authority...</i>

1440
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:50,957
<i>...since Bill Mitchell's incapacitation.</i>

1441
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,585
<i>The new president promises
a leadership of fairness.</i>

1442
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:57,005
<i>I plan to continue
Bill Mitchell's call to arms.</i>

1443
01:42:57,172 --> 01:43:00,425
<i>This isn't my presidency,
this is his presidency.</i>

1444
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:04,220
<i>And I can't think of a better way
to ensure his legacy...</i>

1445
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:07,182
<i>...than to continue the principles
he initiated.</i>

1446
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,810
<i>Bob Alexander and eight
other members of the Mitchell administration...</i>

1447
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:14,105
<i>...were indicted on 34 counts
of election law violations...</i>

1448
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:15,857
<i>...and obstruction of justice.</i>

1449
01:43:16,024 --> 01:43:19,110
<i>Ironically, the indictments came
just 48 hours after final passage...</i>

1450
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,154
<i>...of the Bill Mitchell Jobs Bill...</i>

1451
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:23,990
<i>...for a comprehensive
employment program.</i>

1452
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:29,162
We have a limited amount of buttons,
so don't put any buttons in the envelopes.

1453
01:43:29,329 --> 01:43:30,705
Honey.

1454
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,167
Dave Kobic. Time for a change.

1455
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:36,586
- No, no. Kovic. Kovic.
- Kovic.

1456
01:43:36,753 --> 01:43:38,880
Torn. Tom.
We have a limited amount of posters.

1457
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:41,466
Just put them in the really busy places.

1458
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:43,676
She's terrific. She can do anything.

1459
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:47,388
- Just the flyers.
- Okay, well, she's changed.

1460
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,601
It's the middle of winter. They're gonna
turn off her heat. She needs a job.

1461
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:00,485
Open. Like this. Like this. Neat. Neat.

1462
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:02,862
- Hi.
- No buttons.

1463
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,323
Would you like to volunteer?

1464
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:07,659
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, you're a good man.

1465
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:11,329
Uh, did you get the fund-raising thing
I sent you? Yeah, City Council.

1466
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:14,749
- We have flyers here.
- Thanks. All right.

1467
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,876
We're on a roll now. Karen, you got a job.

1468
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,336
- Thank you.
- It's Monday.

1469
01:44:18,503 --> 01:44:22,257
And everybody works on Monday.

1470
01:44:33,977 --> 01:44:36,271
- Hi.
- Hi, heh.

1471
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:39,274
I understand you find people jobs?

1472
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:40,817
- Well...
- This is great, heh.

1473
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:44,487
Yeah, I'm, uh, running-- You look great.

1474
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:50,326
I saw you on TV at the funeral and...

1475
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:51,744
Well...

1476
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:53,871
That's finally over.

1477
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:01,879
Uh...

1478
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,882
Uh, why don't we go into my office?

1479
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,301
Excuse us.
