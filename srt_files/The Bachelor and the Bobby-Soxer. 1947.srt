1
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:32,114
Miss Susan.

2
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,068
Miss Susan.

3
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,504
Miss Susan?

4
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:13,456
- Just five more minutes, Bessie.
- No, ma'am. Now!

5
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:17,059
But, Bessie, I feel absolutely
sklonklish.

6
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,728
You sklonklish yourself
down to breakfast.

7
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:22,197
I'm getting the judge
up right now.

8
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:23,732
- I'm up.
- Sklonklish.

9
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,935
When I went to school they
taught us to speak English.

10
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:36,879
Judge Turner?

11
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,029
Judge Turner.

12
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,431
Judge Turner.

13
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:17,152
- Five more minutes.
- Breakfast is ready, Your Honor.

14
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,728
- What time is it?
- It's a few minutes past 8.

15
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,566
- Is my sister up?
- Yes, Miss Margaret.

16
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,901
She was feeling a little
sklonklish today,

17
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,036
but I got her up.

18
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:36,672
Next time she tells you she
feels sklonklish,

19
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,707
you tell her not to be a clunk.

20
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,476
Thanks, Your Honor. I dig you.

21
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,981
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,750
Good morning, dear.

23
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:50,519
Hello?

24
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:52,521
Hi, Jerry.

25
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,190
No, we have to listen to
a speech this afternoon.

26
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,424
Good deal, Neil.

27
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:58,961
Susan, your breakfast
is on the table.

28
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,963
Hang on a second.

29
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,000
Sorry I'm late, sis.

30
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,903
- Did you sleep well?
- Oh, sklonklish.

31
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,774
Don't be a clunk, Miss Susan.

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,110
- You've been coaching her.
- Someone has to protect her.

33
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,145
Margaret, you know the case
you were trying?

34
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:19,882
The man who ran away
with a 16-year-old girl?

35
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,751
- What did you give him?
- Three years.

36
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,620
That'll cost me $3.

37
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,622
I always bet you won't
sentence people.

38
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,324
That's ridiculous.
How have you been doing?

39
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:30,993
You've cost me a fortune.

40
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,295
If you're interested in a more
exact science,

41
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,963
spend time on geometry.

42
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,465
I don't consider geometry
a part of life.

43
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:38,834
Mr. Roberts does.

44
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,604
You're his first student to
define a triangle

45
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,471
as two women crazy about one
man.

46
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:45,974
Mr. Roberts is definitely
decadent.

47
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,342
Is he?

48
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,144
- Margaret.
- How much?

49
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,214
Only $3. Just as an advance
on my allowance.

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,251
You're already working on 1949.

51
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:57,720
But no more betting.

52
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,455
Thank you very much. I wonder
why you're so good to me.

53
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:01,957
You know I'd die for you,

54
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:04,026
only sometimes it's hard
living with you.

55
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,261
The call of the wild.
I've got to go.

56
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:08,964
- You haven't eaten breakfast.
- Thanks. Bye.

57
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,872
I can't talk now.

58
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,445
- Bessie.
- Yes, ma'am?

59
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,113
Have you been following the case

60
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,549
about the man who ran
away with the girl?

61
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,151
Yes, ma'am, I have.

62
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,719
As a matter of curiosity,

63
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,755
do you think my sentence
was too severe?

64
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,823
No, I would have given him 10
years.

65
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,059
- Would you?
- I certainly would.

66
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,627
Thank you, Bessie.

67
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:41,496
I was just curious.

68
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:43,565
That must be the judges.

69
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:46,769
Yes, I mustn't keep them
waiting.

70
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,105
Oh, thank you.

71
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,808
- Your Honor.
- Oh.

72
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,010
- Goodbye, Bessie.
- Goodbye, Miss Margaret.

73
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:02,450
Exit woman, enter judge.

74
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,286
More's the pity.

75
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:07,522
Uncle Matt, I take exception
to your innuendo.

76
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,957
I'm no problem to you.

77
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,093
You should concern
yourself with Susan.

78
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,528
Nothing wrong that the
firm hand of a man

79
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,130
in the house wouldn't cure.

80
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:17,966
If you'd listen to me,
you wouldn't have this problem.

81
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,635
And I've been telling you
I will not put up...

82
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,372
...with your constant attempts
to get me married.

83
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,241
Come in.

84
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,276
Good morning, good morning.

85
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:31,113
Good morning, Margaret.
Good morning, Herr Doctor.

86
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,291
- Good morning, Chamberlain.
- Margaret, I have a present.

87
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,719
I found a copy of the rare old
English writ of exigi facias.

88
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,120
Thank you, Tommy.

89
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:40,622
If that's the night-blooming
exigi facias,

90
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,158
you can put it in a vase and
water it.

91
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,393
You seem a little truculent this
morning.

92
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,297
Physician, heal thyself.

93
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,000
See you later, Margaret.

94
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:55,203
I'm not as much interested
in the woman getting married...

95
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,673
...as I am in making sure
that she marries the right man.

96
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:03,145
I don't think he likes me. It's
a sixth sense

97
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,347
one acquires in the district
attorney's office.

98
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,315
Uncle Matt has a personal life

99
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,317
beyond his job as court
psychiatrist...

100
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:11,820
...and occasionally
they become confused.

101
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:13,055
Yes, I guess so.

102
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:15,057
Speaking of combining work and
pleasure...

103
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:18,093
...I understand you're reviewing
the Richard Nugent case.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,963
- I have an interest--
- You know I don't like that.

105
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,398
If your gift is in the nature of
bribe--

106
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,267
Oh, put it out of your head.

107
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,302
But this man has given us great
difficulty--

108
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,873
You'd go where you were going,
and I'll go where I was going.

109
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:35,744
Very well.
But remember, absit invidia.

110
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:41,049
- We're ready, Your Honor.
- All right, Mac.

111
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:44,953
Raise your right hand.

112
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,622
Do you swear the evidence you'll
give in this matter...

113
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,257
...of The State vs. Richard
Nugent

114
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:52,560
shall be the truth, so help you
God?

115
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:55,297
- Yes.
- Step up to the bench.

116
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,078
- Go ahead.
- We picked up Richard Nugent...

117
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:12,314
...in the Vampire Club on a riot
call.

118
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,549
When we got there, there was a
free-for-all,

119
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:17,352
and Nugent was at the bottom of
it.

120
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,887
Which of you is Nugent?

121
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,389
Mr. Nugent isn't here.
I'm representing him.

122
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:22,724
Is he in the hospital?

123
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,392
No, Your Honor. He's out on
bail.

124
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:27,062
Does he know the hearing was for
9 a.m.?

125
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,797
Yes, I'm sure he'll be here.

126
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,699
He must have been unavoidably
detained somewhere.

127
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,869
If he's not here in a few
minutes...

128
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,704
...I'll issue a bench warrant
and forfeit his bail.

129
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,074
- But--
- I'll hear the witnesses.

130
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,444
- May I have your name?
- My name is Anthony Herman.

131
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,246
I work at the Vampire Club.

132
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,381
- In what capacity?
- To maintain order.

133
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:49,551
I throw people out
that raise a disturbance.

134
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:51,987
What happened last night?

135
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:55,057
I got back from the house where
I had to maintain order

136
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:57,325
on a gentleman who said our
music stunk.

137
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:00,528
When I returned to my usual
post, I became aware of loud

138
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,264
activities and screams.

139
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,800
As I rush over to maintain order
a straight left catches me,

140
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,435
as you can see.

141
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,705
A short time later, I'm informed
that the disturbance is over.

142
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,807
There's one thing I remember.

143
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,843
Mr. Nugent was the center of the
disturbance.

144
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,312
But you didn't actually see him
fighting?

145
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,347
He was fighting. If I get my
hands--

146
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:23,485
- The whole thing was your fault.
- Shut up.

147
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,354
Quiet in the courtroom. Quiet.

148
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,690
- Your name?
- Miss Agnes Prescott.

149
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,258
Go on.

150
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:33,495
I'm also employed at the Vampire
Club as an entertainer.

151
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,297
A modern singer of modern songs.

152
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,499
I've known Mr. Nugent for some
time.

153
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,334
I posed for him. In costume.

154
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:42,837
I posed for Mr. Nugent too.
In costume.

155
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:45,740
- Shall I continue, Your Honor?
- By all means.

156
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:48,977
Last night, Mr. Nugent dropped
in to renew our acquaintance.

157
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:51,013
While we were having words at
his table...

158
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,382
...we were accosted by this
lady, which I resented.

159
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,485
Harsh words were exchanged, and
Mr. Nugent came to my defense.

160
00:09:57,552 --> 00:10:01,089
- That's a lie. I knew him first.
- Don't call me a liar.

161
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,892
- Please. Everybody's listening!
- Just a moment.

162
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,933
Your client Mr. Nugent
has exactly 60 seconds.

163
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,168
Mr. Nugent's lack of punctuality

164
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,570
is no surprise to the district
attorney's office.

165
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:16,771
Indeed?

166
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:18,606
Chamberlain has an interest in
this case.

167
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,843
This is the third occasion
Nugent has been involved

168
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,178
in a public disturbance.

169
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,380
I object to these remarks.

170
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,382
They're intended to prejudice
the court.

171
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,318
I think only the facts in this
case should be considered.

172
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,487
Your Honor, I feel it's
important--

173
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:33,922
It's important I consider

174
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:36,391
only the evidence presented in
this matter.

175
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,294
- Very well, Your Honor.
- Don't sulk about it.

176
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,068
I'll move over, lady.

177
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:00,582
Good morning.

178
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,323
- Good morning, Walters.
- Morning.

179
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,460
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

180
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:13,528
Morning.

181
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:19,067
May I assume that this is Mr.
Nugent, the defendant?

182
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:22,037
I'm frankly and honestly
delighted, Your Honor.

183
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,506
Is it all right for us to go
ahead?

184
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:25,507
Well, I'm sorry, but--

185
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,309
I hope we haven't inconvenienced
you.

186
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,279
- Oh, no. It's just--
- I know. Your watch is slow.

187
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:34,249
Stopped. Forgot to wind it.

188
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:37,519
I don't know if you work on
schedule, but this court does.

189
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,721
9:00 means 9:00.

190
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:42,690
Yes, sir. I mean, yes, Your
Honor.

191
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,026
Let's get on with this.

192
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:46,461
Did you go to the Vampire Club
last night?

193
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,662
Yes.

194
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:50,932
I'm doing a series of paintings
on Americana...

195
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,734
...and I'm including a nightclub
scene.

196
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,570
Creating a nightclub scene
would seem more appropriate.

197
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,072
However, there's some doubt

198
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,574
as to how the fight actually
started.

199
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,708
Well...

200
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:05,847
Agnes had finished her spot.
That's a theatrical term.

201
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:08,316
It means her routine, her
performance.

202
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:10,018
Thank you.

203
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:16,391
Well, we were having a drink
when Florence...

204
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,626
- We've met.
- ...appeared.

205
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:22,864
She... On a couple occasions,
Florence has posed for me.

206
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,035
I stopped by his table to say
hello, this cut-rate canary...

207
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:29,137
...apparently resented my
appearance.

208
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,339
I prefer to hear Mr. Nugent's
version.

209
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,042
Thank you.

210
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,678
Florence's escort appeared.

211
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:39,214
I suppose you met him too.

212
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,516
He objected to Florence coming
to my table.

213
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,718
Florence insisted on not being
disturbed.

214
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,420
One thing led to another.

215
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,190
Tony slapped Florence, and I
slapped Tony.

216
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,958
He was only defending
American womanhood.

217
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,360
Get that.

218
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,164
Florence attempted to stop the
fight.

219
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,167
Agnes scratched Florence.
Florence...

220
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,673
Anyone who remembers a fight
punch for punch is lying.

221
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,142
I don't remember.

222
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,944
Your Honor, Mr. Nugent's been
in escapades before...

223
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:12,347
...but never through any fault
of his own.

224
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:15,450
The fact that he's a painter
of contemporary American life...

225
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,720
...often places him in
circumstances that seem unusual.

226
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:21,989
This court should not give Mr.
Nugent privileges

227
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,425
just because he's an artist.

228
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:25,427
I wasn't suggesting that, Your
Honor.

229
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:28,230
The DA's office would like him
held for trial.

230
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:31,233
Based on the evidence, I see no
reason.

231
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,568
Everyone participated in this
fight.

232
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:36,471
Everyone's equally guilty,
and everyone's equally innocent.

233
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,906
I suggest you all go home, nurse
your wounds

234
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,008
and be less emotional in the
future.

235
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,010
Thank you, Your Honor.
May I go?

236
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,813
You just got here.
Don't you like our court?

237
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,152
Sure, I like it fine, only I'm
due to give a lecture today.

238
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,154
Really? What are you lecturing
on?

239
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,422
America as I see it.

240
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:57,091
Should be very interesting.

241
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,561
Mr. Nugent, I've met your type
before.

242
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:02,797
In fact, I sentence them every
day in the week.

243
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,599
If you're brought here again,

244
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,668
you won't be dealt with so
leniently.

245
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:07,935
In future,

246
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,805
I suggest that you confine your
painting to still life.

247
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:12,340
Case dismissed.

248
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:16,344
- Next case.
- Don't press your luck.

249
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:30,192
I wish we didn't have to have
this thing today.

250
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:31,693
I hate lectures.

251
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,163
Look, if your coach told you
to get plenty of exercise...

252
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,031
She's a lap-happy chick

253
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:40,335
compared to that square from
Delaware you run around with.

254
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:43,805
Is it okay for Saturday night,
Susie? You promised.

255
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:46,774
Promises are the hollow shells
of undone deeds.

256
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,612
Well, for gosh sakes,
what's that supposed to mean?

257
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:54,416
You're a nice boy, Jerry,
but you're callow.

258
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,884
I'm not too callow to buy you
sodas

259
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,119
when your allowance runs out.

260
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,054
Don't create a scene.

261
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:01,856
I'm not good enough because

262
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,158
you're looking for a knight in
shining armor.

263
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:06,228
I'm competing with something
medieval.

264
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,563
Don't be a stupe.

265
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:17,272
Students, members of the
faculty,

266
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,940
our high school is honored...

267
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:23,678
...in having as guest lecturer
a man who will speak to us...

268
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,481
...about the classical tradition
of painting.

269
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:30,184
He's well-qualified to speak
to us about painting...

270
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:31,786
...because, in my opinion...

271
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:35,857
...he is one of America's
foremost exponents of painting.

272
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:41,028
Students, I know you will
express your enthusiasm

273
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:42,830
for his appearance here today.

274
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:47,469
And so, with no more ado,
I present Mr. Richard Nugent.

275
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,348
And, as we know,

276
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,983
many people think of art as
something pretty stuffy.

277
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,519
Don't let them kid you.

278
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,887
True art has something for
everyone.

279
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:43,758
Great art unites the masses
in every age in every country.

280
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:46,093
He's handsome.

281
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,763
I suppose so, for an older man.

282
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,233
If you think art isn't
functional,

283
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,735
think in terms of history.

284
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,439
Each age, each era becomes
visual to us when the artist...

285
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:01,175
...recreates it in stone, bronze
or on canvas.

286
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,645
The essence of art is
simplicity.

287
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,913
If I wanted to capture the
feeling of America...

288
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,350
...it wouldn't be necessary to
go looking for mountains

289
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,518
or fields of grain.

290
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:14,188
I'd try to put America on canvas
in a picture of one of you.

291
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,491
In your denims with the cuffs
rolled up

292
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,292
and the shirt open at the neck.

293
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,698
You'd be young, eager and proud
because of what's ahead of you.

294
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,767
You're the kids who, in a few
years,

295
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,536
will run our factories, our
farms, our businesses.

296
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:31,506
You'll be voting to make this
country

297
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:33,808
a place were there's good will,
freedom...

298
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,277
- ...opportunity and tolerance.
- You feeling all right?

299
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:40,348
If I were gonna do a portrait of
you, I'd try to convey all that.

300
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:41,749
Thank you.

301
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,922
Mr. Nugent. Mr. Nugent.

302
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,058
My name is Susan Turner.
I'm a student here.

303
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,060
- No!
- Yes.

304
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,729
I loved your speech.

305
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:56,931
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. Nugent.

306
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,138
Well, nice to have met you.

307
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:07,308
But you don't understand.
I have to interview you.

308
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,310
- You what?
- For the school paper.

309
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:10,778
I'm editor in chief.

310
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,448
- Shall we go somewhere private?
- I'd like to, but--

311
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:16,384
It isn't every day that we have
a famous artist here.

312
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,953
I bet you've had a terribly
interesting life.

313
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,390
Not very. Could we do this
later? I have a date.

314
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,792
- Then you're not married.
- No.

315
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:28,696
I knew you weren't.
You just couldn't be.

316
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,899
- Oh, I've had some offers.
- It's this way.

317
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:35,069
- We can talk in here.
- Yes, but don't you see? I--

318
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:36,538
Please?

319
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:46,414
- Have you ever been married?
- No.

320
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:49,617
- Have you ever been in love?
- Yes, I have.

321
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:53,521
Tell me, what kind of paper
does this school run?

322
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,123
- All the students read it.
- I'll bet they do.

323
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:01,162
You probably have no idea
what an unusual person you are.

324
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,230
I can see it.

325
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,700
I'm really much older than I
look.

326
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,702
These are merely the vestments I
don...

327
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,939
...as a concession to our
outworn educational anachronism.

328
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:14,576
But I know what the artistic
soul is like

329
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,944
and how keenly it can suffer.

330
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:20,214
Did you have many ordeals
before you became a success?

331
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,149
- No, I--
- You can talk to me.

332
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:26,120
I want you to think of me
not as a newspaperwoman...

333
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:29,256
...but as a friend.

334
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:32,560
Well, in that case, I'll tell
you.

335
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:34,195
I did suffer.

336
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:39,400
When I was 10, my parents
had a double-suicide pact.

337
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:43,270
They made it.
I was sent to an orphanage.

338
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:46,173
Some days they didn't beatme.

339
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,277
Then one night I escaped.
I ran away to New York.

340
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:53,815
- I used to steal.
- What did you steal?

341
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:57,184
- Beg your pardon?
- What did you steal?

342
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,887
Crusts of bread and things.

343
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,491
One time I stole a valise.

344
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:06,027
There were paints and
paintbrushes inside.

345
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,429
So I began to paint.

346
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,264
Then they got me.

347
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:13,801
I was sent to a reform school,
but I escaped again.

348
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,804
- Go on.
- Back to New York.

349
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:19,874
A wealthy society lady saw my
work, fell in love with me...

350
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:22,644
...and sent me to art school.

351
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,346
The rest is history.

352
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:27,414
How wonderful.

353
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,517
How terribly wonderful.

354
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:36,223
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,
I must rest.

355
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,259
Of course.

356
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,727
Goodbye, Miss Kilgallen.

357
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,896
Turner. Susan Turner.

358
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:44,999
By the way, remember what you
said about painting one of us?

359
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:48,135
- America and the waving grain?
- Yes, I do.

360
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:50,638
Well, do you think I'd make
a good model?

361
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:53,140
You're not quitting the
newspaper game?

362
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,776
That's merely a stopgap.

363
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:58,445
My family wants me to study law
but I don't wanna be a Portia.

364
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,815
Portia? Your family can
straighten that out.

365
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:03,084
Well, my attitude is that one
female judge

366
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,019
in the family is enough.

367
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:07,021
Did you say your name was
Turner?

368
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:09,256
Right. My sister is Judge
Margaret Turner.

369
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:12,760
- Nice to have met the family.
- What about my posing for you?

370
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,862
- What about young America?
- Fine.

371
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,864
Then you think I'm ideal?

372
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:18,866
You'd make a good model some
time.

373
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:22,536
- Thanks for the interview. Bye.
- Not goodbye, au revoir.

374
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:24,071
Au revoir.

375
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:07,715
- Something wrong?
- That picture. It's hideous.

376
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:09,450
It's a very nice picture.

377
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:11,452
It has absolutely no simplicity.

378
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:13,120
It's so, so busy.

379
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:17,058
True art should unite the masses
in every age in every country.

380
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,028
Who lectured at school today?

381
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:23,631
What does that have to do with
it?

382
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,466
Last month you wanted to be a
designer.

383
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:29,136
Then a naturalist gave a lecture
and you wanted to be the first

384
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,571
female deep-sea diver.

385
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,406
Last week, you wanted to be a
psychiatrist.

386
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:36,610
Now our painting's offensive.
What does this artist look like?

387
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:39,981
He's wonderful. I interviewed
him.

388
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:42,483
I've never seen anyone in armor
before.

389
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,218
Very few people have, Susan.

390
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,888
But you don't know how wonderful
he is.

391
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:50,491
He's had to lie and cheat and
steal to get somewhere in life.

392
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,660
That makes everything just
dandy.

393
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,496
What's the name of this shining
knight?

394
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:58,599
- Richard Nugent.
- Richard Nugent.

395
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,168
- Richard Nugent?
- Have you heard of him?

396
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:02,303
Heard of him?

397
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,106
We have a permanent courtroom
set aside for him.

398
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:07,975
How dare they allow him to
lecture in a public school!

399
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,977
What are you so excited about?

400
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:14,248
All he did was talk about art,
and he was very good.

401
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:17,518
I suppose there's nothing wrong
with his lecturing

402
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:20,487
if it's sponsored by the school.

403
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:23,524
Have you ever thought of me as a
model?

404
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,627
I can't honestly say that I
have. Why?

405
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,696
Dickie wants me to pose for him.

406
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:31,332
Oh, isn't that nice?

407
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:33,067
Dickie?

408
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:37,004
Don't be unreasonable. He's a
fine man. You don't know him.

409
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,307
I know enough to advise you
to go back to deep-sea diving.

410
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:43,745
- I don't need your advice.
- I'm your sister and guardian.

411
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:45,747
I'm acting in your best
interests.

412
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:48,582
- I'll be an old maid.
- Only until you're 18.

413
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,452
When a suitable man comes along,
I'll happily see you married.

414
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,989
And you'll probably make him
pass a lie-detector test first.

415
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,291
You forget about Mr. Nugent.

416
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:00,962
Easy for you to say. Why don't
you write out a court order?

417
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:12,173
- Good evening, Mr. Chamberlain.
- Is the lady of the house in?

418
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,475
The lady of the house is
practically out.

419
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,877
Hello, Your Honor.

420
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:18,012
Only a moment, Tommy.

421
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:24,385
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine. Just fine.

422
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:26,821
- I'm sorry about our--
- It's all right.

423
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,290
It was really nothing.
I'm just fine.

424
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:32,860
I'll be home early. Be a good
girl. See you in the morning.

425
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:35,262
Goodbye. Have a good time.

426
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:44,839
Do I detect an air of trouble?

427
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:47,274
I never enjoy quarreling with
Susan.

428
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:49,476
She's entitled to growing pains,
isn't she?

429
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,278
Yes, but Susan's growing pains

430
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:53,848
are rapidly becoming a major
disease.

431
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,790
Can I be of any assistance?

432
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:04,725
What apartment is Mr. Nugent in?

433
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,327
He isn't in any apartment.

434
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:09,630
- Doesn't he live here?
- Sure, but he isn't home.

435
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:12,299
Anything I can do for you?

436
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:16,537
- Thank you. I'll wait.
- He expecting you?

437
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:19,406
I'm going to pose for him.

438
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:21,208
Do you want to wait upstairs?

439
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:23,444
Do you think it would be all
right?

440
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,246
Sure. I'll take you up.

441
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:27,648
- You're new around here.
- Yes.

442
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,651
- I'm 15.
- I'm 17.

443
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,887
That's okay. I like older women.

444
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,490
Mademoiselle.

445
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:45,833
Here we are.

446
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:49,570
Some layout, huh?

447
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,105
This is where he lives.

448
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:53,740
I'd like to hang around,
but got work to do.

449
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,409
Make yourself at home.

450
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:55,302
When did you first discover she
was gone?

451
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:57,738
About dinnertime I went to call
her.

452
00:26:57,804 --> 00:26:59,740
- What time was that?
- Quarter past 7.

453
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,808
- She leave a note?
- I didn't find any.

454
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,877
- Any signs of a struggle?
- Oh, no!

455
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:06,113
Stop conducting this like an
investigation.

456
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,382
- Bessie, you may go.
- Thank you, ma'am.

457
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:10,551
You're the assistant DA.
Do something.

458
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:13,955
I gotta have some clues.
We only have a description.

459
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:15,322
Have you checked the hospitals?

460
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,858
Hospitals, airports, bus
terminals.

461
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,860
- You call her friends?
- Hours ago.

462
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:22,096
She had a date with a boy, Jerry
White.

463
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,298
When he got here, she'd already
gone.

464
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:30,137
Hello? It's for you.

465
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:32,339
Hello. Yes, Chamberlain
speaking.

466
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:33,574
No, she was alone.

467
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,510
Yes, keep a man there. And,
Keighly, check the morgue.

468
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:38,745
Right.

469
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:40,914
I'm sorry. It's just routine.

470
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:42,950
I remember an important murder
case. The body--

471
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:45,786
If anything's happened,
I won't forgive myself.

472
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,721
- I shouldn't have quarreled.
- What about?

473
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:50,992
It was nothing. I told her she
can't pose for Richard Nugent.

474
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:53,927
She said she didn't need my
advice, that she was...

475
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:49,683
--aggravated by the
imponderables

476
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,553
of international currency
fluctuations--

477
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,508
Hello, Mr. Nugent.

478
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:54,448
Dickie, hello.

479
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,188
Come on, let us in!

480
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,128
And now we bring you Del
Minelli.

481
00:30:07,194 --> 00:30:11,532
And that sensational swoon tune
"Fast Ride in a Patrol Wagon."

482
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,742
Tell me exactly what happened.

483
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:24,911
If I knew exactly what happened,
I wouldn't be here.

484
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:26,513
Give me a rough idea.

485
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,949
Where were you when they finally
let me use

486
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:30,751
the phone here last night?

487
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:33,620
I had not anticipated your
winding up in jail.

488
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,557
I have a life of my own, you
know?

489
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm sorry. I hope I haven't
inconvenienced you.

490
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,962
- Oh, not at all.
- Sleep well? A good breakfast?

491
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:46,900
- Let's have the facts.
- Sit down.

492
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:50,271
Get a load of this.

493
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:52,706
I got home to my apartment last
night.

494
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:54,341
That much I know.

495
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:57,411
And this girl was there.
At least I think she was there.

496
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,413
I guess she was. I don't know.

497
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,982
- Judge Turner's sister?
- Yes, that's the girl.

498
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,351
- Young girl?
- What did you say?

499
00:31:04,418 --> 00:31:07,020
- Young girl?
- Too young.

500
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,457
Nugent, why don't you tell me
the truth?

501
00:31:10,524 --> 00:31:13,927
I am telling you the truth. Now,
would you be quiet for a moment?

502
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:16,363
That's what happened last night.
Nobody listened to me.

503
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,733
I couldn't explain. Please.

504
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,670
All right. I got home
to my apartment last night.

505
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:26,540
I went up to my bedroom,
took off my dinner coat.

506
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,276
Wanted to be comfortable,
put on a robe.

507
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:31,812
Came downstairs, turned on the
radio,

508
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:34,315
got a nice highball...

509
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:36,717
...opened a book,
sat down to read the book...

510
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:39,453
...when up popped this little
girl.

511
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,123
Now, the little girl popped up.
There's a banging at the door.

512
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,125
Everybody yelling. Somebody
busts in.

513
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,127
Everybody starts talking.

514
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:49,129
Don't listen to an explanation.
They're mad!

515
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:51,832
Did the girl explain why she was
there?

516
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:53,800
Yes. Well, she tried to explain,

517
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:55,802
but they wouldn't really let her
explain.

518
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:58,239
She kept trying to say she'd
come up there

519
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:00,040
to be a model or something.

520
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:05,712
Did you or did you not invite
her up there to be a model?

521
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,150
Well, yes, in a roundabout way,
I guess I did. I guess I did.

522
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:14,020
She said I told her I was gonna
paint her as young America.

523
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:15,556
Did you tell her that?

524
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:18,359
Oh, I told that to 500 little
girls.

525
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:21,228
Well, let's not go into that.

526
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:25,065
You're charged with hitting
the district attorney.

527
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:28,034
Did you or did you not hit him?

528
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,437
I hit him. That's right.

529
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:32,439
But at the time I hit him,

530
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:34,908
I did not know he was the
assistant district attorney.

531
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:39,045
If I had known he was the
assistant district attorney...

532
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:40,381
...I would have hit him.

533
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,783
He said some bad things, some
very bad things.

534
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:45,386
Wouldn't let me explain. Kept
pulling my arm.

535
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,388
Wouldn't let the girl explain.

536
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:49,856
And that sister of hers,
that's a mountain of ice...

537
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:52,626
...a gallon of poison.
Jumping to conclusions!

538
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:55,061
Control yourself, now. Control
yourself, Nugent.

539
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:56,930
I'll see what I can do for you.

540
00:32:56,997 --> 00:33:01,101
Worse comes to worse, maybe I
can get your sentence reduced.

541
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,437
But you've got to remember,
coherently,

542
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:05,005
exactly what happened.

543
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,273
Sure.

544
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,942
If you talk like this in front
of a court...

545
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,811
...you'd get 20 years.

546
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,248
- Oh, my...
- Officer, I'm ready to go now.

547
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:17,451
Coherently, exactly.
Coherently, exactly.

548
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,456
See you later. You'll know me.
I'll be dressed like a lawyer.

549
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:26,993
High school. High school. Little
girl.

550
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,897
Model. I...

551
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:34,034
Mr. Nugent, you got a visitor.
This is Dr. Beemish.

552
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,410
- Mr. Nugent?
- Just a second. Just a second.

553
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:47,714
- Now, let me see.
- I am the court psychiatrist.

554
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:50,384
Come back in an hour. I'll be
crazy by then.

555
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,319
I'm here to help you.

556
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:54,154
The only thing you're suffering
from

557
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,392
is a case of being an innocent
bystander.

558
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,594
- Sit down, doctor.
- Thank you.

559
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:07,668
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, than--

560
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:10,837
- Cigar?
- No, no. I'm fine, thanks.

561
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:13,507
- This cell comfortable?
- Well, I don't know.

562
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:17,010
I haven't anything to compare it
with. This is my first time.

563
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,446
Well, on the whole, I think
you'll find our

564
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:22,082
Western penology system is quite
modern.

565
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:24,451
Well, that's a load off my mind.

566
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:28,221
Tell me, what can they do to me
if I kill a judge?

567
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,023
I understand how you feel.

568
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,627
I'm aware that Judge Turner
appears to be a dominant woman.

569
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:36,563
But her dominance is actually a
retreat.

570
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,100
We call it a manifestation of
the Oedipus complex.

571
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,369
As Menninger points out...

572
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:45,338
...traumatic events seem to...

573
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:47,340
The only traumatic event she
needs

574
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:50,110
is a good smack in the jaw.

575
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:52,078
She's my niece.

576
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:56,349
But you're absolutely right.

577
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,419
Judge Turner's ready for you,
doctor.

578
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,687
Oh, thank you.

579
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:03,289
You just leave things in my
hands, Mr. Nugent.

580
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:06,126
I daresay you'll be surprised at
the results.

581
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,594
Daresay.

582
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,798
I have a plan.

583
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:22,543
Just had a talk with Nugent. He
seems to be quite a nice fellow.

584
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,411
Were you talking to the right
man?

585
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:25,612
Why, certainly.

586
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,882
About 6 feet, broad shoulders,
blue eyes.

587
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:31,985
- He has brown eyes.
- Oh, has he?

588
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:36,189
Have you made definite plans
about him?

589
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:37,524
It isn't my case.

590
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,392
Judge Treadwell is reviewing the
evidence,

591
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,329
and whatever he does is all
right with me.

592
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:47,734
Well, I hope Treadwell doesn't
go too far.

593
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,103
I won't be responsible for
Susan.

594
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,909
You were saying?

595
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:57,944
Susan thinks she's in love with
this man.

596
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:01,682
If things take its normal course
this will be just an adolescent

597
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:03,216
attachment for an older man.

598
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:05,018
She'll soon forget him.

599
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:09,089
But if they send him to prison,
it will martyr him in her eyes.

600
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:12,158
This will turn into a tragedy
she'll never get over.

601
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,960
Oh, nonsense.

602
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:17,363
You don't understand Susan.
She's not like other children.

603
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,733
She's old for her age and
levelheaded.

604
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,703
She's above that sort of
silliness.

605
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:29,743
I'm sorry to bother, but this
lady came to visit Mr. Nugent.

606
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,479
She claims to be your sister
and his mother.

607
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:35,782
- Susan.
- I just wanted to talk to him.

608
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:38,885
About the steel business.
She baked this.

609
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,490
Thank you, Melvin.

610
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:48,061
What's happening to you?

611
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,997
I'm in love with him.
Don't you realize that?

612
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:53,534
If I lose him, life has no
meaning.

613
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,068
I love him.

614
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,310
How about a reversal?

615
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:05,846
You win.

616
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:09,215
Come in.

617
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,085
Here's Mr. Nugent.

618
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:15,188
Hello, Richard.

619
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:17,858
Well, you don't look any of the
worse for wear.

620
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:21,728
- Prison agrees with me.
- Mr. Nugent, I have good news.

621
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,665
You're going to hang me.

622
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:28,602
I'm afraid I'm the one
who ought to be hanged.

623
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:31,104
- Won't I sit down?
- Please do.

624
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,675
- I believe you know Dr. Beemish.
- Yes.

625
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:37,878
- This is Judge Treadwell.
- How do you do?

626
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,412
How do you do?

627
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,815
You know Assistant DA
Chamberlain.

628
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,817
Yes, nice to see you again.

629
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:45,819
Sorry about that
misunderstanding.

630
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,821
Forget it. Just a bit of temper.

631
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:50,691
- That's very generous of you.
- Not at all, Nugent.

632
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm afraid I lost my temper too.
I hope you'll pardon me.

633
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:56,997
Oh, that's all right.
I hope you'll pardon me.

634
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,604
I thank you for holding this
preliminary hearing in camera.

635
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,371
Perfectly all right, Chester.

636
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,407
In view of Mr. Nugent's
reputation...

637
00:38:07,473 --> 00:38:11,077
...I see no reason for exposing
him to unnecessary publicity.

638
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:14,114
I think this little incident
can be straightened out...

639
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,317
...if the assistant DA doesn't
wish to press charges.

640
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:21,187
I wouldn't want to see a man
of Mr. Nugent's talents in jail.

641
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:24,858
Well, thank you.
I guess I'm free to go then.

642
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:26,526
- Thank you.
- Just a moment.

643
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,462
I believe Judge Turner has a
suggestion.

644
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:32,532
- Anything.
- Yes, it isn't really much.

645
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,935
You see, I'm a little worried
about Susan.

646
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,102
Oh, yeah.

647
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:38,504
She's become quite enamored of
you, Mr. Nugent.

648
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,440
Well, it's...

649
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:44,077
We were wondering if you'd mind
helping us by taking her out.

650
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:45,912
Oh, I'd be glad to...

651
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:48,348
- Doing what?
- Being her beau.

652
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,150
Just until she gets over you.

653
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:52,719
You see, Dr. Beemish says she
mustn't feel

654
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:54,254
you're being martyred.

655
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,224
Does he? Let Dr. Beemish take
her out. Let her get over him.

656
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:01,527
I'll bet there's no law that
says I've to go out with kids.

657
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:05,598
No one's forcing you. We were
hoping you'd want to cooperate.

658
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,700
Why should I?

659
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,268
Because your attitude will
have...

660
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:11,237
...a decided bearing on the
other charges against you,

661
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:13,874
...if the assistant DA chooses
to press them.

662
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,309
Press what?
I only punched him in the nose.

663
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,278
Mr. Walters, if you were a judge

664
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:21,281
and a man had enticed a
17-year-old girl...

665
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:23,784
...to his apartment to paint her
portrait,

666
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,786
and when her family protested...

667
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:27,954
...brutally assaulted the
assistant DA,

668
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:29,790
what would you do to this man?

669
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:32,258
- I'd give him 20 years.
- Exactly what I'd do.

670
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,928
- Which side are you on?
- You haven't proved it.

671
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,130
- You haven't proved it.
- We will.

672
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:38,732
That's up to the jury.

673
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:41,768
Mr. Walters, if you were a judge
and this man realized

674
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:44,237
this girl was unfortunately in
love with him...

675
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:46,940
...and agreed to help her get
over him...

676
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:49,142
...wouldn't you be inclined to
be lenient?

677
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:50,711
I would.

678
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:53,646
- I think I'd drop the charges.
- Exactly what I'd do.

679
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:01,154
What do I have to do?

680
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:03,757
You'll see Susan as often
as we deem proper.

681
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:06,492
As soon as your fatal
fascination wears off,

682
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,328
you're free to go on your way.

683
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:10,163
And what if it doesn't wear off?

684
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,664
It will.

685
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:16,336
Mr. Nugent, don't have
any illusions about this matter.

686
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:18,939
I'm doing this against my better
judgment.

687
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:22,675
I would just as soon my sister
were going out with an actor.

688
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:25,145
Judge Turner doesn't exactly
mean that.

689
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,146
Just wondering.

690
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:28,181
She means as head of the
psychiatrist...

691
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:31,284
...that I've recommended you
as a vital therapy measure.

692
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:38,925
That's great.
Recommended for children.

693
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:01,247
Get him.

694
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:09,022
This row's reserved for the
faculty and

695
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,092
important members of the student
body.

696
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:15,261
- I hope you like basketball.
- Crazy about it.

697
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,668
Good evening, Susan.

698
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,670
Geometry getting straightened
out?

699
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:26,072
Yes, Mr. Mittwick.

700
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:29,042
- Your handkerchief.
- Thank--

701
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:32,478
You must be a new boy. We'll be
running into each other.

702
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:34,280
I gave a lecture here on art.

703
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,983
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You're in Miss Hallop's class.

704
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,052
Excellent teacher, excellent.

705
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,889
There they go!

706
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:34,374
S-S-S-U-N...

707
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,410
...S-S-S-E-T.

708
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:40,013
S-U-N-S-E-T.

709
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,515
Sunset, Sunset, Sunset!

710
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,502
We had a much better team last
season,

711
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:04,437
but our star center graduated.

712
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:05,405
Too bad.

713
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:08,208
Our new center needs more
experience.

714
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:10,143
Oh, at least.

715
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,180
He used to be sort of
a boyfriend of mine.

716
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:17,717
- What?
- Oh, until I met you.

717
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:20,586
You mean that fine-looking young
man who smiled at you?

718
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:21,922
Number 7?

719
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:25,225
Yes, that's the one.
He's just a child.

720
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,828
- Is he in love with you?
- Oh, I suppose so.

721
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,830
But you needn't be jealous,
Richard.

722
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:33,599
He's really terribly
unsophisticated.

723
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,989
- Christoff for White.
- White out.

724
00:44:02,195 --> 00:44:06,032
Sit it out for a while and get
your mind back on the game.

725
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:13,239
Yes, fine figure of a man.
I'd like to meet him.

726
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:16,142
That can be arranged.

727
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,484
That's a great game you're
playing, Mr...

728
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,420
- Jerry White. Richard Nugent.
- How do you do?

729
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:30,623
Usually my game is much better,
but it's off lately.

730
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,458
You know, personal troubles.

731
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:35,695
It's too bad that when schools
depend on their athletes,

732
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,864
certain athletes are concerned
with their own problems,

733
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,866
instead of beating Peebe High.

734
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:42,335
I don't know, Susan.

735
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:44,370
Why don't we get together,
talk it over?

736
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:47,640
Why not join us for a drink--?
A soda after the game?

737
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:49,209
- You mean that?
- Certainly.

738
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:52,278
Well, gee, I'd love to.
Thanks, Mr. Nugent.

739
00:44:57,283 --> 00:45:00,886
I'm better now. Sure would
like to get back in the game.

740
00:45:00,953 --> 00:45:02,822
- All right, go in for Barthman.
- Thanks.

741
00:45:02,888 --> 00:45:06,892
Team! Team!
Fight, fight, fight!

742
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:09,996
- White for Barthman.
- Barthman out.

743
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,554
One for Sunset!

744
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,122
What a player!

745
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,235
Thank you.

746
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:00,613
You know, I feel sorry for
Jerry.

747
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,681
You do? Why?

748
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:04,650
I used to play a lot of
basketball as a kid.

749
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:08,121
- I'll bet you were wonderful.
- Not nearly as good as Jerry.

750
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:10,156
I know a champ when I see one.

751
00:46:10,223 --> 00:46:12,058
He's off his game because of
you.

752
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,859
- You think so?
- I know so.

753
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:17,530
It's awful what a woman can do
to a man. Look at history.

754
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:20,600
- Caesar and Cleopatra.
- Napoleon and Josephine.

755
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:21,867
All of them.

756
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:25,471
Behind every defeated man,
there's a frustrated love.

757
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:27,607
- You're right.
- You bet I'm right.

758
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:33,146
And I promise, all my life,
never to hurt you.

759
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:35,581
- It was a tough game.
- Oh, hello, Jerry.

760
00:46:35,648 --> 00:46:36,916
But we won.

761
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:38,551
Certainly, through no help from
you.

762
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:42,088
You're wrong, Susan, I thought
he played a splendid game.

763
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:43,623
- No, he didn't.
- He did.

764
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,024
No, I didn't.

765
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:47,193
- What will you have?
- I'm not very hungry.

766
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,662
I'll just have a double
Sweetheart Flip.

767
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:51,864
Aren't you supposed to be in
training?

768
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:54,434
Sometimes a man just doesn't
care.

769
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,203
You see? I know how you feel.

770
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,506
You do? Well, I may as well
level with you, Mr. Nugent.

771
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:03,276
When Susan told me about you and
her, I was sore.

772
00:47:03,343 --> 00:47:04,810
- Can you blame me?
- No--

773
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:08,281
When I saw you tonight, I wanted
to take a poke at you--

774
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:09,615
- Jerry
- Let me finish.

775
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:13,186
Then I said to myself,
"Let's be civilized.

776
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:15,288
"This is life. If Susan feels
that way,

777
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:16,622
it's all right with me."

778
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:19,091
That's big of you, Jerry,
and very generous.

779
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,661
- We can still be friends.
- Of course we can.

780
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:23,696
- No matter what happens.
- That's how I feel.

781
00:47:23,763 --> 00:47:26,499
Dick and I will treasure your
friendship.

782
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:29,769
If I can do anything for either
of you, just call Jerry.

783
00:47:29,835 --> 00:47:33,439
If we can do anything for you,
all you have to do is ask.

784
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:35,575
Yeah. Get in touch, you know.
Call up.

785
00:47:35,641 --> 00:47:38,144
Well, I guess it's goodbye,
Jerry.

786
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:40,413
- I guess it is.
- Guess it is.

787
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:56,629
- Oh, and Susan?
- Yes, dear?

788
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:58,664
It isn't becoming for you to
call me

789
00:47:58,731 --> 00:48:00,866
"dear" and "darling" and all
that.

790
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:03,669
- Why, darling?
- Now, stop that.

791
00:48:03,736 --> 00:48:07,407
Listen, the basketball game was
fun tonight, but it can't go on.

792
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:10,376
Yes, I know.
The season's over next week.

793
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:12,645
No, no, no, Susan.
Wait a minute.

794
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:15,781
I mean, the whole thing can't go
on.

795
00:48:15,848 --> 00:48:18,651
You got me into all this
trouble. Came to my apartment.

796
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:21,086
You told your sister I asked you
to pose.

797
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:22,822
Well, that's true in a way.

798
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:26,326
That isn't so, and you know it.
Let's not argue about it.

799
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:29,829
The point is, everyone has the
crazy idea that you love me.

800
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:31,197
I am.

801
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:34,467
Look at me.

802
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:37,737
Susan, I wouldn't say this to
many people,

803
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:39,972
but I'm old enough to be your
father.

804
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,774
You're so right, dear.

805
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:46,312
You've got to realize that this
isn't proper for either of us.

806
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:47,847
You're so right, dear.

807
00:48:47,913 --> 00:48:49,482
- Well, it's not only--
- Step.

808
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:51,484
Thanks. It's only gonna
embarrass me,

809
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:53,419
but it's gonna embarrass you
too.

810
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:54,787
You're so right, dear.

811
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:57,423
Susan, you're not paying
any attention to me.

812
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,359
You're so right, dear.

813
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:04,264
Well, good evening, Susan.
Good evening, Nugent.

814
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,266
Glad to see you kids home early.

815
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:08,268
We're not home yet. We will be.

816
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:11,103
Did you have a good time?
Was the game fun?

817
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,905
How would you like a cigarette?

818
00:49:12,972 --> 00:49:16,642
- I'm not allowed to smoke yet.
- Sorry I haven't any bubble gum.

819
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:18,744
Good night, Tommy.

820
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:21,614
By the way, we're having a
birthday party for my niece.

821
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:25,885
We'd love to have you come.
She'll be 6.

822
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:27,587
- How's your jaw?
- Fine, why?

823
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:30,022
Because the worst I can get is
90 days.

824
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:32,024
- Temper, temper.
- Dickie, please.

825
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:34,026
Well...

826
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:35,895
Toodle-loo, kids.

827
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:44,304
Hello, Margaret.

828
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,806
Hello, Susan.
Good evening, Mr. Nugent.

829
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:49,074
- Good evening.
- That's the new dress.

830
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:51,577
- Yes. Like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

831
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:55,047
It's too bad you'd to go to that
dreary dinner for some lawyer.

832
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:56,749
It was a very nice party.

833
00:49:56,816 --> 00:50:01,086
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- We had a sensational time.

834
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:03,222
Better turn in now. School
tomorrow.

835
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:06,459
- You have to get up early.
- Yes, of course.

836
00:50:06,526 --> 00:50:07,993
Good night, Dickie.

837
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:10,763
Good night, Susan.

838
00:50:12,598 --> 00:50:15,301
- Good night, Margaret.
- Good night, dear.

839
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:19,071
Good night, Dickie.

840
00:50:19,138 --> 00:50:20,740
Good night, Susan.

841
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,947
Well, good night.

842
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:29,449
Good night.

843
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:36,088
That is a beautiful dress, and
you look wonderful in it.

844
00:50:36,155 --> 00:50:39,091
Thank you.
You said that gracefully.

845
00:50:39,158 --> 00:50:41,060
Perhaps the result of practice.

846
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:45,498
You said that ungraciously.
Perhaps the result of practice.

847
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,000
I had that coming.

848
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,169
Got a moment?

849
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:51,471
Yes.

850
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:07,420
That's right.

851
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:13,325
My mother was quite a remarkable
woman.

852
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:15,461
She taught piano.

853
00:51:15,528 --> 00:51:18,431
Funnily enough, children liked
to take lessons from her.

854
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:19,732
Well, anyway...

855
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:22,368
I read books she didn't want me
to read

856
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:24,437
and didn't read books she wanted
me to.

857
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:27,807
I'd say that was a perfectly
healthy, normal attitude.

858
00:51:27,873 --> 00:51:31,477
One day, I found a book that
had a very racy title.

859
00:51:31,544 --> 00:51:34,847
So I sneaked it up to my room,
started to read it.

860
00:51:34,914 --> 00:51:37,917
I kept reading for a long time.
It was awful dull.

861
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:40,019
I kept on with it.

862
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:41,554
Then suddenly I discovered...

863
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:43,689
...mother had stuck a philosophy
book...

864
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:46,892
...underneath that paper cover
with the racy title.

865
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:50,563
Anyway, I waded through the
thing, hoping for the best.

866
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,566
Although I never did come across
anything exciting...

867
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:55,735
...I learned a lot about
philosophy.

868
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:58,070
I suppose that's one way of
learning.

869
00:51:58,137 --> 00:52:02,842
Yeah, isn't it? Well, I learned
something else, simple but true.

870
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:06,679
Never judge a book by its cover.
All is not gold that glitters.

871
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:09,181
Things may not be what they
appear to be.

872
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:11,484
That's very interesting, Mr.
Nugent.

873
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:13,886
My father was a judge.

874
00:52:13,953 --> 00:52:16,255
When he gave me a book about
law,

875
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:18,290
I knew it was gonna be about
law.

876
00:52:18,357 --> 00:52:20,092
Yes, yes.

877
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:22,327
And when you meet a man who's
labeled "artist"...

878
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:25,998
...you know he's gonna be all
you think an artist is gonna be.

879
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:29,902
Concerning you, I sat in
judgment on a series of facts...

880
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:34,373
...not on your character or
biography.

881
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,676
I just took the long way to say
that

882
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:38,711
when I said that was a beautiful
dress...

883
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:40,713
...and you look wonderful in
it...

884
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,347
...I sincerely meant it.

885
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:44,850
I'm sorry.

886
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:48,721
I've never been subjected
to so much charm before.

887
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:53,993
Well, I'm afraid we're wasting
a perfectly beautiful moon...

888
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,030
...and I'm keeping you up.
Good night.

889
00:52:58,097 --> 00:53:01,567
We'll see you Saturday. You're
taking Susan to the picnic.

890
00:53:01,634 --> 00:53:04,737
Yes, yes, yes, I'll be here.
Don't worry.

891
00:53:04,804 --> 00:53:08,273
With my very best Saturday
picnic charm.

892
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,142
Good night, Your Honor.

893
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:11,577
Good night.

894
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:36,201
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Mr. Nugent.

895
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:37,970
What are you doing here?

896
00:53:38,037 --> 00:53:40,806
You know, it's hard to get Susan
out of your system.

897
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:43,475
I know how it is.
Why don't you go inside?

898
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:45,277
I'm not welcome inside.

899
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:48,347
Don't be silly. She probably
doesn't know you're here.

900
00:53:48,413 --> 00:53:50,583
She put me here.

901
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,918
I'm a square in Susan's social
circle.

902
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:56,421
It's not her fault, I guess.
It's her uncle, Judge Thaddeus.

903
00:53:56,488 --> 00:53:58,423
- Have you met him yet?
- No.

904
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,959
He's something fierce.

905
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:02,962
I walked in and said,
"Mellow greetings, ukie-dukie."

906
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:06,365
- He almost blew a fuse.
- What's wrong with that?

907
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:08,834
Guess he's been around lawyers
so long,

908
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:10,369
he's forgotten how people talk.

909
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:13,472
Sure. "Mellow greetings,
ukie..."

910
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:16,341
- You going to the picnic?
- Well, I was, but--

911
00:54:16,408 --> 00:54:18,811
How'd you like to use my car?

912
00:54:18,878 --> 00:54:21,346
- You're kidding.
- No. I'd like to borrow yours.

913
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,148
- Does it run?
- Oh, sure.

914
00:54:23,215 --> 00:54:25,585
- Where are the keys?
- You don't need a key.

915
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:28,120
- Well, here are mine.
- Jiminy. Thanks, Mr. Nugent.

916
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:30,122
See you at the picnic.

917
00:54:31,323 --> 00:54:33,258
Boy, she sure is a honey.

918
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,260
Just a later model.

919
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:58,050
That must be Richard Nugent.

920
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:00,352
And who the devil is Richard
Nugent?

921
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:03,522
He's older. He's come to take
Susan to the picnic.

922
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:06,325
- I think you'll like him.
- How do you know?

923
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:08,327
I haven't seen him yet!

924
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:10,896
Hi! Mellow greetings,
ukie-dukie.

925
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:12,164
Dickie!

926
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:15,434
Ready, voot? Let's scoot!
You remind me of a man.

927
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,869
- What man?
- The man with power.

928
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:18,503
- What power?
- The power of hoodoo.

929
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,570
- Hoodoo?
- You do.

930
00:55:19,605 --> 00:55:21,373
- Do what?
- Remind me of a man.

931
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,808
- What man?
- The man with power.

932
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,552
- Good morning!
- Power of hoo-- Greetings.

933
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:26,178
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

934
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:28,513
- What are you doing?
- I don't dig you.

935
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,683
What are you whispering about?

936
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,552
Hi, Uncle Matt! How's the light
operator?

937
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,855
May I present my great-uncle,
Judge Turner.

938
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:38,858
- How do you do, judge?
- This isn't a pump handle.

939
00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:40,893
He's sharp.
You remind me of a man.

940
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,728
- What man?
- The man with the power.

941
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:44,195
- What power?
- The power of hoodoo.

942
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:46,999
- Hoodoo? Do what?
- You do. Remind me of a man.

943
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:48,233
Remind you--

944
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,903
He is an associate justice
of the state supreme court.

945
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,805
Better than working
for a living.

946
00:55:52,872 --> 00:55:55,140
Aren't we gonna be late for the
picnic?

947
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:56,676
Yes, we are.

948
00:55:56,742 --> 00:55:59,144
I'm your little pepper shaker.
The hot rod's outside.

949
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:06,451
Come on, Thaddeus.

950
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:08,921
- You remind me of a man.
- Hoodoo.

951
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,924
- No, I'm supposed to say that!
- All right, go ahead.

952
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,100
- But that's Jerry's car.
- Just looks like it.

953
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,803
- What's this?
- Friend made it. A voot-eight.

954
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:25,771
Eight more payments and it's
mine!

955
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:27,606
You expect me to ride in that?

956
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:29,842
- Throw your frame in!
- I wanna talk to you.

957
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:32,111
- No, there's no time--
- I'd rather stay home.

958
00:56:32,177 --> 00:56:35,647
There's no time for talk now.
Come on, come on.

959
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:37,717
- Here's the basket, here.
- Thank you.

960
00:56:37,783 --> 00:56:40,219
Hot vooterenie!

961
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:06,912
- Nice car you got here, Richard.
- Thank you.

962
00:57:09,414 --> 00:57:11,984
I just hope you come up
before me sometime.

963
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:14,219
Must run in your family.

964
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:18,090
- Hello, Tommy.
- I've been waiting for you.

965
00:57:18,157 --> 00:57:21,093
- I'm sorry. We were delayed.
- Look out for your thumb.

966
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,395
It's the junior set.
Hello, Uncle Thaddeus.

967
00:57:23,462 --> 00:57:26,565
- How do you--? My back.
- Can I get something for you?

968
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:28,968
Yes. Get me a seat that doesn't
bounce.

969
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:31,036
We can eat lunch over there.
Come on.

970
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:33,873
I'm as hungry as a bear.
Let's join the ants.

971
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,644
Ladies and gentlemen!

972
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:44,049
First events of the afternoon
are the novelty races.

973
00:57:44,116 --> 00:57:48,453
Open to adults, parents and
friends.

974
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,789
Come on, everybody, win...

975
00:57:49,855 --> 00:57:52,224
I used to be good at these as a
kid.

976
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,659
Well, why not get in?
It's open to parents.

977
00:57:54,726 --> 00:57:57,029
- I'm not a parent.
- Too old, Chamberlain?

978
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:59,899
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

979
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:01,533
All right, then, I will.

980
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,268
- How about you?
- Don't be silly.

981
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:05,537
Dickie, you must.
I want a medal.

982
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:07,572
- Get her a medal.
- Oh, too old?

983
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:09,809
To run in a sack race?
Nothing to it.

984
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:13,578
Then go in there
and show them, Dickie.

985
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:15,848
All right, I will.

986
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:18,017
- Hold that.
- Hold this.

987
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,485
Snap it up, boys.
Give the man his sack.

988
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:24,589
Let's go to the finish line. I
wanna see Dickie comes in first.

989
00:58:24,656 --> 00:58:25,791
Coming, Uncle Matt?

990
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:27,893
No. You go ahead. I'll wait
here.

991
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,095
Two more lanes open!
Who'll step up?

992
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:31,897
Thank you, gentlemen!

993
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:34,566
Step right up and get yourself
a sack.

994
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:36,802
Okay, Jack, you all set?

995
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:39,839
All right, steady now.
Ready, gentlemen?

996
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:42,942
On your marks, get set...

997
00:59:07,399 --> 00:59:09,468
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

998
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:10,870
we're set for the start...

999
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:12,972
...of the spectacular
three-legged race...

1000
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:15,841
...one of the most hilarious
events of the program.

1001
00:59:15,908 --> 00:59:18,543
Now, come on, you folks down
the sidelines,

1002
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,879
pick out your favorite...

1003
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,414
...and cheer him down to the
finish line!

1004
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:26,385
All right, Jack.
On your marks, get set...

1005
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:31,957
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold up, hold up. Not so fast.

1006
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:42,868
All right, everybody, we're all
set

1007
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:44,870
for the spoon and potato race.

1008
00:59:44,937 --> 00:59:48,107
On your marks, get set...

1009
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:11,263
Disqualified! You've got to
cross the line on your feet.

1010
01:00:18,737 --> 01:00:21,373
On your marks, get set...

1011
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:26,578
- Come on, Dickie.
- Come on, Dickie!

1012
01:00:26,645 --> 01:00:27,646
Come on.

1013
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,567
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
it!

1014
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:52,304
This is the main event of the
afternoon.

1015
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:57,309
You are about to witness
the spectacular obstacle race.

1016
01:00:57,376 --> 01:01:03,682
A supreme test of skill,
stamina and endurance.

1017
01:01:03,748 --> 01:01:05,550
Come on, Dickie, stand up.

1018
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:07,953
I can't pin it when you're
sitting down.

1019
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,255
- Haven't you had enough?
- Not for me.

1020
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:13,492
- We've just begun to fight.
- Just begun to fight.

1021
01:01:13,558 --> 01:01:17,129
Hold these medals, Uncle Thad.
I don't want any excess weight.

1022
01:01:17,196 --> 01:01:19,198
Everybody get ready!

1023
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:22,201
All contestants report to the
starting line.

1024
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:24,903
Come on, Dickie,
I know you can win this time.

1025
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,040
- Sure. Sure.
- This is the last call!

1026
01:01:28,107 --> 01:01:30,242
- Hi, Mr. Nugent.
- Where have you been?

1027
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:32,677
I've been trying out your super
jalopy. Hi, Susan.

1028
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:36,548
Hi, Jerry. Now remember, Dickie,
you've got to win me that cup.

1029
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:37,749
Good luck.

1030
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:39,318
- You going in the race?
- Yep.

1031
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:41,720
- May the best man win.
- He will.

1032
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:45,824
I'm beginning to worry about
him.

1033
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,028
Why? He's got courage. A man's
man.

1034
01:01:49,094 --> 01:01:52,897
- I hope he wins.
- Come on, now. Everybody ready.

1035
01:01:52,964 --> 01:01:55,200
- For Susan's sake.
- Of course.

1036
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:57,302
Everybody line up.

1037
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:59,304
Let's go down to the finish
line.

1038
01:01:59,371 --> 01:02:01,773
--In the obstacle race.

1039
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,675
All right, all you contestants,

1040
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,478
take your places on the
starting line.

1041
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:09,948
And remember, anyone who fails
to take a single obstacle...

1042
01:02:10,015 --> 01:02:11,983
...is disqualified.

1043
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:14,219
On your marks, get set...

1044
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,882
Keep going, Mr. Nugent.

1045
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:20,819
Keep going, Mr. Nugent,
keep going.

1046
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:22,121
Keep going.

1047
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:41,973
Excuse me, I slipped.

1048
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,208
You pushed me.

1049
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:53,452
- It was nothing. Just a race.
- Congratulations, Mr. Nugent.

1050
01:03:53,518 --> 01:03:56,888
Everybody over to the bandstand
for the grand award!

1051
01:03:56,955 --> 01:04:01,059
- You were wonderful, Dickie.
- The grand award, that's you.

1052
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:03,262
Oh, sure. Grand reward.

1053
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,134
Thanks a lot, Jerry, for letting
Dickie win.

1054
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:10,502
That's okay.

1055
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:13,138
Pay the boys Saturday.
Seventy-five cents a piece.

1056
01:04:13,205 --> 01:04:14,739
Anyone else, they'd charge a
buck.

1057
01:04:14,806 --> 01:04:17,909
- I'll pay you too.
- I don't want your money.

1058
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:19,711
Some things just can't be
bought.

1059
01:04:19,778 --> 01:04:23,148
You know, Jerry, at times
you're really very nice.

1060
01:04:29,454 --> 01:04:31,590
Quiet, please. Quiet, everyone.

1061
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:37,128
It gives me great pleasure to
present

1062
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:38,930
this beautiful trophy and
medal...

1063
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:43,402
...to that great athlete and
winner of the feature event...

1064
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:45,470
...Mr. Richard Nugent.

1065
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:02,020
I don't know how this happened
to me.

1066
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:07,759
But I guess I owe it all to
clean living, proper outlook...

1067
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:10,762
...and the help of my friend.

1068
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:29,881
What a wonderful day.
What a wonderful picnic.

1069
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:32,984
Oh, I feel wonderful.
Uncle Thaddeus, let's dance.

1070
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:35,220
No. No.

1071
01:05:35,287 --> 01:05:39,591
Susan, your youthful exuberance
is very tiring.

1072
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:42,861
Margaret, I'm going upstairs
to take a hot bath.

1073
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:44,429
Life.

1074
01:05:44,496 --> 01:05:47,299
You'd better rest for a while.
You've had a busy day...

1075
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:49,167
...and you're going to a dance
tonight.

1076
01:05:49,234 --> 01:05:50,469
Quite right.

1077
01:05:50,535 --> 01:05:53,004
But I would like this day to
never end.

1078
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:57,376
I'd like everything to stay
suspended, beautiful.

1079
01:05:57,442 --> 01:06:02,080
Well, you can leave everything
suspended after I sit down.

1080
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:05,617
- I'll take it, Margaret.
- No, I think you'd better go up.

1081
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:06,684
All right, sis.

1082
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:44,055
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

1083
01:06:44,122 --> 01:06:49,160
A very odd thing happened to me
today, Uncle Matt.

1084
01:06:49,227 --> 01:06:51,262
I think it's very simple to
explain.

1085
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,466
Optical illusions have been
known to...

1086
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:58,236
Or the power of suggestion
through Susan...

1087
01:06:58,303 --> 01:07:02,341
These things have been...
Well...

1088
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,843
What happened to me
was a combination of the heat...

1089
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:06,945
...a hurried lunch and the
excitement.

1090
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:08,413
Of course.

1091
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,282
It was a question of me
thinking I saw him. Understand?

1092
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:13,452
Sure. That's perfectly clear.
The same--

1093
01:07:13,518 --> 01:07:15,920
In view of this, it occurred to
me that...

1094
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:17,188
Mr. Nugent.

1095
01:07:17,255 --> 01:07:19,190
...Mr. Nugent's been sweet about
Susan.

1096
01:07:19,257 --> 01:07:21,292
We shouldn't embarrass him
further.

1097
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,895
- What if Susan--
- Susan's romance is adolescent.

1098
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:27,566
I think she'll get over it. I
think we owe it to Mr. Nugent--

1099
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:29,801
I'd like to talk this over with
him.

1100
01:07:29,868 --> 01:07:31,135
I think that's quite--

1101
01:07:31,202 --> 01:07:34,406
I don't think it'll be a good
idea to have him here.

1102
01:07:34,473 --> 01:07:37,376
With Susan in the house,
we couldn't talk freely here.

1103
01:07:37,442 --> 01:07:39,378
- Naturally--
- It wouldn't be proper...

1104
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:41,045
...to invite myself to his
apartment.

1105
01:07:41,112 --> 01:07:42,747
Oh, no--

1106
01:07:42,814 --> 01:07:46,418
So the obvious thing to do is
arrange a convenient place.

1107
01:07:46,485 --> 01:07:50,221
Something public, sophisticated
and...

1108
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:53,525
Well, we can talk things over.
Yes.

1109
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:56,895
- I'd have to give that--
- Thank you for talking to me.

1110
01:07:56,961 --> 01:07:58,329
You've cleared things up.

1111
01:07:58,397 --> 01:08:00,832
It's all right. I appreciate
your confidence.

1112
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,334
It's extraordinary how simple
problems are

1113
01:08:03,402 --> 01:08:05,336
when you don't let emotions run
away.

1114
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:08,039
- True, true.
- Where's the telephone?

1115
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:50,682
Hello?

1116
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:52,684
Yeah.

1117
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:55,420
Oh, anything wrong with Susan?

1118
01:08:55,487 --> 01:08:58,356
Oh, can't go, huh? Sorry to hear
that.

1119
01:08:58,423 --> 01:09:00,592
Will you tell her? Yeah.

1120
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:05,196
With you?

1121
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:06,765
Yeah, I'd be delighted.

1122
01:09:09,367 --> 01:09:11,369
Do you want me to come over
there?

1123
01:09:11,436 --> 01:09:12,904
Oh, I see. Yeah.

1124
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:15,373
You wouldn't want to come here,
would you?

1125
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,311
Oh, naturally.
We can meet any place you say.

1126
01:09:20,378 --> 01:09:24,182
Yeah, we can celebrate my
triumph.

1127
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:26,384
Well...

1128
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,987
No, I'm not too tired to dance.

1129
01:09:29,053 --> 01:09:31,723
Do you dance? I mean--

1130
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:34,626
Well, okay, anything you say.

1131
01:09:34,693 --> 01:09:36,227
Well, let's see now.

1132
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:40,331
I know the headwaiter at the
Tick-Tock Club. How about that?

1133
01:09:40,398 --> 01:09:42,867
Fine. Sure, okay.

1134
01:09:47,906 --> 01:09:49,073
Come in.

1135
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:57,849
- Hello.
- Hello, Nugent.

1136
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:00,051
Come on in.

1137
01:10:00,118 --> 01:10:02,286
Last time I saw you, you were
underwater.

1138
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:04,088
You all right? You didn't get
hurt?

1139
01:10:04,155 --> 01:10:07,726
I keep myself in excellent
physical condition at all times.

1140
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,928
- How do you feel?
- Splendid.

1141
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:14,766
To the victors belong the
spoils.

1142
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,168
You made a good race of it,
Chamberlain.

1143
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:19,003
I don't think I like it there.

1144
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:22,674
The reason I'm here is that I
want to let you off the hook.

1145
01:10:22,741 --> 01:10:24,676
Here, hold that a moment. What
hook?

1146
01:10:24,743 --> 01:10:27,011
I know taking Susan out was a
nuisance.

1147
01:10:27,078 --> 01:10:30,481
It wasn't good for Susan,
and it was a strain on Margaret.

1148
01:10:30,549 --> 01:10:32,617
Which one are you concerned
about?

1149
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:36,287
If I had to indicate my
preference, I'd choose Margaret.

1150
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:37,622
Who's your tailor?

1151
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:40,458
The coach was kind enough
to furnish them to me.

1152
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:42,460
Oh, I had it there, didn't I?

1153
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:43,895
Nugent...

1154
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:46,030
...I have something important
to tell you.

1155
01:10:46,097 --> 01:10:48,232
I've decided to drop charges
against you.

1156
01:10:48,299 --> 01:10:49,734
Let me see this.

1157
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:52,537
I say, I've decided to drop
the charges against you.

1158
01:10:52,604 --> 01:10:54,539
Dropped my medal. Dropped it.

1159
01:10:54,606 --> 01:10:56,474
- Help me look for it.
- Yes, yes.

1160
01:10:56,541 --> 01:11:00,344
We can forget the whole thing.
You won't have to come around.

1161
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:03,682
You look silly in that coat.
Doesn't go with the clothes.

1162
01:11:03,748 --> 01:11:06,150
Let's stick to the subject.
You're a free man now.

1163
01:11:06,217 --> 01:11:10,288
You're free. It's possible we
won't see each other again.

1164
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,856
Found it. What did you say?

1165
01:11:11,923 --> 01:11:15,126
It's possible we won't see
any more of each other.

1166
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:18,697
Chamberlain, you've put me in a
position

1167
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:20,531
where I'm forced to make a
confession.

1168
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:22,400
About Margaret?

1169
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:25,536
No. No, about Susan.

1170
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:28,206
- I'm madly in love with her.
- You're what?

1171
01:11:28,272 --> 01:11:31,542
I don't know how it happened.
Perhaps it's something she said,

1172
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,879
or how she looked
or something she wore.

1173
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:38,149
All I know is that I'm happy
when I'm near her, that I--

1174
01:11:38,216 --> 01:11:41,753
Well, you're a man.
You must have felt what I feel.

1175
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,623
- It's love. Love!
- It's preposterous.

1176
01:11:44,689 --> 01:11:47,826
- The child's only 17.
- Yes, but she'll be 18 soon.

1177
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:50,161
We'll wait for our chance at
life.

1178
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:51,663
Spring and autumn.

1179
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:55,066
Stop it. You're complicating the
issue. I forbid it.

1180
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:57,501
This is something no court of
law can stop.

1181
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,237
It's bigger than you, than me.

1182
01:11:59,303 --> 01:12:01,472
You're just what I always
thought you were.

1183
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,474
You're irresponsible.

1184
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,944
L'amour, my friend, I'amour.

1185
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:09,080
We'll see about "I'amour, my
friend, I'amour."

1186
01:12:15,654 --> 01:12:19,157
Of course, it's not the kind of
wine we got before the war...

1187
01:12:19,223 --> 01:12:21,760
...but I think that she
would rather like it.

1188
01:12:21,826 --> 01:12:24,095
Anyway, it's the best
we can get nowadays.

1189
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,798
Thank you, Alex.
I just wanted to make sure.

1190
01:12:26,865 --> 01:12:30,568
- Is that the mademoiselle?
- No, no, no.

1191
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:33,337
- Hey, that isn't--
- I'm awfully sorry.

1192
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,345
I'm sorry, but the polish,
the best we can get nowadays.

1193
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:42,681
Oh, that's all right.

1194
01:12:42,747 --> 01:12:45,216
Oh, perhaps that's mademoiselle?

1195
01:12:45,283 --> 01:12:46,785
No, no, no.

1196
01:12:46,851 --> 01:12:49,253
I wish we had blue flowers.
She would like them.

1197
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,256
We can get blue flowers,
but it will take time.

1198
01:12:52,323 --> 01:12:54,292
Well, I'll try to fix these.

1199
01:13:01,232 --> 01:13:04,368
Alex, that's the best you can
get any day.

1200
01:13:12,811 --> 01:13:15,546
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

1201
01:13:15,613 --> 01:13:17,716
I didn't know.
I should have checked.

1202
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:21,085
- I'm sorry, no black tie.
- That's all right.

1203
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:24,322
That's a beautiful suit,
and you look wonderful in it.

1204
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:44,675
They're lovely. Thank you.

1205
01:13:44,743 --> 01:13:47,746
- Yellow's my favorite color.
- I thought so.

1206
01:13:58,356 --> 01:14:01,192
Now, isn't that sweet?

1207
01:14:01,259 --> 01:14:04,095
I can't tell you how glad I am
that you--

1208
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:05,196
That we're here.

1209
01:14:05,263 --> 01:14:07,565
Our relationship's been such an
odd one...

1210
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:11,035
...I thought it might be fun for
us to try a new background.

1211
01:14:11,102 --> 01:14:13,271
Would you like to give your
order now?

1212
01:14:13,337 --> 01:14:14,338
Later.

1213
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:16,574
How about a drink in the
meantime? Champagne?

1214
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,342
Yes.

1215
01:14:18,409 --> 01:14:19,878
The time is now, Alex.

1216
01:14:19,944 --> 01:14:22,180
- Shall we dance?
- Love to.

1217
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:34,725
- Now, my father was a bachelor.
- Really?

1218
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:39,630
Wait a minute. Wait till...
Wait until I finish.

1219
01:14:39,697 --> 01:14:42,801
He was a bachelor until way into
his 30s.

1220
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:45,236
He always said he'd know who
he's gonna marry

1221
01:14:45,303 --> 01:14:47,238
the moment he met her.

1222
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:49,207
Then he met my mother.

1223
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:51,876
He put his arm around her,
and that was it.

1224
01:14:51,943 --> 01:14:54,913
Just the way she felt in his
arms did the trick.

1225
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:57,615
They were married three days
later.

1226
01:14:57,681 --> 01:15:00,885
That's a very romantic story.

1227
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:02,553
They were happy all their lives,

1228
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,755
apparently had nothing in
common.

1229
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:06,858
I told you, she was a piano
teacher,

1230
01:15:06,925 --> 01:15:08,960
and he was a flag decorator.

1231
01:15:09,027 --> 01:15:11,162
- A what?
- Flag decorator.

1232
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:13,597
He was a good one, until he fell
off

1233
01:15:13,664 --> 01:15:15,599
Newark City Hall, broke his leg.

1234
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:18,002
Your family sounds like fun.

1235
01:15:20,805 --> 01:15:23,741
You must have come from a nice
family.

1236
01:15:23,808 --> 01:15:25,743
It shows in your face.

1237
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,280
Well, my family weren't quite
that impulsive.

1238
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,049
Father courted Mother through
high school,

1239
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:32,416
college and law school.

1240
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:35,586
Fourteen years after they met,
they got married.

1241
01:15:35,653 --> 01:15:38,456
They had a lot in common.
They were both attorneys.

1242
01:15:42,827 --> 01:15:45,063
You feel nice in my arms.

1243
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:51,035
I imagine if Mother and Father
hadn't had much in common...

1244
01:15:51,102 --> 01:15:54,272
...they needn't have waited 14
years.

1245
01:15:54,338 --> 01:15:57,241
It could have happened suddenly,
romantically.

1246
01:16:02,346 --> 01:16:03,347
Dickie!

1247
01:16:07,518 --> 01:16:10,121
- Oh, hello, Agnes.
- You didn't congratulate me.

1248
01:16:10,188 --> 01:16:12,323
- Should I?
- It's my birthday.

1249
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,591
Congratulations.

1250
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:18,429
Nugent, what do you say
we let bygones be bygones, huh?

1251
01:16:18,496 --> 01:16:21,232
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Yes, we've met.

1252
01:16:21,299 --> 01:16:24,535
Where did I meet you?
Was it Dickie's apartment?

1253
01:16:24,602 --> 01:16:28,206
- No, you remember Judge Turner.
- Oh, well, of course.

1254
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:31,042
Well, yes. Well, you got to be
friends, huh?

1255
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:34,812
Leave it to Dickie.
He knows all the angles.

1256
01:16:34,879 --> 01:16:37,315
If it's too crowded,
we'll go to the table.

1257
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:38,883
It's too crowded.

1258
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,319
- Happy birthday.
- Goodbye.

1259
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:43,387
Goodbye.

1260
01:16:43,454 --> 01:16:46,457
Now, there's a guy who never
goes out of a girl's mind.

1261
01:16:46,524 --> 01:16:49,860
He just stays there like a heavy
meal.

1262
01:16:49,928 --> 01:16:52,997
- What am I like?
- Orange juice.

1263
01:16:54,432 --> 01:16:57,301
- I'm terribly sorry about that.
- It's nothing.

1264
01:16:57,368 --> 01:16:59,537
I'm sure you didn't know she'd
be here.

1265
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:02,473
Are you sure you're sure
I didn't know she'd be here?

1266
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,309
- Yes, why?
- Well, I was just wondering.

1267
01:17:05,376 --> 01:17:07,578
I've given up jumping at
conclusions.

1268
01:17:07,645 --> 01:17:09,180
- Good.
- Hello, Dickie.

1269
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,814
- Hello, Jolly.
- Cigarettes?

1270
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:13,517
- No, thanks.
- All right.

1271
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:17,288
Cute kid.
I did a magazine cover of her.

1272
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:19,958
- She's nice.
- You can't walk in like this.

1273
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:21,993
- It's absolutely forbidden.
- Susan!

1274
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,995
I don't intend to create a
scene.

1275
01:17:24,062 --> 01:17:26,097
You should be ashamed of
yourselves.

1276
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:28,599
I'm too young to be deceived by
treachery.

1277
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:29,934
- Have a drink?
- Lemonade.

1278
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:32,836
- Sit down.
- I don't intend to stay.

1279
01:17:32,903 --> 01:17:34,905
And some chocolate ice cream.

1280
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:37,141
Wonder how I found out where you
were?

1281
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,677
- What's on your mind?
- You know what's going on.

1282
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:43,147
You told me Dickie was sick,
exhausted from the picnic.

1283
01:17:43,214 --> 01:17:46,650
I went to Dickie's apartment.
They told me where he was.

1284
01:17:46,717 --> 01:17:49,153
And here I am, and here you are.

1285
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,023
I demand an explanation from
both of you.

1286
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,258
- Aren't you being childish?
- I'll be anything I want.

1287
01:17:54,325 --> 01:17:56,560
Joey will buy you and the judge
a drink.

1288
01:17:56,627 --> 01:17:59,964
I owe it to you for being so
nice to us.

1289
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:02,600
We'll be here time enough
to drink one down.

1290
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,835
Oh, garçon!

1291
01:18:04,902 --> 01:18:06,837
This party's on me. Bring
chairs.

1292
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:08,706
I don't believe we've been
acquainted.

1293
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:09,974
Susan Turner--

1294
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:12,376
Agnes and Joey.
This your daughter, judge?

1295
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:16,147
No, it's her sister. Her older
sister-- Margaret's sister.

1296
01:18:16,214 --> 01:18:18,349
- Got plenty of room, sweetheart?
- Sure.

1297
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,551
You look like mother and
daughter.

1298
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:21,885
Sisters look alike too.

1299
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,022
I hate my sister.

1300
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,203
Oh, I just love birthdays.
Birthdays are the best.

1301
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,305
Maybe Mr. Rosenheimer
can come over here.

1302
01:18:41,372 --> 01:18:43,774
No matter what you say,
I intend to wait here.

1303
01:18:43,841 --> 01:18:47,411
- Nobody said anything to you.
- Cute hat you got on.

1304
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:51,382
- I don't intend to take it off.
- I didn't ask you to.

1305
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:54,885
Bring another round of the same.
Put it on my check.

1306
01:18:54,952 --> 01:18:56,954
- Very good.
- Take these. We're not eating.

1307
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:58,556
- Just drinks.
- Oh, yeah--

1308
01:18:58,622 --> 01:19:01,725
- Hello, Jerry. Glad to see you.
- I doubt if anyone's glad.

1309
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:04,628
- You weren't invited, Mr. White.
- Meet Agnes and Joey.

1310
01:19:04,695 --> 01:19:07,931
I love kids with floppy hair.
It's so casual.

1311
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,933
Suppose you're wondering how I
got here.

1312
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,302
If she isn't, I am.

1313
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:13,304
It's getting to be quite a
party.

1314
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:16,874
- All is not gold that glitters.
- You said a mouthful. Remember--

1315
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,043
Just a minute. Just a minute!

1316
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,844
I haven't got much time left.

1317
01:19:20,911 --> 01:19:25,583
I went to see you, Susan, 'cause
I got word I'm being drafted.

1318
01:19:25,649 --> 01:19:29,187
I went to the house. You were
gone. I went to Mr. Nugent's--

1319
01:19:29,253 --> 01:19:32,890
- Yes, we know the rest of it.
- I just want to say goodbye.

1320
01:19:32,956 --> 01:19:36,694
You don't have to make a big
thing about it. The war's over.

1321
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:40,364
But guns go off by accident. A
fellow could trip on a bayonet.

1322
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:44,202
I know. Going away, not seeing
your loved ones for years.

1323
01:19:44,268 --> 01:19:46,637
You're a fine boy, Jerry,
and a good friend.

1324
01:19:46,704 --> 01:19:48,906
Possibly Mr. Nugent doesn't know
how good.

1325
01:19:48,972 --> 01:19:50,974
You don't have to tell me about
Jerry.

1326
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,910
Maybe I could tell you things.

1327
01:19:52,976 --> 01:19:55,146
How loyal he is, and how he made
sure

1328
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:57,014
you won that race this
afternoon.

1329
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:59,117
Race? Where were you this
afternoon?

1330
01:19:59,183 --> 01:20:01,619
- It doesn't concern you.
- What are you talking about?

1331
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:04,522
- You shouldn't say that.
- A woman scorned is a fury!

1332
01:20:04,588 --> 01:20:07,291
- What are you drinking, bub?
- I'll have an eggnog.

1333
01:20:07,358 --> 01:20:09,960
Just a second. Jerry--

1334
01:20:10,027 --> 01:20:11,262
Bring an eggnog.

1335
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:13,497
What do you've to do with my
winning?

1336
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:14,565
Two eggs!

1337
01:20:14,632 --> 01:20:18,536
What did you have to do
with my winning--?

1338
01:20:18,602 --> 01:20:21,239
Me? Joey, you shouldn't have
done it.

1339
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:26,009
Joey's the cutest thing.
Oh, thank you.

1340
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:28,479
Did you frame it
so I could win that race?

1341
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:31,349
He only did it because he knew
how I loved you.

1342
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:33,917
- I forbid this kind of talk.
- Life's complicated.

1343
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:35,986
- Too complicated.
- Good evening.

1344
01:20:36,053 --> 01:20:38,021
Sit down.
You're in time for cake.

1345
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:40,324
Thanks. I will.
Wondering how I got here?

1346
01:20:40,391 --> 01:20:41,692
I went to your house--

1347
01:20:41,759 --> 01:20:43,727
You went to her house, found her
gone.

1348
01:20:43,794 --> 01:20:46,430
You were suspicious
and went to my apartment.

1349
01:20:46,497 --> 01:20:48,166
You'd make a good detective.

1350
01:20:48,232 --> 01:20:50,000
- I don't like him.
- Nor do I.

1351
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:51,602
- The name is Chamberlain.
- Hello.

1352
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:54,238
- How do you do?
- Get him. "How do you do?"

1353
01:20:54,305 --> 01:20:56,240
- Know what you're doing?
- Of course.

1354
01:20:56,307 --> 01:20:58,609
- It might interest you--
- Know what you are?

1355
01:20:58,676 --> 01:21:01,279
- You're a regular Blackbeard.
- Bluebeard, dear.

1356
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:03,947
- A rose by any color.
- Everybody's excited.

1357
01:21:04,014 --> 01:21:05,749
Nobody's excited!
I want you to know.

1358
01:21:05,816 --> 01:21:09,287
Only this afternoon, he told me
he's madly in love with Susan.

1359
01:21:09,353 --> 01:21:11,155
Oh, Dickie, did you, darling?

1360
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:12,990
I did, yes. But I was only
kidding.

1361
01:21:13,056 --> 01:21:15,993
- Don't kid Susan for any reason.
- You stay out of this.

1362
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:19,730
Everybody's so unhappy. Why
don't we have a drink and cake?

1363
01:21:19,797 --> 01:21:22,566
- I don't feel like eating.
- Chamberlain, you know--

1364
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:24,902
It's too public to continue this
discussion.

1365
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:27,805
- Mister, you have my chair.
- There are other chairs.

1366
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:30,341
I realize that. I suggest you
occupy one.

1367
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:32,376
- Do you love me?
- I want my chair.

1368
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:34,245
- You're a cute child--
- I'm busy.

1369
01:21:34,312 --> 01:21:36,714
- I can't say I love you.
- I want my chair.

1370
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,550
She spent $4.50 to make sure
you won that race.

1371
01:21:39,617 --> 01:21:41,619
That's too bad.
You can have the cup!

1372
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:43,921
That victory of Nugent's was a
frame-up?

1373
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:47,658
For the last time, I want my
chair!

1374
01:21:47,725 --> 01:21:49,993
Happy anniversary, Mr. and Mrs.
Overholtz.

1375
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:53,030
Look at this. It's their
anniversary.

1376
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:54,698
Congratulations.

1377
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:56,834
It's your anniversary, my
birthday--

1378
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:00,170
I don't want any trouble.
I just want my chair back.

1379
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:02,039
- Oh, stand up.
- And for that matter--

1380
01:22:02,105 --> 01:22:05,108
Please sit down.
You can have the medal.

1381
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:07,678
What happened?
Always saying the wrong thing.

1382
01:22:07,745 --> 01:22:10,614
- Shall we fight this out?
- No. We're too excited.

1383
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:12,015
- Sit.
- Right.

1384
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:14,051
- I'm getting out of here.
- So am I.

1385
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:15,419
Now, now. Wait a minute.

1386
01:22:15,486 --> 01:22:17,488
I've had enough of this and you.

1387
01:22:17,555 --> 01:22:20,157
- You attract trouble.
- There you go, jumping again.

1388
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:22,293
Shut up!
Thank you for a lovely evening.

1389
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,795
Well, thank you. Thank you!

1390
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:27,665
If I was so disposed,
I could make trouble for you.

1391
01:22:27,731 --> 01:22:30,334
You may be a regular guy,
but I don't know.

1392
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:33,070
I hope this fixes your kettle of
fish.

1393
01:22:33,136 --> 01:22:35,406
I came to buy you a birthday
drink,

1394
01:22:35,473 --> 01:22:37,741
and you ruined my birthday. You
ruined it!

1395
01:22:37,808 --> 01:22:40,878
Joey got me a birthday cake
and you ruined everything!

1396
01:22:40,944 --> 01:22:43,814
Come on, Joey.
Let him pay for the drinks.

1397
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:47,285
I'd punch your nose if I wasn't
afraid you'd break my jaw.

1398
01:22:50,254 --> 01:22:52,990
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Mr.
Nugent.

1399
01:22:57,295 --> 01:23:01,164
Will there be anything else?

1400
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,833
For instance?

1401
01:23:07,471 --> 01:23:10,007
Well? It's your move.

1402
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:11,909
Been your move for several
minutes.

1403
01:23:11,975 --> 01:23:15,713
I was just a little concerned
about Margaret and Susan.

1404
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:17,948
They're old enough
to take care of themselves.

1405
01:23:18,015 --> 01:23:20,418
And you just made a stupid move.

1406
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:27,391
Susan.

1407
01:23:28,892 --> 01:23:30,260
Susan!

1408
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:39,169
- Why does she do that?
- I should find out what's wrong.

1409
01:23:39,236 --> 01:23:41,038
Your queen's in danger.

1410
01:23:48,245 --> 01:23:51,649
- Margaret.
- You and your psychology!

1411
01:23:57,688 --> 01:24:00,223
I will not stand for this
excitement!

1412
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,493
Your queen's still in danger.

1413
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:06,697
What's wrong?

1414
01:24:06,764 --> 01:24:08,699
A great deal. I'm talking to
Margaret.

1415
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:11,101
That's impossible unless you
break her door down.

1416
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:12,736
This is a conspiracy!

1417
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:21,211
Do you intend to finish this
game?

1418
01:24:21,278 --> 01:24:23,414
Now, Thaddeus...

1419
01:24:24,882 --> 01:24:27,250
I can't stand it. I've gotta
talk to Susan!

1420
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,487
It's late. Come back in the
morning.

1421
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:32,423
This is a fine way to treat a
veteran!

1422
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:41,465
Thaddeus, you're old enough
to control yourself.

1423
01:24:47,705 --> 01:24:50,708
- Margaret, I wanna talk to you.
- You keep out of this!

1424
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:01,251
If you're leaving, you might
take something more than a doll.

1425
01:25:01,318 --> 01:25:03,554
- I hate you.
- Susan, you can't mean that.

1426
01:25:03,621 --> 01:25:06,289
I do. My own sister,
stealing the man I love.

1427
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,659
- You're not being fair.
- The other woman.

1428
01:25:08,726 --> 01:25:10,828
It's not like that at all.

1429
01:25:10,894 --> 01:25:13,897
Why not send me to prison,
get me out of the way?

1430
01:25:13,964 --> 01:25:16,366
I'm old enough to fight for my
own happiness.

1431
01:25:16,434 --> 01:25:18,669
Anyway, I saw him first!

1432
01:25:20,604 --> 01:25:23,507
I couldn't help overhearing.
I had my ear to the door.

1433
01:25:23,574 --> 01:25:26,243
This is your fault.
You created this situation.

1434
01:25:26,309 --> 01:25:28,546
You told Susan to come to that
nightclub.

1435
01:25:28,612 --> 01:25:29,880
Calm down. Be sensible.

1436
01:25:29,947 --> 01:25:32,750
Did I or did I not
send you to find Margaret?

1437
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:35,853
- You didn't. It was my own idea.
- That's beside the point.

1438
01:25:35,919 --> 01:25:40,891
I didn't send Tommy or Jerry,
and you're both hysterical.

1439
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,561
Will you go to your room?
Lemme talk to Susan.

1440
01:25:43,627 --> 01:25:45,228
I have nothing to say to anyone.

1441
01:25:45,295 --> 01:25:48,999
I will not make a statement of
any kind at this time.

1442
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:52,436
Unpack those clothes and hang
them up.

1443
01:25:52,503 --> 01:25:54,672
I'm strong enough to take you
over my knee

1444
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,374
and give you the spanking you
deserve.

1445
01:25:57,441 --> 01:25:58,576
You wouldn't dare.

1446
01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:00,611
I have no intention, however, of
doing so

1447
01:26:00,678 --> 01:26:03,380
if you'll be sensible. Now, sit
down.

1448
01:26:03,447 --> 01:26:05,716
Sit down!

1449
01:26:05,783 --> 01:26:09,086
I think your infatuation for Mr.
Nugent is a childish one...

1450
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:12,590
...and you've been unfair to Mr.
Nugent, Margaret and to Jerry.

1451
01:26:12,656 --> 01:26:15,225
You're going to get sensible
about the matter.

1452
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:18,696
- I am.
- You are?

1453
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:20,498
You're going to listen to me.

1454
01:26:20,564 --> 01:26:23,133
And you're going to do
just as I tell you.

1455
01:26:26,737 --> 01:26:29,640
- Margaret?
- Come in, dear.

1456
01:26:34,712 --> 01:26:37,380
I've just had a long talk with
Uncle Matt.

1457
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:38,549
Yes.

1458
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:41,351
And I see things much more
clearly.

1459
01:26:41,418 --> 01:26:44,154
After all, Richard is too old
for me.

1460
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:46,924
When I'm 42, he'll be 60.

1461
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:50,193
Jerry's going to look handsome
in his uniform, don't you think?

1462
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:51,495
I think.

1463
01:26:51,562 --> 01:26:54,331
I've decided to renounce Richard
for Jerry.

1464
01:26:54,397 --> 01:26:55,666
That's very sensible of you.

1465
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:57,901
Now that you have a clear field
with Richard

1466
01:26:57,968 --> 01:27:00,671
I think you ought to patch
things up.

1467
01:27:00,738 --> 01:27:04,742
I've acted very childishly,
and I'm sorry, really sorry.

1468
01:27:06,644 --> 01:27:08,378
If I had a million sisters,

1469
01:27:08,445 --> 01:27:11,081
I'd want them all to be exactly
like you.

1470
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:13,483
You're saying that because I'm
sklonklish.

1471
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:14,752
Because you're smart.

1472
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:17,187
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

1473
01:27:19,122 --> 01:27:21,491
You know, in many ways...

1474
01:27:21,559 --> 01:27:24,127
...I think this has made
a bigger woman of me.

1475
01:27:34,271 --> 01:27:37,975
I'm not interested in any of
your psychological mumbo-jumbo.

1476
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:40,043
But you're being too cold about
this.

1477
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:42,479
Look at it from the emotional
point of view.

1478
01:27:42,546 --> 01:27:44,815
I don't deal in emotions, but in
facts.

1479
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:47,217
And the conclusions I draw are
depressing.

1480
01:27:47,284 --> 01:27:50,621
Well, depressing or not, you're
in love with Richard Nugent.

1481
01:27:50,688 --> 01:27:53,090
I'm quite weary,
and I want to go to sleep.

1482
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:55,525
I'll discuss this with you in
the morning.

1483
01:27:55,593 --> 01:27:57,227
Good night.

1484
01:27:57,294 --> 01:27:59,296
Very well.

1485
01:27:59,362 --> 01:28:02,432
I thank you for one thing,
straightening Susan out.

1486
01:28:02,499 --> 01:28:04,201
It's perfectly all right.

1487
01:28:04,267 --> 01:28:06,003
- Good night.
- Good night.

1488
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:27,791
- Hi.
- How did you get in?

1489
01:28:27,858 --> 01:28:30,260
Door was closed. I opened it
and came in.

1490
01:28:30,327 --> 01:28:31,762
Open it. Go out.

1491
01:28:31,829 --> 01:28:33,229
You and Margaret are having
trouble.

1492
01:28:33,263 --> 01:28:35,666
- None of your business.
- In a way, it is.

1493
01:28:35,733 --> 01:28:37,701
Don't forget, I started this
whole thing.

1494
01:28:37,768 --> 01:28:39,703
- I won't.
- Where are you going?

1495
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:42,039
- Africa.
- That's far away, isn't it?

1496
01:28:42,105 --> 01:28:45,108
It all depends. If you're in
Arabia, which is where I'll be

1497
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:48,178
before going to Africa, you're
pretty close.

1498
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:51,381
All right. But you're making a
mistake.

1499
01:28:51,448 --> 01:28:52,916
You can't run away from
yourself.

1500
01:28:52,983 --> 01:28:55,152
The trouble is you're in love
with Margaret.

1501
01:28:55,218 --> 01:28:58,021
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Look at the facts. First--

1502
01:28:58,088 --> 01:29:00,290
Facts. I'm an artist. I deal in
emotions.

1503
01:29:00,357 --> 01:29:04,461
My emotions say get out of here.
What do your emotions tell you?

1504
01:29:04,527 --> 01:29:07,397
- Fine.
- All right.

1505
01:29:07,464 --> 01:29:08,799
But I've got a plan.

1506
01:29:08,866 --> 01:29:11,168
I've had enough of your plans
and your family.

1507
01:29:11,234 --> 01:29:13,403
I was carefree before I met all
of you.

1508
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:17,307
I've been in trouble ever since.
I'm going to be carefree again.

1509
01:29:17,374 --> 01:29:20,110
- Now, buzz off.
- All right.

1510
01:29:20,177 --> 01:29:23,246
If you run across Professor
Smedley in Johannesburg...

1511
01:29:23,313 --> 01:29:24,614
...give him my regards.

1512
01:29:24,682 --> 01:29:27,718
He's a cousin of ours. Just a
fifth cousin.

1513
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,824
Beautiful morning, simply
beautiful.

1514
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:35,859
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1515
01:29:35,926 --> 01:29:38,696
Wonderful weather for flying.

1516
01:29:38,762 --> 01:29:40,397
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1517
01:29:40,463 --> 01:29:43,867
Thing is, it'll give you a
chance to relax for a few days.

1518
01:29:43,934 --> 01:29:47,270
Uncle Matt, I think I'd better--
You better take me home.

1519
01:29:47,337 --> 01:29:48,906
Oh, well, that's ridiculous.

1520
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:51,608
I think it's ridiculous I'm
packing up for three days,

1521
01:29:51,675 --> 01:29:52,743
running away...

1522
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,544
...because of a very silly man.

1523
01:29:54,611 --> 01:29:57,347
Well, darling,
let bygones be bygones.

1524
01:29:57,414 --> 01:30:00,918
And if by chance your paths
should ever happen to cross...

1525
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:04,054
- ...well, that's another thing.
- They better not cross.

1526
01:30:04,121 --> 01:30:07,257
For the time being, you just
do what Uncle Matt tells you.

1527
01:30:07,324 --> 01:30:09,860
Last few weeks,
you haven't been doing so good.

1528
01:30:09,927 --> 01:30:12,896
This morning, I talked you into
taking a plane trip.

1529
01:30:12,963 --> 01:30:15,432
You could talk the devil
into going to church.

1530
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:32,549
- Keys, please.
- Be right with you.

1531
01:30:32,615 --> 01:30:36,586
Go ahead, dear, I'll take care
of the baggage and the tickets.

1532
01:30:36,653 --> 01:30:37,988
Attention, please.

1533
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:40,090
Porter wanted at the main
information booth.

1534
01:30:40,157 --> 01:30:43,560
I'm sorry, but I'm sure we can
get you on the next flight.

1535
01:30:43,626 --> 01:30:44,795
Thanks.

1536
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:46,496
Judge Turner's reservation,
please.

1537
01:30:46,563 --> 01:30:48,165
All right, sir.

1538
01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:50,868
Thank Mr. Martin for arranging
this.

1539
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:53,103
It was an emergency. I do
appreciate it.

1540
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:55,505
Thank you.

1541
01:30:55,572 --> 01:30:56,840
Beemish, where's Margaret?

1542
01:30:56,907 --> 01:30:59,042
I don't know. I'm looking for
her now.

1543
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:00,911
- You know she's leaving?
- Oh, yes.

1544
01:31:00,978 --> 01:31:04,114
It's Nugent's fault. I see him,
he'll get 10 years.

1545
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:05,883
I got a warrant for his arrest.

1546
01:31:05,949 --> 01:31:08,585
- If you take my advice--
- I don't want your advice.

1547
01:31:08,651 --> 01:31:09,820
Now, where's Margaret?

1548
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:12,189
Well, I don't know. She should
be here.

1549
01:31:12,255 --> 01:31:14,825
You watch that entrance,
and I'll watch here.

1550
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:16,659
Let me know the instant she
arrives.

1551
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:18,261
Sure, sure.

1552
01:31:26,636 --> 01:31:28,571
So long, Jebby. Thanks.

1553
01:31:28,638 --> 01:31:32,575
Have fun. Stay out of jail.

1554
01:31:32,642 --> 01:31:34,177
Well, here you are, darling.

1555
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:36,679
Maybe I ought to have second
thoughts about this.

1556
01:31:36,746 --> 01:31:40,283
Don't start that again. You just
go away and have a good time.

1557
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:42,786
I'm sorry I can't wait to see
you off,

1558
01:31:42,853 --> 01:31:45,222
but I have to get back to the
office.

1559
01:31:45,288 --> 01:31:46,556
Thanks, Uncle Matt.

1560
01:31:46,623 --> 01:31:48,792
I don't know what for, but
thanks.

1561
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:51,328
You're welcome. Happy landing.

1562
01:31:51,394 --> 01:31:53,030
Bye.

1563
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:57,167
TWA's Constellation, flight 60,
Super Sky

1564
01:31:57,234 --> 01:31:59,402
Chief is ready for immediate
departure.

1565
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:01,104
Passengers will board the
flight to...

1566
01:32:01,171 --> 01:32:03,941
I'm Dr. Matthew Beemish.
I'm the city psychiatrist.

1567
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:05,242
I'm glad to know you.

1568
01:32:05,308 --> 01:32:07,777
I'm observing a patient. I need
your help.

1569
01:32:07,845 --> 01:32:09,079
Who is he?

1570
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:12,249
That blond fellow with
the brown suit and hat.

1571
01:32:12,315 --> 01:32:14,784
He's harmless, but he might
create a scene.

1572
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:16,186
What's his trouble?

1573
01:32:16,253 --> 01:32:18,922
He thinks he's
the assistant district attorney.

1574
01:32:18,989 --> 01:32:21,158
He goes around arresting people.

1575
01:32:21,224 --> 01:32:23,093
Oh, poor guy.

1576
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,963
You'd think he'd at least
want to be a desk sergeant.

1577
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:29,232
I'll try to handle him.
I wanted you to know, in case.

1578
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:30,433
I'll be around.

1579
01:32:32,936 --> 01:32:35,238
- Have you seen Margaret?
- No, I haven't yet.

1580
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:39,109
- I want to tell you a story.
- I don't want to hear any story.

1581
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:44,214
- Nugent! Let's get him!
- Wait. You're making a mistake.

1582
01:32:44,281 --> 01:32:46,449
- I'm not.
- You're sure about this?

1583
01:32:46,516 --> 01:32:47,817
It will give me pleasure

1584
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:50,487
to put him where he belongs.
Officer.

1585
01:32:50,553 --> 01:32:52,155
I want you to arrest someone.

1586
01:32:52,222 --> 01:32:53,891
You don't want to arrest people.

1587
01:32:53,957 --> 01:32:56,659
- What?
- Be a good boy and go on home.

1588
01:32:56,726 --> 01:32:59,296
I'm the assistant district
attorney.

1589
01:32:59,362 --> 01:33:02,065
- Sure you are.
- Tell him who I am.

1590
01:33:02,132 --> 01:33:03,867
He is the assistant district
attorney.

1591
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:05,869
Now, ain't that nice?

1592
01:33:05,936 --> 01:33:07,871
You blockhead. I'll do it
myself.

1593
01:33:07,938 --> 01:33:10,073
- You don't wanna bother anybody.
- Having trouble?

1594
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,875
I'm the assistant district
attorney.

1595
01:33:11,942 --> 01:33:14,744
Sure he is. Now, just take it
easy. Relax.

1596
01:33:14,811 --> 01:33:17,214
We'll make you district attorney
in charge

1597
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,216
of the assistant district
attorneys.

1598
01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:21,751
I'll report you. Get their
numbers.

1599
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:23,887
- I'll get a pencil, be back.
- Come on.

1600
01:33:23,954 --> 01:33:25,422
I'm the assistant district
attorney!

1601
01:33:25,488 --> 01:33:28,058
Wait! Where you taking me?
Leave me alone.

1602
01:33:42,472 --> 01:33:45,308
- Thank you, sir.
- Margaret Turner.

1603
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,411
- Nugent, Richard.
- Thank you, sir.

1604
01:34:02,059 --> 01:34:03,994
You remind me of a man.

1605
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:06,263
- What man?
- A man with the power.

1606
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:08,665
- What power?
- The power of hoodoo.

1607
01:34:08,731 --> 01:34:09,832
- Hoodoo?
- You do.

1608
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:11,935
- Do what?
- Remind me of a man.

1609
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:13,770
- What man?
- A man with the power.

1610
01:34:13,836 --> 01:34:15,338
What power?

1611
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:17,507
Give up?

1612
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:19,276
Give up. Let's go.
