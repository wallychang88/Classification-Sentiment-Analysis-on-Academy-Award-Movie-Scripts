bury the two of them deep,

on a man's head.

I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,868
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164

I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,572
I truly have killed him,

166

at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167

it's a flesh for cash business.

He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

And he walks through hellfire...

627

with a soft bed,

them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

when you granted me an audience,

922
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1018

You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1019

it would be good if I could have

with my confidant.

what the hell you doing?

on her back and speaks German.

01:44:13,977 --> 01:44:16,071
CALVIN: Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1358
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:18,220
STEPHEN: Hm!
It's like a pool of black tar.

1359
01:44:18,398 --> 01:44:20,014
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1360
01:44:20,191 --> 01:44:23,161
Yessir, you stuck. (LAUGHS)

1361
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:24,855
LARA LEE: I don't know, doctor.

1362
01:44:25,029 --> 01:44:27,282
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1363
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:31,954
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1364
01:44:33,079 --> 01:44:34,194
(LARA LEE GIGGLES)

1365
01:44:34,372 --> 01:44:36,841
Well, naturally.

1366
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,630
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1367
01:44:40,795 --> 01:44:43,594
not the plucked chicken.
(ALL CHUCKLE)

1368
01:44:43,756 --> 01:44:46,248
CALVIN: Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1369
01:44:46,426 --> 01:44:48,349
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1370
01:44:48,511 --> 01:44:49,696
CORA: You got to clean these dishes,

1371
01:44:49,721 --> 01:44:51,882
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1372
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,109
You know that nigger, don't you?

1373
01:44:55,018 --> 01:44:56,304
Who?
"Who?"

1374
01:44:56,477 --> 01:44:59,572
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1375
01:45:01,316 --> 01:45:03,307
At the table?

1376
01:45:03,484 --> 01:45:04,736
I don't know him.

1377
01:45:04,903 --> 01:45:07,941
You don't know him.
No.

1378
01:45:08,114 --> 01:45:10,947
"No," what?
No, sir.

1379
01:45:13,036 --> 01:45:14,117
(CHUCKLES)

1380
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:18,049
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1381
01:45:22,253 --> 01:45:23,459
OK.

1382
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:27,843
Yeah. If you say so.

1383
01:45:34,307 --> 01:45:37,732
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1384
01:45:39,103 --> 01:45:44,280
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1385
01:45:44,442 --> 01:45:46,786
What would your price be?

1386
01:45:46,945 --> 01:45:48,902
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1387
01:45:49,072 --> 01:45:52,531
and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1388
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:56,736
9,000. Maybe.

1389
01:45:57,997 --> 01:46:03,800
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1390
01:46:03,962 --> 01:46:06,124
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1391
01:46:06,297 --> 01:46:07,253
Sure wasn't.

1392
01:46:07,423 --> 01:46:09,130
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1393
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,462
Sure was.
Now, that $9,000 figure

1394
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:14,197
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1395
01:46:14,222 --> 01:46:15,942
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1396
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:18,985
I could do so any day of the week.
Any day.

1397
01:46:19,143 --> 01:46:23,387
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1398
01:46:24,023 --> 01:46:28,028
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1399
01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:31,027
that made me even consider it.
Hm-mm.

1400
01:46:35,702 --> 01:46:39,036
(DEEP INHALE)

1401
01:46:39,205 --> 01:46:43,301
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1402
01:46:43,459 --> 01:46:44,745
(CHUCKLES)

1403
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:49,625
(SLAMMING TABLE) Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1404
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:53,133
Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
(BANGING TABLE) Hooray, doctor.

1405
01:46:53,302 --> 01:46:55,430
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1406
01:46:55,596 --> 01:46:59,146
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1407
01:46:59,308 --> 01:47:02,471
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1408
01:47:02,645 --> 01:47:04,443
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1409
01:47:04,605 --> 01:47:07,700
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1410
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:10,897
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1411
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,060
Hm-mm.

1412
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:13,911
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1413
01:47:14,073 --> 01:47:16,690
by a physician of my choosing.
CALVIN: Naturally.

1414
01:47:16,868 --> 01:47:21,590
So, say I return in about...

1415
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,037
five days time.
Five days?

1416
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,462
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1417
01:47:27,628 --> 01:47:29,676
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1418
01:47:29,839 --> 01:47:32,809
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1419
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:36,672
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1420

1421
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:41,590
may I propose a toast.

1422
01:47:43,978 --> 01:47:48,848
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1423
01:47:49,025 --> 01:47:51,699
(ALL CHUCKLING)
To The Black Hercules.

1425
01:47:53,404 --> 01:47:54,815
(SPEAKS LOW)
To The Black Hercules.

1426
01:47:54,989 --> 01:47:58,835
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. (CHUCKLES)

1427
01:47:58,993 --> 01:48:00,404
Hm.

1428
01:48:00,578 --> 01:48:03,821
Hildi, top my drink off.

1429
01:48:06,918 --> 01:48:11,970
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1430
01:48:12,131 --> 01:48:15,351
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1431
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:18,252
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
Hm-mm.

1432
01:48:18,429 --> 01:48:21,171
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1433
01:48:21,349 --> 01:48:22,692
through a bramble bush.

1434
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:25,971
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1435
01:48:26,104 --> 01:48:27,830
huh, sugar bear?
Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1436
01:48:27,855 --> 01:48:29,027
Sure do.
Like Samson? Huh?

1437
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,658
HILDI: No, sir.

1438
01:48:30,817 --> 01:48:32,160
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1439
01:48:32,318 --> 01:48:35,982
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1440
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:39,398
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1441
01:48:39,575 --> 01:48:41,703
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1442
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:44,907
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1443
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:46,822
No, we just talked and...

1444
01:48:46,999 --> 01:48:49,377
CALVIN: Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1445
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:51,342
I haven't...
No, no, no, no.

1446
01:48:51,504 --> 01:48:53,552
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1447
01:48:53,714 --> 01:48:56,809
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1448
01:48:56,968 --> 01:48:58,925
Go on.
LARA LEE: Uh, Calvin.

1449
01:48:59,095 --> 01:49:01,473
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1450
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:04,552
CALVIN: But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1451
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:07,729
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1452
01:49:07,895 --> 01:49:10,478
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1453
01:49:10,648 --> 01:49:14,232
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1454
01:49:14,402 --> 01:49:16,564
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1455
01:49:16,737 --> 01:49:18,737
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1456
01:49:18,865 --> 01:49:20,091
STEPHEN: Sure would.
CALVIN: Look at that, doctor.

1457
01:49:20,116 --> 01:49:22,369
It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
Calvin!

look at her whipped up back.

01:49:50,897 --> 01:49:53,366
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

Come on in here.

01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:05,154
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1468
01:50:05,328 --> 01:50:07,285
You say you ain't know him.

1469
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:09,495
Huh?

1470
01:50:09,665 --> 01:50:15,263
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1471
01:50:16,422 --> 01:50:19,790
I don't.
Yes, you do.

1472
01:50:21,969 --> 01:50:23,585
Mr. Stephen...

1473
01:50:24,597 --> 01:50:25,587
I don't.

1474
01:50:25,765 --> 01:50:28,257
Why is you lying to me?

1475
01:50:30,645 --> 01:50:31,988
I ain't.

1476
01:50:32,146 --> 01:50:34,638
Then why is you crying?

1477
01:50:34,815 --> 01:50:36,977
You scarin' me.

1478
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:41,065
Why is I'm scaring you?
Because you scary.

1479
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,835
SCHULTZ: To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1480
01:50:45,993 --> 01:50:49,122
was positively soul-enriching.

1481
01:50:49,288 --> 01:50:52,167
CALVIN: Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1482
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:55,166
You stay right here.

1483
01:51:00,508 --> 01:51:05,014
SCHULTZ: You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1484
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:08,012
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1485
01:51:10,017 --> 01:51:15,979
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1486
01:51:16,148 --> 01:51:17,525
I'm all ears.

1487
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:19,399
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1488
01:51:20,027 --> 01:51:21,620
Monsieur Candie...
CALVIN: Stephen!

1489
01:51:22,655 --> 01:51:25,124
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1490
01:51:26,242 --> 01:51:28,370
STEPHEN: I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1491
01:51:28,536 --> 01:51:31,244
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1492
01:51:31,414 --> 01:51:32,529
Excuse him.

1493
01:51:32,707 --> 01:51:36,462
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1494
01:51:36,627 --> 01:51:38,550
You mean get up out of my chair?

1495
01:51:38,713 --> 01:51:42,047
If you could manage it.
Why?

1496
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:46,062
It's about dessert.
What about dessert?

1497
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,837
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1498
01:51:49,015 --> 01:51:50,881
We're having white cake!

1499
01:51:51,058 --> 01:51:53,402
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1500
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:57,896
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1501

(WHISPERS) Meet me in the library.

1502
01:52:00,026 --> 01:52:03,121
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1503
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:05,145
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1504
01:52:05,323 --> 01:52:10,318
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1505

Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1507
01:52:16,417 --> 01:52:18,258
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1508
01:52:18,336 --> 01:52:21,966
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

Get! Hurry up, girl.

1513
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:45,148
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

ain't hereto buy no Mandingos.

are you talking about? Hm?

1520
01:53:13,391 --> 01:53:16,554
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1521
01:53:16,727 --> 01:53:20,391
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1522
01:53:20,564 --> 01:53:22,726
They here for that girl.

1523
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,517
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1524
01:53:25,694 --> 01:53:29,324
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1525
01:53:31,033 --> 01:53:32,626
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1526
01:53:32,785 --> 01:53:35,163
Did he give you any money?
No! Not yet. But...

1527
01:53:35,329 --> 01:53:37,798
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1528
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,210
But he's just about to buy

1529
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:43,596
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1530
01:53:43,754 --> 01:53:46,758
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1531
01:53:52,179 --> 01:53:54,170
Where you gettin' all this?

1532
01:53:55,307 --> 01:53:57,243
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1533
01:53:57,268 --> 01:53:59,760
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1534
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:04,238
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1535
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,232
She probably his wife.

1536
01:54:06,402 --> 01:54:09,201
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1537
01:54:09,363 --> 01:54:12,458
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1538
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:16,992
If she's who they want...

1539
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,881
why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1540
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:25,535
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1541
01:54:25,713 --> 01:54:31,186
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1542
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,561
Yes, it did.

1543
01:54:38,893 --> 01:54:40,509
His Wife, huh?

1544
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:48,119
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1545
01:54:48,277 --> 01:54:49,688
(CHUCKLES)

1546
01:54:51,405 --> 01:54:53,396

1548
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,630
Sons of bitches!

1549
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:09,041
Out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1550
01:55:10,299 --> 01:55:11,767
Oh, there you are.

1551
01:55:11,926 --> 01:55:14,725
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1552
01:55:14,887 --> 01:55:16,355
(ALL CHUCKLING)

1553
01:55:16,514 --> 01:55:18,676
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1554
01:55:18,849 --> 01:55:21,944
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1555
01:55:22,102 --> 01:55:25,140
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1556
01:55:25,314 --> 01:55:26,540
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1557
01:55:26,565 --> 01:55:30,445
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1558
01:55:30,611 --> 01:55:32,864
Of course, brother.
Thank you, darling.

1559
01:55:46,126 --> 01:55:49,847
Yeah. Business never sleeps.
Hm-mm.

1560
01:55:51,882 --> 01:55:54,795
Apropos, before your exit,

1561
01:55:54,969 --> 01:55:58,974
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1562
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:02,052
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1563
01:56:02,226 --> 01:56:04,354
And we will again. In a moment.

1564
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:22,876
Who's your little friend?

1565
01:56:25,249 --> 01:56:26,296
(CLEARING THROAT)

1566
01:56:27,835 --> 01:56:29,337
This is Ben.

1567
01:56:30,671 --> 01:56:35,666
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1568
01:56:35,843 --> 01:56:38,255
And I do mean a long damn time.

1569
01:56:39,346 --> 01:56:43,101
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1570
01:56:43,976 --> 01:56:46,024
and my daddy's daddy.

1571
01:56:46,186 --> 01:56:48,769
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1572
01:56:51,609 --> 01:56:53,282
Old Ben took care of me.

1573
01:56:55,863 --> 01:56:59,652
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1574
01:56:59,825 --> 01:57:05,696
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1575
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:12,624
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1576
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:17,670
surrounded by black faces.

1577
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,064
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1578
01:57:29,104 --> 01:57:31,573
Why don't they kill us?
(LAUGHS)

1579
01:57:34,568 --> 01:57:39,745
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1580
01:57:39,907 --> 01:57:44,834
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1581
01:57:44,995 --> 01:57:50,115
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1582
01:57:50,292 --> 01:57:53,717
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1583
01:57:56,256 --> 01:57:57,758
But he never did.

1584
01:57:59,635 --> 01:58:00,921
Why not?

1585
01:58:02,304 --> 01:58:07,094
You see, the science of phrenology

1586
01:58:07,267 --> 01:58:12,353
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1587
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:17,912
In the skull of the African here,

1588
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:20,198
the area associated
with submissiveness

1589
01:58:20,364 --> 01:58:25,871
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1590
01:58:26,954 --> 01:58:28,627
(SAWING)

1591
01:58:41,385 --> 01:58:43,342
If you examine...

1592
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,884
this piece of skull here...

1593
01:58:53,188 --> 01:58:56,772
you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1594
01:59:00,362 --> 01:59:04,083
Here, here and here.

1595
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:05,493
Now...

1596
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:10,654
if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1597
01:59:10,831 --> 01:59:13,323
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1598
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,834
most associated with... creativity.

1599
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,336
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1600
01:59:19,965 --> 01:59:22,093
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1601
01:59:22,259 --> 01:59:24,546
unburdened by genius,

1602
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:28,896
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1603
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:31,360
servility.

1604
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,093
Now, Bright Boy...

1605
01:59:35,022 --> 01:59:37,184
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1606
01:59:39,651 --> 01:59:41,745
But if I took this hammer here...

1607
01:59:43,864 --> 01:59:46,208
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1608
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:52,549
you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1609
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:55,259
as Old Ben.

1610
01:59:56,376 --> 01:59:59,960
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1611
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,100
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1612
02:00:03,258 --> 02:00:06,501
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1613
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:10,725
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1614
02:00:10,891 --> 02:00:13,235
but that you can believe!

1615
02:00:13,393 --> 02:00:16,192
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1616
02:00:16,355 --> 02:00:18,733
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1617
02:00:23,445 --> 02:00:25,857
Thank you ever so much.
Doctor.

1618
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,787

1620
02:00:41,672 --> 02:00:43,174
Ah, yes.

1621
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:46,082
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1622
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,729
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1623
02:00:48,887 --> 02:00:50,264
Am I right?

1624
02:00:54,268 --> 02:00:55,611
Right.

1625

1631

you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1632
02:01:20,627 --> 02:01:24,962
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1633
02:01:25,132 --> 02:01:28,170
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1634
02:01:28,343 --> 02:01:32,314
To which you said, "$12,000."

1635
02:01:33,098 --> 02:01:34,839
(YELLS)
Now, considering y'all

1636
02:01:35,017 --> 02:01:36,974
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1637
02:01:37,144 --> 02:01:41,115
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1638
02:01:41,273 --> 02:01:43,685
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1639
02:01:43,859 --> 02:01:49,821
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1640
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:53,745
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1641
02:01:53,911 --> 02:01:59,543
the price is $12,000.

1642
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:03,497
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1643
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:07,292
Yes, I do, doctor.

1644
02:02:08,133 --> 02:02:11,137
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1645
02:02:11,303 --> 02:02:14,853
Broomhilda here is my property.

1646
02:02:15,015 --> 02:02:20,135
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1647
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:23,516
And if y'all think my price...

1648
02:02:24,191 --> 02:02:26,899
for this nigger here
is too steep...

1649
02:02:27,069 --> 02:02:30,528

what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1650
02:02:34,451 --> 02:02:37,580
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1651

Right in front of both y'all!
Easy, big fella.

1652
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:44,546
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1653
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:48,887

Dumas would make of all this.

1688
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:44,000
Come again?

1689
02:06:47,078 --> 02:06:51,117
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

1690
02:06:51,291 --> 02:06:52,964
Yes, of course, doctor.

1691
02:06:53,126 --> 02:06:54,662
I figured you must be an admirer.

1692
02:06:54,836 --> 02:06:59,262
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1693
02:06:59,424 --> 02:07:03,145
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1694
02:07:03,303 --> 02:07:05,260
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1695
02:07:07,307 --> 02:07:09,139
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1696
02:07:11,353 --> 02:07:16,530
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1697
02:07:18,818 --> 02:07:20,616
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1698
02:07:22,489 --> 02:07:24,708
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1699
02:07:28,536 --> 02:07:31,335
Are these Broomhilda's papers?
Yes, they are.

1700
02:07:31,498 --> 02:07:33,171
May I?
Of course.

1701
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:34,710
Thank you.

1702
02:07:36,836 --> 02:07:39,806
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1703
02:07:39,965 --> 02:07:42,127

her freedom papers, doctor.

1704
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:44,519
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1705
02:07:45,762 --> 02:07:48,675
Right over there on that little table.

1710

normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1711
02:08:41,526 --> 02:08:45,986
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1712
02:08:46,156 --> 02:08:48,500
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1713
02:08:48,658 --> 02:08:53,323
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

One more moment, doctor!

1717
02:09:06,676 --> 02:09:07,723
What?

1718
02:09:12,432 --> 02:09:14,560
It's a custom here in the South...

1719
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:20,442
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1720
02:09:21,274 --> 02:09:23,322

But you are...

1723
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:32,779
So I'm afraid I must insist.
Insist?

1724
02:09:32,952 --> 02:09:34,943
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1725

I must insist in the opposite direction.
