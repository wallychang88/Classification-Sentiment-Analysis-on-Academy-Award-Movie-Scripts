There's no question about it.

345
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:20,758
I'll keep names out of it until we get
some answers or hit a dead end.

346
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:26,216
You know how the press is when they get
ahold of a murder story, even 40 years old.

347
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:30,645
Yeah, yeah. They can do a number on you.

348
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,188
I remember...

349
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:39,931
...Charlie Wade come
to my father's hardware store once.

350
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,731
I was just a little boy.

351
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:45,223
I'd heard stories
about how he shot this one...

352
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,274
...how he shot that one.

353
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,480
The man winked at me.

354
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:53,063
I peed my pants.

355
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:55,817
Winked at me.

356
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:01,736

a bloody conflict for dozens of years...

357

358

361

362
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:23,705
The war between Mexico
and the anglo forces ends...

363
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:25,621
...in 1836...

364
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:30,005
<i>...with the formation</i>

The Confederacy is beaten...

is marked by range wars...

370
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:52,006

We found a body out
by Fort McKenzie yesterday.

386
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,166
It'd been there a long time.

387
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,658
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

388
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:57,628
You recall if Charlie Wade was a Mason?

389
00:27:58,506 --> 00:27:59,501
Charlie?

390
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:03,623
I believe he used to go for Lodge meetings
over to Laredo.

391
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:07,593
What's Charlie Wade got to do
with your body?

392
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,385
All he was wearing was
a big old Masonic ring...

393
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:13,670
...and a Rio County sheriff's badge.

394
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,218
You remember anything else
from the last night you saw him?

395
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,060
I told the story enough times.

396
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:32,521
We were in the car. He was stewing about
his fight with Buddy as we drove over...

He owned the colored roadhouse

He's still living?

401
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:40,854
No.

402
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:45,778
I think his widow's still in their place
in Darktown, though.

403
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:49,898
You think it was Charlie Wade, huh?

404
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:52,777
Forensics people are sure of it.

405
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,700
You got any idea
who might have put him there?

406
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,116
Besides my father, I mean.

407
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:04,819
There's no call for that, Sam.

408
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,537
Wade made himself a pile of enemies
over the years.

SAM: Buddy was one of them.

Some crop needed picking
and the man was short-handed.

518
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:51,891
As I remember, it was 'cause
he had a sassy mouth on him.

519
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,520
<i>Must run in the family.

520
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,267
You wouldn't be running numbers
out of this club?

521
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:01,438
Running numbers is illegal, sir.

522
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,936
Running numbers without I knowin'
about it is both illegal and unhealthy.

523
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,728
You remember that.

524
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,652
<i>Son, you're not finished.

525
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,018
Pour his.

526
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,113
I prefer it in the bottle.

527
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:16,573
WADE: Shut up, Hollis.

528
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:24,610
How come you don't look familiar?

529
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:27,200
I've been away, up in Houston.

530
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,068
Houston?

531
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,867
I hear they let you boys run wild up there.

532
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:34,413
WADE: Look what you've done now.

533
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:37,078
Better get something to wipe it up, son.

534
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:44,205
You spilled it.
Maybe you should wipe it up.

535
00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:56,377
I told you to do something. Will you hop
to it or will we have a problem?

536
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:02,838
You don't want to turn tail
in front of your people?

537
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,303
I understand.

538
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,714
Come on, Houston, give it a try.

539
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:12,469
WADE: Come to Papa.

540
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,131
RODERICK: Don't mind him.

541
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:19,973
He's a bit slow, is all.
He don't mean nothing by it.

542
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,723
That the problem, son?

543
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,052
You slow?

544
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:25,810
RODERICK: Otis!

545
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:28,232
Apologize to the sheriff.

546
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,400
Sheriff, you got him too scared to peep.

547
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,226
Maybe if you'd put that gun up.

548
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,229
You telling me what to do?

549
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,110
No, Sheriff, I'm just....

550
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,897
Is that whisky in them glasses?

551
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:47,233
I'll have to cite you
for violation of a state law.

552
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:50,231
This is a club, Sheriff. You've been here.

553
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,327
You people better clear out of here now!

554
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,204
Learn how to act your place, son.

555
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,375
This isn't Houston.

556
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:14,534
'Course, I was young...

557
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:17,537
...and full of beans back then.

558
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:22,959
I didn't understand the spot
I was putting Roderick in.

559
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:32,297
And that was the last time you saw him?

560
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,681
I think he came in one more time...

561
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,800
...with Hollis and....

562
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,596
No, no, your daddy wasn't with him.

563
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:45,008
Made their monthly pickup.

564
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:50,221
Roderick wasn't in, so I kept my mouth
shut and handed over that envelope.

565
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,271
That was the night he disappeared?

566
00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:57,060
Could have been.

567
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:06,058
You own a gun?

568
00:39:07,237 --> 00:39:08,150
Back then?

569
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:10,150
OTIS: No.

570
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:12,693
How about Roderick?

571
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:14,811
Oh, he kept...

572
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:20,735
...a big old piece back behind the bar,
just so folks knew it was there.

573
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,735
I don't keep one here now.

574
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:26,326
Don't much care for them.

575
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:29,947
And when my father was sheriff?

576
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:31,445
OTIS: What about him?

577
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,282
What was your deal with him?

578
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,295
Buddy was more part of the big picture:

579
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,751
County political machine...

580
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:49,132
...Chamber of Commerce, zoning Board....

581
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:54,629
If I kept those people happy,
he was pretty much on my side.

582
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:59,966
When somebody thought of starting up
a new bar for the black folks, they'd be....

583
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,755
How should I say this?

584
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:06,635
They'd be officially discouraged.

585
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,341
He ever accept cash for a favor?

586
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:21,679
I don't recall a prisoner ever died...

587
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:24,097
...in your daddy's custody.

588
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,895
I don't recall a man in this county...

589
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,230
...black, white, Mexican...

590
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,683
...who'd hesitate for a minute...

591
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,018
...before they'd call on Buddy Deeds
to solve a problem.

592
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:40,898
More than that...

593
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:44,400
...I wouldn't care to say.

594
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:50,324
I'm supposed to tell my friends
they're too low-class to hang with?

595
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,406
Come on, Amado.

596
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:53,571
'Cause I'm not like Miss Honor Roll?

597
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:55,322
PILAR: Leave your sister out of it.

598
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,488
You and those teachers in that dump....

599
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,951
<i>Your story's over, so nobody can have fun.

600
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,989
You jerk.

601

You have no friends.

602
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:05,159
Who'd be friends with a <i>pachuco</i> wannabe?

603
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,748
I don't pretend I came on the Mayflower.

604
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,459
PALOMA: And those stupid girls.

605
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:10,659
Shut up.

606
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:14,251
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school
she's in love with Santo Guerra.

607
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,251
So?

608
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,911
You can't be desperately in love
when you're 14.

609
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,046
<i>Not if you have half a brain in your head.

610
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:22,792
Of course, you can.

611
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:24,339
What?

612
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:27,552
It's got nothing to do with being smart.

613
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:31,084
It's ancient goddamn history, Danny.

614
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:35,093
1963, they dam up the north branch
to make Lake Pescadero...

615
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,174
...and a whole town disappears.

616
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:38,510
A squatter's town!

617
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,093
People lived in Perdido for over 100 years!
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported...

618
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:47,050
...forcibly evicted by our local hero,
Buddy Deeds, and his department.

619
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:49,434
There was a bill from the state legislature.

620
00:41:49,522 --> 00:41:52,770
Families were split apart!
A whole community was destroyed!

621
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:57,225
And who gets Lakefront property
bought for a fraction of the market price?

622
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:01,563
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County,
and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.

623
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,736
Are you finished?

624
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:07,069
Look, I'm not after you, Sam.

625
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:11,105
I just think people ought to know
the full story on Buddy Deeds.

626
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,116
That makes two of us.

627
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:23,536
What's the big deal? Go back over,
talk to the man, and bury the hatchet.

628
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:26,988
DEL: Why me? He's had almost 40 years
and I haven't heard from him.

629
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,539
He was probably embarrassed.

630
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:31,908
DEL: Otis Payne was never embarrassed
about a thing in his life.

631
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,039
You were 8 when he left.

632
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:37,495
He moved three houses down
with my mother's best friend.

633
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:39,124
Dad.

634
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:42,078
''Delmore, where's your daddy?''

635
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:45,876
Godforsaken town.
Everybody in everybody else's business.

636
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,832
Everybody loved Otis. Big ''O.''

637
00:42:47,924 --> 00:42:51,172
Always there with a smile or a loan...

638
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:54,175
-...or a free drink.
-Dad, can I talk to you about track?

639
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,256

00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:57,042
Not that much.

641
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:58,133
I talked to the coach.

642
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:00,508
I told you. Next year,
if your grades are high.

643
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:01,842
I have a B average!

644
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,716
How many B students do you think
they take at West Point?

645
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,297
We'll be here for three years.
We'll have to see him.

646

Maybe you're getting less patient.

If they're going to survive,
they have to know how to work.

Nobody's illegal in my cafe!

656
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,030
They've got green cards,
relatives who were born here.

01:41:46,042 --> 01:41:48,247
...that out of 120 people...

1385
01:41:48,377 --> 01:41:50,285

When you were given
the opportunity to enlist...

1389

...a kind of contract was agreed upon.

1390
01:42:03,259 --> 01:42:06,092

1392
01:42:07,553 --> 01:42:08,547
Yes, sir.

What exactly do you think your job is?

1396
01:42:26,603 --> 01:42:29,009

1400
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,937

of the best deals they offer.

01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:13,987
Being good at your job.
Doing what they tell you.

1412
01:43:15,585 --> 01:43:17,622
I mean, follow orders, sir.

With your attitude, Private...

1414
01:43:25,255 --> 01:43:27,710
...I'm surprised you want to stay
in the service.

1415
01:43:28,257 --> 01:43:29,454

1416
01:43:30,216 --> 01:43:31,544

1417
01:43:33,885 --> 01:43:36,375

1418
01:43:41,138 --> 01:43:42,086

1420
01:43:48,933 --> 01:43:51,258
...they let us in on the deal?

1421
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:59,554

Arabs, yellow people, whatever.

...in what he's fighting for.

1426

Most of them fight just to back up
the other soldiers in their squad.

You try not to get them extra duty.

1429
01:44:29,077 --> 01:44:31,531
You try not embarrass yourself...

1430
01:44:32,329 --> 01:44:33,822
...in front of them.

1431
01:44:47,878 --> 01:44:49,870

02:10:34,688 --> 02:10:36,929
After Amado, I had complications.

1726
02:10:37,023 --> 02:10:40,603
I can't get pregnant anymore,
if that's what the rule is about.

1727
02:10:44,693 --> 02:10:46,020
So that's it?

1728
02:10:48,361 --> 02:10:50,851
You won't want to be with me anymore?

1729
02:10:54,489 --> 02:10:55,947
If I met you...

1730
02:10:57,699 --> 02:10:59,821
...for the first time today...

1731
02:11:01,117 --> 02:11:03,192
...I'd still want to be with you.

1732
02:11:08,829 --> 02:11:10,655
Start from scratch?

1733
02:11:12,123 --> 02:11:13,071
Yeah.

1734
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:17,660
All that other stuff and all that history...

1735
02:11:18,584 --> 02:11:20,374
...the hell with it, right?

1736
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:27,956
Forget the Alamo.

1737
02:11:42,678 --> 02:11:44,421
