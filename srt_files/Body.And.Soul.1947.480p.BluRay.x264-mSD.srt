2
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,123
Ben...

3
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,627
Ben!

4
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:48,507
Where's he going? The champ must be crazy.
He's got a fight tomorrow night.
- Yeah, I know.

5
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,596
I'll get him.

6
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,708
- Hiya, champ!
- How ya shake, champ?

7
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,589
- Okay, kid.
- It's Charlie Davis!

8
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,451
- Charlie!
- Hello, Ma.

9
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,044
Careful Charlie, you'll cut yourself.

10
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,027
What do you want, Charlie?

11
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,445
Ben died.

12
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:38,993
- When?
- Today. I had to come down anyway
for the fight tomorrow.

13
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:42,079
I couldn't sleep, Ma. I thought maybe I...

14
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:44,165
- Peg is sleeping here, Charlie.
- Oh.

15
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:21,035
I couldn't stand it up there, Ma.

16
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,787
After they took Ben away.

17
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,666
I couldn't sleep, so I came down.

18
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,169
I had to find a place where I could lie down.

19
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,171
You know, Ma.

20
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:34,590
You have to find a place...

21
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,644
I didn't mean all those things I said to Peg...You know that.

22
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,817
What's the matter? Don't you want me here?

23
00:05:57,196 --> 00:06:01,701
The butcher was closed, but I got everything else from the grocer.

24
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:06,747
Peg!

25
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:27,602
Peg...Peg...

26
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:40,156
Go away, Charlie...Go away.

27
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:06,974
Hey, lay off of that!...I knew him when he was a kid in the poolroom. He used to beat everybody.

28
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,309
What a fighter!

29
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,230
You leaving, champ?

30
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,498
Oh, hello, Champ! She'll be through in a few minutes...

31
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,625
Can I check your coat?

32
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:35,378
- Hello, champ.
- Bourbon.

33
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,549
Chaser?

34
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,018
Hi, champ.

35
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:28,639
Hello, sweetie. Quinn's been going nuts. You've been every place in town but here.

36
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:30,808
Why didn't you come here first, Charlie ?

37
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:35,980
How does it look, Charlie, the night before the fight...3 a.m. and you loaded?

38
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,774
Come on, Alice, let's go.

39
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:42,111
Okay, champ.

40
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:44,947
Just on the nose, Davis.

41
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:47,742
All fat! Nightclub fat!

42
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:51,037
Whisky fat! 35-year-old fat!

43
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,625
- Too bad about Ben.
- Yeah.

44
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,127
- You in good shape tonight, Marlowe?
- Great shape.
- Two pounds under Davis.

45
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,797
- Think you're gonna lick him?
- I've licked everybody in the division.

46
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,090
Are you nervous?

47
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,636
Nervous? He's nervous! It took the Boxing Commission two years. It took every sportswriter two years...

48
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:10,723
- It took me two years to pressure Davis into this fight.
- In what round do you think you're gonna stop him?

49
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,141
I'll stop him in two if his legs hold out.

50
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,269
Look you, lay off the propaganda. Can't you keep this loud mouth shut?

51
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,855
I'm in charge of the muscles, not the brains.

52
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:21,484
Say...What eye are you using, champ, the good eye or the glass one?

53
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:45,717
Vince...go see what boxer's on.

54
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,267
That was great publicity, Charlie, smacking Marlowe this afternoon...
- I meant to hit him.

55
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,477
The kid was putting on an act to make it look good.

56
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,105
I could knock that Marlowe on his ear in two rounds.

57
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,108
What's wrong, Charlie ?

58
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:06,904
The books are all balanced. The bets are in. You bet your purse against yourself.

59
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:10,950
You gotta be business-like, Charlie...Just because the kid talks a little fresh...

60
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,744
Give me the tape, Quinn.

61
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:15,496
You still thinking about Ben, Charlie?

62
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:20,918
Everybody dies.
Ben, Shorty...even you.

63
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:24,547
- What's the point?
- No point, that's life.

64
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:28,301
You go in and just box that boy for 15 rounds, Charlie, like we agreed.

65
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,596
Nobody get hurt, nobody get knocked out. You'll lose by a clean decision.

66
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:34,057
You'll get your money and we're squared away.

67
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:37,518
You know the way the betting is, Charlie. The numbers are in.

68
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:42,523
Everything is addition or subtraction. The rest is conversation.

69
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,694
I still think I can knock that Marlowe on his ear in two rounds.

70
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:54,786
Maybe you could, Charlie. But the smart money is against it.

71
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,746
And you're smart.

72
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,249
It's a deal...It's a deal!

73
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:06,339
You gotta be business-like, Charlie...And businessmen have to keep their agreements.

74
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:10,301
15 rounds is a long time, Mr. Roberts.

75
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:12,261
Make it short then.

76
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,321
Get out of here.

77
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,835
I'm going down the drain...

78
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,547
everything down the drain.

79
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:56,639
All these years...everything down the drain...All these years...

80
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:21,122
And now The Iroquois Democratic Club of the 14th AD

81
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:24,125
has a big surprise for a very lucky young man.

82
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:28,546
The boy who won his first amateur bout in 1 minute and 12 seconds,

83
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,966
our own neighborhood champ, Charlie Davis!

84
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,806
Quiet, boys! Quiet!

85
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,852
Who's got the privilege of dancing a solo

86
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,605
with Miss Iroquois Democratic Club, 14 AD!

87
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,831
Come on, Charlie...Come on!

88
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:14,884
Take her around, Charlie, she won't bite you!

89
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,429
You can dance, can't you? Can you walk?

90
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,433
Come on, she's willing, like I am. Go ahead!

91
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,230
He's a ringer, a wrestler!

92
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,410
Now why ain't I young and lucky?

93
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,169
Okay friends, before we get lost in fun,

94
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:53,631
don't forget to vote for the people's choice, Jack Shelton,

95
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,509
the man who never said no to a friend.

96
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,332
Ever hear of the law of gravity?

97
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,460
- No...what's gravity?
- Sit up straight.

98
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:39,761
- Well, good night.
- Night.

99
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:49,437
I win.

100
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:51,481
Well, you're in better shape.

101
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,067
Depends on the point of view...

102
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:58,530
Well, good night.

103
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:01,950
- Aw, it's early yet.
- Why don't you go to a movie?

104
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:05,829
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

105
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,126
Is your friend going to wait for you?

106
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:18,383
Hey!...Ouch!

107
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:31,896
My friend...

108
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,067
It don't look good!

109
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:50,707
- All right, but as soon as your friend leaves, you leave. Promise?
- Promise.

110
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,294
Say...What's your name?

111
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:55,712
Peg.

112
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,508
- Still the undefeated champ!
- Amateur!

113
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:13,605
- Irma?
- Yeah?

114
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,024
Don't you live alone?

115
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:19,694
- Are you decent?
- Not particularly. Bring him in.

116
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,279
Are you decent?

117
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:32,665
This is Irma.

118
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,544
She sculpts.

119
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,298
- I make statues.
- Oh.

120
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,969
And this is Charlie Davis, amateur boxing champion of the universe...

121
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,846
as of tonight!
- Really?

122
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:50,809
Pleased to meet you.

123
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:55,021
- Well...sit down, champ.
- Thanks.

124
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:01,277
- Take your coat and shirt off.
- What?

125
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,030
Like to pose for me?

126
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,826
No...sit down.

127
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,370
I've got a longshoreman posing for me now.

128
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:11,996
A longshoreman?

129
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,665
He's very graceful, too.

130
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,752
Anytime you'd like to be preserved for posterity, champ...

131
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:21,714
drop in to see me...Good night, champ.

132
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,217
- Peg.
- Irma.

133
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,390
Is she kidding?

134
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,894
- What do you do here?
- I paint.

135
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,563
Pictures.

136
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:40,024
I go to art school because I want to be a painter.

137
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,694
What about this Miss This and Miss That?

138
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:46,114
There's an agency which arranges these little jobs for me.

139
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:49,909
I get 25 dollars, and the crowd gets to whistle.

140
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:54,414
- What's with that accent?
- What accent?

141
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:57,250
The way you say "crowd", and "whistle"...

142
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,585
- Why, I talk that way.
- Why?

143
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:02,672
- Well, because...because I learned it that way.
- Where?

144
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:07,135
Oh...in Paris, Berlin, London, Montreal...

145
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,970
And you paint too?

146
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,474
- Well, paint me.
- Sure.

147
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,569
- Did your friend leave?
- ...Oh.

148
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,037
That character's still there...

149
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,873
Pull the shade up.

150
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,336
- What?
- That'll send him away.

151
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,798
Okay...

152
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,223
Should I take my coat off?

153
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,392
It makes no difference.

154
00:18:58,603 --> 00:18:59,771
How's this?

155
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:06,152
Are you going to be professional prizefighter?

156
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,406
Or are you going to run for President?

157
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,496
I just want to be a success.

158
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,959
- You mean you want other people to think you're a success?
- Sure...sure.

159
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,295
Every man for himself.

160
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,049
- Ouch!
- It's time to go home now.

161
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:30,677
Good night...

162
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,770
- Can I see you again sometime?
- What for?

163
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,189
Just to see you...anything.

164
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,526
- Try sometime.
- Will you?

165
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:48,903
Try.

166
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,284
I don't get it, Peg.

167
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,411
Why should you want to see me?

168
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,913
Why do you want to see me?

169
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:05,295
Because you're beautiful and you're level...and you're different.

170
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,923
Oh Charlie, you're so innocent.

171
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,469
You know, when I went to school, I learned a poem.

172
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,095
It went:

173
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:18,933
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright
In the forest of the night,

174
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:24,856
"What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"

175
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,359
What's "symmetry"?

176
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,027
Well built.

177
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,892
After I showed him how to knock this guy out, we get this big feed, see?
- Yeah?

178
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:05,146
- And they bring this quail out.
- Yeah?

179
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,148
And then what happened, then what happened?

180
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:10,777
- Come on, come on!
- Finish the story!

181
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:16,116
- Well, She and Charlie begin to dance...
- Yeah?

182
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,827
And before you know it...Come here...

183
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,707
- She's inviting him up to her apartment.
- No kidding.

184
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,836
Charlie, perfect man of the world,

185
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:31,047
gives me the sign, see, and me...I blow.

186
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,260
Fellas...just like that...

187
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,346
- Charlie, very nonchalant...
- Hello, Charlie!

188
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,973
Well? Well?

189
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:42,225
What happened?

190
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,019
She draws pictures.

191
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:46,021
You mean she was drawing your picture?

192
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:51,443
Yeah! She's got a big room with big paintings and statues and all that kind of stuff. I'm going to see her again.

193
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:54,154
- She give you a diploma?
- Wise guy!

194
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,571
Let me see that.

195
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,658
- Look, she drew his picture!
- Hey, look! Fur!
- Doesn't look like you.

196
00:21:58,742 --> 00:21:59,784
All right, all right...

197
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,745
- What are you getting sore about?
- I'm not sore...who's sore?

198
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,914
Hiya, Mr. Quinn!

199
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,751
He was at the fights.
- No kidding!

200
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,878
- Yeah! I saw him.
- You mean when I knocked that guy out?

201
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:11,713
- He was sitting right at the ringside.
- Gee.

202
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,340
- Come on!
- What for?

203
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:17,427
- Come on, don't be a dope! Hit him while you're hot!
- Okay.

204
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:19,596
I win.

205
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,528
Very strong! You see that, Charlie?

206
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,697
Like the fights tonight, Mr. Quinn?

207
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,449
So-so.

208
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,160
How'd you like that quick knockout Charlie made?

209
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,289
I've seen knockouts before.

210
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,792
Everybody said it was sensational!

211
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,378
You ever meet Charlie personally, Mr. Quinn?

212
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,796
You shoot.

213
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,634
- This is Charlie Davis.
- Hello.

214
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:02,222
How about you take in a hand? You know, set up a few money fights now? Charlie's on his way up.

215
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,684
Charlie's a great fighter, Mr. Quinn. He's got the natural stuff. He's got the style...

216
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,895
- A little training...
- So what?

217
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,481
So what? He won the amateurs!

218
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,652
So what? Kids win this and that every day. Thousands of them.

219
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,739
One out of a hundred fights professionally, one out of a thousand's worth watching,

220
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:24,411
one out of a million is worth coffee and donuts...Now tell your boy to get himself an honest job.

221
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:30,208
Nobody's asking you for coffee and donuts!

222
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,636
You see that, Mr. Quinn? He's a natural fighter, you got a champion!

223
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:44,055
Throw me the balls.

224
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:46,141
Hiya, Pop!

225
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:52,397
Good evening, Ma!

226
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:54,774
Good evening, champion.

227
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:58,486
We had a delegation tonight from the poolroom. They congratulated your parents.

228
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,781
Well...it's better to win than to lose.

229
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,743
Surely...And the other boy, you hurt him good, champion?

230
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:07,621
It's only a prizefight, Ma. It's a sport!

231
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:09,789
A fine sport...A fine sport, indeed!

232
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:13,126
Quinn will take you on. He'll teach you to be a professional fighter!

233
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,670
All we gotta do is raise ten or fifteen bucks for equipment.

234
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,172
We can dig up the dough, and...

235
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:21,593
Evening, Mrs. Davis...evening, Mr. Davis...

236
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,638
- I'll see you later, Charlie.
- Yeah.

237
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,186
So now you'll be a professional sport and make a living hitting people.

238
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:35,148
Knocking their teeth out, smashing their noses, breaking their heads in.

239
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:36,983
Sportsman, this is what you want?

240
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:39,694
All right, Anna, if we're closing up, let's close.

241
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:44,491
20 years ago, I wanted to move to a nice place so our Charlie would grow up a nice boy and learn a profession.

242
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:48,078
But instead we live in a jungle, so he can only be a wild animal.

243
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,164
Do you think I picked the East Side like Columbus picked America?

244
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,001
It was possible to buy the candy store with a small cash-down payment...

245
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,419
A fine investment.

246
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,422
Next door a speakeasy, across the street a poolroom...

247
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,258
Loafers on the corner, children like wolves...

248
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,720
Could I help it that J.P. Morgan refused to advance me credit?

249
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,306
I would have opened a fancy store on Fifth Avenue...

250
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:12,185
We could have lived at the Ritz, Charlie would be wearing a monocle...

251
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:15,605
You think I want to spend the rest of my life selling kids two-cent soda?

252
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,276
"Mr. Davis, give me a penny candy, Mr. Davis, give me a pack of cigarettes, mind the baby,
make mine raspberry!"...

253
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,071
Well not me, Ma! Understand, not me.
I don't want to end up like Pop.

254
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,031
Don't talk that way about your father.

255
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,117
Let the boy alone. He don't mean what he says.

256
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,079
I'll let him alone like you do, to fight in poolrooms, to hang around street corners...

257
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,999
- I want him to study to be something.
- I want to be a fighter!

258
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,585
So fight for something, not for money!

259
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:39,796
Charlie!

260
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,141
That's 10 dollars!

261
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,059
For your boxing equipment.

262
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,687
You don't have to discuss this with your mother.

263
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,522
Thanks, Pop!

264
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:16,666
They're bombing the speak!

265
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,637
They got the speakeasy.

266
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,056
Yeah, and they got the candy store, too!

267
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,401
Look at the front...All smashed in!

268
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,957
Pop...Pop!

269
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,443
Don't cry, Ma.

270
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,155
Don't cry.

271
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,350
Charlie, it's cold out...Why don't you come in and get a little warm?

272
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,644
- Thanks, I'm waiting for somebody.
- Okay...

273
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,296
- It's cold outside, huh?
- Yeah.

274
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,466
- She didn't come yet, huh?
- No.

275
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,844
Maybe she won't come.

276
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:36,348
She'll come...She'll come. That's wait I'm afraid of.

277
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:40,018
It's gonna be great! She and my mother...

278
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:44,398
- Well, if you're going with a girl...
- Who's going with a girl? I won't have a dime in a hundred years.

279
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,027
No unemployment for him.

280
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:50,612
All right, all right...Don't rub it in.

281
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:52,656
I got troubles of my own.

282
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:56,076
You and me both.

283
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:59,121
Look through the want ads. Maybe somebody died and you can carry the corpse.

284
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,087
How's business, Mr. Quinn?

285
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,298
Always pitching, huh, punk?

286
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,635
Why don't you talk to Charlie?

287
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:13,969
What for?

288
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,388
Well, he might listen to you. He ain't got a job...nothing.

289
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,181
It ain't my headache...He don't want to fight.

290
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,267
His old lady won't let him.

291
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:25,105
That never stopped anybody, kid. You know that. Charlie just doesn't have the drive, the fighting spirit.

292
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,649
How about Marino?

293
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,986
He stinks! But he's willing, that's half the racket.

294
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,656
Now look, stop dreaming, kid. You'll have to make a buck some other way.

295
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:36,867
- Let me see that form, will you, friend?
- Yeah, that Four Leaf Clover's following in...

296
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:45,000
Hey Marino, you were great in your last fight!

297
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:46,877
You know Marino, don't you, Charlie?

298
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,338
The real mutt. Couldn't even lick my kid brother.

299
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,215
Now lay off of that stuff, Shorty.

300
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,595
- He even got knocked out last week, but he still got plenty of dough in his pockets.
- And that was the ringer.

301
00:29:57,804 --> 00:29:59,473
How much do you get when you lose?

302
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,224
50 bucks.

303
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:02,559
50 bucks?! 50 bucks?

304
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,187
You hear that, Charlie?

305
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:09,066
He don't have to take his girl walking on the streets...

306
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:10,108
- Jacks.
- Queens.

307
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:16,198
- Let me see the cards.
- You don't trust me, eh?

308
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,503
See what I mean? And your boy don't get 50 bucks this time.

309
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,463
You just burned up my cigar money, Charlie.

310
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:34,299
I bet you'd be willing to pay expenses now, wouldn't you?

311
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:37,636
- You know, you're a pretty cute kid! I oughta take a sock at you!
- Charlie...Charlie!

312
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:42,182
- That's a lot of dough, Charlie.
- There's Peg! - Get my hat, will you? Peg! Oh, Peg!

313
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,275
She left her lipstick on you, Charlie.

314
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,778
Did that other girl show you her paintings?

315
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:58,865
Oh. I ran into a door...Let's take a walk around the block.

316
00:30:58,865 --> 00:30:59,908
What for?

317
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:05,122
My mother's been talking like I was bringing you around for approval or something.

318
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,875
- I don't want to embarrass you, and make you sore...
- I won't be sore.

319
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,671
Look Charlie, you can't call it off. Just tell her you like long engagements.

320
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,047
Is this a proposal?

321
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:18,844
From Mama! She'll say:
"And where do you come from, Miss Born?"

322
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,433
And where do you come from, Miss Born?

323
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,478
She told you, Ma.

324
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,771
I heard Miss Born, Charlie.

325
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,774
- Call me Peg, Mrs. Davis. My friends call me Peg.
- Thank you, Peg.

326
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:35,360
I mean where did you come from in this country?

327
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,237
Highlandtown. My father was a druggist there.

328
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,364
A professional man? Very nice...

329
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,201
Charlie's father's brother was a teacher. Very smart.

330
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,120
Charlie's going to night school. He told you?

331
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,039
Yes, I think it's an excellent idea.

332
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:50,500
- And you came to New York to study?
- I want to be a painter.

333
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:54,755
- Charlie made me bring this.
- Talented, huh?

334
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,214
Very talented.

335
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:00,385
No, thank you!

336
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,804
And you live in Greenwich Village?
- Yes.

337
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,850
It must be very lonely for a girl all alone. You live alone?

338
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,103
With a friend. She makes statues.

339
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,608
Wonderful. Your father's a druggist, a professional man, and you're an artist.

340
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,778
Peg...Have another cookie, they're homemade!

341
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:18,862
..And Shorty?

342
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:23,992
You know, Shorty lives on the same block. He's got ten brothers and sisters.

343
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,036
And seven of them are out of work!

344
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:31,583
Times are very hard. It's not easy for a boy to get started nowadays.

345
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:36,672
But if his friends encourage him, if he goes to school and gets an education,

346
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,342
- if he makes sacrifices...
- He'll end up wearing glasses, and still broke.

347
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,804
We're very poor, Mrs. Davis. We've always been poor.

348
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:46,390
My father scrimped and scraped, and

349
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:51,812
when Prohibition came, he sold some of the bonded medicinal whisky, you know? Without prescription?

350
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,856
- And what happened?
- They arrested him and fined him.

351
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,359
I got fed up anyway, so I came to New York.

352
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,361
We're nothing fancy.

353
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,323
- Did Charlie show you his medal?
- No.

354
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,077
He won it at basketball. The very best in the whole school!

355
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,204
- Oh, Ma...
- Show her, show her!

356
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:12,416
Now don't be bashful, Charlie. Peg wants to see it!

357
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,426
Mrs. Davis? May I come in?

358
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,469
I heard your voices in the kitchen.

359
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,264
I'm Miss Tedder.

360
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,183
- Oh. Would you come in here please?
- Yes, thank you.

361
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:39,443
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt your dinner, but it's hurry hurry hurry...

362
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:43,280
So many cases and so few people. And so little cooperation.

363
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:46,617
I won't be long. I have your letter here...

364
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:49,203
- Mrs. Anna Davis, is that right?
- Yes, I'm Anna Davis.

365
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,001
And now, just a form to make a proper check.

366
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:01,798
Race : White. Religion : Jewish.
Nationality : American.

367
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,843
Is this your boy?

368
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm Charlie Davis.

369
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,640
Are you unemployed?

370
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,975
Have you got a job for me?

371
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:15,812
- Have you tried?
- He tried.

372
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:19,149
All these questions must be answered, I'm sorry.

373
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,652
Have you tried to get a job, Mrs. Davis?

374
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:25,614
Would I be asking for a loan from charity if I could find work?

375
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:28,158
It isn't personal, we're supposed to ask.

376
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:32,120
Have you any resources, any jewelry?

377
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:34,498
She has her wedding ring!

378
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,877
We don't ask our clients to sell their wedding rings...

379
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,213
I wish you'd understand, I have to ask these questions.

380
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,298
Charlie, please, go in the other room!

381
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,677
Is this furniture yours?

382
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:49,304
Get out of here!

383
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:51,974
Charlie, I won't have you talking like this.

384
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:53,475
Get out of here! Get out of here!

385
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,943
We have to ask questions if we're going to help.

386
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:06,989
We don't want any help. Tell them we're dead! We don't want any help!

387
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:12,286
I did it to buy myself fancy clothes? Fool!

388
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:16,707
It's for you! To learn, to get an education, to make something of yourself!

389
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,752
Shorty, get me that fight from Quinn. I want money, do you understand? Money. Money!

390
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,046
I forbid it. You'd better buy a gun and shoot yourself!

391
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,299
You need money to buy a gun!

392
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:48,739
Charlie!

393
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,796
It's cold.

394
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:13,806
I don't want any handouts.

395
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:17,810
You think I like the idea of waiting around for the whole world to make up its mind what to do with me?

396
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,645
My mother don't understand.

397
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,648
What is it you want to do?

398
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,193
There's only one thing I know how to do: Fight.

399
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,239
If you want to fight, fight.

400
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:32,783
And it's all right with you?

401
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:39,206
Anything you want is all right with me. I love you, Charlie.

402
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,459
I'll be quick!

403
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,797
- Tiger, tiger...
- Yeah, that's right!

404
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,092
I got claws!

405
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:53,387
But not for you, Peg...Not for you.

406
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:33,612
- Quinn!
- Hello, Shorty!

407
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:36,115
- What you doing up here? Couldn't you wait for Grand Central?
- Got big news!

408
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:37,658
- Hey, Quinn!
- Hello, Boy!

409
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,077
- Gee, that cigar stinks!
- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!

410
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,080
Now you got that news...you got that fight for me?

411
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,666
- Well I don't know...
- Come on, tell me about it!

412
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,042
Hey...hey...hey...the hat's here!

413
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:49,002
- How do you like the new coat?
- I like the tie, Charlie!

414
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,713
Never mind that. Come on, give us the dope, will you?

415
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,549
We've got some business arrangements to take care of first, Charlie.

416
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,135
With who? Roberts?

417
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:01,348
Who else? Nobody fights the championship for anything unless Roberts gets cut in...You know that.

418
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,726
He's got the dough, the real estate, everything. The business.

419
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,936
What does Roberts want, Quinn?

420
00:39:06,395 --> 00:39:07,646
Nothing much.

421
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:09,231
Only Charlie.

422
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,442
He'll be cutting you to pieces, Charlie.

423
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,902
That only means more dough cut more ways.

424
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,447
A bigger pie, more slices, more to eat for everybody!

425
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:19,742
And Roberts will be telling us what and when.

426
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,536
So what? Everyone's been telling us what and when!

427
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,664
The guy who owned the arena, the guy who owned the fighter, the guy who owned the books...

428
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:28,500
Cheap mobsters, gangsters, guys who own nothing.

429
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:32,254
We've been fighting for peanuts and eating them! Right?
- Right.

430
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,883
You know you can't get a fight in New York without Roberts' say-so. Right?
- Right.

431
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:37,509
Right. Okay, Quinn, make the deal.

432
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:40,137
I'll be the champ, then I'll give the orders. I'll say what and when.

433
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,139
You can tell us what and when, but you can't tell Roberts.

434
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,475
But the champ can.

435
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,102
Not if he gives away his right arm!

436
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:49,313
Aw, you made me cut myself!

437
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,402
It's my arm, isn't it?

438
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,424
- Gee, you're lighter!
- You're stronger.

439
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,468
Boy, you feel good!

440
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,389
Hey, who's that?

441
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:26,308
- I'm Victor. Mr. Quinn employed me.
- Doing what?

442
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:28,227
- It's the butler!...Hello, Peg.
- Hello, Shorty.

443
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:32,731
- You look beautiful.
- You took the words out of my mouth! How's your job?

444
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,442
Wonderful! I'm third assistant designer now...

445
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,322
- Where do the bags go?
- In there.

446
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:45,536
You miss me?

447
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,132
- It's been a long year, Charlie.
- Yeah.

448
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,468
21 fights.

449
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:04,221
19 knockouts, 2 decisions.

450
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,931
A lonely year.

451
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,058
I missed you too.

452
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,687
- Hey, easy!
- What's the matter?

453
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,774
The guy had a head like a rock.

454
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:19,778
That'll be all right.

455
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:21,572
- And this?
- Chicago.

456
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,409
- And this?
- Philadelphia.

457
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:27,703
- And this?
- Boston.

458
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:33,167
You get something every time, but it's worth it.

459
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,835
As long as you win.

460
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:38,297
Look! Lots of money, lots of clothes...

461
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,174
Lots of everything.

462
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:41,175
Hey, Shorty...Shorty!

463
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,969
What about the reservations, the tickets for tonight?

464
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:46,555
- Why, I want to talk to you about that...
- How about a drink? - Yes, sir.

465
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:49,308
It's early in the morning yet, Charlie, we haven't said hello.

466
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:53,729
Hello, morning, noon or night, what's the difference how you cut up the 24 hours?

467
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,320
Well, what do you know!

468
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:03,739
The only trouble is Peg's picture's on the other side.

469
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:06,575
- We'll find another wall that stands still.
- Sure.

470
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:11,372
Look, it's even got a little sink!

471
00:42:11,622 --> 00:42:13,832
Bourbon, scotch, like milk, like cream!

472
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,460
What'll you have, folks? Just like the candy store!

473
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:18,128
Want a two-cent soda, Peg?

474
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,966
- Shorty, I thought I told you...
- Charlie, I'd like to...

475
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:26,303
- Come on, come on, we got no secrets here!
- I need some money.

476
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:30,015
- What do you mean, you need money? I thought I gave you some in Detroit.
- That was Detroit.

477
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:33,394
All the time he needs money! Well, what do you do with it?

478
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:39,191
I steal it! I go through your pockets every night to see if there's any left to send to your old lady!

479
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:43,195
Get the reservations!

480
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:46,490
You, bring my bags in!

481
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:51,996
- What's wrong, Shorty?
- Nothing, nothing...

482
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,546
Come on, Shorty...Not with me.

483
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:05,676
He's restless, he's had a lot of fights, he's all wound up, like a guy on a jag.

484
00:43:06,385 --> 00:43:07,636
Peg, you've got to...

485
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:10,514
What have I got to?

486
00:43:11,265 --> 00:43:12,933
You two still getting married?

487
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:15,853
Well, I haven't had time to say no!

488
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,688
Then get married right away.

489
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,983
- Why, have I got a rival?
- Yeah, money!

490
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:24,528
You know what Charlie is, what they're making him? A money machine.

491
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:27,198
Like gold mines, oil wells, ten percent of the U.S. Mint!

492
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:29,533
They're cutting him up a million ways!

493
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:32,703
You're the only one left, Peg, the only one. He won't listen to me.

494
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:36,123
If you don't hold onto him, it's Goodbye, Charlie Davis.

495
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:39,001
Marry him, Peg, but do it now, now!

496
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:43,881
How do you like this coat? Handmade! Shorty's got one like this, too.

497
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:47,468
Come on, honey, we're gonna burn up the town! We'll rob the stores!

498
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:51,680
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I forgot. Oh, yeah...Mom...Mom is coming up.

499
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:55,392
Would you do me a favor, Shorty, the old lady's coming up. Keep her happy. Make with the jokes!

500
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,811
- Where'll you be?
- On the town!

501
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:02,983
- Quinn?
- Arnold...

502
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:08,239
What did you decide, Arnold?

503
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,784
The champ and I talked it over. We owe you...

504
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:14,495
- about 40 grand.
- Exactly 40 grand.

505
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:19,416
And we figure if we can hold the title for six months or more, we could pick up some easy money.

506
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,043
You know...making appearances, and...

507
00:44:21,252 --> 00:44:26,006
The champ hasn't fought a real match in two years, Arnold. That costs money. No gates.

508
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:29,510
We waited for a real contender. He's here!

509
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:30,803
I know.

510
00:44:31,011 --> 00:44:34,348
It's a business, Arnold. We get one fight now, another in six months.

511
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,767
It's money at the gate...and the betting!

512
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:40,104
Besides, I been carrying you and your boy.

513
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:42,898
Debts have to be paid or it wouldn't be business.

514
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,109
I guess you're right, Mr. Roberts.

515
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:49,947
Too bad about Ben getting hurt in that last fight. I liked Ben, he was a real fighter.

516
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:52,908
- Hard luck.
- Accidents happen.

517
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:55,161
Let them happen to other people!

518
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:58,914
After Ben's head cracked into that post, I wanted to die.

519
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:02,293
It's still there...the blood clot.

520
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:05,004
Doctors say no more fights.

521
00:45:05,212 --> 00:45:06,088
What do you want me to do?

522
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:09,842
I told you...get your boy in the ring.

523
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,808
It's up to you, Ben.

524
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:20,060
If you say no...no.

525
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:22,313
If it's no, I want the money right away!

526
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:25,065
And I hold you responsible, Arnold!

527
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:37,786
People don't count with you, do they, Mr. Roberts?

528
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:43,042
You've been square with me, Arnold. I'll fight Davis.

529
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,126
Okay, Mr. Roberts.

530
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:47,171
- In two months.
- In two months.

531
00:45:48,547 --> 00:45:51,258
But we agree it's for a decision...No slugging!

532
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:53,385
I don't want my champ killed, Mr. Roberts.

533
00:45:53,594 --> 00:45:55,638
Nobody's gonna get killed!

534
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:58,599
Thank you, Mr. Roberts...Thank you!

535
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,859
- Have a good cigar, Quinn. For the new champ.
- Thanks, Mr. Roberts!

536
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,155
Too bad about Ben's head...he was a great fighter.

537
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:17,409
I like fighters, Quinn, better than horses.
But you gotta look out for business.

538
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:21,330
So we don't tell Charlie anything about this. Let him go into the fight and knock Ben out.

539
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:23,415
But Ben's sick, Mr. Roberts. Charlie might kill him!

540
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:26,168
The crowd likes a killer, and Charlie's a hard fighter.

541
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:28,212
- It'd look fixed if he takes it easy.
- I know, Mr. Roberts.

542
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,465
So wipe your nose and forget the whole thing!

543
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,761
Where's your boy? I asked you to bring him down.

544
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:39,140
He said you'd know where to find him.

545
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:41,976
- Fresh kid, huh?
- Yeah.

546
00:46:44,186 --> 00:46:45,479
I'll see him.

547
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:55,781
- Why don't you freshen your drink, Quinn?
- It tastes all right.

548
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:59,535
Lay off in front of the old lady, will you?

549
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:05,541
If you're sleepy, why don't you go home?

550
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,502
I'm not sleepy, I'm just thinking.

551
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:09,962
Don't tell me.

552
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:13,174
It's getting kind of late, Mrs. Davis.

553
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:17,052
Oh I've waited, I'll wait, Shorty. I wouldn't want to disappoint Charlie.

554
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:18,596
I'm waiting for Charlie, too.

555
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:21,766
Quinn promised me...It's lucky to meet lucky people.

556
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:23,768
You're a lucky woman, Mrs. Davis!

557
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:25,269
You think so, in what way?

558
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:28,314
Your son's going to be champ. And that means he's gonna be rich.

559
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:29,982
And that means you're gonna be rich.

560
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:33,486
I'm beautiful, why should I want to be rich?

561
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,952
- Why, hello!
- Ma!

562
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:46,040
- Charlie...How are you?
- Fine...You look wonderful.

563
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:48,626
- Let me look, let me see...
- Well, I haven't changed, and neither have you.

564
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,377
How do you like everything?

565
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:51,462
Wonderful.

566
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,548
I'm sorry we kept you waiting, but Peg and I, we've been on the town.

567
00:47:54,757 --> 00:47:56,967
My fault, Mrs. Davis...my fault, everyone.

568
00:47:57,176 --> 00:47:59,553
We danced and danced and Charlie just couldn't get me home.

569
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:03,599
Look at my dress, we robbed the stores!
And what do you think of my wedding present?

570
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:07,061
Yeah, we're gonna get married, right away! We decided this afternoon!

571
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:09,897
Now I am rich!

572
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:13,317
Getting married, that's great! Peg, that makes me feel fine!

573
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,403
- Look now, Shorty, that's enough!
- It sure is wonderful!

574
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:19,281
It's been such a night! Such a day!

575
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,742
Did you ever drink an oceanful of champagne?

576
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:24,203
Every place we went, there were millions of people,

577
00:48:24,412 --> 00:48:27,540
and every one an intimate, personal friend of Charlie's.

578
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:31,085
And every place we went, there was another party, and more champagne!

579
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:35,464
And Charlie was the king, and I was...Charlie's girl!

580
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:38,134
And you're Charlie's mother, and you're Charlie's manager...

581
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,344
and you're Charlie's friend, and...

582
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:43,597
Who are you?

583
00:48:44,557 --> 00:48:46,017
I'm nobody.

584
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:48,602
Don't sulk...We're all nobody.

585
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:50,646
You know who nobody is?

586
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:53,607
Nobody is anybody who belongs to somebody.

587
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:57,069
So if you belong to nobody, you're somebody.

588
00:48:57,278 --> 00:48:58,487
Understand?

589
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:04,243
I'm sorry...This is Alice, Charlie, she's a friend of mine. She sings in a nightclub.

590
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:06,287
- Pleased to meet you, Charlie.
- Hello.

591
00:49:07,455 --> 00:49:08,497
- And Miss Born?
- Hello.

592
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:10,124
- Could I try it on?
- It's all yours!

593
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,377
- Well, when's the wedding?
- Right away! - Good, good!

594
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:17,048
We'll invite the whole neighborhood. You wanna have it uptown or downtown?

595
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:18,257
- Uptown.
- Downtown.

596
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:19,967
Anyplace, as long as it's legal!

597
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:22,970
Gee...soft like baby skin.

598
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,555
I bet it cost a lot of dough!

599
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:26,640
Too rich for your blood.

600
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:28,976
Probably Roberts.

601
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:35,566
Hello, Mr. Roberts, we've been waiting for you.

602
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:36,984
Who asked you to wait?

603
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:41,155
- I'm Roberts...You're Charlie Davis.
- Yeah...Pleased to meet you, Mr. Roberts.

604
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:43,824
- This is my mother.
- How do you do, Mrs. Roberts.

605
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,202
And this is my girl. We're gonna get married.

606
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,537
I just bought her a mink coat for a wedding present.

607
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:50,790
And...who's this?

608
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:52,208
That's my friend, Shorty.

609
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,543
- How about a drink, Mr. Roberts?
- Never touch it.

610
00:49:54,752 --> 00:49:56,253
- How do you like the layout?
- Nice.

611
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,714
We've got a wonderful view...you can see the whole park from here.

612
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:01,217
- What's on your mind, Roberts?
- Oh...a social call.

613
00:50:02,009 --> 00:50:03,636
A social call, huh?

614
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:05,763
What kind of a deal did you cook up with Quinn?

615
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:07,807
Lay off, Shorty!

616
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:09,100
Who did you say this was?

617
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:11,894
- That's my friend.
- For how much?

618
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:13,854
Ten percent.

619
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:16,232
Good evening, friend.

620
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:19,777
Good evening, partner.

621
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:22,738
Watch your arm, Charlie!

622
00:50:23,948 --> 00:50:25,825
I told you it was my arm, didn't I?

623
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,166
Well...can we talk?

624
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,377
Yeah...who's this?

625
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:38,087
He's with me.

626
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,381
She's with me.

627
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:42,883
We have to get straightened out on this deal, Charlie.

628
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:46,345
- I thought you arranged that with Quinn?
- I don't talk money with Quinn.

629
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:51,142
- What do you want?
- I only make one kind of deal, Charlie, from now until the time you retire: 50 percent.

630
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,727
50 percent of what?

631
00:50:52,935 --> 00:50:55,563
Quinn gets 30 percent, Shorty gets 10 percent and I get 60.

632
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:58,065
You want a crack at the title, don't you, Charlie?

633
00:50:58,274 --> 00:51:02,361
We start fresh...You're a fresh young kid, so we start fresh.

634
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,905
There's always 100 percent.

635
00:51:05,114 --> 00:51:06,824
You take 50 and I take 50.

636
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,492
Well, what about Quinn?

637
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:12,121
He's your manager. We both need him. You give him 5 percent and I'll give him 5 percent.

638
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:13,789
What about Shorty?

639
00:51:13,998 --> 00:51:16,375
I don't ask you what you give your mother, Charlie, or your girl.

640
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:21,505
You want Shorty for laughs, give him the 10 percent. I pay my expenses, you pay yours.

641
00:51:21,714 --> 00:51:23,132
Shorty gets 10 percent.

642
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:26,594
I told you I only make one kind of deal, Charlie.

643
00:51:26,802 --> 00:51:29,221
This way you fight for the championship right away.

644
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:34,310
Okay...I'll take care of Shorty myself.

645
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:36,812
But...don't say anything about it, huh?

646
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:38,272
He's your friend.

647
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:40,024
You're my partner.

648
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:41,233
It's a deal!

649
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:44,612
Well what about me, Mr. Roberts? What percent do I get?

650
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,032
After all, I made him what he is, because I told him to fight.

651
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,160
In my business, there's only 100 percent.

652
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:55,957
- I'd like to say good night to your mother, Charlie.
- Oh yeah, sure...Ma!

653
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:01,170
Mr. Roberts would like to say good night.

654
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,799
I was awful glad to meet you, Mrs. Davis. You're a lucky woman to have a boy like Charlie.

655
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:07,343
He's going to make a lot of money...enough for everybody.

656
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,013
No more candy store for you. It's a lot nicer, ain't it?

657
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,808
Here...I almost forgot.

658
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:20,189
- What's this?
- Just a little on account, Charlie...I know you must be running short.

659
00:52:20,356 --> 00:52:21,399
Good night, Mrs. Davis.

660
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:26,070
By the way, Charlie...You want to start training right away. The fight goes on in two months, you know.

661
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:27,655
Oh, it can't be too soon for me!

662
00:52:27,863 --> 00:52:29,657
- Oh, and take a tip, kid...
- What's that?

663
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:31,075
Postpone the wedding bells.

664
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,077
Keep your mind on the fight.

665
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,121
Good night, Charlie's girl.

666
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,456
Very nice coat!

667
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:40,835
Remember, after mink comes sable.

668
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,296
- See you, Charlie.
- Good night.

669
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:54,015
Shorty, we got a lot of work to do...

670
00:52:54,223 --> 00:52:55,975
I want you to set up that training camp...

671
00:52:56,183 --> 00:52:59,228
Get ahold of Quinn...tell him to get me the best sparring partners in town.

672
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:01,772
- When do you want to start?
- You heard him...right away.

673
00:53:01,856 --> 00:53:03,149
- Then you're not going to get married?
- You aren't going to get married?

674
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:05,192
Why, sure we're going to get married, but it'll wait.

675
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:07,612
Why can't the fight wait?

676
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,698
Ma, you can't do a thing like that! Explain it to her, will you, Shorty?

677
00:53:10,907 --> 00:53:15,411
Charlie is absolutely right, Mrs. Davis. You can't postpone a fight. We could wait.

678
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:18,581
Why can't we drive up to Greenwich tonight? You can get married right away!

679
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:20,458
No Shorty, we'll wait.

680
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:22,418
That's my baby!

681
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:24,670
And you know what else, Ma?

682
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:27,757
I think you ought to get rid of the candy store and come and live here in a decent place.

683
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:29,800
I live in a decent place, Charlie.

684
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:31,219
Yeah, and it's paid for.

685
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:33,596
Sure...By who?

686
00:53:33,804 --> 00:53:35,348
Not by Roberts!

687
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:39,810
What's the difference? What are you beefing about? It's money, ain't it?

688
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:41,979
You get it Peg, don't you?

689
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:45,942
Yeah, I get it.

690
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:02,083
What's the matter, Charlie?

691
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,338
You ought to keep walking him around...I don't want him to cool off.

692
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:09,257
I've been thinking Charlie...you've been working too hard.

693
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:12,552
Why don't you take a few days off and go to the city and see Peg?

694
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:16,973
Ah, I feel fine.

695
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,392
The last few weeks get kinda tough, don't they, Charlie?

696
00:54:24,438 --> 00:54:25,481
Yeah.

697
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,828
I'm beginning to feel a strain myself.

698
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:40,329
You're overtrained.

699
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:41,789
So are you.

700
00:54:42,373 --> 00:54:43,457
Maybe.

701
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,168
Awfully edgy.

702
00:54:47,003 --> 00:54:49,255
You don't want to overdo it.

703
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:51,299
Neither do you.

704
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:53,634
What have I got to lose?

705
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,096
What have you got to win?

706
00:54:58,389 --> 00:54:59,974
Everything.

707
00:55:04,187 --> 00:55:05,730
Time, Charlie.

708
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,446
When are you going back to the city?

709
00:55:13,654 --> 00:55:16,449
No hurry...The club doesn't open for another week.

710
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:18,034
Maybe you need a week to get ready.

711
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:21,412
I don't think so. I'm beginning to like it up here. I think I'll stay.

712
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:22,830
- Now listen, Alice...
- No, you listen to me.

713
00:55:23,748 --> 00:55:26,250
Don't forget, you made me come up here.

714
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:28,419
Yeah, I'd like to see you get ahead, Alice.

715
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:29,879
What did you ever do about it?

716
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,047
Nothing, I never done anything about it.

717
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:32,757
You done everything about it.

718
00:55:33,382 --> 00:55:35,343
- A job in a nightclub...
- That lousy job?

719
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:39,388
- The clothes you're wearing...
- You want them back? I'll give them back to you in spades!

720
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,561
Take it easy, will you?

721
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,397
You can't take that, can you?

722
00:55:48,898 --> 00:55:49,941
No, I guess I can't.

723
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,819
From me to you, a word of advice...

724
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:55,822
People shouldn't be too ambitious at first.

725
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,949
You drive too fast...you break your neck!

726
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:11,420
Kill him, Charlie. Kill him!

727
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:14,048
Kill him, Charlie. Kill him!...Kill him, Charlie!

728
00:57:34,754 --> 00:57:37,799
We'll get him down to the hospital...Make some xrays...

729
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:40,968
- I'll call an ambulance.
- He's not gonna live.

730
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:43,054
We'll see.

731
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,224
You must have hit him awful hard.

732
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,519
Anything I can do...Anything! Any money...

733
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,020
It'll be all right.

734
00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:53,231
He won't be all right, you know that!

735
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:55,483
Take it easy, Arnold!

736
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:58,194
Go ahead, Charlie, everybody'll be waiting. I'll clean up here.

737
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:01,364
Go ahead, Quinn. Shorty, keep the champagne cold.

738
00:58:01,322 --> 00:58:02,365
- Come on, Charlie.
- Mr. Arnold...

739
00:58:03,658 --> 00:58:06,494
If there's anything I can do, just say the word...Anything!

740
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:14,085
- Come on, Shorty...
- I'll stick around...Drive down to the hospital with him.

741
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:16,045
That's a good idea.

742
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:18,840
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

743
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:26,180
Run along, Shorty. I'll take care of everything here.

744
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:29,809
You promised to have Davis take it easy. Look at him!

745
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:31,227
Maybe he'll die.

746
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:34,897
- You better beat it, Shorty.
- What for?

747
00:58:36,065 --> 00:58:38,359
Who promised to take care of what?

748
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:40,403
Have it your way.

749
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:43,906
- You got any complaints?
- Me? I got no complaints.

750
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:46,534
He got complaints. Maybe he'll die.

751
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:48,286
Everybody dies!

752
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:51,122
You knew Ben had the blood clot in the brain! You promised him...

753
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:54,584
What do you want, a few grand more? You got it.

754
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,714
- Anything on your mind, Shorty?
- Plenty.

755
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,758
Spill it.

756
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:06,220
I don't like being your partner, Roberts...I'm out.

757
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:09,140
And I think after tonight, Charlie'll be out too.

758
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:13,936
You're a little behind the times, Shorty. We're not partners, you were out already.

759
00:59:14,145 --> 00:59:15,897
Whatever you get, you get from Charlie.

760
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:19,108
- He's giving you a handout. Didn't he tell you?
- No.

761
00:59:19,692 --> 00:59:20,860
Check it.

762
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:26,324
Send me the hospital bills.

763
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:40,088
- Thanks, champ!
- Oh wait, you can't do that!

764
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:42,590
Congratulations champ, it was a wonderful fight.

765
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:44,050
Hey, Charlie, throw me those gloves!

766
00:59:45,593 --> 00:59:46,636
- Was it a tough go, Charlie?
- He wouldn't go down, he was like a rock!

767
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:50,181
Who's sitting here, you or him?

768
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,058
That's right, that's right...You saw him, Peg, you saw him!

769
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:53,643
Yes, I saw him, Charlie, I saw him.

770
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,353
There's Shorty, Charlie!

771
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:58,106
Shorty! Hey, Shorty!

772
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,530
We're kings of the world, Shorty!

773
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:07,490
- Aren't you going to join us, Shorty?
- No.

774
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:09,492
- Why not?
- What's the matter?

775
01:00:10,493 --> 01:00:12,537
You didn't win the title, Charlie!

776
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:15,540
Ben was double-crossed. They promised him an easy go.

777
01:00:15,748 --> 01:00:18,334
Where do you get that stuff? Who promised who?

778
01:00:18,543 --> 01:00:21,045
Ben was sick...He had a blood clot, and they all knew!

779
01:00:21,796 --> 01:00:24,173
- A blood clot?...You didn't know that, Charlie, did you?
- No, I didn't...!

780
01:00:25,758 --> 01:00:27,802
It's the old alibi, champ...You'll get used to it.

781
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,096
Come on, let's sit down everybody and celebrate.

782
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:33,975
- What's the matter, Shorty? Don't you think I beat him square?
- You beat him foul!

783
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:36,269
Ask Quinn, ask Roberts.

784
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,982
I don't like partners like Roberts, Charlie...it's rotten enough without them. Tell him he's out!

785
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:44,736
What are you talking about, Shorty? Are you crazy? You want to make trouble? You can't believe everything you hear.

786
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:46,696
Can I believe Roberts?

787
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:48,615
He told me to check with you.

788
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:50,283
He said I was out.

789
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,702
Am I out?

790
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,164
Or are you going to keep giving me the 10 percent for old times' sake?

791
01:00:58,124 --> 01:00:59,000
- Yes.
- I had to tell him, champ...

792
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:02,670
There's only room for one in the driver's seat, and that's you!

793
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:06,049
Sure, what's the difference? We won, didn't we? That's what we wanted!

794
01:01:06,257 --> 01:01:09,177
We didn't win. He won!

795
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:11,721
Come on, let's sit down. We'll talk about it some other time.

796
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,681
We're going to talk about it right now!

797
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,934
That's right...now's the time, now!

798
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:20,939
It's not enough to be great, Charlie. I tried to tell you in Philly. I tried to tell you in L.A. we're infested with rats!

799
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,816
He's not just a kid who can fight, he's money!

800
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:28,029
And people want money so bad they make it stink, and they make you stink!

801
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:35,370
If you don't like the racket, Shorty, you can always quit.

802
01:01:35,954 --> 01:01:38,581
I quit before I ever came in here.

803
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,251
And if he has any sense left, he'll do the same!

804
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:43,878
I'm through and you can keep your pension.

805
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:46,839
Come on, Shorty...Let's all relax. Come on...

806
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:03,231
Shorty...Shorty!

807
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:07,777
Don't run out on me. Don't leave me alone. Because I can't do it all by myself.

808
01:02:07,986 --> 01:02:12,156
Now remember, long ago he came to us and asked us, and we said:
"It's all right, Charlie, go ahead."

809
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:13,449
Now we've got to help him!

810
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:15,034
Nobody can help him.

811
01:02:15,243 --> 01:02:17,203
He's got to help himself.

812
01:02:19,914 --> 01:02:20,957
Shorty!

813
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:30,341
Charlie!

814
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:45,857
Charlie, your hands, look!

815
01:02:52,488 --> 01:02:54,657
We all know you can fight.

816
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,037
Thanks, friend!

817
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,080
Shorty, you're hurt!

818
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,291
- I'm all right...take care of Charlie.
- Come on, Shorty.

819
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,006
Charlie, Shorty's hurt.

820
01:03:13,092 --> 01:03:14,135
Shorty!

821
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:23,436
I tell you he walked right into it! He didn't even look where he was going.

822
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:26,856
It's too late!

823
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:56,469
What's the matter...You lose your key?

824
01:03:56,678 --> 01:03:59,931
No. I'd like to have a cigarette, if you don't mind.

825
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:07,689
If one could only say, Charlie...

826
01:04:08,273 --> 01:04:11,484
that it started here...or there...

827
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,280
But we're in something horrible and we've got to get out.

828
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,283
Well what can I do? Go back to the candy store?

829
01:04:18,491 --> 01:04:20,285
It was an accident.

830
01:04:20,618 --> 01:04:23,037
Only the dying, nothing else?

831
01:04:23,621 --> 01:04:25,665
It was all inevitable.

832
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:28,168
You must quit.

833
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:32,046
It took a long time, Peg!

834
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:34,924
Rotten and hard and tough.

835
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:36,676
Now I'm a champ.

836
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,095
Now it's gonna be easy.

837
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:42,807
I can't stop now...I can't throw it all away.

838
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:44,642
It's what we wanted.

839
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,565
But, Charlie...we can't live with these people! I couldn't bear it.

840
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:53,109
You won't have to see them, or meet them again.

841
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:55,069
We'll live fine...I'll make the money.

842
01:04:55,278 --> 01:04:57,739
I'll look after Ben...Believe me, I'll do everything I can!

843
01:04:57,947 --> 01:04:59,908
But I can't start again.

844
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:02,327
From what? With what?

845
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:08,041
But Charlie...you'll have to start again with nothing anyway someday.

846
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:10,418
Only it'll be worse.

847
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:12,712
You'll be like Ben.

848
01:05:13,463 --> 01:05:14,506
I'm too smart for that.

849
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:18,927
It's nothing to argue, Charlie!

850
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:21,638
I can't live this way.

851
01:05:22,388 --> 01:05:24,015
You'll stop now.

852
01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:27,018
Or I'll stop.

853
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,690
But that's not fair!

854
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:37,070
Was it fair for Shorty to die?

855
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:39,197
It was an accident!

856
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:41,908
And for Ben to fight with a blood clot?

857
01:05:42,117 --> 01:05:43,243
I didn't know.

858
01:05:44,285 --> 01:05:46,621
Charlie...one way or the other.

859
01:05:57,507 --> 01:05:59,008
But I'm the champ!

860
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:02,095
You mean Roberts is.

861
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:04,097
Charlie...

862
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:08,017
I can't marry you.

863
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:11,729
That would just mean marrying him.

864
01:07:36,106 --> 01:07:37,565
Go on, take the money...Take it!

865
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:42,112
Then...how about working with me?

866
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:45,532
It's not charity...I need someone.

867
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:47,867
Someone I can trust.

868
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,411
Okay, Charlie. Okay!

869
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:22,819
Not this time, Charlie.

870
01:08:24,612 --> 01:08:26,031
What's the matter?

871
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:28,116
You know I'm good for the money.

872
01:08:28,324 --> 01:08:30,326
Only if you fight!

873
01:08:30,702 --> 01:08:33,580
- So I'll fight.
- And it's gotta be Marlowe!

874
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:46,801
Leave the door open, you dope!

875
01:08:47,302 --> 01:08:49,721
Are you crazy coming in here in front of everybody?

876
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:51,890
It's a gym...People come and go here.

877
01:08:52,098 --> 01:08:55,018
Besides, I'm an admirer of yours...I like to watch you train.

878
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:57,312
- So you're all set for the Marlowe match?
- Yeah, we're all set.

879
01:08:57,896 --> 01:09:01,524
That's great...The odds are 2 to 1 for you to win. That's a lot of dough...

880
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:03,443
if you bet on Marlowe.

881
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:08,031
I ain't handing no title over to any kid!

882
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:09,532
I can beat him.

883
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:12,285
Betting on yourself to win, Charlie?

884
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:15,205
I didn't think you were punch-drunk yet...

885
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,043
- I think I can beat him.
- You're not thinking, Charlie...you're dreaming.

886
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:23,046
It's only natural after all these years of living good.

887
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:26,216
A fight now and then, the dough rolling in...and the dough rolling out.

888
01:09:26,424 --> 01:09:28,843
You begin to dream this can go on forever.

889
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:31,471
When I lose the championship, they'll have to carry me out.

890
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,432
This gym is full of guys who were carried out.

891
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,559
Mr. Roberts is right, Charlie.

892
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:38,895
You'd like to see me take a dive, wouldn't you?

893
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:41,856
No...why should I? You mean money in the bank to me...

894
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:43,858
But facts are facts, Charlie.

895
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:46,027
- Yeah?
- How much of my money have you got in the bank, Quinn?

896
01:09:46,236 --> 01:09:48,405
How much you got, Charlie?

897
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:53,076
There's 60 grand in there...You wanna count it?

898
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:59,791
60 grand, a clean fast fight, 15 rounds to a decision.

899
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,877
60 grand at 2 to 1, your end of the purse at 2 to 1.

900
01:10:03,086 --> 01:10:05,755
I'm good at figures, Charlie...it'll add up to a fortune.

901
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:09,009
Besides, you don't like fighting anymore...You like living too much.

902
01:10:09,217 --> 01:10:11,136
So why not live the easy life?

903
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:15,307
- Maybe open a caf with this singer, with this...what's her name...
- Alice!

904
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:19,644
- Yeah, Alice.
- You punch the cash register instead of getting punched.

905
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:22,564
You got a million friends, Charlie...You can't miss!

906
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:30,655
All right, Charlie...Let's stop being nice to each other.

907
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,700
We agreed to make a killing on this fight months ago.

908
01:10:33,908 --> 01:10:35,452
You're into me for a lot of dough!

909
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:40,457
I made my arrangements with Marlowe, and a lot of other people.

910
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:43,251
Nobody backs out now.

911
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,462
That's the way it is.

912
01:10:46,296 --> 01:10:50,216
Besides, a lot of guys think Marlowe can beat you on the square.

913
01:10:51,593 --> 01:10:54,429
I don't take no dive for nobody...What do you think I am, a tanker?

914
01:10:54,638 --> 01:10:58,224
Who's asking you to take a dive?
15 rounds to a decision.

915
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:04,397
- 15 rounds to a decision?
- That's right.

916
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:13,531
When you get ready to bet that dough, Charlie...

917
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,034
see that you give it to me to bet for you.

918
01:11:16,242 --> 01:11:18,620
I'll get you a few extra points!

919
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,460
How's the head, Ben?

920
01:11:26,086 --> 01:11:27,379
It's still on, Mr. Roberts...

921
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:28,964
no thanks to you.

922
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:30,632
Are you still sore?

923
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,759
I should have done something for you, Ben!

924
01:11:32,968 --> 01:11:34,511
I like being Charlie's trainer.

925
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,263
Here's a little something to sweeten the past...

926
01:11:40,976 --> 01:11:43,520
I don't take blood money, Mr. Roberts.

927
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:46,064
Mine or anybody else's.

928
01:11:47,983 --> 01:11:50,402
You only have to bend down to pick it up, Ben!

929
01:11:56,533 --> 01:12:00,328
Hey...take it easy, Ben! You mustn't get excited.

930
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:04,332
It's just the pressure, Charlie.

931
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,505
The last couple of weeks, I've been fighting my head all the time.

932
01:12:10,714 --> 01:12:12,674
We've got to get you a real examination, Ben!

933
01:12:12,882 --> 01:12:14,759
Yeah, after the fight.

934
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,055
- Are you all right now?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

935
01:12:22,851 --> 01:12:24,185
Ben...Take the money, Ben!

936
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:27,939
It's not like people. It's got no memory. It don't think!

937
01:12:28,148 --> 01:12:29,274
Did you sell the fight, Charlie?

938
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:33,945
Are you crazy?

939
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:36,740
I'll see you up in camp. Take it easy.

940
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:05,560
Leave the doors open, Quinn, what'll people think?

941
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:07,938
You care?

942
01:13:11,358 --> 01:13:12,484
You sure you're not worried?

943
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:14,402
I got nothing to be worried about.

944
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:16,613
As long as you can keep your mind on the dough...

945
01:13:16,821 --> 01:13:17,948
To the money!

946
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,824
Are you gonna bet?

947
01:13:20,033 --> 01:13:23,453
If I have to beg, borrow and steal, I'm gonna bet this fight.

948
01:13:23,954 --> 01:13:27,707
Just remember baby...I told you about it.

949
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:34,214
You get in on a big fix once in a lifetime...And after it's over?

950
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:37,384
No problem...The boy's gonna make a snootful of dough!

951
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,427
He'll go through it in a year with your help.

952
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:43,014
That gives me a year, Quinn. What about you?

953
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:47,310
I'll find myself another mug. They come and they go but I stay.

954
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:50,188
That's the reason you should listen to me, baby!

955
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:52,190
Don't you ever get tired?

956
01:13:53,316 --> 01:13:56,862
No...I got no time for pride!

957
01:13:58,363 --> 01:14:01,116
He could have had the whole world, so he leaned over sideways and grabbed you!

958
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:02,909
Nobody grabbed me, I grabbed him!

959
01:14:03,118 --> 01:14:05,912
Sure, baby, sure! All love in the yard wide. But every time he's low-down,

960
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:08,582
he's gone to Peg. He's not gonna feel so high after this fight.

961
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,084
I don't care where his heart is, only the money!

962
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:12,711
What about me, how I feel?

963
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:14,963
Don't romance me, Quinn. You're getting old.

964
01:14:15,172 --> 01:14:17,591
You could use a new paint job yourself.

965
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:23,805
And I know where to get it.

966
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,135
Hey Charlie, who you hiding?

967
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:05,263
How about going out, cutie?

968
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:15,690
Charlie, take it easy!

969
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:41,860
Early delivery today.

970
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:46,073
But Charlie...come in.

971
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,305
- Trouble?
- No...no.

972
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:15,268
I better make some coffee, you look as if you need some.

973
01:17:18,522 --> 01:17:20,899
Isn't this a trifle early for you?

974
01:17:21,108 --> 01:17:22,901
No, I got up early this morning.

975
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,237
That is, I didn't get to sleep.

976
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,656
Oh? Celebrating the Marlowe match?

977
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:29,950
I tried to.

978
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:34,121
I thought you skipped all the places in the papers that mentioned my name.

979
01:17:36,415 --> 01:17:39,209
On the contrary, I read about you religiously.

980
01:17:40,585 --> 01:17:41,920
Orange juice?

981
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,713
Sure.

982
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:56,685
Yes, I've been promoted since you were last here.

983
01:17:56,893 --> 01:17:59,521
I'm a fully fledged designer now.

984
01:17:59,396 --> 01:18:00,439
That's great.

985
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:05,652
well, good health!

986
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,992
What is it this time, Charlie?

987
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,579
Last time you came it was because you were bored.

988
01:18:15,787 --> 01:18:17,873
And the year before, you were lonely...

989
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:21,251
Once it was your birthday, twice it was mine...

990
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:24,588
What's the occasion now?

991
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:33,597
I don't understand.

992
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:38,310
I worked very late last night so I'm not very bright this morning, but I'll try and I'll...

993
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:39,728
What do you want?

994
01:18:39,936 --> 01:18:43,231
Advice? Comfort? Recriminations...

995
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,525
I brought this, too.

996
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:51,114
It doesn't look like me. It's bad technique.

997
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:52,949
Isn't this your problem?

998
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:54,868
Don't you want it anymore?

999
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:55,702
No.

1000
01:18:58,246 --> 01:18:59,748
I just don't understand...

1001
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:01,958
Now...I'm still half asleep...

1002
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:05,796
If you don't want it anymore, why return it after all these years?

1003
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,550
I want you.

1004
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,479
Well here I am, Charlie.

1005
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:31,613
Peg...I'm scared...so low-down, I...

1006
01:19:31,822 --> 01:19:35,951
I had to see, I wanted to know, I had to find out, once and for all, I had to know!

1007
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:39,037
And we won't be broke...it's my last fight...

1008
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:41,206
Look, I got 60 grand and more to come and I'll...

1009
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:44,209
Don't tell me what you can get me, don't tell me what you can buy.

1010
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,169
You've got nothing to buy.

1011
01:19:46,378 --> 01:19:49,047
I...I said all that once before, didn't I?

1012
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,591
Don't talk, Charlie. Just sit.

1013
01:19:51,842 --> 01:19:56,305
Because you'll only start saying those things you've learned to say.
Not what you once were.

1014
01:19:56,888 --> 01:19:58,682
What you are.

1015
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,728
Ever since Irma left, it runs over!

1016
01:20:03,478 --> 01:20:05,480
Irma! Where is she?

1017
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:06,898
In Texas.

1018
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:09,359
Texas? Doing what?

1019
01:20:09,568 --> 01:20:10,944
She's married.

1020
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,823
She married the first guy that ever bought a statue from her!

1021
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:16,450
Is she happy?

1022
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:17,618
Oh, deliriously!

1023
01:20:17,826 --> 01:20:20,454
It all happened on a rainy afternoon.

1024
01:20:21,204 --> 01:20:25,626
Things happen that way. Sometimes you...you wait very long for happiness.

1025
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:28,962
And sometimes you fall over it just before you learn to walk.

1026
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,798
She just walked it all...Or jumping!

1027
01:20:32,215 --> 01:20:34,509
I must be jumping, I can't think why.

1028
01:20:34,718 --> 01:20:36,762
I think I'm ill, I'm running a high...

1029
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:41,350
What am I talking about, do you know?

1030
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:49,399
Do you know what it's like to love, and be alone?

1031
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,122
Don't poke it...pat it gently.

1032
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,666
Is it spoiled?
- No, no...

1033
01:21:50,711 --> 01:21:52,796
I'm trying to be useful.

1034
01:21:53,171 --> 01:21:55,090
Then get me a saucer.

1035
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,680
There...Let the expert have a taste.

1036
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:08,061
One pretty woman in the family's enough.

1037
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:17,696
More.

1038
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:21,033
You approve?

1039
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:27,164
You know, that's a taste that never leaves your mouth!

1040
01:22:27,372 --> 01:22:29,374
The expert approves!

1041
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:35,380
Say, I meant to ask you...What did the old lady say when I told you this was my last fight?

1042
01:22:36,798 --> 01:22:38,175
She cried.

1043
01:22:38,383 --> 01:22:41,887
And then she said the most beautiful thing I've ever heard in my life.
- What?

1044
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:48,268
She said she didn't think that at her age she could fall in love again.

1045
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:49,519
With who?

1046
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,896
Us.

1047
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:00,948
By the way...What did you do with all my money?

1048
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:02,783
I put it in my bank.

1049
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:05,827
Well, in the morning I'll go down with you and pick it up.
- What for?

1050
01:23:06,703 --> 01:23:08,455
I need it.
- Why?

1051
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:10,332
To bet on the fight.

1052
01:23:12,209 --> 01:23:15,921
Charlie, if you lose the fight and the money, then you'll want to fight again...

1053
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:20,008
No, no, I'm not going to give you the money to bet. We're rich enough.

1054
01:23:24,721 --> 01:23:27,850
Charlie!...Charlie, you're a sight for sore eyes.

1055
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:28,892
Hello, Shimen!

1056
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:31,103
Good to see you! You look wonderful...He looks fine.

1057
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:34,064
You know Miss Born, Charlie's fiance?

1058
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:35,899
This I suspected. Here you are, Mrs. Davis...

1059
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:40,779
Charlie, something special for you.

1060
01:23:40,988 --> 01:23:42,739
Straight from the Garden of Eden.
- Thanks!

1061
01:23:42,948 --> 01:23:44,616
Have some wine, Shimen.
- What's the occasion?

1062
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,244
Charlie's last fight.
- You don't say.

1063
01:23:47,744 --> 01:23:48,871
Don't spread it around, Shimen!

1064
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:50,581
I'm like a grave.

1065
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:53,208
Does that mean you won't fight anymore?
- That's right.

1066
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:56,003
So you'll retire champion...That's bad?

1067
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:57,421
It's good!

1068
01:23:58,463 --> 01:24:01,967
To the future retired champion of the world...good luck!

1069
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:06,513
And to my five dollars that I bet on the fight, good luck too.

1070
01:24:09,266 --> 01:24:14,438
Excuse me...Charlie, everybody is betting on you. The whole neighborhood, like you was the Irish Sweepstakes!

1071
01:24:14,646 --> 01:24:16,857
People shouldn't bet.
- No, no, Mrs. Davis...

1072
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,736
It isn't the money. It's a way of showing.

1073
01:24:20,944 --> 01:24:25,616
Over in Europe, the Nazis are killing people like us, just because of their religion.

1074
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:28,535
But here, Charlie Davis is champion.

1075
01:24:29,036 --> 01:24:32,122
So you'll win and you'll retire champion.

1076
01:24:32,331 --> 01:24:34,208
And we are proud, period.

1077
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:41,715
And Charlie, when you leave, stop in and say toodle-doo.

1078
01:24:48,555 --> 01:24:51,558
What's the matter with people, anyway?
Why do they have to bet?

1079
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:54,228
It's a racket, don't they know? They know it's a racket.

1080
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:55,979
People gamble.

1081
01:24:56,396 --> 01:24:59,358
Well, they're suckers! Tell them not to bet on me.

1082
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:03,278
I'm too old to walk up and down New York telling people not to bet. Especially when they win.

1083
01:25:03,487 --> 01:25:05,405
You don't win all the time, you can lose, too.

1084
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:07,741
Suckers like Shimen shouldn't bet!
- Suckers like Shimen?

1085
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:11,995
You didn't hear what he said, Charlie...It isn't the five dollars that's important...

1086
01:25:12,204 --> 01:25:13,330
I heard, I heard...I can still lose!

1087
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:16,708
That's right, Charlie! So why bet, why take a chance?

1088
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:19,378
Well you don't understand. It's a diffrent thing.

1089
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:22,381
I don't want to quit without money. I don't want to end up broke!

1090
01:25:22,548 --> 01:25:25,801
Broke? You have $60,000, you could stop right now.

1091
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:27,886
Stop now, are you kidding?

1092
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:30,139
There's a million bucks riding on my back!

1093
01:25:30,347 --> 01:25:32,141
If I don't fight, I don't get a dime.

1094
01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:35,435
I'm all mobbed up, tied hand and foot, down to my last buck.

1095
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:39,440
You think I want to end up like Ben, punchy, with a blood clot on the brain, ready to die any day...

1096
01:25:39,648 --> 01:25:41,233
Or with a bullet in my back in an alley?

1097
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:43,569
What do you mean, bullet?

1098
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,988
Don't you understand? The fight's fixed!

1099
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:49,616
Fixed? What does it mean, fixed?

1100
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:58,625
It...it means I'm...I'm throwing the fight.
- Throwing the fight?

1101
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:02,463
It means I'm gonna lose, it's all arranged!

1102
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:05,090
It's a racket anyway. That's why I want to bet the 60 grand.

1103
01:26:05,299 --> 01:26:06,675
You get it Peg, don't you?

1104
01:26:07,259 --> 01:26:08,719
Yeah, I get it.

1105
01:26:08,927 --> 01:26:11,013
It's an investment, a sure thing...

1106
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:17,519
Well what do you want? What are you looking at?

1107
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:21,732
Then you didn't understand what Shimen said.

1108
01:26:22,065 --> 01:26:25,569
It's none of my business what they think or what they do! Nobody looks out for me!

1109
01:26:25,778 --> 01:26:28,489
Poor Charlie, nobody's looking out for you.

1110
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:32,201
You're all so high and mighty!

1111
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:36,330
You wouldn't even have that dirty candy store if it wasn't for me! You wouldn't have a dime, the clothes on your back!

1112
01:26:36,538 --> 01:26:40,000
It's my money, isn't it? You were in such a hurry to take it and slap it in the bank.

1113
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:43,670
Sure, you said "We're rich enough", like the rest of them.
But it comes out of my hide!

1114
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:46,215
I take the beatings and you take the dough, like all the rest of them!

1115
01:26:46,423 --> 01:26:47,966
Well, this time I'm taking care of the dough.

1116
01:26:48,175 --> 01:26:49,635
Give me back that 60 grand!

1117
01:26:50,094 --> 01:26:52,012
Yeah, that's right.

1118
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,599
I'm like the rest of them.

1119
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:57,309
So you want your money back?

1120
01:26:57,518 --> 01:27:00,562
Well take it back! And everything else you've given me.

1121
01:27:01,605 --> 01:27:03,732
Here! What everybody gives you!

1122
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:07,653
The long years of happiness, the promises broken,

1123
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:09,696
the lonely nights!

1124
01:27:27,506 --> 01:27:28,799
That's enough, Charlie.

1125
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,595
Take it easy for the rest of the day, Charlie.

1126
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:37,975
Been that way for two months, boys, there's no stopping him.

1127
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:39,601
It's gonna be a Marlowe massacre!

1128
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:40,853
You're looking great, champ!

1129
01:27:41,061 --> 01:27:44,273
Thanks, Pete. I feel fine. I can even name the round.
- Good.

1130
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:28,776
The last night, eh, Charlie?
- Yeah...

1131
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:42,539
I always get a sort of sad feeling when I see them breaking camp.

1132
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:46,335
Tearing down the ring, collecting the gear...

1133
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:55,094
It always felt so good after a win.

1134
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,138
Walk down Lennox Avenue,

1135
01:28:58,347 --> 01:29:00,599
the kids all crazy for you, and proud...

1136
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:03,769
Champion of the world, for the whole world to know.

1137
01:29:07,898 --> 01:29:09,817
You fixed the fight, didn't you?

1138
01:29:11,318 --> 01:29:13,112
I been worried about you, Ben.

1139
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,281
The three or four times in the last month you fainted.

1140
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,617
But I got it all arranged.

1141
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:21,412
It's not like a hospital. They've got doctors...

1142
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:24,873
They give you tests, it's kind of like a check-up.

1143
01:29:25,082 --> 01:29:28,836
You know your head's been getting worse.
A fella's got to take care of himself.

1144
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:32,423
Yeah...it's been pretty bad lately.

1145
01:29:32,631 --> 01:29:34,383
That's why I shouldn't have fought you.

1146
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:38,304
But look Charlie, you can lick Marlowe.

1147
01:29:38,512 --> 01:29:40,347
He's fast, but he ain't got what it takes.

1148
01:29:40,556 --> 01:29:43,392
If you keep on top of him, he'll go down, I know!

1149
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,146
I got you covered, Ben.
You haven't got a thing to worry about.

1150
01:29:47,354 --> 01:29:48,856
The bet's in there for you too.

1151
01:29:49,064 --> 01:29:50,566
That's what I figured!

1152
01:29:50,774 --> 01:29:53,193
I knew that day at the gymnasium.

1153
01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:56,780
All this monkey business with the training to run the odds up against Marlowe,

1154
01:29:56,989 --> 01:29:59,283
and you're not really training at all.

1155
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:02,202
What are you ducking out on, Charlie?

1156
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:04,246
You can be on top for years yet.

1157
01:30:05,289 --> 01:30:08,167
That's the way things are, Ben. That's the way they are.

1158
01:30:09,543 --> 01:30:12,338
There'll be a big chunk of dough, and I'm through. It's enough.

1159
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:13,672
Why?

1160
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:15,674
There's nobody in your class.

1161
01:30:16,425 --> 01:30:18,385
Look, I've watched this Marlowe...studied him.

1162
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:21,347
He backs away and shoots a left and backs away.

1163
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:24,350
You keep on top of him and he'll go down, I know he'll go down!

1164
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:25,768
Look...I'll show you.

1165
01:30:26,644 --> 01:30:30,356
Look Charlie...keep on top of him like this, see? And then one good punch!

1166
01:30:30,564 --> 01:30:32,149
I know...I know.

1167
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,115
Maybe it's Roberts talked to you a little too fast.

1168
01:30:40,324 --> 01:30:42,201
I'd like a word with you, Ben.

1169
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:48,874
- Say, Mr. Roberts...
- When are you leaving?

1170
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,668
Tomorrow, when Charlie leaves.

1171
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:52,795
I think you'd better go tonight.

1172
01:30:53,003 --> 01:30:54,046
Where to, Mr. Roberts?

1173
01:30:54,254 --> 01:30:56,840
- Where we don't have to see you.
- Now take it easy.

1174
01:30:57,049 --> 01:30:59,760
I'm taking it easy. We'll get somebody else for your corner, Charlie.

1175
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,512
Let Charlie take care of that!

1176
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,306
It's taken care of. Get out tonight.

1177
01:31:04,515 --> 01:31:06,225
And keep your mouth shut.

1178
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:08,060
Now wait a minute, Roberts, maybe Ben is right.

1179
01:31:08,269 --> 01:31:11,605
What's our hurry? Maybe we figured this Marlowe wrong. Maybe we can cover!

1180
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:14,316
Don't second-guess me, Charlie. It's all set.

1181
01:31:14,525 --> 01:31:17,569
You bet your pile on yourself to lose. So what are we talking about?

1182
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:21,115
I told Quinn to dump you months ago. He said Charlie wanted you.

1183
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:23,158
Well, Charlie doesn't want you anymore.

1184
01:31:23,367 --> 01:31:24,493
Let Charlie tell me!

1185
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:33,752
I'm telling you. Start running!

1186
01:31:34,211 --> 01:31:35,838
You double-crossed me before.

1187
01:31:36,046 --> 01:31:39,508
I'm through, done washed up! I don't scare easy anymore!
- Take it easy.

1188
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:41,176
You're punchy, Ben, your head's soft!

1189
01:31:41,385 --> 01:31:42,344
Leave him alone, he's sick!

1190
01:31:42,553 --> 01:31:44,388
I let you stay on Charlie's pension list...

1191
01:31:44,597 --> 01:31:47,683
- You don't tell me how to live!
- No, but I'll tell you how to die...

1192
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:50,311
- Take it easy, Ben...
- Get this crazy punch-drunk wreck out of here!

1193
01:31:51,478 --> 01:31:53,981
Come on, I don't scare anymore! I don't scare anymore!

1194
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:55,649
Ben...Ben!

1195
01:32:06,577 --> 01:32:10,122
Ben, get up, will you?...Come on, Ben...Ben!

1196
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,333
Ben, come on, get up...Ben!

1197
01:32:14,418 --> 01:32:17,546
- Ben, you'll be all right...come on, get up.
- Oh, Charlie...sIt's the same room...Just like I told you...

1198
01:32:17,254 --> 01:32:18,297
Get a doctor, will you?
- No! No!

1199
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:21,717
I don't want no doctor! I don't want anything! I can take him!

1200
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:25,638
Let him wear himself out.

1201
01:32:30,059 --> 01:32:31,101
I can take him! I can take him!

1202
01:32:33,187 --> 01:32:35,648
I can take it! I've gotta take it! I'm the champ!

1203
01:32:48,702 --> 01:32:50,454
I think he's dead.

1204
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:32,621
Ben...

1205
01:33:34,707 --> 01:33:35,624
Ben!

1206
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:37,835
Hello, champ!

1207
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:44,508
Better get ready. You only got a few minutes.

1208
01:33:45,134 --> 01:33:46,177
Did you have a good sleep?
- Yeah.

1209
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,181
I hear Marlowe was so nervous he could barely sit still.

1210
01:33:50,848 --> 01:33:54,018
He ain't taking it easy...lying back so relaxed.

1211
01:33:54,226 --> 01:33:56,687
He's got plenty to be nervous about, too.

1212
01:33:56,896 --> 01:33:58,147
Because they're certainly going to carry him

1213
01:33:58,355 --> 01:33:59,773
out of that ring.

1214
01:34:00,816 --> 01:34:03,402
Makes you feel kinda funny, not having Ben with you.

1215
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:05,196
He was a great champ.

1216
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:08,073
Laying the bet, get ready!

1217
01:34:09,992 --> 01:34:13,245
I was talking to a few of the reporters, out in the hall...They asked me how you felt.

1218
01:34:13,454 --> 01:34:15,873
I says, "How do you think a champ feels?

1219
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:17,541
"He's sleeping inside."

1220
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:19,585
Yeah...dreaming.

1221
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:57,456
Introducing the worthy contender...

1222
01:34:57,665 --> 01:35:02,586
that fast and rugged boy from the Lone Star State...

1223
01:35:02,795 --> 01:35:05,089
Jackie Marlowe!

1224
01:35:12,096 --> 01:35:14,640
And now, introducing a great champion

1225
01:35:14,849 --> 01:35:17,434
who has met and defeated

1226
01:35:17,643 --> 01:35:19,979
all the leading contenders,

1227
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:22,273
the champion of the world,

1228
01:35:23,315 --> 01:35:25,067
Charlie Davis!

1229
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:15,284
Come on, boys...Break this and fight!

1230
01:36:18,412 --> 01:36:20,498
Boo...Boo!

1231
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,053
Come on...Make a surprise...make a surprise!

1232
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:43,437
Boo!

1233
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,631
There's still no action in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
The champion looks badly out of condition.

1234
01:37:16,804 --> 01:37:18,889
Okay, boys...I warned you for the last time...Fight!

1235
01:37:34,947 --> 01:37:37,158
- What round is it?
- It's the end of the 12th.

1236
01:37:37,366 --> 01:37:38,617
I'll fall down before the 15th.

1237
01:38:21,452 --> 01:38:22,495
Hit!

1238
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:46,477
Three...four...five...

1239
01:39:07,331 --> 01:39:11,502
One...two...three...four...five...

1240
01:39:32,982 --> 01:39:34,650
You sold me out, you rat!

1241
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:36,986
Take a dive and finish it.

1242
01:39:37,194 --> 01:39:38,529
Sold out like Ben.

1243
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:40,406
It looks like we have a new champion!

1244
01:39:41,073 --> 01:39:42,658
All right, buddy...He just lost his head, is all.

1245
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:50,708
When the bell rings, get in there and finish him, son!

1246
01:39:51,459 --> 01:39:52,335
<i>I'll kill him! I'll kill him!</i>

1247
01:40:26,577 --> 01:40:27,620
Down, Charlie!...Stay down!

1248
01:40:57,858 --> 01:40:58,901
Get him, Charlie...Get him!

1249
01:40:59,944 --> 01:41:00,987
Charlie!

1250
01:41:38,065 --> 01:41:39,734
The guy's crazy! He's crazy!

1251
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:41,986
I'm gonna kill him.

1252
01:41:42,194 --> 01:41:43,571
Take a dive and finish it!
- I'm gonna kill him!...I'm gonna kill him.

1253
01:41:47,325 --> 01:41:49,160
Keep running and you'll be champ!

1254
01:41:49,368 --> 01:41:52,705
You're behind in points, anyway.
You've gotta knock him out to win.

1255
01:41:53,164 --> 01:41:54,624
You know what you're doing, Charlie?

1256
01:42:01,088 --> 01:42:03,382
Last round coming up. Stay away from him.

1257
01:42:16,604 --> 01:42:18,481
I've never seen anything like it before in my life.

1258
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:21,192
A great silence has descended over this crowd.

1259
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,069
They seem to sense the kill.

1260
01:42:23,277 --> 01:42:26,280
There's fear in Marlowe's eyes, as Davis looks for an opening.

1261
01:42:36,499 --> 01:42:40,294
Davis is following Marlowe around the ring now like a tiger stalking its prey.

1262
01:44:06,672 --> 01:44:09,592
By a knockout, the winner...

1263
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,136
still champion of the world...

1264
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:31,614
Charlie!

1265
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:46,671
Back in my league now, aren't you baby?

1266
01:44:53,511 --> 01:44:55,346
Congratulations, champ.

1267
01:45:02,019 --> 01:45:04,147
Get yourself a new boy.

1268
01:45:04,355 --> 01:45:05,314
I retire.

1269
01:45:05,523 --> 01:45:08,401
What makes you think you can get away with this?

1270
01:45:08,609 --> 01:45:10,069
What are you going to do?

1271
01:45:10,278 --> 01:45:11,654
Kill me?

1272
01:45:12,029 --> 01:45:14,115
Everybody dies!

1273
01:45:15,408 --> 01:45:18,619
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie?
- Hey, let her through!

1274
01:45:19,704 --> 01:45:21,664
Are you all right Charlie? Are you all right?

1275
01:45:25,418 --> 01:45:27,879
I never felt better in my life!

1276
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,071
