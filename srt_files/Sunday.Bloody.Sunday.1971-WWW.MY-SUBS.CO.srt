1
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,467
Tell me if you feel anything at all.

2
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,529
- Here?
- No.

3
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,374
- How about there?
- No.

4
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,641
Here?

5
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,942
No.

6
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:04,247
I think we ought to Iose a Iittle weight.

7
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:08,219
Why do doctors always say "we"?

8
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:10,247
As if it were your pain?

9
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,184
No.

10
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:16,662
How about here?

11
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:18,722
That's it. My appendix side.

12
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:21,064
You shouldn't read
those medical journals.

13
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,570
It's probably the worry
that's hurting you.

14
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:27,438
You thought you had a brain tumor once
and it was your bowler hat.

15
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,809
- This does hurt.
- Yes.

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,341
I think perhaps it's a good idea
if we got you in for a few tests.

17
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:39,410
Tests? There's something critical?

18
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:41,978
There's nothing critical.

19
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:45,383
There's no question of that.

20
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,951
It's just in case there is colitis.

21
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,054
You are hiding something from me.

22
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:54,261
I'm not hiding anything from you.
This may be nothing at all.

23
00:01:55,936 --> 00:02:00,270
Give me a moment, will you?
I've got to be sure, OK?

24
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:03,175
Sorry. No, I can't. I'm with a patient.

25
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:07,245
- Do you want me to Ieave?
- No, of course not.

26
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:10,682
Can I ring you back?

27
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:13,278
It shouldn't be Iong but I can't now.

28
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:16,648
Just try and stay in for a few moments.

29
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,858
Can't you stay there for a few moments?

30
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:22,488
- I'm in a terrible hurry.
- Right.

31
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,026
- Can we arrange tests for next week?
- I can't next week.

32
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:30,401
- I've got to go to Brussels.
- The week after, then.

33
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,429
I think I'm going to Frankfurt.

34
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:35,636
Which is more important -
the pain or Frankfurt?

35
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:39,168
I'd rather you told me now, at this stage.
I mean...

36
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,881
Listen, old friend.

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,911
It's not cancer.

38
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:51,491
- How do you know?
- Because I'm telling you.

39
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:56,018
My secretary will be
in touch with you on Monday.

40
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:25,248
Pool Hotel?

41
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:29,522
Message desk.

42
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,192
- What was the name?
- Dr. Daniel Hirsh.

43
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:37,364
- Oh! Dr. Hearsh!
- What were those calls?

44
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,396
Just a minute.

45
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,431
There was a call from Dr. Simon,

46
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:45,571
a call from Mrs. Burke, you have
the number, and one from Mr. Elgin.

47
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,411
Did Mr. Elkin say how Iong he'd be in?

48
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,440
He was going straight out.

49
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:53,419
He must have changed his mind.
He's in. It's engaged.

50
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,446
It might be someone else ringing him.

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,685
I know, but he needs to talk to me

52
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,251
before he goes away for the weekend.

53
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:03,286
Oh, never mind.

54
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,426
In future, try and get his name
roughly right. It adds a personal touch.

55
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:11,802
It's Elkin, not Elgin or Alvin
or Alcott or Higgins.

56
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,103
You've been taking it Iong enough.

57
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,132
Will you be picking up now?

58
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:19,510
No, I'm going out. Thank you. Goodbye.

59
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:33,142
Christ.

60
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,030
- Hello?
- Answering service?

61
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:51,902
I'm Iate. This is Alex Greville.
What's the time? My watch stopped.

62
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:54,373
- It's five to six.
- Oh, no.

63
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:58,174
If Mr. Elkin should ring,
tell him I'm on my way

64
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:01,181
but I had to booze with a client
who's had the push.

65
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,048
I tried to ring him but he must have Ieft.

66
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:06,746
- Is the traffic bad?
- It's always bad here.

67
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,153
It would be different round you.

68
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,783
Worse, of course, Iike your weather. Bye.

69
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,223
Sod it!

70
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,057
- It's not there at all.
- Babstock Passage.

71
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,931
- It's probably upstairs anyway.
- Excuse me.

72
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:58,200
- Is there a hat shop in here?
- I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm in a hurry.

73
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:00,069
I thought there was, dear.

74
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:10,606
Now, with the time exactly on
the half-hour, Iet's go to the news room.

75
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:15,247
With Britain in the throes of its most
serious economic crisis since the war,

76
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,089
the cabinet will be in
continuous session over the weekend.

77
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,026
So will trade union Ieaders

78
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,552
faced with the threat
of mass unemployment

79
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:26,122
and militant unofficial strike action.

80
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,657
The sharp increase in the bank rate

81
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:31,500
and the tough new restrictions
on bank Ioans

82
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:35,838
were attacked today by the TUC,
who said that hundreds...

83
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,777
Let me come alone.
I can Iook after the kids.

84
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:44,011
Alex, bring Bob.
It'll be good for you both.

85
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:46,645
- Trust me.
- Alva, Alva...

86
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,656
..the duty on a wide range of products.

87
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,851
One car manufacturer said...

88
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:12,234
2830811. Hello?

89
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,907
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

90
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:18,349
Darling, are you stuck somewhere?
What's the matter?

91
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:22,185
I shouldn't have said yes
to this weekend. Can Bob hear you?

92
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:25,123
I shouldn't think so,
with all this going on!

93
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,719
Timothy, you've started John Stuart off.

94
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:31,495
It will go fine. Look, talk to Bob.

95
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,501
No, I don't want to talk to him.

96
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:38,198
I'm sorry I've held you up.
I was going to put the kids to bed.

97
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:42,174
They always go to bed at this time.
You'll have a Iie-in.

98
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,336
Mummy says it's nice for them

99
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:47,370
if they put us to bed together.
Bob and Alex.

100
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:51,248
Alex, don't worry, darling. Trust me.

101
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,946
Lucy, don't forget to turn
the shepherd's pie down.

102
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,980
Have you got the other one?

103
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,515
Alva.

104
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,858
I'm so sorry.

105
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:04,955
The traffic!

106
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,861
- I'm so sorry.
- It really doesn't matter.

107
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,928
You won't be there till midnight.

108
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,906
It's better to be there Iate.

109
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,868
- You know Professor Johns.
- How do you do? I'm terribly sorry.

110
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:23,041
- And how are you?
- Two bleeding hours Iate, miss.

111
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,482
Don't.

112
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,617
He recognizes you!

113
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:31,522
Lucy, tell Carl not to eat
all the monkey's bananas.

114
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,026
Bye, the Iate Miss Greville.

115
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:38,262
- Papa made a joke!
- What?

116
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,960
Papa made a joke!

117
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:44,129
He said to Alex,
"the Iate Miss Greville."

118
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:48,232
- She is terrifically Iate.
- No, darling...

119
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,210
You're never Iate. What happened?

120
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:55,147
- Just couldn't get going.
- You know he's eaten already.

121
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,548
- What?
- He only has one meal a day.

122
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:00,212
Two pounds raw tomorrow.
I think I've got it.

123
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:03,519
Don't Iet the economic crisis
spoil your weekend.

124
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:06,458
It is worrying about
the cost of Iiving index.

125
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:09,929
- Go away!
- Be a good family. Bye!

126
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,693
Bye.

127
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:19,396
Have a good time!
Enjoy yourselves! Bye!

128
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,270
Come on, dog.

129
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:25,939
Daniel Hirsh wouldn't just turn up
this weekend, would he?

130
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,970
He knows we're away.

131
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:34,452
I never minded any of the sacrifices
God required of me...

132
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,149
Except one.

133
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,455
I was terrified he'd make me
give up football.

134
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,389
Come here.

135
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,921
When you incur a penalty...

136
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,664
What have you got that on for?

137
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:53,400
- I don't know.
- Well, take it off.

138
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,299
It's this house.

139
00:10:56,343 --> 00:11:00,006
And this room! It's so bloody freezing!

140
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:07,109
You're Iike a Iittle fire!

141
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,251
I do Iove you.

142
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:18,054
Well, thank you, sir.

143
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,072
Good night.

144
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,564
If you get up, I'll kill you.

145
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,369
Yes, I'm just coming.

146
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:11,214
It's me, Lucy, just to say
I'll Iook after John Stuart for you.

147
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:14,311
She sounds Iike somebody's
mother-in-Iaw, Ioitering.

148
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,413
It's all right. I'll manage.

149
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:22,557
Do you think Alva and Bill had that
disgusting octopus they gave to us?

150
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:26,157
Perhaps they'll be sick in the middle
of the sociologists.

151
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,429
- I want some milk.
- Oh, my God!

152
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:30,834
You're getting more Iike an American.

153
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,066
I want some wine.

154
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,800
- What's this?
- I don't know.

155
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,971
It Iooks special. I'll ask Lucy tomorrow.

156
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:44,450
Oh, I Iove Alva.
Fancy having those posters in here.

157
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:47,044
But Alva does that sort of thing.

158
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:50,648
What she would really, really Iike

159
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:53,216
is for us to get engaged in her bed.

160
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,194
Oh, my God.

161
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:58,288
She's Iike a CIA agent for happy families.

162
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,527
And we're her guinea pigs.

163
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,297
Oh, no, we're not.

164
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:06,431
Are we? Oh, why did we come?

165
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,899
Because you're soft.

166
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:12,505
No.

167
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:16,380
Because it's a chance
for a whole weekend together.

168
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,848
You Iocked Kenyatta out
of your bedroom. He sleeps on your bed.

169
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,257
- So sorry.
- I suppose you didn't mean to.

170
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:33,365
- Is this milk all right for Bob to drink?
- It's Mummy's.

171
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,302
- She wouldn't mind, would she?
- It's Mummy's milk for John Stuart.

172
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,737
He isn't weaned yet.

173
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:44,100
Oh, my God.

174
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,135
Thank you very much.

175
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,151
Shut up.

176
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:16,298
Come on, then. There's a good boy.

177
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,236
Come on, then. Come on.

178
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:37,644
Serves you right
for pinching my breakfast.

179
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:41,586
- Papa paid for it.
- There's socialism for you.

180
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,248
What does he mean?

181
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,191
Thank you so very much
for bringing up the tray.

182
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:49,024
Mummy said you'd Iike a Iie-in in peace.

183
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:51,860
Did she mention you
bringing the tray and staying?

184
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:54,332
We always come in here first thing.

185
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,768
Then we watch Mama and Papa
have a bath together.

186
00:16:57,804 --> 00:16:59,396
Oh, my God.

187
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:04,902
There's a most peculiar smell.
It's exactly Iike p...

188
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:10,578
Are you children smoking pot?

189
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,448
Are you bourgeois?

190
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:14,715
I don't mind, but does Mummy know?

191
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:18,087
They keep it behind the records
so we know where it is.

192
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,922
Behind Tristan and Isolde.

193
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,527
I suppose it doesn't matter.

194
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:22,285
- What are you doing?
- Resigning.

195
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,313
From my job at the office.

196
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,291
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

197
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,455
I should have done it ages ago.

198
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,296
What will you do instead?

199
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:46,538
It's not because of me, is it?

200
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,480
No, my duck, it is not because of you.

201
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,848
You turn everything to yourself.

202
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:02,918
What shall we do with them today?

203
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:13,361
What's wrong?

204
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,601
Do you want to go out?

205
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:22,877
Is it so difficult to say that to me?

206
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,078
No.

207
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,610
Just want to go into town for a bit.

208
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,088
OK, fine.

209
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,617
But you don't have to go to work.

210
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,398
Oh, I see.

211
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:43,635
Could it be...

212
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,197
that you are going to see someone
whose name begins with D?

213
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,869
- With D-A? Am I getting warm?
- Time's up.

214
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,842
- Back soon.
- Give me a ring.

215
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,872
Oh, no, you won't have time.

216
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,808
Have fun with...

217
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,630
One of the things is,
I can't stand the dirt he brings home.

218
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:20,896
- I'm so sorry.
- Tell me...

219
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,704
how Iong is it since you've Ied a...

220
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:26,234
normal married Iife with him?

221
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,681
How Iong is it?

222
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,709
I can't complain.

223
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:38,417
You mean he hasn't
been near you for a Iong time?

224
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:43,589
- Or is it that you haven't wanted him to?
- He's never forced himself on me.

225
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,731
Have you ever thought of Iiving apart?

226
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:51,760
I couldn't do that. It would kill him.

227
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,365
Sometimes people survive better apart,

228
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:00,442
even after a Iong time together.

229
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,574
What do you know?
You're not married, are you?

230
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:05,948
- No.
- Well, then.

231
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,115
It's too Iate to start again.

232
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:15,787
You see, it was never that sort of thing
between us.

233
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:18,730
Not what you're saying.
Nothing physical.

234
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:22,792
He just said when he proposed to me,
"Do you think we'd make a go of it?"

235
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:26,795
I said, "When you've got a house,"
and there it is.

236
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,469
We've always been good to one another.

237
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:36,915
Did I speak out of turn?

238
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,713
Oh, no.

239
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,818
Good of you to see me on a Saturday.

240
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,194
A doctor's always busy, though.
Must be interesting seeing people.

241
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:54,962
- I could do with a holiday.
- It's a calling, isn't it?

242
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:09,337
- I'm so sorry.
- Hang on.

243
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,885
- I'll see you next week.
- Thank you.

244
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,225
I wish they wouldn't cry.

245
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,602
I didn't expect you this weekend.

246
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:40,612
- You're working on a Saturday.
- She said it was a calling.

247
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,582
It always makes me want
to be a house painter.

248
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,607
Are you all right?

249
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,056
Christ, what a morning.

250
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,796
I've had two nervous breakdowns,

251
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:07,363
three cases of the pox,
an attack of German measles

252
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,398
and quite frankly, I'm flaked.

253
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:21,416
I always expect Saturday
to be the best day of the week.

254
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,479
A Iung.

255
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:35,563
- So you finally bought it.
- Yes. Do you Iike it?

256
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:39,467
Possessions, possessions...
It's getting to be a disease.

257
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:43,075
They told me it would be an investment.

258
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:49,746
- How's it bearing up?
- Fine. I had it on Iast night.

259
00:23:55,455 --> 00:23:58,015
I think it's the best thing I've done.

260
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,283
Switch it off.

261
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:13,030
It's a bit small, this.

262
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:18,774
I'd Iike to build one on a vast scale,
really huge.

263
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:22,175
Right. Could you switch it on,
and the Iight?

264
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:32,688
- Do you think they'll Iike it in America?
- I think they'd Iap it up.

265
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,558
You sure they haven't
thought of it already?

266
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:39,531
Someone seems interested.
Keep telephoning from New York.

267
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,394
Does that mean you might have
to go there?

268
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:47,600
Yeah, but if I went
it wouldn't be for Iong.

269
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:55,637
Hello?

270
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:58,014
Yes, I'm on the Iine answering.

271
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:01,546
Oh, Mrs. Hackett.

272
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,886
- Johnny's not getting better.
- He's taking the pills?

273
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:09,224
- He doesn't Iike them.
- Yes, but didn't you...? Did you try to...?

274
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,253
He's running a terrible fever.

275
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:16,064
I gave you the pills to bring
the fever down. That's what they're for.

276
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:18,297
He's got a very high temperature.

277
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:21,272
Have you given him the pills
I prescribed?

278
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:25,004
- Why don't you try that?
- I tried giving him a hot drink.

279
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:29,071
- I don't think a hot drink...
- His throat has just closed up.

280
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:33,108
I've tried painting it.
It doesn't seem to make any difference.

281
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:38,055
Mrs. Hackett... Would you try
and do exactly what I said,

282
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:41,390
and call me tomorrow only if
his fever hasn't gone down?

283
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:43,418
Otherwise, ring me on Monday.

284
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,455
Goodbye.

285
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,568
Jesus Christ! I need a drink.

286
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:55,802
- I don't know why you put up with it.
- How Iong have you got?

287
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:57,867
A while.

288
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:04,415
Is Alex hating it up there?
I'll bet Lucy's putting her through it.

289
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,975
Why on earth did you go?

290
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,317
Because she wanted me to.

291
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:13,155
- Because I wanted to.
- How the hell did you get away?

292
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:47,048
There we are.

293
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,500
What shall we make with this?

294
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,593
You want to get down?

295
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:59,366
- No, you don't.
- I do.

296
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,396
Off you go, then.

297
00:27:17,023 --> 00:27:19,992
I've come to get the fudge.
You've eaten it!

298
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:23,992
It was my idea, me who made it

299
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,396
and there's a ton of it Ieft.

300
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,628
Where's Bob gone?

301
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,661
Out.

302
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:36,665
When's he coming back?

303
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,742
Soon.

304
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,611
What have you been doing?

305
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:45,549
Why don't you know
exactly when he's coming back?

306
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:50,852
Oh, do stop it, Iovely. I do know.
I just can't be bothered to tell you.

307
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:54,655
Has Bob walked out on you?

308
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:57,822
I expect that's why you're overeating.

309
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,301
Bludgeoned into feeling something.

310
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:23,586
Can't see being a fanatic. Can you?

311
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:26,853
I'm not at all sure.

312
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:40,795
Do you honestly feel Jewish?

313
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,539
Not particularly.

314
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:48,411
Only at school when there were
eight of us amongst 250.

315
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:51,914
I Iike chopped Iiver.

316
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,316
When will we make
our famous trip to Italy?

317
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:00,757
I can go at the end of the month.
Can you?

318
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,818
Yeah.

319
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,823
Three.

320
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,419
Four.

321
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,362
Five.

322
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:41,389
They're not going to answer.

323
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:48,468
One moment, I'll take it for you.

324
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:11,956
Oh, my God.

325
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,891
Christ!

326
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,949
Get off! Get off!

327
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,974
You swine!

328
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:45,530
Oh, turn the main switch off,
you'll electrocute yourself.

329
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,829
- Do you think I can't to mend a fuse?
- Yes.

330
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:57,935
Oh, shit. Now that's gone.

331
00:30:57,977 --> 00:31:00,741
I wish they'd have American fuses here.

332
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,238
Whenever you're stuck,
everything is better in America.

333
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,274
How do you know?

334
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,012
- There.
- Oh, well done.

335
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:13,155
How Iucky that you're here.

336
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:17,726
Don't push it. Just don't push it.

337
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,630
I never mentioned him.

338
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:24,727
- Use his name if you must bring him up.
- I didn't bring him up.

339
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:27,636
No, but I could hear you thinking it.

340
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:33,074
Why don't you piss off upstairs
and Iet me know what's working?

341
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,448
I need the torch.

342
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:42,010
You can see by the candle.

343
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,045
Christ!

344
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,525
Bastard.

345
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:52,554
Does this one work?

346
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:54,589
No.

347
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:00,095
- How about that one?
- No.

348
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,130
Yes! No!

349
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,576
Yes.

350
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:10,605
Is Bob back?

351
00:32:14,787 --> 00:32:18,917
- Is everything all right?
- Shouldn't you be asleep?

352
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:26,521
That hasn't been on
since the Crimean War.

353
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,961
- I missed you.
- What, upstairs?

354
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:34,739
Today.

355
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:37,537
Don't go on at me
Iike some possessive wife.

356
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:41,171
I feel Iike a possessive wife,
Ieft alone with five children,

357
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:44,376
- one dog, one monkey...
- You've never complained before.

358
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,853
I've never been alone before. This was
supposed to be a proper weekend.

359
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:54,282
I know you're not getting enough of me
but you're getting all there is.

360
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:57,784
Perhaps you're
spreading yourself a Iittle thin.

361
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,821
Drop it.

362
00:33:56,422 --> 00:34:00,449
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

363
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:07,288
You are a silly tart.

364
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,777
- Oh, God. The car's parked miles away.
- Gumboot time.

365
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:22,303
- Bloody English weather.
- Better make a dash for it.

366
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:30,787
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Taxi!

367
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:33,621
- Let's run for it.
- Anyone got a paper?

368
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,024
- Bye.
- Bye.

369
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,044
..the economic crisis.

370
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:07,024
And the cabinet has been
in almost continuous session.

371
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,959
It broke up an hour ago.

372
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:13,260
At one point, TUC Ieaders,
meeting to discuss the emergency,

373
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:15,392
were called in by the prime minister.

374
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:19,393
They were there for two hours,
and our political editor understands

375
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:22,430
that there were some
acrimonious exchanges...

376
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:27,512
And the program Saturday Nightride.

377
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:43,985
Hello!

378
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:50,067
Hey, I said hello.

379
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:52,764
You don't remember me?

380
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,432
No, I don't.

381
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:58,273
Look, don't pretend
that you don't remember me!

382
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,371
Stop it!

383
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,315
AII right. Get in.

384
00:36:15,494 --> 00:36:17,359
Oh, Christ. He'll have me.

385
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,294
- Is everything all right, sir?
- Yes, Officer.

386
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:26,167
I know him.

387
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,538
I'm a doctor. He's hurt his hand.
I'll see that he's all right.

388
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,566
I see.

389
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:53,297
Well, how are you keeping?

390
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,626
Christ, my hand hurts.

391
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:02,198
Do you think it's broken?

392
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,937
No. You can move your fingers.

393
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:07,309
It's probably just bruised.

394
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,779
You just stop pretending
that you don't remember, eh?

395
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:20,018
I remember you perfectly well.

396
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:22,390
You were pissed the Iast time.

397
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:36,903
Are we going back to your place, then?

398
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:39,103
No. I'm dropping you off.

399
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,843
On the way I'll call up a chemist
and get you a painkiller for that.

400
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,010
Look where you're going, will you?

401
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,351
You're not much of a bleeding driver,
are you... Doctor?

402
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,463
Are you in Iove?

403
00:38:03,502 --> 00:38:04,833
Probably.

404
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:13,710
Poor old Danny.

405
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:15,736
Christ.

406
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:19,575
You even remember my name.

407
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,002
Thank you, madam.

408
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:16,200
Has the doctor got a relief?

409
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,519
I can't accept this.
That Iooks just Iike an initial.

410
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:41,124
- That's my signature.
- Are you a doctor?

411
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:45,296
- Yes. Hirsh.
- Where did you get this prescription?

412
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:49,330
It's the same signature
as on my driving Iicense. Here.

413
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,382
I must have forgotten to sign it.

414
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:04,014
I'll get my instrument case from the car
to identify myself,

415
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:06,286
as you're being so difficult.

416
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:17,018
..something for Mum and Dad.

417
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:22,295
I thought it would be nice to play for you
that Iovely tune by Mendelssohn,

418
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,325
On Wings Of Song.

419
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:41,986
- Morning.
- Morning.

420
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:47,314
I've got two Sunday Times.

421
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,366
- Thanks.
- Your bulbs are flourishing.

422
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,346
Stop! You silly dog.

423
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:34,800
Come on, Timothy!

424
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:52,190
- She's a Iovely Iittle girl, isn't she?
- She's not a girl. He's a boy.

425
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:55,159
Come on! We'll Iaunch it.

426
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,397
Ready, steady...

427
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:03,765
Go!

428
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:10,139
- Wave! Come back, balloons!
- Come back!

429
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:33,053
Have a Iook at that.

430
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:39,293
Let me see.

431
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:42,963
Come on.

432
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:58,078
Come on, Timothy.

433
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,824
I think it's time to go home.

434
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:16,401
AII righty. Time to go home.

435
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:19,535
Come on, Kenyatta. Oh, stop it.

436
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,547
One, two, three!

437
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:31,646
Come on, Kenyatta.

438
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:38,757
Look at me!

439
00:44:39,464 --> 00:44:43,901
- Come on.
- Lucy! Be careful!

440
00:45:00,886 --> 00:45:02,911
You stupid girl!

441
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:06,446
- Running across the road Iike that.
- Why did you do that?

442
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:10,018
Why did you run across
the road Iike that, you naughty girl?

443
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:13,053
- Is that your dog?
- You took that corner Iike a maniac!

444
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:17,330
- It should've been on a Iead!
- You can't do that! See all this traffic?

445
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:20,532
How many times have you been told
not to run across a road?

446
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:24,235
You might have been killed!
Do you hear me?

447
00:45:36,154 --> 00:45:38,520
Stop it.

448
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:42,492
Stop it. Do you hear me?
Stop that screaming. Stop it.

449
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:46,691
It's all right. Now stop it. Stop it. AII right.

450
00:45:49,301 --> 00:45:51,895
You're all the same. You charge around...

451
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:53,928
What do mean "charge"?

452
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,270
Stop crying. Stay there and Iook
after the children. AII right?

453
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,302
Now, stay there.

454
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:08,609
Look, get the kids home.
I'll cope with this.

455
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:14,486
Off we go. Home.
Come on. Come on, now.

456
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:16,687
Everything's all right.

457
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:19,128
Be back soon.

458
00:46:39,351 --> 00:46:43,287
We won't see him anymore. We won't.

459
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:47,315
That isn't the doggy.

460
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:49,792
I'm ready.

461
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:51,955
Now fold your papers.

462
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:56,062
- One, two, three. Swap!
- Ready, steady... swap!

463
00:46:57,569 --> 00:46:59,696
Now we all draw bodies.

464
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:35,796
Shall we turn these into ears?

465
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,831
Right? Big, big ears.

466
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:05,527
Take care of yourself, Alex.
I'll give you a hand with that tonight.

467
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:23,682
Stop! Stop, somebody! Stop!

468
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,690
Stop him! My daddy's forgotten
his gas mask!

469
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:30,785
Stop him, somebody! He'll get killed!

470
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:37,564
My father's forgotten his gas mask!
He'll get killed!

471
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:07,328
You don't need those.

472
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,604
I keep thinking it could have been Lucy.

473
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,802
Well, it wasn't. Right?

474
00:49:21,846 --> 00:49:23,837
Come on.

475
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,121
Hi, Tommy?

476
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:20,653
Has the thing come back
from the workshop yet? It has?

477
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:23,690
I'd Iove to see it.

478
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:27,260
No, I couldn't possibly Ieave here.

479
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:57,965
Timothy, bed. Come on. Bed.

480
00:51:58,002 --> 00:52:00,630
Bed. Come on now.

481
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:03,869
Bed, darling. Come on, please.

482
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:06,103
Off to bed, Timothy.

483
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:08,305
- Stop it.
- You've been told.

484
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:12,510
I'm sorry. I must have been
flat out for hours.

485
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,509
We crept up but you Iooked as if
you needed the rest.

486
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:18,317
Stop it.

487
00:52:18,356 --> 00:52:19,983
You must be exhausted.

488
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:26,028
Timothy, stop it. Come away from there,
he's trying to concentrate.

489
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:28,055
Come on. Bed.

490
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:33,064
Professor Johns
gave such a marvelous Iecture.

491
00:52:33,104 --> 00:52:36,631
- Didn't he, Bill?
- He did indeed. Off to bed.

492
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:41,475
- He's trying to remember what he said.
- AII of you. I'll take that.

493
00:52:41,512 --> 00:52:44,743
- Say good night to Alex, darling.
- Good night!

494
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:54,355
- I'm terribly sorry about Kenyatta.
- Must have been awful for you.

495
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:58,520
Anyway, we're buying another
for Lucy's birthday.

496
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:01,657
Good night.
Thank you for Iooking after us.

497
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:05,191
- Night, Lucy.
- Good night, Mama, good night, Papa.

498
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:11,241
Lucy took it rather hard.
Has she ever seen anyone dead before?

499
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:14,642
Oh, yes. They all saw Granny
when she was dead.

500
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:18,046
We just think it's very important
not to pretend.

501
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:22,251
Where's Bob?

502
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:25,119
He's upstairs working with his mates.

503
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:28,216
Darling, there are nine for dinner.

504
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:30,250
Could you Iook at the meat?

505
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:33,929
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

506
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:38,794
- I feel it ought to be more mobile.
- More mobile? In what way?

507
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:44,106
- A stand or something.
- It has to be rigid. This'll wobble.

508
00:53:44,142 --> 00:53:47,043
And high to compensate
for these pendulums.

509
00:53:47,078 --> 00:53:49,603
We could have a tripod.
Look good in chrome.

510
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:51,808
Maybe a telescopic tripod.

511
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:56,149
It'd be Iike having furniture in the middle
of the room. That's not right.

512
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:59,850
If you were an American businessman,
which would you prefer -

513
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:02,325
something you could push
around the office

514
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,295
or a permanent fixture up on the wall?

515
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,890
- I think on the wall. Try it.
- That's what we thought.

516
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:11,925
- Stick it on the wall.
- Pass it over. Lift it up.

517
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:14,665
We won't need all these holes
to start with.

518
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:18,232
- It needs a chrome bolt.
- Chrome will be a nightmare.

519
00:54:18,276 --> 00:54:21,712
It's the American answer to worry beads.

520
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,010
Why don't we make it in America?

521
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:46,298
Drop me off here at the Iights.
I'll get a cab.

522
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:53,041
- Aren't you coming home?
- Got to get my eight hours.

523
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,612
See you. Bye.

524
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:56,127
Thank you.

525
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:13,474
Must be New York.

526
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:28,429
Harry, I've realized a couple of million.

527
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:32,266
I'm Iooking for a good home for them.
Any suggestions?

528
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:35,205
Such as short-dated treasury bonds.

529
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,231
Well, what are they?

530
00:57:38,176 --> 00:57:40,474
Now, wait, wait, wait!

531
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:42,503
I'll just work it out.

532
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:46,607
She's very well.

533
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:49,549
How's Cathy?

534
00:57:49,587 --> 00:57:52,818
I do wish you wouldn't have
David to dine here.

535
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:56,918
Father and I are fond of him.

536
00:57:56,961 --> 00:57:59,088
Yes, well...

537
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,121
I wish you wouldn't.

538
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:06,166
He's rather bitter
about your taking the books.

539
00:58:06,204 --> 00:58:09,105
They were mine. They were all I took.

540
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:12,803
- They Ieave gaps, he says.
- Oh, Jesus.

541
00:58:12,844 --> 00:58:17,144
Does being married ever
come down to anything but property?

542
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:19,173
Sometimes.

543
00:58:21,086 --> 00:58:23,782
He wants you back, you know.

544
00:58:23,822 --> 00:58:26,154
I don't want to hear about that.

545
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:34,195
You see too Iittle of people.

546
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:37,367
Enough.

547
00:58:38,002 --> 00:58:39,993
I mean too Iittle of Daddy.

548
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:44,934
It's not much use
to start wanting things of him.

549
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:47,843
I'm not always very good
at stopping myself.

550
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:49,403
What, you?

551
00:58:57,689 --> 00:59:00,749
- Other Iine.
- It's been a heavy week.

552
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:04,728
It's always been a heavy week.
Why do you put up with it?

553
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:07,263
You're complaining about your father.

554
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:11,234
Perhaps you're complaining about
whoever it is you're seeing.

555
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:17,267
Who are you seeing now?

556
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:21,404
- The same person. On and off.
- On and off?

557
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:23,437
You don't give it a chance.

558
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:25,745
Having an affair with someone
on and off

559
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:29,914
is no worse than being married
for a course or two at meal times.

560
00:59:32,657 --> 00:59:35,148
What sort of man is he?

561
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:37,718
I don't think you'd Iike his haircut.

562
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:39,423
Is he a hippie?

563
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:42,763
I Iike hippies.
They hate business and competition.

564
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:45,463
That's what makes them so attractive.

565
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:50,239
You keep throwing your hand in

566
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:52,937
because you haven't got the whole thing.

567
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:55,002
There is no whole thing.

568
00:59:55,046 --> 00:59:57,037
You have to make it work.

569
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,451
I Ieft your father once.

570
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,991
When?

571
01:00:07,025 --> 01:00:10,961
You were three.
We disagreed about everything.

572
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:13,327
Everything seemed impossible.

573
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:17,399
He Ieft me alone. It was good of him.

574
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:21,966
But I was mad not to know
how much I'd miss him.

575
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:28,839
You think it's nothing but it's not nothing.

576
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:49,563
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Brown.

577
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:51,899
- How are you keeping?
- Fine. And you?

578
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:54,131
- Very well.
- Good.

579
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,543
- Message desk.
- Any messages for me?

580
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:39,641
Nothing for you, Miss Greville.

581
01:01:39,684 --> 01:01:42,482
- That's a relief.
- Will you be picking up now?

582
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,853
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm only in if Mr. Elkin rings.

583
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,382
Would you tell him to ring twice
so I'll know it's him?

584
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:54,888
Have you tried him at 937-3000?
He's often there.

585
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:57,800
I wouldn't want to ring him there.
It's a doctor.

586
01:01:57,835 --> 01:02:02,204
Yes, I know, it's Dr. Hearsh.
Dr. Hearsh also uses this service.

587
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:06,704
Right.

588
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:40,240
"Dear Reggie, for some time now,
I have felt the need for a change."

589
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,906
Oh, no.

590
01:02:42,947 --> 01:02:45,711
"I badly need..." No.

591
01:02:47,919 --> 01:02:52,356
"Dear Reggie,
this is a Ietter of resignation.

592
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:55,518
"Please don't be surprised."

593
01:02:56,561 --> 01:02:59,155
It's too difficult to explain?

594
01:02:59,197 --> 01:03:02,132
"It's too complicated to explain.

595
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:07,999
"I'm getting stale
and I don't feel I'm really at my best.

596
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,839
"I'd Iike to go as soon as I can.

597
01:03:12,877 --> 01:03:15,175
"I'm sure this is the right decision."

598
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:21,113
It's my age, isn't it? When you're over 50
in business, you're over the hump.

599
01:03:21,152 --> 01:03:24,178
- You shouldn't say that.
- You get a golden handshake

600
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:27,248
or a sherry party
and you can't find another job.

601
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,191
- That's that.
- Night, Alex.

602
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:32,287
This place would be all right if it had walls.

603
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:35,527
You'd have got this job
if you hadn't invented a degree.

604
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:39,696
- Why did you do it?
- There's no point going on about it.

605
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:42,900
You'd been accepted,
then you make a muck of it.

606
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,068
Why come here
if you won't Iet us help you?

607
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,740
You? It's firms Iike you
that are putting me out to grass.

608
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:54,411
- Me and all the other 50-year-olds.
- You told me 55.

609
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:56,113
50.

610
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:59,453
Hang on to that, then.

611
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:06,958
Would you Iike to have done engineering?

612
01:04:14,939 --> 01:04:17,271
You're a very attractive girl.

613
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:22,869
Well, you've...

614
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:27,583
You've messed this chance up and I...

615
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:30,109
I don't think
we're going to be able to fix...

616
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:34,114
I'm so sorry.

617
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:38,555
They'll take up references.

618
01:04:41,332 --> 01:04:43,266
Don't you start.

619
01:04:51,976 --> 01:04:55,639
Can you help me or not?
Are you an expert or not?

620
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,376
I've been behind a bigger desk
for 20 years.

621
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:01,442
I've had three secretaries at a time.

622
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:05,650
If it's any comfort to you,
I won't be here after next week.

623
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,119
I'm packing it in.

624
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:11,684
Then who am I supposed to deal with?

625
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:29,440
Are you really all right?

626
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:33,473
The face-Iift's gone. That's what you'll see.

627
01:05:37,388 --> 01:05:39,822
You didn't know that, did you?

628
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:49,522
We can get our faces done too, you know.

629
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:53,862
For interviews.
They told me down the corridor.

630
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:55,964
It Iasts two days.

631
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:59,169
They... stretch the skin.

632
01:06:01,512 --> 01:06:04,003
I surprise myself. I Iook 42.

633
01:06:06,384 --> 01:06:10,480
I didn't go home.
I thought it might upset my wife.

634
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:15,325
We're all right, you see.

635
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:24,497
- How am I going to tell her?
- She doesn't know about the sack?

636
01:06:34,178 --> 01:06:37,079
Yes, that's right. Like that.

637
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:46,180
Two words!

638
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:48,192
Book?

639
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:51,091
- First word!
- Hands?

640
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:54,921
- Peering.
- Love?

641
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:58,197
- Adoration.
- Glory.

642
01:06:58,236 --> 01:07:00,329
- Halo?
- Devout. Devout.

643
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:02,669
Looking? Peering.

644
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:06,399
- Butterfly!
- Pilgrim's Progress.

645
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:08,071
- Adoration.
- Heavens Above.

646
01:07:08,112 --> 01:07:10,580
- AII This And Heaven Too.
- Lost?

647
01:07:10,615 --> 01:07:12,742
Paradise.

648
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,774
Oh, Paradise Lost.

649
01:07:16,888 --> 01:07:18,788
Four words.

650
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,453
- Love For Sale.
- Passion.

651
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:25,359
Pain.

652
01:07:25,396 --> 01:07:27,455
- Stomachache.
- Appendix!

653
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:30,626
- My Heart Belongs To Daddy.
- Haggerty.

654
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:34,069
- My Heart And I!
- I'm Just Wild About Harry.

655
01:07:34,105 --> 01:07:37,597
- Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen.
- Pack Up Your Troubles!

656
01:07:58,629 --> 01:08:00,790
- Dancing.
- Goldfish.

657
01:08:01,866 --> 01:08:03,424
- Touch?
- Eel.

658
01:08:03,467 --> 01:08:05,765
Pocket.

659
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:09,371
- The Touch Of Your Lips.
- Fear.

660
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:11,102
- Fear.
- Flesh.

661
01:08:11,142 --> 01:08:13,906
"The poor Iittle thing
was so skinny and thin."

662
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:16,914
- Skin deep.
- You.

663
01:08:16,948 --> 01:08:19,746
- Skin under?
- I've Got You Under My Skin.

664
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:23,710
I'm coming!

665
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:28,823
- Where's my manuscript?
- Hello. Is it over or are we on time?

666
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:30,793
- On my desk...
- What's going on?

667
01:08:30,828 --> 01:08:33,922
- It's gone on all evening.
- AII through dinner.

668
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:37,264
- My desk!
- I'm going in, and you're coming too.

669
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:40,134
- Where's my manuscript?
- It's only a cookbook.

670
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:42,571
Small word.

671
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,768
My God! Children's games?

672
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:53,983
I might have known
you'd be in the best seat.

673
01:08:54,018 --> 01:08:56,009
Call girls on strike?

674
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:58,453
Come on, start the game.

675
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:00,719
Why go through
Pelham Crescent anyway?

676
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:04,057
Nobody ever goes that way.
You were thinking about her.

677
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:06,825
Of course I wasn't. Sit down and behave.

678
01:09:06,864 --> 01:09:09,128
- Don't I get a drink?
- What are we doing?

679
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:12,932
The first one is five, a film,
and this is the second word.

680
01:09:14,438 --> 01:09:17,032
Plonk? Isn't there any vodka Ieft?

681
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:20,869
A Iittle for her. She's had enough already.

682
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:23,539
- Muscle.
- Expanse.

683
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:26,311
- Not Ioudest, best.
- Big one.

684
01:09:29,186 --> 01:09:31,814
- Good gracious!
- Thank you.

685
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:33,585
- Big.
- Massive! Massive!

686
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:35,854
- Seven Pillars Of Wisdom.
- The Big Country.

687
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:38,191
Potemkin?

688
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:41,255
Ingrid is the Iast au pair girl
we're going to have.

689
01:09:41,298 --> 01:09:45,860
- I never Iaid a finger on her.
- Ingrid is the Iast fucking au pair girl

690
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:48,929
we're ever going to have!
The way you stare at her...

691
01:09:48,973 --> 01:09:53,410
- Listen to me.
- Oh, piss off, Daniel, you know nothing!

692
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:56,845
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

693
01:09:56,881 --> 01:10:00,180
- For goodness' sake, you two!
- When I tell you...

694
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:02,276
Charming!

695
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:07,518
- ..he's the best one of them all!
- You fucking bitch.

696
01:10:08,526 --> 01:10:11,757
Get bloody Kenneth
to pour you another one...

697
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:14,026
You fucking bastard!

698
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:15,862
Here come those tired old tits again.

699
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,801
What the hell are you doing?
AII right. Go on!

700
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,936
No, darling! No.

701
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:30,970
- Where are you going?
- I'm going.

702
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:35,145
- Thanks for the support.
- They're ridiculous.

703
01:10:35,186 --> 01:10:37,518
I don't Iike them when they're Iike this.

704
01:10:37,555 --> 01:10:41,491
- Why see them?
- I didn't invite them. You Iet them in.

705
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,391
- Oh, sorry.
- Come on.

706
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:49,365
Don't go now. Go upstairs.
I'll get rid of them

707
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,460
- and I'll come up in a minute.
- I'd rather be on my own.

708
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:55,802
- They're your friends.
- Typical! Plain bloody selfish!

709
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,071
- I can't stand people carrying on!
- Right.

710
01:10:59,543 --> 01:11:01,443
OK, out!

711
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:02,912
Right!

712
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:17,857
AII right, you two. Get out!

713
01:11:17,895 --> 01:11:19,556
Now piss off!

714
01:11:19,597 --> 01:11:21,588
That's enough!

715
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:24,128
Christ.

716
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,933
- Very well. I'll tell her that.
- Hello? Hello?

717
01:12:11,515 --> 01:12:15,007
- Message desk.
- What was that message?

718
01:12:15,052 --> 01:12:19,250
Mr. Elgin just rang. I said I thought
you were in but not picking up.

719
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:22,917
- What did he say?
- Could he come over straightaway?

720
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,525
Thanks.

721
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,444
It's nice to see you.

722
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:55,615
George.

723
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:57,684
Come down.

724
01:13:00,064 --> 01:13:03,465
George, this is Bob Elkin. George Harding.

725
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,163
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

726
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:10,771
- Would you Iike a drink?
- Yeah.

727
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,801
You know where they are.

728
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:19,707
- I think I'd better be going.
- Not yet.

729
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,082
I must catch my train.

730
01:13:23,387 --> 01:13:26,049
- Thank you for my dinner.
- Thank you.

731
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,024
Thanks.

732
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:32,825
We'll see each other next week.
Will you telephone?

733
01:13:32,863 --> 01:13:37,197
- You won't be at the office.
- Next week I will. After that, here.

734
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,607
- Goodbye.
- Thanks again.

735
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:51,581
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

736
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:15,464
Does this thing ever work
or is it just for decoration?

737
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,176
No, it should work.

738
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,678
It is bloody freezing, isn't it?

739
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:26,342
Haven't got any Iogs.
There's some rubbish that might burn.

740
01:14:30,854 --> 01:14:34,381
I am glad you came. It's so nice to see you.

741
01:14:37,428 --> 01:14:40,420
It Iooked as if
I was interrupting something.

742
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:49,666
- I thought you'd be alone at this hour.
- Well, we're alone now.

743
01:14:52,376 --> 01:14:54,571
Do stop Iooking so desolate.

744
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:59,442
You've had your hair cut.

745
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:04,484
- It doesn't Iook as bad as I thought.
- Thank you.

746
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:10,025
This won't burn for more than ten minutes.

747
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,120
There's some wood on the roof.
Want to get it?

748
01:16:04,248 --> 01:16:07,411
Bloody heating.
I'm going to have to change it.

749
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,245
Where are you?

750
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:29,736
Who was that man Iast night?

751
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:33,573
I told you. His name's George.

752
01:16:37,147 --> 01:16:39,138
Who is he?

753
01:16:42,286 --> 01:16:45,813
He's a man from the office
who's Iost his job

754
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:48,347
and I'm trying to find him another.

755
01:16:50,327 --> 01:16:53,455
- Do you mind about him?
- No.

756
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:59,259
You really don't mind, do you?

757
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:03,867
No, not a bit.
We're free to do what we want.

758
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,472
Darling...

759
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:12,846
other people often do
what they don't want to do at all.

760
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,910
- Just a vaccination for smallpox, please.
- Boost?

761
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:20,212
When was the Iast time?

762
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,980
When I was born, I suppose.

763
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,955
- Are you right- or Ieft-handed?
- Right-handed.

764
01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:27,980
The Ieft arm.

765
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:32,521
- Where are you off to?
- New York, probably.

766
01:18:32,563 --> 01:18:36,397
You should try San Francisco.
That's a Iovely place.

767
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:44,267
Then from Verona, La Garda

768
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:46,640
down to Ravenna and then...

769
01:18:46,677 --> 01:18:48,406
Just a minute.

770
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,346
Verona. Museums,
opera, mountains, hotels.

771
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:57,376
- Thank you.
- Ravenna.

772
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:59,946
Churches, beaches, hotels.

773
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:04,552
Then we were going
to motor down from Ravenna

774
01:19:04,595 --> 01:19:06,893
through Umbria to Siena.

775
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:14,628
Siena. Events, churches, hotels.

776
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:24,079
- Would you Iike to see the menu, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

777
01:19:26,984 --> 01:19:29,179
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello. Fine.

778
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:32,211
- Hello, how are you keeping?
- Great.

779
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:38,587
Excuse me, sir. I have a message for you.

780
01:19:38,629 --> 01:19:42,963
Mr. Elkin is not able to come.
Shall I keep your table, sir?

781
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,458
- No, I'm sorry. Cancel it.
- Thank you very much.

782
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:01,513
Why didn't you say you were sick
instead of just not turning up, as usual?

783
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:04,111
You're not still on about the other night?

784
01:20:04,154 --> 01:20:06,145
Of course not.

785
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:09,015
Open your mouth.

786
01:20:15,499 --> 01:20:20,027
That seems to be all right.
Have you been eating anything strange?

787
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,129
I don't think it's that.

788
01:20:23,273 --> 01:20:25,571
You've certainly got a temperature.

789
01:20:26,843 --> 01:20:30,279
- Now tell me to take aspirins.
- Take aspirin.

790
01:20:30,313 --> 01:20:33,009
- And fluids?
- Take fluids.

791
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,577
I got some bumf about Italy.
How does that grab you?

792
01:20:40,624 --> 01:20:43,286
Now... Come on. Let's have a Iisten.

793
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,194
What's the matter?

794
01:20:49,232 --> 01:20:51,860
Oh, shit. I might as well tell you.

795
01:20:51,902 --> 01:20:54,894
I had a vaccination
for smallpox yesterday.

796
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:57,930
Why the hell didn't you come to me?

797
01:20:58,709 --> 01:21:00,540
I just thought...

798
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:03,569
I don't know.

799
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:09,013
It means you are going to America.

800
01:21:09,052 --> 01:21:11,850
I think so. But it wouldn't be for Iong.

801
01:21:13,557 --> 01:21:17,254
- I always knew Italy was a fiction.
- Oh, don't.

802
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:19,694
- We'll go when I get back.
- Pointless.

803
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:21,721
I want to go.

804
01:21:21,765 --> 01:21:23,756
Pointless.

805
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:28,894
- Would you Iike a drink?
- No.

806
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,771
Thanks.

807
01:21:40,016 --> 01:21:43,543
You'll be there much Ionger
than you say, won't you?

808
01:21:43,587 --> 01:21:45,418
I don't know.

809
01:21:46,356 --> 01:21:49,018
Have to play it by ear when I get there.

810
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:53,357
Will you get a Iot of work out of it?

811
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:55,387
Maybe.

812
01:21:58,034 --> 01:21:59,797
We shall fight in France.

813
01:22:05,642 --> 01:22:09,476
- Do you Iike the people over there?
- I don't know many.

814
01:22:09,513 --> 01:22:12,038
It is a chance.

815
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:14,949
I don't have to go. I could send Tony.

816
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:18,147
Well, you'll have to decide.

817
01:22:19,656 --> 01:22:22,682
I could never just piss off.

818
01:22:25,162 --> 01:22:27,130
Have you told Alex?

819
01:22:27,164 --> 01:22:29,655
- No.
- Why not?

820
01:22:30,934 --> 01:22:33,061
I don't know what to do.

821
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:36,266
Should I go? What do you think?

822
01:22:38,608 --> 01:22:41,133
I told you, it'll have to be your choice.

823
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:46,013
I know it would solve a Iot of problems
for you if you went.

824
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:49,312
But...

825
01:23:05,035 --> 01:23:08,436
- Jonathon. Good Iuck.
- Thank you.

826
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,564
Daniel. Glad you could make it.

827
01:23:10,607 --> 01:23:12,768
Hello, Father. Sorry I'm Iate.

828
01:26:27,137 --> 01:26:30,903
My dear Daniel, now that you are 13,

829
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:34,171
you are a fully fledged member
of the community.

830
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:39,409
Today, Daniel,
you start to assume responsibility

831
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:42,316
and take your own decisions

832
01:26:42,352 --> 01:26:48,018
as you prepare yourself to make
your own particular contribution in Iife.

833
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:07,202
Jonathon. Congratulations.

834
01:27:07,243 --> 01:27:09,541
- You were super. Wasn't he?
- Wonderful.

835
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:12,810
- Have you seen David?
- Yes. He's over there.

836
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:16,785
Ruth Collins married an EIIis.
That's how we're related.

837
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:21,723
- You must know the Hirshes.
- David Hirsh married a niece of mine.

838
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:24,852
- Daniel!
- Aunt Sophie.

839
01:27:24,894 --> 01:27:28,660
Lovely to see you.
Do you remember your cousin Mark?

840
01:27:28,698 --> 01:27:32,691
Cousin Daniel knew you
when you were just a baby. And Elsa!

841
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,231
- It's going well.
- Splendidly.

842
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:42,438
My brother Daniel, Terry Selby Lowndes,
my new partner.

843
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:44,538
So nice to meet you.

844
01:27:44,581 --> 01:27:48,039
I am delighted that they've come round
to see our way.

845
01:27:56,893 --> 01:27:59,191
Is it Daniel?

846
01:27:59,229 --> 01:28:01,390
You don't remember me, do you?

847
01:28:03,633 --> 01:28:06,864
I'm Emil, your third cousin
on your mother's side.

848
01:28:08,104 --> 01:28:12,473
We Iast met at your grandmother's.
She would have Ioved to be here.

849
01:28:15,945 --> 01:28:18,573
- I want to talk to you.
- Excuse me.

850
01:28:18,615 --> 01:28:21,345
You're not going to be
an old fuddy-duddy?

851
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:22,783
- Why?

852
01:28:22,819 --> 01:28:26,949
I put you next to a very nice girl.
She's just got a divorce.

853
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:30,448
You will be nice to her, won't you?
I know you two will get on.

854
01:28:30,493 --> 01:28:33,860
Hello, darling! Lovely to see you.

855
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:36,092
I was sure you weren't going to make it.

856
01:28:36,132 --> 01:28:39,101
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Daniel.

857
01:28:39,135 --> 01:28:41,433
- You know all these people?
- No.

858
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:44,497
Quite a do.

859
01:28:45,074 --> 01:28:47,406
Mostly your brother's business associates.

860
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:52,808
And how are you, son?

861
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:56,178
Fine. Fine.

862
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:01,613
- Aunt Astrid.
- How are you?

863
01:29:01,658 --> 01:29:04,354
You are Iooking spruce.

864
01:29:04,394 --> 01:29:06,521
Have one of these.

865
01:29:07,096 --> 01:29:09,690
When are you giving us a nice surprise?

866
01:29:09,732 --> 01:29:12,724
- Still holding out on us?
- Aunt Astrid, don't...

867
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:17,365
It's very selfish of you.
You are going to be very Ionely.

868
01:29:17,407 --> 01:29:19,602
I haven't found the right person yet.

869
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,371
Is that straight?

870
01:29:26,482 --> 01:29:29,383
- When are you going?
- In a day or two.

871
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,453
Why did I have to ask you that?
Why didn't you tell me?

872
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,151
I'll be back.

873
01:29:37,093 --> 01:29:39,493
You'll be here.

874
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:42,692
- We can ring each other up.
- I'm bound to be here.

875
01:29:43,733 --> 01:29:48,534
- I can't exactly say when I'll be back.
- OK, you have to Ieave things open.

876
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:53,503
You should never
have decided to quit that job.

877
01:29:53,543 --> 01:29:56,876
You need something to occupy
that piercing mind of yours.

878
01:29:57,413 --> 01:30:01,076
No. That's absolutely not it.

879
01:30:01,117 --> 01:30:03,415
I don't get you Iike this.

880
01:30:03,453 --> 01:30:05,580
You could come over.

881
01:30:05,622 --> 01:30:07,613
Could you come over?

882
01:30:12,795 --> 01:30:15,992
- Nothing's changed.
- I've changed.

883
01:30:19,902 --> 01:30:23,167
AII this fitting in and making do
and shutting up.

884
01:30:25,475 --> 01:30:29,878
I won't be here when you get back.
I can't come over.

885
01:30:30,947 --> 01:30:33,006
Don't ring.

886
01:30:35,518 --> 01:30:37,986
We've got to pack this in and I...

887
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:40,012
don't know what else to say.

888
01:30:40,056 --> 01:30:43,583
Me being careful
not to ask you about Daniel,

889
01:30:43,626 --> 01:30:46,959
Daniel not getting answers from you
because you're here.

890
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:51,228
My old mum not making demands for
umpteen years and my fucking office!

891
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:54,567
I don't want us to Iive Iike this.

892
01:30:54,604 --> 01:30:58,096
Shall we try Iiving together?
Shall we try that?

893
01:30:59,142 --> 01:31:01,133
I don't want to Iose you.

894
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,671
Darling, you...

895
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:08,907
You couldn't do it.

896
01:31:10,086 --> 01:31:12,816
Whenever there's any trouble,
you always...

897
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:14,846
Oh, damn.

898
01:31:20,396 --> 01:31:22,864
I'm not angry with you.

899
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:27,892
I bought it because I Iove you.
Your terms were rotten

900
01:31:27,937 --> 01:31:30,132
and I shouldn't have done it. My fault.

901
01:31:31,007 --> 01:31:34,670
- You keep asking too much.
- For God's sake!

902
01:31:36,713 --> 01:31:39,876
Caring a Iot about someone,
is that too much?

903
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:44,978
People who have some time
for each other, is that too much?

904
01:31:45,555 --> 01:31:48,285
I've had this
"Anything is better than nothing."

905
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:51,452
Sometimes nothing
has to be better than anything.

906
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:01,428
If you Iook back on this,
which you won't,

907
01:32:03,373 --> 01:32:06,274
you'll think it has
something to do with Daniel.

908
01:32:06,309 --> 01:32:08,300
Well, it hasn't.

909
01:32:22,859 --> 01:32:25,521
New York for you. Wouldn't you know?

910
01:32:38,274 --> 01:32:40,265
Put him on, please.

911
01:32:45,615 --> 01:32:48,175
What's the joke?

912
01:32:48,217 --> 01:32:51,152
I was thinking of someone else.

913
01:32:51,187 --> 01:32:53,348
Yeah, hi!

914
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:55,789
Could you speak up a bit? Sorry, I can't...

915
01:32:55,825 --> 01:32:58,191
My old mum, actually...

916
01:32:58,227 --> 01:33:01,219
- Yeah?
- ..and that I Iove you a Iot.

917
01:33:01,264 --> 01:33:04,597
- What? Yeah!
- I don't want you to go.

918
01:33:04,634 --> 01:33:09,765
Yeah! Tuesday. Lovely! Yeah!
What sort of time?

919
01:33:09,806 --> 01:33:13,139
When? Fantastic!

920
01:33:41,804 --> 01:33:44,102
Bar Mitzvah host and hostess,

921
01:33:45,141 --> 01:33:47,302
Iadies and gentlemen,

922
01:33:47,343 --> 01:33:51,245
pray silence for grace
by the Rabbi Eisenberg.

923
01:34:05,928 --> 01:34:07,987
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes.

924
01:34:14,937 --> 01:34:18,338
Dr. Hearsh, I'm sorry to drag you
from your party,

925
01:34:18,374 --> 01:34:23,607
but there's an urgent call for you to ring
the R.M.O. at St. Stephen's Hospital.

926
01:34:23,646 --> 01:34:27,514
- Anything else? Did Mr. Elkin ring?
- No, he didn't.

927
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,541
Thank you.

928
01:34:52,508 --> 01:34:54,442
Yes.

929
01:35:00,816 --> 01:35:02,579
Well...

930
01:35:02,618 --> 01:35:04,779
I think we might have a chance.

931
01:35:05,988 --> 01:35:09,617
That doctor in the white coat
said to us, "The race is run."

932
01:35:09,725 --> 01:35:11,556
He didn't say the same as you.

933
01:35:12,094 --> 01:35:14,961
That was earlier in the night.
She's hanging on.

934
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,536
You're not thinking
she'd be better gone, Doctor?

935
01:35:21,571 --> 01:35:24,233
No, I'm not. I'm certainly not.

936
01:35:24,273 --> 01:35:26,798
Doctors often say that, don't they?

937
01:35:27,843 --> 01:35:31,973
She might pull through.
Surely, that would be best.

938
01:35:32,014 --> 01:35:34,175
But if she couldn't move?

939
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:40,020
People can manage on very Iittle.

940
01:35:40,056 --> 01:35:42,718
There's a chance. That's what he's saying.

941
01:36:47,923 --> 01:36:50,949
I think I'd give her
100 milligrams of pethidine.

942
01:36:51,994 --> 01:36:54,292
AII right.

943
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,991
OK.

944
01:37:27,463 --> 01:37:30,523
It's Iate. Poor old Daniel.

945
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:32,796
I've been at hospital.

946
01:37:34,003 --> 01:37:36,597
- Be all right, will he?
- She.

947
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,801
She might just pull through.

948
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:44,936
It's much better now you're awake.

949
01:37:47,383 --> 01:37:49,476
How was the Bar Mitzvah?

950
01:37:50,519 --> 01:37:52,180
OK.

951
01:37:54,657 --> 01:37:58,491
You take a Iot of trouble
with your family, don't you?

952
01:38:07,837 --> 01:38:11,329
You know, we should have
seen Italy together.

953
01:38:15,845 --> 01:38:17,836
I shall miss you.

954
01:38:20,683 --> 01:38:23,117
I wonder if you'll miss either of us.

955
01:38:25,755 --> 01:38:28,087
I'll be back.

956
01:38:30,726 --> 01:38:32,717
Sometime.

957
01:39:04,126 --> 01:39:07,755
1,500 Iira to the pound.

958
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:14,292
Sign here, please.

959
01:39:15,237 --> 01:39:17,501
Where is the nearest post office?

960
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:35,680
Turn Ieft.

961
01:39:40,029 --> 01:39:42,190
And take the...

962
01:40:23,806 --> 01:40:27,742
- When are you off to Italy?
- On the 21st, God willing.

963
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,472
- You going with Bob?
- I don't think so.

964
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:39,387
We always thought we should try
to be a bit more grown-up

965
01:40:39,421 --> 01:40:42,356
about having holidays on our own.

966
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:44,382
Separately, I mean.

967
01:40:45,294 --> 01:40:48,661
Have you ever thought of one
of those scholars' cruises?

968
01:40:48,697 --> 01:40:50,824
Alva nearly went on one.

969
01:40:50,866 --> 01:40:53,027
It isn't what I'd have chosen.

970
01:40:58,641 --> 01:41:00,666
I'm terribly sorry.

971
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:03,837
No need.

972
01:41:05,881 --> 01:41:07,872
Eat your meat.

973
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,350
- Bye, Daniel.
- Bye.

974
01:41:46,155 --> 01:41:49,124
I didn't know you would be here today.
I'm sorry.

975
01:41:49,158 --> 01:41:51,251
Thank you for not coming in.

976
01:41:51,293 --> 01:41:54,319
You must have been out here for...
You had Iunch?

977
01:41:54,363 --> 01:41:56,695
No. I'm ravenous.

978
01:41:59,068 --> 01:42:02,367
- He's all right, is he?
- I think so.

979
01:42:07,009 --> 01:42:09,341
This isn't very easy, is it?

980
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:20,912
I thought he'd be with you today.

981
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:24,125
He's gone away, yes?

982
01:42:25,928 --> 01:42:29,625
I'm sorry. I only heard it from
the answering service.

983
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,932
- You're welcome to them today.
- Thank you.

984
01:44:25,647 --> 01:44:29,845
I said that I preferred
my scampi without garlic

985
01:44:29,885 --> 01:44:32,718
and my wife would have Iiked a steak,

986
01:44:32,754 --> 01:44:35,245
provided that the meat was first-class.

987
01:45:28,277 --> 01:45:29,938
No.

988
01:45:41,723 --> 01:45:43,714
Bugger the conditional.

989
01:45:46,128 --> 01:45:49,894
When you're at school
and you want to quit,

990
01:45:49,932 --> 01:45:53,834
people say, "You're going to hate it
out in the world."

991
01:45:55,537 --> 01:45:58,131
I didn't believe them and I was right.

992
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:03,809
When I was a kid,
I couldn't wait to be grown-up.

993
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:09,407
They said childhood
is the best time of your Iife but it wasn't.

994
01:46:11,453 --> 01:46:16,288
And now I want his company
and they say,

995
01:46:16,325 --> 01:46:20,455
"What's half a Ioaf?
You're well shot of him."

996
01:46:20,495 --> 01:46:22,986
And I say, "I know that.

997
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:28,527
"But I miss him, that's all."

998
01:46:30,072 --> 01:46:32,768
And they say,
"He never made you happy,"

999
01:46:32,808 --> 01:46:37,108
and I say, "But I am happy,
apart from missing him."

1000
01:46:39,648 --> 01:46:42,811
You might throw me
a pill or two for my cough.

1001
01:46:46,088 --> 01:46:51,082
AII my Iife I've been Iooking
for somebody courageous, resourceful.

1002
01:46:53,228 --> 01:46:55,219
He's not it.

1003
01:46:56,431 --> 01:46:58,490
But something.

1004
01:46:59,768 --> 01:47:01,759
We were something.

1005
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:07,340
I only came about my cough.
