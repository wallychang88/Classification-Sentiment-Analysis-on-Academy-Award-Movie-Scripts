<i>And that question is...</i>

333
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:58,663
who killed Joey Doyle?

334
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:09,049
Not one of you has a line on who killed Joey Doyle?

335
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:16,181
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

336
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,268
<i>All right, then answer this one:</i>

337
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,479
<i>How can we call ourselves Christians...</i>

338
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,814
<i>and protect these murderers with our silence?</i>

339
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:33,323
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

340
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:36,159
How can you just sit there and not say anything?

341
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:38,870
And I'll always think of him as my best friend.

342
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:41,664
- But what do you want me to -
- Who asked him in here?

343
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:45,543
I'm just trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

344
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,213
<i>- Maybe you can be helpful.
- “Helpful”?</i>

345
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:52,217
The brother of Charley the Gent?
They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.

346
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,219
Better leave Charley outta this.

347
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,137
You don't think he'd be “helpful”?

348
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,306
Why don't you ask him yourself?

349
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:00,433
<i>Maybe I will one of these days.</i>

350
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:03,770
“One of these days.”

351
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,981
Now, listen. You know who the pistols are.

352
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,403
You going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

353
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:14,572
Are you?

354
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:17,492
Hey, Dugan, how about you?

355
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,746
One thing you gotta understand, Father:
On the dock we've always been D and D.

356
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:24,124
- “D and D” - what's that?
- Deaf and dumb.

357
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,085
No matter how much we hate
the torpedoes, we don't rat.

358
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,880
“Rat”? Now, boys, get smart.

359
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,425
I know you're gettin' pushed around, but...

360
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,553
there's one thing we've got in this country,
and that's ways of fightin' back.

361
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:39,889
<i>Now, getting the facts to the public,
testifying for what you know is right...</i>

362
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:41,641
<i>against what you know is wrong.</i>

363
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:44,060
<i>And what's ratting to them
is telling the truth for you.</i>

364
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:45,937
<i>Can't you see that?</i>

365
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:50,567
Can't you see that? Huh?

366
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,295
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

367
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,422
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

368
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:16,634
So I'd like to close
with a few words from St. Matthew.

369
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,928
“Come unto me, all ye -”

370
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:23,057
<i>[ Sticks Pounding]</i>

371
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:30,315
What did I tell you, sticking your neck out?
This is a police problem, not ours!

372
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:33,026
- These people need our help, Vince.
- Okay! Okay!

373
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:35,153
Only don't blame me
when they ship you off to Abyssinia.

374
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,988
I won't.

375
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,748
You'd better go home in pairs.
Two's is two, you know.

376
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,335
Come on!

377
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:56,132
- [ Edie] Pop! Pop!
- Come here. Don't go out there.

378
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:03,765
No, no. Come here.

379
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,687
Edie! Edie!

380
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,081
What happened to Pop?

381
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,542
He's an old man. They won't hurt him.

382
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:33,836
Get out, you!

383
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,386
Here, talk to me. Are you all right, Dugan?

384
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,222
Yeah, considerin' they were
usin' my head for a baseball.

385
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:46,516
Are you still D and D? You still call it ratting?

386
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,560
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?

387
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:51,938
If I stick my neck out and they chop it off,
would that be the end of it...

388
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:54,190
- or are you willing to go all the way?
- Down the line.

389
00:25:54,315 --> 00:25:56,150
They'll put the muscle on you too...

390
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:58,403
turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.

391
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,405
Here, wipe your face. Listen to me.

392
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,448
You stand up, and I'll stand up with you.

393
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,577
- Right down the wire?
- So help me God.

394
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:10,957
[Terry] I think we're okay.

395
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:13,042
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

396
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:15,378
Well, they play pretty rough around here.

397
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,547
Well, I can make it home now all right.

398
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:19,591
Okay.

399
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,343
Which side are you with?

400
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:24,887
Me? I'm with me. Terry.

401
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,557
Hey, you got a dime for a cup of coffee?

402
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,434
Beat it, will ya?

403
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,561
Just a little dime you don't need?

404
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,106
Hey, I know you.

405
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,191
You're Edie Doyle.

406
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,277
- Come on, beat it.
- Your brother was a saint.

407
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,738
He's the only one who ever tried
to get me compensation.

408
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,781
What are you doin'? Get outta here, will ya?

409
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,242
You remember, Terry. You was there that night -

410
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,411
- Get outta here.
- You remember.

411
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,830
Get outta here!

412
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:54,125
Here's some change. Go have yourself a ball.

413
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,210
You don't buy me.

414
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,421
You're still a bum.

415
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,632
So long, Edie.

416
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,717
Lord have mercy on Joey.

417
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,970
Who's callin' me a bum?

418
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:11,434
Everybody loved Joey.

419
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,936
From little kids to the old rummies.

420
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:18,316
Did you know him very well?

421
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:22,153
Well, you know, he got around.

422
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:26,491
- What did that man mean just now?
- Don't pay no attention to him.

423
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,868
He's drunk, he's falling down, everything.

424
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:31,788
He's just a juicehead
that hangs around the neighborhood.

425
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,040
Don't pay no attention.

426
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,042
I'd better go now.

427
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,836
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna bite ya.

428
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:43,758
I guess they don't let you walk with fellas
where you've been, huh?

429
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:45,843
You know how the sisters are.

430
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,554
Yeah. Are you training to be a nun?

431
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,723
It's just a regular college.

432
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:52,684
Wait a second.

433
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:55,728
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

434
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,897
Where is that?

435
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:59,857
It's in Tarrytown.

436
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:03,569
- Where is that?
- In the country.

437
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:06,406
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

438
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,953
So how often do you get in here?

439
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:15,707
I guess I haven't been here since last Christmas.

440
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:19,127
We were gonna have a Thanksgiving party.

441
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:23,005
That's nice.

442
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:26,843
What do you do up there? Just - What? Study?

443
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:28,886
I want to be a teacher.

444
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:31,973
A teacher? That's very good. You know -

445
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:35,727
Personally, I admire brains.
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.

446
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:38,563
He done a couple of years of college.

447
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:43,109
It isn't just brains. It's - It's how you use them.

448
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,486
Yeah, I get your thought.

449
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,989
You know, I've seen you a lot of times before.

450
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:51,325
Remember parochial school on Pulaski Street?

451
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:54,412
Seven, eight years ago?
Your hair - Had your hair, uh -

452
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:56,414
Braids. That's right.

453
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,499
Looked like a hunk of rope.

454
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,210
You had wires on your teeth, and...

455
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:03,212
glasses, everything.

456
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,923
You was really a mess.

457
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,177
I can get home all right now, thanks.

458
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:11,721
Hey, listen, don't get sore.
I'm just kiddin' you a little bit.

459
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:14,557
I just mean to tell you that you...

460
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:17,018
grew up very nice.

461
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:19,103
Thanks.

462
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,273
You don't - You don't remember me, do you?

463
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:26,402
I remembered you the first moment I saw you.

464
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,280
By the nose, huh?

465
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:35,953
Well, some people just got faces
that stick in your mind.

466
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:40,416
I remember you were in trouble all the time.

467
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:42,627
Now you got me.

468
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:46,631
Boy, the way those sisters used
to whack me, I don't know what.

469
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:51,302
They thought they was gonna beat
an education into me, but I foxed 'em.

470
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:56,724
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.

471
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,559
How would you have done it?

472
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:03,856
With a little more patience and kindness.

473
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:08,402
That's what makes people mean and difficult:
People don't care enough about them.

474
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:16,661
What, are you kiddin' me?

475
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,579
Come on. I'd better get you home.

476
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:22,250
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

477
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,169
Am I gonna see you again?

478
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,966
What for?

479
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,304
I don't know.

480
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,019
- I really don't know.
- Ah, come on.

481
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,734
Come on.

482
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,044
All right. You're all packed.

483
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,882
Here's your bus ticket, and you're
on your way back to St. Anne's.

484
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:14,969
- I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.
- Edie, for years your mom and me...

485
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:17,722
put quarters into the cookie jar...

486
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:19,932
to keep you up there with the sisters...

487
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:23,144
keep you from things
like I just seen outside the window.

488
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,814
A daughter of mine walkin'
arm in arm with Terry Malloy.

489
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:29,817
- You know who Terry Malloy is?
- Who is he, Pop?

490
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:32,737
<i>- He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...</i>
- [ <i>Cat Meows</i> ]

491
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:37,241
<i>Who is Johnny Friendly's right hand,
and a butcher in a camel-hair coat.</i>

492
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,078
You tryin' to tell me Terry is too?

493
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:43,247
He tries to act tough...

494
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,543
but there's a look in his eye.

495
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:49,670
Yeah, a look in his eye. [ Mock Chuckle ]

496
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:52,798
Hold your hats, brothers. Here we go again.

497
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,092
Do you think he's one of them cases you're always...

498
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,470
draggin' into the house and feelin' sorry for...

499
00:31:57,595 --> 00:32:00,431

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,311
Look...

1006
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:17,356
this girl and the father, they got
their hooks in the kid so deep...

1007
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,775
he doesn't even know which end is up anymore.

1008
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,111
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

1009
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:24,863
All I wanna know is, is he D and D or is he a canary?

1010
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:29,827
I wish I knew.

1011
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:33,372
So do I, Charley. For your sake.

1012
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,880
What do you want me to do?

1013
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:44,967
Look, it's simple. Drive him out
to this place we've been usin'.

1014
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:48,303
Try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.

1015
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:51,265
Johnny, you can't do that.

1016
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:55,561
I mean, maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid.

1017
01:08:55,686 --> 01:08:57,646
“Confused kid”?

1018
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,944
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it, then the next joker.

1019
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,196
Pretty soon I'm just another fellow around here!

1020
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,740
Johnny, I can't do that.

1021
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:16,165
Then don't.

1022
01:09:25,507 --> 01:09:28,218
- Who do you like in the third?
- Gotta be New Hope.

1023
01:09:28,343 --> 01:09:30,179
Definitely.

1024
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:36,143
Johnny...

1025
01:09:36,268 --> 01:09:38,228
he's my kid brother.

1026
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:40,397
That's for you to figure out.

1027
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:42,816
You can have it your way, or you can have it his way.

1028
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:45,360
But you can't have it both ways. Am I right, Truck?

1029
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:47,070

- Yeah.
- The guys would know you well enough to know that you're not a cheese-eater...

1043
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:58,517
but they think maybe you should not
be on the outside so much.

1044
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:02,771
A little on the inside. Have a few little things
workin' for you down at the docks.

1045
01:11:02,896 --> 01:11:07,442
A steady job, a couple
extra potatoes - that's all I want.

1046
01:11:07,609 --> 01:11:11,196
Oh, sure, that's great when you're a kid,
but you're gettin' on.

1047

You're pushin' 30, slugger.

1048
01:11:13,448 --> 01:11:16,243
It's time to think about gettin' some ambition.

1049
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:21,498
Well, I always figured
I'd live a little bit longer without it.

1050

1052
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:34,553
there's a boss loader slot that's open...

1053
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:37,472
on the new pier we're openin' up.

1054
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:39,975
You see, now, it pays six cents...

1055
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,603
on every hundred pounds that goes in
and every hundred pounds that goes out...

1056
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:45,647
and you don't have to lift a finger.

1057
01:11:45,814 --> 01:11:48,817
That's two, three, four hundred dollars a week.

1058
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:52,571
