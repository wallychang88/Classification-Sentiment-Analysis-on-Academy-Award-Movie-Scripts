Shep told me 8:30.

14

The new vehicle plus $40,000.

32
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,783
Yeah, but the deal
was the car first,

33

then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

I thought Shep told you.

35
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,956
Shep didn't tell us much,
Jerry.

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,123
Well, okay...

37
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,376
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

38
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,044
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up, then.

39
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,629
Yeah,
you already said that.

40
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,299
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

41
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,512
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

42
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,138
I'm not gonna debate you,
Jerry.

43
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,223
Okay.

44
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,392
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

45
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,476
I will say this, though.

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,270
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

47
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,399
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

48

You...

51
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,199
My point is,

52
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,119
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

53
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,039
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

54
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,457
It's like robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

55

It doesn't make any sense.

56
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,045

me paying the ransom.

57

if they did, I wouldn't get it,

00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,275
Yeah.

504
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,069
I'll fix you some eggs.

505
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,697
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

506
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,241
You got to eat
a breakfast, Marge.

507
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,036
I'll fix you some eggs.

508
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,998
Hon, you can sleep.

509
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,459
You gotta eat a breakfast.

Norm.

513
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,225
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

514
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,019
Love you, Margie.

515
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,353
Love you, hon.

516
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,513
Hon?

517
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,597
Yeah?

518
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,474
Prowler needs a jump.

What you got there?

522
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,252
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

523
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,045
Thanks a bunch.

524
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,421
So what's the deal now?

525
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,714
Gary says triple homicide?

526
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,091
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

527
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,759
Two of them are over here.

528
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,761
Where is everybody?

529
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,639
Well, it's cold, Margie.

530

Watch your step, Margie.

531
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,697

Here's the second one!

534
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,788
It's in the head
and the hand there.

535
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,125
I guess that's
a defensive wound.

536
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,793
Oh, yeah?

537
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,880
Where's the state trooper?

538
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,633
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

539
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,135
Okay.

540
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,597
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

541
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,140
We got a shooting.

542
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,600
These folks drive by.

543
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,311
There's a high-speed
pursuit, ends here,

544
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,605
and then this
execution-type deal.

545
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,814
Yeah.

546
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,319
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

547
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,570
Yeah.

548
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,948
And I'll tell you what.

549
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:26,160
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

550
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,207
You see something
down there, Chief?

551
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,085
No. I just think
I'm gonna barf.

552
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,295
Jeez.

553
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,839
You okay, Margie?

554
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,507
Yeah. I'm fine.

555
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,095
It's just morning sickness.

556
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,099
Well, that passed.

557
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,267
Yeah?

558
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,977
Yeah. Now
I'm hungry again.

559
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,647
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

560
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,190
Oh, yeah.

561
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,775
Norm made some eggs.

562
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,026
Yeah?

563
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,028
Well...

564
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,198
What now, do you think?

565
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,367
Let's go take
a look at that trooper.

566
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,288
There's different
footprints here, Lou.

<font color="#804040">LOU:</font> Yeah?

568
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,125
Yeah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

569
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,502
Oh, yeah?

570
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,963
<font color="#804040">MARGE:</font>
For Pete's sake.

571
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,464
How's it look, Marge?

572
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,550
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

573
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,470
and he looks like
a nice enough guy.

574
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,514
It's a real shame.

575
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,932
<font color="#804040">LOU:</font> Yeah.

576
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,436
Didn't monkey with his
car there, did you?

577
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,604
No way.

578
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,314
Well, somebody shut his lights.

579
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,816
I guess the little guy
sat in there

580
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,234
waiting for his
buddy to come back.

581
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,902
Yeah, it would have
been cold out here.

582
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,905
Heck, yeah. You think
is Dave open yet?

583
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,115
Dave?

584
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,659
You don't think
he's mixed up in...

585
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,079
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

586
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,792
Did you look
in his citation book?

587
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:02,089
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

588
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,383
Under plate
number he put "DLR."

589
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,135
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

590
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,263
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

591
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,850
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

592
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,019
They don't got no match yet.

593
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,063
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

594
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,190
on your police work there, Lou.

595
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,608
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,446
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

597
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,281
"DLR."

598
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,617
Oh.

599
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,787
Jeez.

600
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,749
Say, Lou,

601
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,916
did you hear
the one about the guy

602
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,543
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

603
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,963
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

604
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,008
Yeah. That's a good one.

605
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:57,186
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

606
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,063
No. They said no cops.

607
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,898
They were darn
clear on that, Wade.

608
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,941
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

609
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,443
Of course they're
gonna say that.

610
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,570
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

611
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,572
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

612
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,449
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

613
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,533
Well, they...

614
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,701
$1 million is a lot
of damn money.

615
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,495
- Yeah, but...
- There they are. They got my daughter.

616
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,080
Think this thing
through here, Wade.

617
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,083
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

618
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,044
You got to listen to
me on this one, Wade.

619
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,921
Heck, you don't know.

620
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,006
You're just whistling
Dixie here.

621
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,092
I'm saying the cops, they
can advise us on this.

622
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,426
I'm saying call a professional.

623
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,470
No. No cops.

624
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,973
That's final. This is
my deal here, Wade.

625
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah.

626
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,143
Jean is my wife here.

627
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,105
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

628
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,189
Well...

629
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,441
We got to protect Jean. These...

630
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,276
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

631
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,320
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

632
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,530
You're darn tooting.

633
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,697
Oh, damn it.

634
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,949

635
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,409
Well, why don't we...

636
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,080
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

637
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,581
Now, come on here!

638
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,625
No way, Wade.
No way.

639
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,085
We're not horse-trading
here, Wade.

640
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,169
Yeah.

641
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,963
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

642
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,172
Yeah.

643
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,844
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

644
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,555
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

645
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,223
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

646
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,474
Damn it!

647
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,770
How was everything today?

648
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,647
Yeah. Real good, now.

649
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,984
How you doing?

650
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,904
Okay. Now, we'll get
the money together.

651
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,115
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

652
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,119
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

653
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,662
No, I...
They don't...

654
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,539
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

655
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,832
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

656
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,084
You know, they said
no one listening in.

657
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,335
They'll be watching.

658
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,379
You know, maybe it's all bull,

659
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,007
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

660
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,258
Okay.

661
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,303
Now, is Scotty
gonna be all right?

662
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,098
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

663
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,475

In what way?

742
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,289

Just funny-looking.

He wasn't circumcised.

746
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,590

apart from that?

747
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,799
Yeah.

748
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,596

with the little fella, then.

Uh-huh.

750
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,266
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

751
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,186
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

752
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,313

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

757
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,945
But maybe I'm saying
that, you know,

758
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,323
'cause he smoked
a lot of Marlboros.

759

So, it didn't work out, huh?

1093

And then I've been working for

didn't work out. It's...

1101
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,393
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1102
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,313
She was...
She passed away.

1103
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,773
No.

1104
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,360

01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,863

1107

You know...

1109

1112
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:50,636

Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1190
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,846
and I shoot you and I
shoot your fucking wife,

1191
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,222
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1192
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,767
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1193
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,685
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1194
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:27,770

1195
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,521
Okay. Real good, then.

It's okay, Scotty.

1198
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,551
Where you going?

1199
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,929
I'll be back in a minute.

1200
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:06,558
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1201
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:09,937
Okay.

1202
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,606
Here's your damn money.

1203
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,400

1204
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,194
Yeah.

01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,590
Who the fuck are you?

1207
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,220
Who the fuck are you?

1208
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,390
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1209
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,976
I am through fucking around!

1210

Where's my daughter?

1212
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,857
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1213
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,234
I gave simple
fucking instructions.

1214
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,027
Where's my damn daughter?

1215
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,445
No Jean, no money.

1216

No Jean, no money!

Oh, jeez.

1241
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,028
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1242
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,488
Officer Olson.

1243
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,073
Yeah. Righto.

1244
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,117
Well...

1245
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,411
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1246
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,205
and this little guy's drinking,

1247
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,290
and he says, "Where can
a guy find some action?

1248
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,626
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1249
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,211
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1250
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,463
And he says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1251
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,006
And I says, "Well,
what do I look like?

1252
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,259
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1253
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,845
And he says, "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1254
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,181
And I says, "Yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place."

1255
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:41,768
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1256
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,395
Only he don't use
the word "jerk."

1257
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,021
- I understand.
- Then he calls me a jerk,

1258
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,566
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1259
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,234
So, I don't say nothing.

1260
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,194
He says, "What do you
think about that?"

1261
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,698
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1262
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,824
You got that right.

1263
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,659
Yeah, he says, "Yeah,
that guy's dead,

1264
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,244
"and I don't mean
of old age."

1265
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,831
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1266
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:03,957
White Bear Lake?

1267
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,501
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1268
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:07,711
So I made that assumption.

1269
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:08,795
Sure.

1270
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,672
Anyway, he's drinking
at the bar,

1271
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,465
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1272
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,552
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1273
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,764
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1274
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,602
End of story.

1275
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,687
Well, what'd this guy
look like, anyways?

1276
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,355
Oh, he's a...

1277
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,065
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1278
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,359
In what way?

1279
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,445
Just in a general kind of way.

1280
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,114
Okay. Well, thanks a
bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1281
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,866
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1282
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,159
but thanks for calling her in.

1283
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,493
Sure.

1284
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,163
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1285
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,540
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1286
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,918
Yeah.

1289
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,745
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1290
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,289
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

1291
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,749
But you think he's all right?

1292
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,000
I saw him last night and...

1293
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,085
<i>What did he say?</i>

1294
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,878
Well, it's nothing
specific he said.

1295
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,173
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1296
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,175
<i>- His wife?
- Linda.</i>

1297
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,219
<i>- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.</i>

1298
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,137
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

1299
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:49,140
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

1300
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,310
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

1301
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:53,937
So...

1302
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,939
He didn't...

1303
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:57,482
He never...

1304
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,234
<i>No! No,
they never married.</i>

1305
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,820
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

1306
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,279
Oh, my.

1307
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,906
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

1308
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,325
<i>He's living
with his parents now.</i>

1309
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,828
Oh, jeez.

1310
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,288
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1311
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:13,957
Jeez. Well...

1312
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,667

1313
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,087

I'm kind of busy here.

1317
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,981
I understand. I'll keep
it real short, then.

1318
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,901
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1319
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,152
Do you mind if I sit down?

1320
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,403
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1321
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,613
No, I...

1322
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,406
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1323
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,491
I was just wondering...

1324
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,702
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1325
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,871
Okay. Are you sure?

1326
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,291
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1327
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,001
Because, see, the crime
I'm investigating,

1328
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,295
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1329
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,630
and they called
someone who works here,

1330
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,340
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1331
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,258
you know, connected.

1332
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,260
Yeah, I see.

1333
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,803
So, how do you...

1334
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,014
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1335
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,724
The car's not
from our lot, ma'am.

1336
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,893
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1337
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,686
Well, I would know.

1338
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,522
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1339
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,315

Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1343
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:08,655
I mean,
are the cars counted daily,

1344
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,573
or what kind of a routine here?

1345
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,117
