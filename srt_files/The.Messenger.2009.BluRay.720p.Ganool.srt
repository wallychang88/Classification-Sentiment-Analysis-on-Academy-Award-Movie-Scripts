1
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,642
Here. Right here. Just wait.

2
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,189
Sorry. I'm late. I...

3
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,987
I ain't dead yet.

4
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,782
It's also for healing.

5
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,952
And celebration, you know?

6
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,468
Hey.

7
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,322
Yeah.

8
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,371
- Thank you.
- I'd like to sit at that table.

9
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,084
- Why?
- I'd like to sit at that table.

10
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,505
- I know, but they're still eating. It's fine...
- I can see that.

11
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,882
I don't know, I think...

12
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,470
I think in, like, a year or so, you know,
I think I'll be ready...

13
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,849
but, you know, I really–
I want to get married.

14
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,768
I just... like, eventually, you know.
I don't...

15
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,188
I just don't want to right now.

16
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:14,527
Plus, we're kind of on this,
like, cruise control, you know?

17
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,155
Which is normal. I mean, it happens to
every couple. It happened to us.

18
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,575
Where did you tell him you were going?

19
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,369
- To visit you.
- Yeah, right.

20
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,747
To visit my dad.

21
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,251
- And he believed that?
- I invited him actually, but...

22
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,629
it turns out he was really, really busy.

23
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,676
You always were a terrific liar.

24
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,763
That's not fair.

25
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,568
- I really do love him, you know?
- Well, I do.

26
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,987
He's the right guy for you.

27
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,952
I mean, what do you want to do?

28
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,706
Are you thinking... family?
Bachelorhood?

29
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,751
College? Job?

30
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,092
You don't have to worry about me.

31
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,511
The world's my fucking oyster.

32
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,813
Thanks for coming.

33
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,609
I really wanted to see you.

34
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,529
I'm glad you came.

35
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,543
Say hi to Alan for me.

36
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
I don't think so.

37
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,132
Somewhere you gotta be?

38
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,509
No, sir.

39
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,724
How long has he been waiting?

40
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,354
Seventeen minutes, sir.

41
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,527
Send him in.

42
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,695
Yes, sir.

43
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,117
Come in.

44
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,460
Sir, Staff Sergeant Montgomery reports.

45
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,339
At ease. How you getting on, Montgomery?

46
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,259
- It's going well, sir.
- I have an assignment for you, Montgomery.

47
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,512
It so happens that over the few months you
have left on your enlistment...

48
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,100
you will get your chance to render some of
your most valuable service to your country.

49
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,854
I'm assigning you to
a Casualty Notification team.

50
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,483
Sir?

51
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,652
Captain Stone will show you the ropes.

52
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,322
He is the expert.

53
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,118
But until he does,
I just want to make myself very clear...

54
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,914
that although most of your time will
remain occupied by your other duties...

55
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:59,418
CNO is to be your absolute priority.

56
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,755
This mission is not simply important.

57
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,091
It is sacred.

58
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,259
- Sir, if I may?
- Go ahead.

59
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,013
I've never received any grief counseling,
let alone given it.

60
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,058
I'm not a religious man, sir.

61
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,143
We're just there for notification.

62
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,313
Not God. Not heaven.

63
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,358
Montgomery...

64
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,362
this job is about character.

65
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,785
Now I have had soldiers go out on
notification and break into a stutter.

66
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,498
Men so nervous they read from a script
or get the name wrong...

67
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,458
or the address.

68
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,002
Too many tears.

69
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,089
I need men of solid stature.

70
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,303
Now you are a model soldier.
Hell, you're a goddamn hero.

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,394
Casualty is a soldier who's
been killed, wounded, missing...

72
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,188
captured, beleaguered or besieged.

73
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,108
Of course, our job's mainly about killed.

74
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,069
What you actually need
to do is pretty simple...

75
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,947
read the guidebook, learn the script...

76
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,908
stick to the script, fill in the blanks
from the casualty report.

77
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,286
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

78
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,539
Can you look at me when I speak with you?

79
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,749
Much appreciated.

80
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,921
Never say stuff like lost
or expired or passed away...

81
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,673
things people misunderstand.

82
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:32,511
I knew this guy once told this old lady
that her grandson was no longer with us.

83
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,932
She thought he had defected to the enemy,
started calling him a traitor.

84
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,814
We need to be clear.
Need to say killed or died.

85
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,692
What we don't say
is the deceased or the body.

86
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,279
We call each casualty by name.
We honor them. You with me?

87
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,406
- Yes, sir.
- Then look at me, Sergeant.

88
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,454
You do not speak with anybody
other than the next of kin.

89
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,874
No friend, no neighbor,
no coworker or mistress.

90
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,002
Hours of operation are 0600 to 2200 hours.

91
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,338
We don't want to wake anybody
up in the middle of the night...

92
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,424
though if you ask me, hitting them with
the news at the crack of dawn...

93
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,136
is not exactly a great way
to start their day, breakfast wise.

94
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,224
What do we do if
the next of kin isn't around?

95
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,393
We leave. We don't wait. We don't lurk.
We come back later.

96
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:25,856
This is a zero-defect mission.
A pure hit-and-git operation.

97
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,235
Is that it, sir?

98
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,281
One more thing.
You do not touch the NOK.

99
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,911
Avoid physical contact
with the next of kin...

100
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:43,374
unless it's a medical emergency, like if they
were having a heart attack or something.

101
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,921
You're representing the Secretary of the Army,
not Will Montgomery.

102
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,299
So in case you feel like offering a hug
or something, don't.

103
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,260
It'll only get you in trouble.

104
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,681
I'm not gonna be offering any hugs, sir.

105
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,851
- Is that's it?
- No.

106
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,771
These are the rules. It's not the job.

107
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,523
The job is about...

108
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,527
something else.

109
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,363
You gotta do it before you can understand.

110
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,493
You a head case?

111
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,830
No, sir.

112
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,041
I surely hope not.

113
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,047
Then that's it. You can go.

114
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,568
Sergeant, one more thing.

115
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,365
We make it our business to deliver
the news within 24 hours of positive ID.

116
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,367
The ideal is within four.

117
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,121
We're racing FOX,
CNN, Drudge Report, what-have-you.

118
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,249
Not to mention any soldier
with a cell phone or a webcam.

119
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,668
The whole point is we gotta be first.

120
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,211
So, if you're in bed...

121
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:16,133
or church or the ballet,
this baby stays on.

122
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,595
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,685
Tried and true.

124
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,898
A long battery life too. Can't be beat.

125
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,445
I know what you're thinking.

126
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,199
You're thinking...
"Shit, I'm a goddamn decorated war hero...

127
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,203
with three months left to serve and they
draft me into the Angels of Death squadron.

128
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,664
I get a beeper, a canned speech...

129
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:52,169
and a lunatic commanding officer
to surfa fucking ocean of grief."

130
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,630
Am I right?

131
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,258
More or less, sir. Am I right?

132
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,433
It's the middle of the fucking night!

133
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,518
Turn that fucking music off!

134
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,128
There's your problem.

135
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,047
Attention to detail, Private!

136
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,844
Read the fucking manual!

137
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,723
You have 130-degree heat.
You have sand blasting.

138
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,142
It's baked the hose
right under the housing.

139
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,227
Break the suction.

140
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,565
Every second you're
on the side of the road...

141
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,401
increases your chances of getting shot...

142
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,403
your boys shot, your boys blown up.

143
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,364
No haji armor's gonna protect you.

144
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,659
Plus you're fucking up
a five billion dollar a week operation...

145
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,079
because you don't have
a 25 cent cooling hose.

146
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,665
So you think ahead.
You have 10 in the back.

147
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,959
You think ahead. You prepare.
You think ahead.

148
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,596
Yeah, well, should be
in the next couple blocks.

149
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,265
We should just ask someone.

150
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,433
No.

151
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,438
First of all, men don't ask for directions,
much less soldiers.

152
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:22,694
Soldiers on a notification, definitely,
positively do not ask for freaking directions.

153
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,282
No GPS. No MapQuest. We navigate.

154
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,662
Second, you never wanna park too close.

155
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:36,458
They hear a car park, go to the window,
see two soldiers getting out...

156
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,502
it's just a minute of torture.

157
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,757
Now I should warn you
some of them do have guns.

158
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,721
Knocking is ominous,
but ringing is jarring.

159
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,058
Or worse, sometimes you get one ofthose
god-awful chirping doorbells...

160
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,894
some singsongy shit throws
you right off your game.

161
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,231
Yankee Doodle went to town
A ridin' on a pony

162
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,234
And "Sorry your husband is dead"
doesn't flow. So I knock.

163
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,237
I don't really like to say good morning
or good afternoon either.

164
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,447
There ain't nothing good about it.

165
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,034
I used to introduce myself, that's standard,
but now I think it's rude.

166
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,996
It ain't about me. Lose the shades.

167
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,014
We're looking for Mrs. Tina Burrell.
Is she in?

168
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,644
Is Leroy in trouble again?
I'm his girlfriend.

169
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,355
We need to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

170
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,066
Okay, Come in. Come in.

171
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,284
Please, sit down.

172
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,203
I just made some tea.

173
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,540
Do you want some?

174
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,461
Ma'am, could you please get Mrs. Burrell?

175
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,964
Yeah, she's down the block. She just called.
She'll be back in a minute.

176
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,429
I thought you said we don't wait.

177
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,892
If she's not here in 30 seconds,
we're gone.

178
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,811
Sit.

179
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,107
I'm Monica. I'm Leroy's girlfriend.

180
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,946
And this is his baby. He's a boy.

181
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,992
But he don't know that yet, so don't tell
him because I ain't calling him Junior.

182
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,495
Two cell phones.

183
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,999
One was $209.75, and the other...

184
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,584
What did he do?

185
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,339
I'm sorry, ma'am. Our orders
are to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

186
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,008
Well, I am too. I mean, I was gonna be.

187
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,470
We were supposed to get married, but then
my father got laid off and...

188
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,350
Look, I know Leroy's always saying
the wrong thing, but he's a good man.

189
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,062
Please, just tell me.

190
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,648
I got an envelope
with these sheets of paper.

191
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,650
Could I see those papers, please?

192
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,694
We'll be back.

193
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,864
You sent her the money and this envelope
came with these two pictures...

194
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,659
Sir, tell me.

195
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:24,292
Oh, why? Oh, no,
please, God, no! My, God, why?

196
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,879
- What's going...
- I have bad news, Mrs. Burrell.

197
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,883
The Secretary of the Army has asked me to
express his deepest regret...

198
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,720
that your son,
Private First Class Leroy Burrell...

199
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,931
No, no, no!
You got to go! You got to go!

200
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:42,561
- I'm very sorry, Mrs. Burrell.
- No. Listen. No!

201
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,106
That's my baby. That's my baby.

202
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,108
We can't do this right...

203
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,319
- Your son was killed yesterday–
- Monica... Oh, my God! My house is a mess.

204
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,574
- A Casualty Assistance...
- No! Don't you say that about my baby!

205
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,243
Don't you say that about my baby!

206
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,496
- I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- No! Make him go!

207
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,541
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

208
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,836
- to help you arrange for the funeral.
- Tell him to stop saying that!

209
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,558
We left them with the next-door neighbor.

210
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:26,062
- How'd she take it?
- Hard. Very hard.

211
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,064
- Okay.
- Yep.

212
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,776
We'll be there by 1000 hours.

213
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,861
All right, thanks. Good luck.

214
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,198
CAO is on the way.

215
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,079
No such thing as a satisfied customer.

216
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,666
Ice cream! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!

217
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,919
Double whiskey, please.

218
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,589
- Hot water and lemon?
- And a glass of ice.

219
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,555
I'm in AA, if you're asking.

220
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:06,394
Been sober three years. Mind you, I never
drank anything stronger than pop.

221
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,898
Of course, my pop would drink
just about anything.

222
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,284
Oh, they tell them to get ready
when their kids deploy...

223
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,703
but they never really listen, do they?

224
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:29,167
Soldiers go to war
and everyone waves flags and applauds...

225
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:34,589
Iook at charts, study strategies,
have "informed opinions."

226
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:39,302
And then bullets fly and soldiers die
and it's such a shock.

227
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,765
Fuck that! What did they think
it was gonna be like, FearFactor?

228
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,854
- Where'd you see action?
- Desert Storm/Desert Shield.

229
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,650
Never got a crack at Enduring Freedom
or Iraqi Freedom, much to my chagrin.

230
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,320
Wasn't much of a war, but...

231
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,116
I got my baptism too.

232
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,619
You weren't the only one getting shot at.

233
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,840
So they say you saved your buddies.

234
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,725
You want to know what I think?

235
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:32,105
I think they ought to show
every goddamn funeral on TV, live.

236
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,984
Have the president come
around from time to time and eulogize...

237
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,279
the vice president, get people used to it.

238
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,656
I mean, are we at war or not?

239
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,204
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

240
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,042
- Let me know if you guys need anything else.
- Oh, you know it already, Emily.

241
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:01,343
I'd like to strap her on and wear her like
a government-issue gas mask.

242
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,888
- I got my sights on her, so don't even go there.
- Roger that.

243
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,436
I figure I could play
the sensitivity card.

244
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,980
Tell her what my day was like
down in death valley.

245
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,817
Then again, sympathy backfires...

246
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,861
she'll never leave.

247
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,657
Trust me, I've been married three times.
Twice to the same woman.

248
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,622
So now you know what the mission is.

249
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,831
Yeah.

250
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,627
Hey, if you're not cut out for it...

251
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
you're not cut out for it.

252
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,054
So you have a girl?

253
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,475
You got to think about it?

254
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,103
Kelly.

255
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,690
We were together
since we were little kids.

256
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,900
Then when I was deployed, everything...

257
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,860
She wanted you to commit, you balked...

258
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:05,198
and the minute you were gone,
Jody plunked his ass down in the La-Z-Boy.

259
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,242
You probably dodged a bullet.

260
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,204
The only reason to get married like that
is the extra pay.

261
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,415
Cut them in, then cut them loose.

262
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,628
Of course, they can always get pregnant
and bleed you dry.

263
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,006
It's too easy.

264
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,968
I just told her she was free.
I didn't want you knocking on her door.

265
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,602
Yeah, well.
Anyway, lot of Shellys out there.

266
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,938
Kelly.

267
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,781
You know, up to Vietnam,
they used send a telegram.

268
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,118
If it was your wife, what would she want?

269
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,039
Why don't you just kill me,
you son of a bitch!

270
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,375
Yeah! Come on! Come on!

271
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,476
Hey, that was quick.

272
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,022
Are you awake?
Just making sure you're on your toes.

273
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,817
- Is this a joke, sir?
- No, no. I just...

274
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:09,823
You know, since I stopped drinking,
I stay up nights...

275
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,659
especially after notifying someone.

276
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:20,667
So you think you might stay on
after your enlistment's up?

277
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:21,751
I mean...

278
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,461
hell, you...

279
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,591
What's your e-mail anyway? Do you IM?

280
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,760
I don't have a computer.

281
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,055
Really? How does that work?

282
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,892
Hey, you're funny.

283
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,146
- What?
- You calling my beeper.

284
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,566
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, shit.

285
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,860
Get ready. I'll meet you on post.

286
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,289
What's going on?

287
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,416
You gotta get out of here.

288
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,715
Don't look at me like that. I gotta go,
so you gotta go. Come on, let's go.

289
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,052
I don't get it. You married or something?

290
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:19,392
No, no. I just got... work.

291
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,353
Work? In the middle of the night
all of a sudden?

292
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,523
What the do you do? Deliver babies?

293
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,407
Dale Martin. Dale Martin. Dale. Dale.

294
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,661
Specialist Eric Martin, killed in action...

295
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,539
- I got it covered.
- I'm doing this one.

296
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,708
...in southern Iraq...
- It's okay. I'll do it.

297
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,377
I'm assigned to do something,
I'm going to do it, sir.

298
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,673
Specialist Eric Martin, southern Iraq.

299
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,636
Well, okay. It's a man this time.

300
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,389
So?

301
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:04,354
Men try harder to keep it together.
They're also the ones that can hurt you.

302
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,356
You cannot be a burden to taxpayers!

303
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,359
- You're not entitled to welfare...
- I'm doing this.

304
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,028
...assistance that comes
in any way out of my pocket.

305
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,113
Well, then, reach down in your pants...

306
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,408
grab a double handful of balls
and do it right.

307
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,119
Freeloader, got it! You can come here
ifyou can invest here...

308
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,747
around, let's say, 50 times
the current minimum wage.

309
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,832
If you can do that, ha, come!

310
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:11,671
Let's go.

311
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,638
Excuse me?

312
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,891
Mr. Martin?

313
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,144
Oh, shit!

314
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,313
Dale Martin?

315
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,608
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express his deep regret...

316
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,572
that your son, Specialist Eric Martin,
was killed in action yesterday...

317
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,491
in southern Iraq by sniper fire.

318
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,578
You will receive a more complete report
as soon as possible, sir.

319
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:48,291
What we can tell you right now is that his
platoon came under sniper fire...

320
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,961
and it was an instant death.

321
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,174
I'm so sorry.

322
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,138
Look at that tree.

323
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,184
I said look at that fucking tree.

324
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,438
It's the same age as my son.

325
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,239
"If I don't go,
who's gonna go in place of me?"

326
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,824
That's what he said.

327
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,289
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in four hours...

328
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,666
- Fucking bastards!
- Will notify you in...

329
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,837
Will notify you in four hours.

330
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,340
Is there a neighbor
or a friend or a family member...

331
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,093
- You fucking idiot!
- That can come and help you in your trying time?

332
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,471
Why aren't you there?

333
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,266
Why aren't you dead?

334
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,313
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Why aren't you there now?

335
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,567
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking cowards.

336
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,570
- Let's go.
- I don't care if you're fucking sorry!

337
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,280
We're done here.

338
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,533
Don't you fucking say you're sorry to me.

339
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,287
You want to tell his mother?

340
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,832
Are you gonna tell his mother?

341
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,167
He's fucking 20 years old!

342
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,129
Keep walking.

343
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,384
- You fucking coward!
- Keep walking.

344
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,594
- I said...
- I don't fucking care!

345
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,348
Sergeant,
he touches you again, I'll handle it.

346
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,017
What? Fucking handle what?

347
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,688
You'll fucking handle what?

348
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,525
You fucking cowards!

349
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,559
Well, I guess one way or another
we're all God's children.

350
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,233
It's all fortune cookies to me, sir.

351
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,041
I'm not really happy with these drops.

352
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,753
I'm gonna prescribe something else.

353
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,842
What's the doctor saying about the leg?

354
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:48,262
It's getting better. Though but I'm sort
of rooting for the eye.

355
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,182
It's not a race.

356
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,060
Polytrauma takes a lot of patience.

357
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,439
The body parts are literally
on different schedules.

358
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:04,111
"And all the king's horses
and all the king's men..." How does it go?

359
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,617
"Couldn't put Humpty back together again."

360
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,796
Kelly's phone. This is Alan.

361
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,976
Answer off.

362
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,624
Shit.

363
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,753
- Son of a bitch.
...for sentencing tomorrow.

364
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,881
We'll keep you posted.
And the State Supreme Court...

365
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,766
Don't say anything. I'll do the talking.

366
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,691
Sergeant.

367
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,694
- License and registration.
- What'd I do?

368
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,114
You went through a red light
about a half a mile back.

369
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,117
- It was yellow.
- It was red when he went through it.

370
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,578
- It's an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

371
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,706
A soldier died.
We're going to notify the widow.

372
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,917
- That's not an emergency.
- It's about timing.

373
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,461
You know that.

374
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,297
Yeah, well, you get into a wreck
on your way to a notification...

375
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,342
you kill somebody, you get yourself killed,
how's that gonna feel?

376
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,427
That's a jackass move.

377
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,429
- Can you believe this shit?
- Excuse me?

378
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,139
No, he's right. He's right.

379
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,356
I don't want to do this anyway.

380
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,275
You want to do it?

381
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:14,200
Go to this address,
her name is Olivia Pitterson.

382
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,119
Knock on her door
and break her little heart.

383
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,456
Fuck it.
Well, let's pretend it didn't happen.

384
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,336
Let her find out that he got blown up
from some kid at the local news desk.

385
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,048
Let him put her on hold, 'cause you don't
give a fuck about her, do you?

386
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,344
No. No! You are just doing your job.

387
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,231
Get the hell out of here.

388
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,892
- All right. Hey!
- Yeah, me too.

389
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,894
Last one's is ready!

390
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,105
Pretty high up, isn't it, huh?

391
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,955
Could be worse.

392
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,082
It could be Christmas.

393
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,046
Jesus.

394
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,146
Mrs. Pitterson? Mrs. Pitterson.

395
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,524
Are you Mrs. Pitterson?

396
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,362
How did it happen?

397
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,034
Did anyone talk with you already, ma'am?

398
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,788
How did he die?

399
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,835
He was killed in action yesterday
in the city of Mosul.

400
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,962
That's all the information
we have now, ma'am.

401
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:36,801
But the Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

402
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,677
There's no need.

403
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,435
But...

404
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,400
I would ask you in, but my little boy...

405
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,531
Am I supposed to call Phil's parents?

406
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,576
Not unless you want to, ma'am.

407
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,455
Your husband's DD-93 has you
listed as the primary NOK...

408
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,833
and them as secondary.

409
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,878
They moved to Florida.
Is that still accurate?

410
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,171
Yes.

411
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,885
A local notification team
has been alerted...

412
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,764
and they're waiting for us
to give them the go-ahead.

413
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,185
Okay, thanks a lot. Good-bye.

414
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,689
The Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

415
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,525
to help make arrangements for the funeral.

416
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,443
Okay. Thanks.

417
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,864
Good-bye.

418
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:46,287
Ma'am, would you like us
to notify your child?

419
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,249
What?

420
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,462
No, no. I can tell my little boy.

421
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,885
Okay, good-bye.
I know this can't be easy foryou.

422
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:09,602
- Lfyou have any further questions, just...
- No. No. No, thanks.

423
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,166
Sergeant!

424
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:43,218
"I know this can't be easy foryou."
Can you believe that?

425
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,512
That's a first.

426
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,685
She's banging someone.
You see the shirt she was hanging?

427
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:59,526
Her husband dies 10,000 miles away,
she's got a man on the clothesline already.

428
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:08,452
Hey, we getting in this vehicle
sometime today?

429
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,081
We walk into these people's lives,
we don't know shit.

430
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,123
Trust me.

431
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,792
You don't want to know.

432
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,172
Come on.

433
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:28,514
From now on we take the silver bullet.
Your wheels are crap.

434
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,861
Why are you giving me pancakes?

435
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,406
'Cause you're my baby and I love you.

436
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,409
What's wrong?

437
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,812
You going to pretend you don't have one?

438
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,399
I know you have her picture.

439
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm willing to bet the next round on it.

440
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,619
What have we here?

441
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,456
Nice.

442
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,751
You can afford the next round.

443
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:46,967
Nice.

444
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,720
Very nice. Table grade.

445
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,431
I could slop her up with a biscuit.

446
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,933
Yeah, well, she has
a very serious boyfriend.

447
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,396
No, I don't buy it. Not this girl.
There's nothing serious about her.

448
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,818
She's having a ball down in Nowheresville
while you pine for her.

449
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,863
You still got her number?

450
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,747
Oh, wait. Hey, hey.

451
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,165
Come here.

452
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,418
Sit. Will you sit?

453
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,674
Listen, I thought we had
a great time the other night.

454
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,220
You were amazing, as was I...

455
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:36,183
and I'm sorry I had to go,
but tonight's another night.

456
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,852
I'm pregnant.

457
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,150
I'm just fucking with you.

458
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,654
- Have a good life.
- A good life.

459
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,614
Hey, you got my hopes up.

460
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,834
A glass of ice, hot water, lemon.

461
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,418
Paid in full.

462
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,882
I think I'm gonna head out.

463
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,261
Where you going?

464
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,724
- I'm gonna go home.
- What for? Internet porn?

465
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,478
Come on, you don't even have a computer.

466
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:22,729
What...

467
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,692
I was bullshitting. No, stay.

468
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,906
Forget women.
We'll talk about something else, right?

469
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,410
Sleep when you're dead.

470
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,079
What's your deal?

471
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,415
Your folks around?

472
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,508
My father's gone.

473
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,929
My mom's a... nut.

474
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,515
I haven't seen her in years.

475
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,102
Another lost child
looking for family, huh?

476
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,521
I guess so.

477
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,402
Why did you join?

478
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,488
- A dare.
- A dare?

479
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,032
Why are you still here?

480
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,619
Well, they offered me a commission
and no one dared me to leave.

481
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,586
And I dare you to stay.

482
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,428
Hey, we're not gonna lie to you... Iraq,
Afghanistan... wherever we go next, hostile.

483
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,765
Hey, it's crazy, but it's real.

484
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,143
Hey, the army's hard work. Fighting terrorists,
rebuilding countries, saving lives.

485
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,728
And risking our lives?

486
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,688
I don't have to remind you
how many Americans lost their lives...

487
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,565
just showing up for work
one morning in September, do I?

488
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,484
- That's right.
- No, I didn't think so.

489
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,569
Shoot, there's risk in the army,
there's risk in life.

490
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,571
But we're talking about rewards here...

491
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,241
and we're talking about
a feeling that you can get...

492
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,453
but not from flinging hot dogs at a ball game
or bagging groceries at a supermarket.

493
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,081
We're talking about honor and discipline.

494
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,250
- Self-respect.
- Thank you.

495
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,918
I just wanna fuck some shit up.

496
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,420
- That does come with the job sometimes.
- Oh, come on.

497
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,422
You have any sort of skills
you want to bring to the army?

498
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,049
Leave them alone.
They're just kids.

499
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,301
Oh, ma'am, these young men
want to serve their country.

500
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,054
- They're here by their free will.
- Oh, do you want to take a look?

501
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,265
- You want to take a look at this, see?
- Okay, ma'am...

502
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,267
- You want to guess what it's for?
- Ma'am...

503
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,936
There's a sticker on my husband's coffin
that says "remains unviewable."

504
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
- Ma'am, we're very sorry...
- Nice big tall boys like you.

505
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,524
- And what's left could fit in a shoe box.
- I understand you're upset.

506
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,818
- Why don't you calm down?
- Ma'am, why don't you take your son home...

507
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,404
Why don't you take your son home
and calm down?

508
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,532
Why don't you go home? In fact, why
doesn't everybody just go home?

509
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,534
- That's right go home!
- We're all in this together.

510
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,328
- Sergeant. Take a walk.
- Why doesn't everybody just go home?

511
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,330
- Yes, sir.
- You guys know where to find us.

512
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,541
- What are you looking at? Just go home!
- You okay?

513
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,501
Yeah.

514
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,338
- Do you need anything?
- What? No, thank you.

515
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,258
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Come on.

516
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,684
- Come on.
- I hate this suit!

517
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,812
Pick it up.
I've asked you to pick that up.

518
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,689
Pick it up. Now.

519
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,776
Do not do that.

520
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,002
I was getting a prescription...

521
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,714
at the mall.

522
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,676
And that's why I was at the mall.

523
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,971
I have this eye...

524
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,559
I gotta get... take drops... for...

525
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,982
It's okay now? Is it okay now?

526
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,027
Yeah.

527
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:05,952
Gets dry. It's kinda... spotty.

528
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,489
You'll need a new transmission soon.

529
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,200
Can I pay you something?

530
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,535
No.

531
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,666
I should get a new car
at some point, but...

532
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:57,337
it just feels wrong,
you know, with the new money.

533
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,467
Do you play?

534
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,762
No.

535
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,514
I work at Lock and Keep.

536
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,685
It's a storage space
on Third Street and Battalion.

537
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:17,232
You know, sometimes people
leave things behind. Nice things.

538
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,360
A new mattress, coffee table...

539
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,363
framed pictures of strangers.

540
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,038
I'm gonna get going.

541
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,001
Thanks for your help.

542
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,462
Yeah. Get a new transmission.

543
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,671
Soon.

544
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,007
Seriously.

545
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,928
Thanks for the ride.

546
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,937
Thanks. Bye.

547
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,870
That's it! Yeah, come on!

548
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
Yeah!

549
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,183
That's not what I said.

550
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,519
But you are trying to fuck her,
aren't you?

551
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,772
I'm not trying anything, sir.
I fixed her car.

552
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:43,151
You saw the shirt.
She's got someone.

553
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,361
Who?

554
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,113
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

555
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,203
Jesus, why is it always the quiet ones?

556
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,249
Where are your morals, hero?

557
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:02,504
It's just too easy. You bring her her husband's
death and then you try to fuck her.

558
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,927
And by the way, if she's into you,
she's into some really weird twists.

559
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,722
She's a real head case.
You've been warned.

560
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,433
Thank you, sir.
I will make a note of that.

561
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:26,695
I bet her husband couldn't wait to get
away from her and back in theater.

562
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,197
For Central, a stalled
car blocking the middle lane.

563
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,157
Traffic slowing down from...

564
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,289
We're here to speak with Mrs. Galindo.

565
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,335
What, this some kind ofjoke?

566
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,423
- No, sir.
- There's no Mrs. Galindo here.

567
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,260
- Marla Galindo? Are you saying she moved or...
- Hold it. Marla!

568
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,180
Marla!

569
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,606
- Marla!
- What?

570
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,691
- I'm so tired of this shit from you.
- What? What did I do?

571
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,819
There are a couple of soldiers downstairs.
They're asking for a Mrs. Galindo.

572
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,405
Dad, we were gonna, but l...

573
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,616
Tell me what? What are you talking about?

574
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,826
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's going on?

575
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,411
We were gonna tell you, but l...

576
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,913
I knew how you felt and there
was just so little time before...

577
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,999
- What, you married that little greaseball?
- Please, don't call him that!

578
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,001
- You always do that!
- Mrs. Galindo...

579
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,003
Hold it! I'm dealing with
some family stuff here!

580
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,213
- Could you step outside?
- Just let them say what they need to say!

581
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,633
- I have bad news for you, Mrs. Galindo.
- Just leave us for a second?

582
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:33,928
Your husband, Corporal Mario Galindo,
was killed last night in Iraq...

583
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,307
by an improvised explosive device.

584
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,728
The Secretary of the Army has asked me
to express his deepest sympathy to you.

585
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,484
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in the next few hours.

586
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,248
- We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- All right, all right.

587
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,175
Daddy.

588
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,637
- I'm so sorry.
- I know. I know.

589
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,557
I was gonna tell you. I'm... I'm...

590
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,104
Here's a good one! Here's a good one!

591
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:28,024
So this tribal chief, he's this
old-looking guy, I figured he's around 50.

592
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,068
Maybe older. Maybe 60.

593
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,987
His face is all sagging and fucking gray.

594
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,739
He's got a bunch of teeth missing.

595
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,449
The guy's got fucking scurvy.

596
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,743
All kinds of, you know, desert shit.

597
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,121
We called him Haji-Wan Kenobi.

598
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,124
So he tells me he's not used to making
deals like this with a kid.

599
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,126
So I tell him, "Hey, man, I'm 28."

600
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,128
Twenty-nine next month.

601
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,131
Yeah, I'm no kid, gramps.
But then, so, the chief says...

602
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,259
"Twenty-eight?
You can't be 28. You're a beautiful man.

603
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,511
You must be 20, 21."

604
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:01,349
I'm thinking, what is he talking about?
What is this? What is this, he likes me?

605
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,978
He wants to get in my pants? But the guy,
he's getting all depressed.

606
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,189
He starts saying, "This country's shit.
This country's cursed."

607
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,483
I try to tell him,
"Hey, man, it ain't that bad...

608
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,069
since we came in
and liberated your sandy asses."

609
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,363
And then he goes...
And then he goes, "Not that bad?

610
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,741
Look at me. I'm 27!"

611
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,454
It's all the goat fucking, man!

612
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,166
The poor asshole. He got one here,
a couple here, one went through his chest.

613
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,501
You could almost hear the lungs
deflate, like, swoosh.

614
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,670
One of his own men did it.

615
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,757
Anyway, he was a funny guy.

616
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,510
Haji-Wan Kenobi.

617
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,179
I liked him.

618
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,186
What's going on?
What is this? A funeral all ofa sudden?

619
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,527
I'll be right back.

620
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,384
You okay?

621
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,471
Yeah, sure.

622
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,140
Night. Good night, guys. See you Monday.

623
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,975
See you Monday.

624
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,402
It's like coming back from another planet.

625
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,241
What are you talking about, man?

626
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:45,829
I'm fine.

627
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,833
I'm home, baby.

628
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,589
I'm fucking home, sweet home.

629
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,680
Every American generation
has to have a war, you know.

630
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:08,685
We just need it. Because we gotta use up
our weapons, so we can make more. Easy.

631
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,480
And we gotta take warriors through wars
so they can command the next batch.

632
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:14,190
Nothing wrong with that.

633
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,861
Hey, Sergeant.
Ladies, this is the guy I told you about.

634
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,155
Will, this is Claire and Laura.

635
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,157
- It's Lara.
- Hey, baby.

636
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,368
- Lara. I'm sorry.
- No.

637
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,537
- Nice to meet you, Will.
- I'm not sure I can.

638
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,706
Yeah, likewise, Lara.

639
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,292
- Are you coming in?
- Yeah, in a minute.

640
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,502
- I'm buying.
- I'll be in.

641
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,754
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Ladies.

642
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,299
Everybody's all fucking concerned.

643
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,305
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

644
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,476
Ready, aim, fire!

645
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,396
Ready, aim...

646
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,815
fire! Ready.

647
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,484
Present arms.

648
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,167
Excuse me.

649
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,166
Are you Angel Vasquez?

650
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,795
Do you speak English?

651
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,214
No.

652
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:48,261
Mr. Vasquez, the Secretary of the Army
has asked me to extend his deepest regret...

653
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,265
that your daughter, Patricia...

654
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,351
was killed in a helicopter crash...

655
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:59,272
at 7:00 a.m. Our time
in the Anbar province of Iraq.

656
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:03,317
You will be further advised
as more information becomes available.

657
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:11,576
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

658
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,121
and your family in your tragic loss.

659
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,218
He's asking ifwe're sure about it.

660
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,182
Positive identification
has been made, sir.

661
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,494
He's saying, "It can't be."

662
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,831
I'm very sorry, sir.

663
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,370
Hey, it's Kelly.

664
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,666
I'm sorry I sent that invitation.

665
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,794
That was really... That was really dumb.

666
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,172
You know, I wanted us to be able...

667
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:50,967
I don't know. I hope you're not mad, okay?

668
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,054
You didn't RSVP, so...

669
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:01,519
I guess, you know,
I was scared to tell you and...

670
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,688
I don't know, there's, like,
all this stress.

671
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:07,441
You know, I don't even want
this stupid party anyways, and his parents...

672
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,406
Sorry, it's, like,
not even your problem.

673
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,576
I'm crazy, I know.

674
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,246
Alan and I got in a big fight
about it and...

675
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,333
Don't come, okay?

676
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:29,505
Just forget the invitation
and forget me. Just...

677
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,215
I'm sorry.

678
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,968
Matt?

679
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,973
Hey, pal.

680
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,144
I bet the other kid
got it pretty good, huh?

681
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,106
I brought you this.

682
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,193
It was my unit's flag.

683
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,904
I already have two.

684
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,324
Matt, say thanks.

685
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,867
Thanks.

686
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,001
Thanks a lot.

687
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:53,839
You know, flags and casseroles,
I can't seem to get enough of them.

688
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,388
If I can... do anything...

689
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,683
I know where to find you.

690
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,479
Anyway, we're leaving town.

691
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,026
Where you going?

692
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,320
I haven't decided. You know, it's funny.

693
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,447
We always had to move
wherever the army sent us...

694
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,325
and now I don't know where to go.

695
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:27,164
If you need help with any, you know,
packing boxes or putting things in boxes...

696
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:31,585
You know, I can pack up
this house in a day and unpack it in two.

697
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,879
Plenty of practice.

698
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,972
- Thanks for the flag.
- Sure.

699
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,934
We were thinking about
getting some pizza.

700
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,531
- Can I watch TV?
- After you finish your broccoli.

701
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,745
Mom, there's no broccoli.

702
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,963
Oh, I must've left it on the microwave.

703
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,382
I should probably go...

704
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,510
but thank you... for the pizza.

705
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,347
And it was nice
hangin' with you, Matt.

706
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,892
How come he doesn't
have to eat his broccoli?

707
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,898
I could eat broccoli.

708
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,778
I'm not eating mine.

709
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,031
Then I'll have yours.

710
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,827
Stain Spray-Away, the only
instant stain remover...

711
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:50,122
that can spray away stains
anywhere stains can happen.

712
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,209
Worry-free Oxy-clean
uses the power of oxygen.

713
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,836
It gently lifts stains out
without rubbing and scrubbing.

714
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,506
You can't avoid stains
like coffee and ketchup...

715
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,177
It's like you never got them
in the first place.

716
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,082
Because Friday's my last day...

717
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,877
I thought that you could
take some of this stuff, you know?

718
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,338
It's just left here,
and it seems such a waste.

719
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,074
Anybody looking at us right now...

720
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,202
would say that you're a lowlife
trying to take advantage of my grief...

721
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,457
and that I'm a slut
and that I'm not really grieving.

722
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,052
You ever lose anybody?

723
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,390
Yeah.

724
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,228
Friends, over there.

725
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,274
My father during peacetime.

726
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,443
A drunk driver.

727
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,154
Did they catch him?

728
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:49,033
No, my father was the drunk driver.

729
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,955
My mom woke me up
in the middle of the night...

730
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,085
and she said his brakes failed.

731
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,841
Never saw her cry.

732
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:10,095
But it made me
want to be a mechanic by age 10.

733
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,440
So your mom notified you.

734
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,305
Do you want to dance?

735
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,517
There's no music.

736
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,975
I'm gonna go get a shower.

737
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,688
But why?

738
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,025
'Cause I smell.

739
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,375
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
Do you want one?

740
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,472
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

741
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,949
I can't. I'm sorry.

742
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,118
It's okay.

743
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:31,130
When Phil reenlisted for a third tour...

744
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,676
it was like he needed to go.

745
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,013
Staying home was no longer an option.

746
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,310
I was relieved to see him go.

747
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,400
I missed him, but I didn't...

748
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,487
I didn't miss the guy thatjust left...

749
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,659
because I missed the man
he was a long time ago.

750
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:10,002
One morning, I opened the closet...

751
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,880
and a shirt fell out...

752
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,759
and I smelled it.

753
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,513
And it smelled awful.

754
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,352
It smelled horrible.

755
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:35,569
Not of, like, another woman
or booze or cigarettes or...

756
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,950
It smelled of rage...

757
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:44,244
and fear.

758
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:55,214
It smelled of the man
that he had become over there, you know?

759
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:02,346
And he didn't treat me or his little boy
very good when he was at home.

760
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:07,059
So in a way, in my mind,
it was like he was dead already.

761
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:12,397
Anyway, I washed the shirt...

762
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,902
and then you came.

763
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,101
I loved him once.

764
01:09:55,942 --> 01:10:00,153
And it's weird because now he's dead.

765
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,784
I just... I love him again.

766
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,124
But more for my little boy.

767
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,755
I'm sorry. I should never
have brought you here.

768
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,175
God, I'm sorry.

769
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,513
Don't be.

770
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,315
And it's not that I don't want to. I just...

771
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:40,819
I know. Me too.

772
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,836
I'm gonna go and get Matt
and pick him up early.

773
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,341
He loves that,
and the other kids go green with envy.

774
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:14,603
Okay.

775
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,747
Is it okay if I...

776
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:38,710
stay here for a few minutes?

777
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,050
Sure.

778
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:49,596
Just slam the door real hard.
The lock's kinda funky.

779
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:50,764
Okay.

780
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,558
Thanks.

781
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:45,569
A soldier dies in a black-op mission
someplace we never admitted being...

782
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,696
the army calls his death an accident.

783
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,532
Why? To protect the next one.

784
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:55,787
Another soldier dies slipping into
a ditch, we call it a combat death...

785
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,582
just to give it a meaning.

786
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,542
What's your point?

787
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,793
My point?

788
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,547
My point is that sometimes the army...

789
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:09,176
has to be concerned
with something bigger than the truth.

790
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,803
And it's not that
they don't care about you.

791
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:15,724
On the contrary, there is not a family
on God's green Earth...

792
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,435
that takes better care ofyou
than the US Army.

793
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,811
Really?

794
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,980
Really.

795
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,401
Civilian life's for people
who ain't seen shit.

796
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,278
It's too late for you.

797
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:31,948
You've already seen the shit.
You can't unsee it anymore.

798
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:37,204
You can't be an insurance salesman now,
brother. It's too fucking late.

799
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,290
How's that beautiful garden?

800
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:43,126
Oh, it's doing well.
It's his pride and joy.

801
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:45,420
Oh, yes. He must have you working on it.

802
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,464
The size of those strawberries.

803
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,300
I'll see you, Ralph.
Good-bye, Mrs. Flanigan.

804
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,885
Good-bye, now.

805
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,597
Ralph Flanigan?

806
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,433
Do I know you?

807
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:01,686
You're Walton Flanigan's father?

808
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,021
Yes?

809
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:15,909
Oh, God!

810
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,621
Oh, my God, what's wrong? Ralph?

811
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,914
Ralph?

812
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,334
- Ralph?
- Oh, God.

813
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,463
- Ma'am...
- No.

814
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,549
- No.
- Talk to me, sweetheart.

815
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,805
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express...

816
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:41,059
his deep regret that your son,
Walton Flanigan...

817
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:43,770
died yesterday in Iraq.

818
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,440
He... No.

819
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:52,529
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy...

820
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:56,741
to you and your family
in your tragic loss.

821
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,335
No.

822
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:15,969
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you within a few hours.

823
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:20,348
Do you need anything? Do you need a ride?
Do you want us to call someone?

824
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:24,436
- No.
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

825
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,106
I'm so sorry, sir.

826
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,029
Where'd they go?

827
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,364
They took off.

828
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,459
- What?
- What'd I tell you from day one?

829
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,338
You do not touch the NOK.
You gotta wake the fuck up.

830
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:52,881
You're not in high school.

831
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,884
You're not in a fucking rock band.
You're in the army.

832
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,262
Yeah, I know. I know I'm in the army.
I gave blood to the army.

833
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,850
I got blown up in a firefight
that lasted longer than your entire war.

834
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:08,063
I didn't sunbathe in Kuwait
with the rest of the POG's. I fought!

835
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,992
That was not your job
and you did not follow procedure.

836
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:26,498
Fuck procedure, Tony.
They're human beings.

837
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,876
They'rejust people.

838
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,837
They're not like you.

839
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:34,774
Get in.

840
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,615
It's gonna take you a week
at this rate. Get in.

841
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,583
Hey, guess what? I already let it go.

842
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,759
Hey, stubborn, get in the fucking car!

843
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,522
Thanks.

844
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,702
Dorsett thinks you need some time away.
Clear your head.

845
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:29,871
He told me to look after you.

846
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:30,955
Yeah...

847
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,540
I don't need anything.

848
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,584
You walked home. You need it.

849
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,545
We're off till Tuesday.
I got everything planned out.

850
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:42,217
Just bring your bathing suit and your ACU's
and the girls are totally into it.

851
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,719
What girls? Into what?

852
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:47,680
Come on.
They won't go if it's just me.

853
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:52,102
Milk in the bottle
Milk in the bottle

854
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:55,230
Well, that sounds like...
That sounds really good.

855
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,815
What are you wearing?

856
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:02,237
Hey, come on. You're my buddy, right?

857
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,531
I haven't had any in decades.

858
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,033
Okay, so don't make me beg, just...

859
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:10,328
I need to get laid and you do too, right?

860
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,539
Can we take my car?

861
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:17,335
I'll let you choose the girl.
How's that?

862
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,260
You sure your step dad
ain't gonna show up?

863
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:28,596
No, he's fishing in Alaska
till the end of the season.

864
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,266
Fishing.

865
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,934
In Alaska.

866
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,369
Nice.

867
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,333
That's not distracting.

868
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,419
How embarrassing.

869
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,218
God.

870
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:09,971
Yes!

871
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,890
- Want a piece of gum?
- Yeah.

872
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,614
Choke me. Choke me. Come on. Come on.

873
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,826
I know. I'm sorry.

874
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,412
- Come on.
- She doesn't ever close the door.

875
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:35,538
Yeah.

876
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,630
Keep going.

877
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,466
Come on.

878
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,066
Gross.

879
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:07,946
Hey.

880
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,449
Is there any more beer left in the car?

881
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,789
What the hell you doing?

882
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:22,710
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm just... taking the edge off.

883
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,297
Extraordinary times, right?

884
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:33,638
Hey, you can give me a break, can't you?
You're my buddy, aren't you?

885
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:39,143
Hey. Come on.
We've been to hell and back together.

886
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,897
Three years just like that.

887
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:46,526
You know what? He knows what he's doing.
It's good. Let's just go to sleep.

888
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,069
Yeah, lets go to bed.

889
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:51,781
- Go to bed.
- Fucking asshole.

890
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,835
I'm more fun when I drink.

891
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,171
Sergeant.

892
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,550
You missed out. That's the whole problem.

893
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:14,929
That is the whole problem
this time around in Iraq.

894
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:20,101
Vietnam, those guys
got laid six ways from Sunday.

895
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:24,606
Bosnia... best brothels in the world.

896
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:30,403
Desert Storm... we had R and R ships
with Filipino hookers...

897
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,614
on call.

898
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,286
Yeah, but this war? I don't know.

899
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:44,584
All the religious bullshit, the Crusades
and jihad and nobody getting laid.

900
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:51,007
I mean, that right there is halfthe reason
why everybody's so angry, yeah?

901
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,552
Hey, Charlie, don't surf!

902
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,724
- Let's get back.
- Yeah.

903
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,145
I'm thinking maybe
I ought to have a kid.

904
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,814
I shouldn't have let you drink.

905
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,859
No, see, that is your other problem
right there, hero.

906
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:14,072
Everything's your fault.
Everything is your responsibility.

907
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,326
Somebody's gonna fall to pieces?
Well, here's Will with a glue stick.

908
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,829
Some soldier gets drunk...
Hey, let me tell you something.

909
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:26,000
I had a beer last month, okay?

910
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:28,961
A few weeks ago, I had a few more.

911
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,963
- The other day...
- You serious?

912
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,509
Today is not the day
that I got off the wagon.

913
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:38,763
This is the day that I'm gonna not
bother pretending anymore.

914
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:50,066
Stay the fuck away from us, you assholes!

915
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,152
Motherfuckers! Goddamn it!

916
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,237
It's okay.

917
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:55,947
Fuck you!

918
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,615
Let's head back.

919
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,493
Stone, let's head back.

920
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,330
Where'd you learn about knots?

921
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:06,207
Oh, Boy Scouts.

922
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:11,129
They sure love a good knot. Easy to tie,
easy to untie, hard to pull loose.

923
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,131
Dude, what's your fucking problem, anyway?

924
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,924
You own this lake?

925
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,599
- Lock and load, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sir.

926
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,435
Hey, ladies.

927
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,438
- What sorority you girls belong to?
- What the fuck?

928
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:38,114
Boy, those girls sure overreacted.
Just a little fight is all.

929
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,828
I thought they was cool.

930
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,622
Sorry, buddy.

931
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:54,046
Hey, how far did you get
with that girl, Laura?

932
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,257
- Lara.
- Lara.

933
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:59,177
What a name, Lara.

934
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:14,233
Give me a home
where the buffalo roam

935
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:18,488
Where the deer
and the antelope play

936
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:27,580
Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word

937
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:33,586
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

938
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:38,925
Home, home on the range

939
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:43,763
Where the deer
and the antelope play

940
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:51,395
Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word

941
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,776
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

942
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,528
Whoo!

943
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:03,241
Home, home on the range

944
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,708
Bill! Hi. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

945
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:33,521
You should have RSVP'd, okay?
Alan is gonna freak.

946
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,525
Hey. I didn't know you...

947
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,485
Alan, good to see you. Long time.

948
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,738
Yeah. Jesus, you look terrible.

949
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:45,157
I feel terrible.

950
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:52,290
Tony, this is Alan.
Alan, Tony, groom-to-be.

951
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,459
Hey, Tony.
What happened to you guys?

952
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:59,589
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
We do all our own stunts, you know.

953
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:03,801
Kelly, Tony. Tony, Kelly. Bride.

954
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:06,095
Enchanté. Hubba-hubba.

955
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,895
Well... let's get these guys
some drinks.

956
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,607
- I wasjust about to sober up. Come on.
- Sounds good.

957
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:21,819
Let's go, Alan.
Come on. All right?

958
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,867
- You look beautiful.
- Don't.

959
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:30,578
You do.

960
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,332
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

961
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,884
So, on behalf of everyone in the room...

962
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,345
and those who couldn't
make it here tonight...

963
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:53,684
Kelly and Alan...

964
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,939
here's to a lifetime together, huh?

965
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,941
Hear! Hear!

966
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,692
Whoo! Kelly and Alan.

967
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:07,406
Hey, there's a lot better things
we could be doing right now than talking.

968
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,533
I would like to say something.

969
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:16,624
Jesus Christ. Before you do...

970
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:21,420
I would like everyone to toast our troops.

971
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:23,631
Hear! Hear!

972
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:28,344
Love the war or hate it,
we support you guys all the way.

973
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:31,013
Hear! Hear!

974
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:36,727
- They support us.
- All the way.

975
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,563
Alan...

976
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,900
Kelly...

977
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,695
family and friends...

978
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,664
the Secretary of the Army...

979
01:28:56,748 --> 01:29:01,585
is pleased to congratulate you
on your engagement.

980
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,507
We love it here
We love it here

981
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:09,969
You bet your ass
We love it here

982
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,430
- Hoo-ahh!
- Hoo-ahh!

983
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:19,729
Back away.

984
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,910
Go, Sergeant!

985
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,789
Fuck me.

986
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,921
You just caught a.556 in your upper lip!

987
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,131
Bang!

988
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,215
Boom.

989
01:29:56,516 --> 01:30:00,186
This is America!

990
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:20,516
Hey.

991
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:28,941
It's time to wake up.

992
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:37,241
Jesus, am I dead?

993
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:40,077
No.

994
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:45,749
Oh, dear God, help me.

995
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,261
I gotta call my sponsor.

996
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,276
We should both
get out ofthis together.

997
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,154
You could retire.

998
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,742
We'd go fishing in Alaska.

999
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,461
Nah, this Dorsett will never let me go.

1000
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,129
He doesn't own you.

1001
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,466
He saved my life.

1002
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:40,346
Got me sober... until yesterday.

1003
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,101
The army owns me and that's fine with me.

1004
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:53,317
That's not fine with me.
Come on.

1005
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,669
All I ever wanted...

1006
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,797
was to get shot at.

1007
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:23,347
That too much to ask for
on the battlefield? A battle?

1008
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,687
I thought you said you had your baptism.

1009
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,900
Yeah, well, I lied.

1010
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,238
Wasn't much ofa war.

1011
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,094
Heads up.

1012
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:14,315
Dale Martin's my name.
Do you remember me?

1013
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:17,026
Yes, sir.

1014
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,419
You know what's the last thing
my son said to me?

1015
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:43,010
He said,
"I'll see you next week." On the phone.

1016
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,095
That's what he said, from over there.

1017
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,935
And all I said was, "Yeah."

1018
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:57,649
I'm...

1019
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,487
I'm not a good talker.

1020
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,033
But...

1021
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,456
Will you please forgive me?

1022
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:20,214
Sir, there's nothing to forgive.

1023
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:45,447
Mama said there'd be days like these.

1024
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:03,799
Our LT was taking fire
two blocks down...

1025
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:08,595
and so I made a decision
to move up this alleyway...

1026
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,141
so we could get into this haji market
that I knew had roofaccess.

1027
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,855
Sniper fire came down on us
from everywhere.

1028
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,232
It was just pop, pop, pop, pop.

1029
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:25,863
And we're all scrambling
around trying to get some cover...

1030
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,948
when an IED goes off.

1031
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,700
You know, blows us back.

1032
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,203
And we're all...

1033
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:42,004
But I can see Timmerman
is still standing, and he has...

1034
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:47,092
he has this flap hanging off
the side of his head...

1035
01:36:47,177 --> 01:36:49,803
and when he turns around,
I can see it's the...

1036
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:52,097
I can see it's the side of his face.

1037
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:56,643
Two of my guys behind us are hit
and I'm yelling at them...

1038
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,980
you know, yelling,
"Get out of the road"...

1039
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,900
but they're screaming so loud
they can't hear me.

1040
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:07,696
So I take off. I pick one of 'em up.

1041
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:10,866
He was...

1042
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:16,288
I don't know,
third month, fourth month, 18, 19.

1043
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:18,332
Pull the other one with my free hand...

1044
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,043
take us and drop them behind
these truck tires.

1045
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:25,923
And we're all catching our breath,
trying to radio the bird...

1046
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,510
when I see Derek...

1047
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,430
just bleeding out in the middle
of the street.

1048
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,516
Now, sniper fire had slowed...

1049
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,394
and he was on his back.

1050
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,941
He had his hands up like this.

1051
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:47,861
Looked like he was... like he was praying.

1052
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:52,908
Nothing but noise from the radio,
so I make a mad dash to him.

1053
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,869
It's pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

1054
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:59,748
Grab his wrist, drag him across the street
behind this burned-out old car.

1055
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:04,127
And he looking down at his hands.

1056
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:05,921
He keeps looking down at his damn hands.

1057
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:09,132
He keeps opening them and closing them...

1058
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:12,594
and he's opening,
he keeps saying over and over...

1059
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:16,056
"I can't feel my hands.
I can't feel my hands."

1060
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,934
And I'm looking down at his hands.
His hands are fine.

1061
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:21,186
There's not a spot on them...

1062
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:24,106
when his left leg is, you know,
halfway down the block.

1063
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:28,777
So I start pushing him
underneath the car...

1064
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:33,073
and I'm saying, "Derek, your hands
are fine. Your hands are fine.

1065
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,909
Just sit tight."

1066
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:40,539
And he looked at me like I was...

1067
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,958
He looked at me like I was lying to him.

1068
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,629
And that's when the IED
went off under him.

1069
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,301
Jesus.

1070
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:59,474
I actually got pieces of him
blasted right into me.

1071
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,059
It was like...

1072
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:04,688
flesh shrapnel.

1073
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,108
When I came to,
I had already been to the FOB.

1074
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,945
I was on my way to Ramstein. In the hospital,
I'm laid out and some guy comes in.

1075
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:16,783
I can't see very well,
and he drops this little...

1076
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,494
drops a little ribbon
on my bare chest and I'm...

1077
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:25,542
I'm all hooked up to wires and machines
and heart rate monitors...

1078
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,129
IV's and shit.

1079
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:31,632
Shit I, you know, shit I don't need.

1080
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:33,592
And he...

1081
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:37,846
he says, "Son...

1082
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,392
you're a hero."

1083
01:39:43,519 --> 01:39:45,729
Damn right, you are.

1084
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:48,398
No.

1085
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,071
No, l... No.

1086
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:57,574
I put him there.

1087
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,160
I did that.

1088
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,539
That was me.
I didn't mean to. I didn't plan that.

1089
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,667
There's no planning. You can't plan.

1090
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,587
You only have the moment,
but that's what I did.

1091
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:11,838
L...

1092
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:16,093
I loaded him into the bomb.

1093
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:28,772
That's not a hero in my book.

1094
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:36,488
A couple weeks later,
I'm on crutches.

1095
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:43,203
Major surgery. Fox eye shield patch.

1096
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:49,960
And everything looks gray...
the nurses, the flowers, blood.

1097
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:53,422
I'm wandering the halls in the hospital.

1098
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:58,969
My ears are ringing.

1099
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:03,056
I take the elevator up to the roof
and climb the stairs.

1100
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:05,726
And we're not supposed to be up there...

1101
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:10,647
but that's where the doctors
take their smoke breaks.

1102
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,650
So the door was open.

1103
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:16,486
And the whole...

1104
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:23,535
the whole living thing just didn't,
you know, make sense anymore.

1105
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:24,953
It was...

1106
01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:29,916
I was out there for a while...

1107
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:34,838
standing on the edge...

1108
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:40,969
and it was cold and it was dark...

1109
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,348
and I felt calm.

1110
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:49,311
Why didn't you jump?

1111
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:04,534
The sun came up.

1112
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:08,538
The sun came up?

1113
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,749
Yes.

1114
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,795
The sun came up and...

1115
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:18,548
and I didn't feel like dying anymore.

1116
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:25,972
Want another one?

1117
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:29,976
No, I just...

1118
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,104
Pepsi.

1119
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:36,274
This fake beer tastes like laundry.

1120
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:11,161
Pass me the ball. Pass me the ball.

1121
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:16,833
Where you heading?

1122
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:19,377
Louisiana.

1123
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:24,382
Taking the piano.

1124
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,761
What?

1125
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,346
Why?

1126
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,890
- Do you play?
- No.

1127
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:35,685
A little bit.

1128
01:44:37,021 --> 01:44:40,857
My mom forced me when I was a kid.

1129
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,026
I hated it.

1130
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:46,821
Hey, you don't have to...

1131
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:52,369
Thanks a lot.

1132
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:14,933
- Yes!
- Good-bye, Will.

1133
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:19,729
Good luck.

1134
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:29,072
Look, I've never been very good at timing.

1135
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:33,243
I wouldn't say that.

1136
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:40,291
Maybe... you'd let me know where you are,
you know, your address?

1137
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:43,545
I don't mind driving.

1138
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,971
I think I could handle that.

1139
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:55,932
Okay?

1140
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,435
Okay.

1141
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:03,606
E- mail?

1142
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,944
Yeah. I just have to get a computer first.

1143
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,613
I could check at Tony's, though.

1144
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,450
You're staying on?

1145
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:15,452
Thinking about it.

1146
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:29,382
Why don't you come inside
and give me your address...

1147
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:31,593
and I'll write you a letter.

1148
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:34,846
I'd like that.

1149
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:50,153
Yeah.
