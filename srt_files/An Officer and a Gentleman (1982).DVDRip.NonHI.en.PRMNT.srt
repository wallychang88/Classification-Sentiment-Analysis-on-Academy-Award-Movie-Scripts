<i>Passengers arriving

00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,342
<i>flight 118,</i>

3
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,141
<i>welcome to Manila
International Airport.</i>

4
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,408
<i>Those passengers flying on...</i>

5
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,747
Hey.

6
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,095
Hey, kid!

7
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,655
Are you Zack?

8
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,098
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,137
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,105
Come on. Let's get
your bags, okay?

11
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,539
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,612
<i>Take your jacket off, kid.</i>

13
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,673
<i>It's hot as hell here.</i>

14
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>This is the P. I. It's what
we call the Philippine Islands.</i>

15
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,623
I'm sorry about what
happened to your mom.

16
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,888
It must have been
pretty rough, huh?

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,895
I would have called
you a lot sooner,

18
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,399
but I was out at sea.

19
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,403
But I've been calling
you for four months.

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,962
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

21
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,305
I was out at sea
for four months.

22
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,158
All right, kid.

23
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,819
These are your mama-sans,

24
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,590
Tiki and Maria.

25
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,756
Hello, Byron.

26
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,602
I want you to meet somebody.

27
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,606
This is my son,
Zack. Tiki, say hello.

28
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,608
Zack, Tiki and Maria.

29
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,608
Hi, Zack.

30
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,905
Hi.

31
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>I'm out at sea three
weeks out of every month.</i>

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,616
When I'm back in port,

33
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,126
I don't have time for this daddy
stuff, because that's not who I am.

34
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,854
That's okay, sir.

35
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,555
Wait a second, kid,
you don't understand.

36
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,222
I'm too old for this.

37
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,597
I don't care what the Navy says,
this is no place to bring up a kid.

38
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,067
Like I told you on
the telephone...

39
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,570
you're better off in that
state school back in Virginia.

40
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,073
I'm never going back!
They treat me like shit.

41
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,609
Maybe that's not for you to say!

42
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,577
Goddamn it! Don't
look at me that way!

43
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,615
What happened to your mother
had nothing to do with me.

44
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,617
It did! You said
you'd come back!

45
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,586
Is that what she said? That's
a female lie. That's bullshit!

46
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,623
That's a lie!

47
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,089
I found your letters,

48
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,592
and I read them
after she did it!

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,638
You said you were going to come
back for us. You said you loved her,

50
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,631
<i>and she believed you!</i>

51
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,222
<i>You're a liar!</i>

52
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,765
Grow up, boy. I'll wait
for you. Cherry boy.

53
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,630
<i>Want to go to school?
I'll teach you nice.</i>

54
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,603
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

55
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,265
Chicken feet, monkey
meat. Come on, you buy.

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,777
You buy. Monkey
meat. You buy. You buy.

57
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,870
<i>Hey, sailor. What
ship are you from?</i>

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,586
Hey! What are you doing?

59
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,250
Big spender, give us money.

60
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,588
I don't have any.

61
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,787
Bullshit!

62
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:28,885
No!

63
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,424
Leave me alone!

64
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,600
Leave me alone.

65
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>Holy shit.</i>

66
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,526
Watch it. I got to heave.

67
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,598
Jesus Christ.

68
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,369
Give me a towel.

69
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,883
Pretty fuckin' wild.

70
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,883
Holy shit.

71
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,129
Not as wild as that night

72
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,132
we banged those three
stewardesses in Manila.

73
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,600
Bet you didn't
get it on like that

74
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,729
in that jerkwater college
you graduated from.

75
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,940
How long are you going
to hang around Seattle?

76
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,314
Get ready, man. This one
is going to blow you away.

77
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,950
Nothing you do is ever
going to surprise me.

78
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,255
<i>Tell me.</i>

79
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,319
I joined the Navy.

80
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,262
You joined the Navy.

81
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,323
That's right. I joined the Navy.

82
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm on my way to
Port Rainier now,

83
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,500
this officer's training
school over there.

84
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,769
What for?

85
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,279
Jets. I want to fly jets.

86
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,111
It's only a couple
of hours from here.

87
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,812
Maybe you'll want to
come visit me sometime.

88
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,856
Who put that idea in your head?

89
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,654
Nobody. It just come to me.

90
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,126
What's so funny?

91
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,792
You, man.

92
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,230
It's like saying you're
running for fuckin' president.

93
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,861
Christ, look at yourself.

94
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,367
Officers don't have tattoos.

95
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,903
Look, I'll see you,
man, all right?

96
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Hey.

97
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,012
Zack, come on.
Don't be pissed off.

98
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,883
I'm not pissed off.

99
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,216
You are pissed off.

100
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,257
Come on, I'm on your side.

101
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,225
Don't do something
you'll regret.

102
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:17,731
You got to give up six
fucking years to the Navy

103
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,732
if you want to fly.

104
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,358
Six fucking years

105
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,734
with the most uptight
assholes God put on this Earth.

106
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,241
Officers, man, they're
not like you and me.

107
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,833
They're a different breed.

108
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,243
You're afraid you might have
to salute me someday, Chief.

109
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,249
Bullshit! Why the
fuck would I be afraid?

110
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,751
I don't know. It kind
of sounds that way.

111
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,913
You want some fatherly
bullshit, a pat on the back.

112
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,422
From you? No.

113
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,514
No.

114
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,294
Thanks for my
graduation present.

115
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,296
I'll see you around.

116
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,298
Don't go away mad.

117
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,298
Hey, baby.

118
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,767
Zack, come on.

119
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,859
Zack!

120
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,093
Fall in!

121
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,000
I said fall in, you slimy worms!

122
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,004
Put your toes
on that chalk line!

123
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:17,032
I said put your toes on the
chalk line, you slimy worms!

124
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,874
A-ten-hut!

125
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,777
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

126
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,291
Where you been all
your lives... At an orgy?

127
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,292
Listening to Mick Jagger music

128
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,296
and bad-mouthing
your country, I'll bet.

129
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,195
You better stop
eyeballing me, boy.

130
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,961
You're not worthy enough

131
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,299
to look your
superiors in the eye.

132
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,305
Use your peripheral
vision. Understand?

133
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,704
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,141
Every time I say "Understand,"

135
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,145
everyone says, "Yes,
sir!" Understand?

136
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,145
Yes, sir!

137
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,112
Understand?

138
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,443
Yes, sir!

139
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:59,247
I know why most of you are here.

140
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,753
I'm not stupid.

141
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,279
Before you get to
sell what we teach you

142
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,258
over at United Airlines,

143
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:10,286
you'll give the Navy
six years of your life.

144
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,299
Lots of things can
happen in six years.

145
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,801
Another war could come up.

146
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,568
If you're too peaceful to
napalm an enemy village

147
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,973
where there might be
women and children,

148
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,273
I'm going to find that out.

149
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,278
Understand?

150
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,279
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,280
Understand?

152
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,748
Yes, sir!

153
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,318
Hi, son.

154
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,412
How you doing, Sarge?

155
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,824
What did you call me?

156
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,291
Beg your pardon?

157
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,329
What did you call me, boy?

158
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,296
- Sarge.
- Before that.

159
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,663
I didn't call you
anything before that.

160
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,996
You said, "How are <i>you?"</i>

161
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,832
A ewe is a female sheep.

162
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,463
You think that's what I am?

163
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,666
No.

164
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,834
No, sir!

165
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,841
No, sir.

166
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,002
Louder, sweet pea!

167
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,306
No, sir!

168
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,874
Hey. You want to
fuck me up the ass?

169
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,782
You a queer?

170
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,286
Hell no, sir!

171
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,787
Where are you from, boy?

172
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,983
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, sir.

173
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,286
Ah!

174
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,795
Only two things come
out of Oklahoma...

175
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,354
Steers and queers.

176
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,800
Which one are you, boy?

177
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:25,805
I don't see no horns.
You must be a queer.

178
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:26,872
No, sir.

179
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,306
Stop whispering, sweet pea.

180
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,070
You're giving me a hard-on.

181
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,634
No, sir!

182
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,323
You laughing at me, dickbrain?

183
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,982
No, sir!

184
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,321
Stop eyeballing me, boy,

185
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,827
or I'll rip your eyeballs out

186
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,160
and skullfuck you to death.

187
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,254
Yes, sir!

188
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,324
What's your name, boy?

189
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,835
Mayo. Zack Mayo, sir!

190
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,737
How did you slip
into this program?

191
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,106
I didn't know the
Navy was so hard up.

192
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,784
You got an injury there, Mayo?

193
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,376
Not exactly, sir.

194
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,225
Hey, this is really
wonderful work.

195
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,286
Where did you get this?

196
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,594
Subic Base, Philippines, sir.

197
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,794
Ah. Thought I
recognized the work.

198
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,303
Be proud of them wings.

199
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,170
They're the only ones
you'll leave here with,

200
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,732
Mayo-nnaise!

201
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,490
What's your name, boy?

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,026
Emiliano Santos
Della Serra, sir.

203
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,028
Mmm-hmm. You don't say?

204
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,996
You a college boy?

205
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,930
Yes, sir! Math major, sir.

206
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,969
Graduated from Texas
Tech with honors, sir!

207
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,765
I see.

208
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,773
You see this cane, Della Serra?

209
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,776
See the notches near the handle?

210
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,439
There's a notch for
every college puke like you

211
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,348
that I got to D.O.R...
Drop on request...

212
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,783
From this program.

213
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,945
The first one I'm
carving out of this class

214
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,956
is you, Emiliano.

215
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,482
I expect to lose half of
you before I'm finished.

216
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,962
I will use every means
necessary, fair and unfair,

217
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,464
to trip you up,

218
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,966
to expose your weaknesses

219
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,970
as an aviator and as a
human being. Understand?

220
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,471
Yes, sir!

221
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,974
The prize at the other end

222
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,977
is a flight education
worth $1 million!

223
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,140
But first, you got
to get past me!

224
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,117
Hey, Paula!

225
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,658
It's 5:00!

226
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,387
Where's the goddamn whistle?

227
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,863
Oh, shit!

228
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,594
Whoo!

229
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,271
Come on, Paula. Let's go!

230
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,530
Next!

231
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,541
Oh, shit.

232
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:26,452
This is my idea
of an ass bandit.

233
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,956
Wait till the girls see
you, scrotumhead.

234
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,014
Ha ha ha! Scrotumhead.

235
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,957
Think that's funny, Worley?

236
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,963
Not all the obstacles
are on this base.

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,967
Let me tell you
about the local girls.

238
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,970
Ever since there's
been a naval base here,

239
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,472
there's been the
Puget Sound debs.

240
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,477
Poor girls come across
the Sound every weekend

241
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,480
with just one thing in mind,

242
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:59,383
and that's to marry
themselves a naval aviator.

243
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,964
<i>♪ You want me to leave

244
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,431

00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,434
<i>"Don't worry about

00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,975

00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,273
<i>and say anything to trap you.</i>

Hurry up! On the double!

259
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,612
You lard asses, I'll fix you!

260
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,615
Get up in there!

261
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,617
On the double, Mayonnaise!

262
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,620
Little girl poopies to the left,

263
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,883
little boy poopies, right!

264
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,948
Come on, let's go!

265
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,890
What a motley bunch!

266
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,451
Get in there!

267
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,659
All right, quick! On the double!

268
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,533
How's it going?

269
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,980
They've got to be kidding.

270
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,313
How do they expect
me to get down there?

271
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,979
One of you guys
want to switch bunks?

272
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,488
Those are assigned bunks, man.

273
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,821
I don't think we can.

274
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,883
Hey, Daniels, you're in there.

275
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,497
Who the hell is that guy?

276
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,500
Your mom and dad
for the next 13 weeks.

277
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,536
All right, fall out!

278
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,468
Get outside! On the double!

279
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,766
Come on out here!

280
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,932
Quick! Out the door!

281
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,600
On the double!

282
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,310
Quick!

283
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,311
Quick!

284
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,438
Quick!

285
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,947
More! More! More!

286
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,449
Give me 50.

287
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,109
Give me 50.

288
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,380
Count them for me!

289
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,791
Think it's true
about those girls,

290
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,292
Puget debs?

291
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,554
Sure.

292
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,961
Should have warned
you female types

293
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,499
about the Puget dudes.

294
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,466
They say they're
wearing rubbers,

295
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,003
but there's really a hole

296
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,470
bitten in the bottom.

297
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,268
Very funny.

298
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,799
Seeger, Mayo, Worley! Got
enough energy to run them sewers,

299
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,847
give me 50! On the double!

300
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,404
Right now!

301
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,945
Poopie asses, get your
faces on down there!

302
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,684
You women better not
expect special privileges!

303
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,191
You think flying a plane

304
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,694
is just sitting on a
chair pushing buttons?

305
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,459
You need more upper-body
strength, See-gar!

306
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,194
Ugh!

307
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,329
Ugh!

308
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,339
All right, get up.

309
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,874
Get up!

310
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,301
Step out!

311
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,739
Back in line! You <i>watch!</i>

312
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,808
The pilots off the <i>Lexington</i>

313
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,285
ought to be at
the officers club.

314
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,255
You sure got the timetable down.

315
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,259
After three years,
you learn all the tricks.

316
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,625
You see that
bodacious set of tatas?

317
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,097
Hi. The social committee
wanted these records.

318
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,100
You're pissing me off, boys!

319
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,366
38...

320
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,439
39...

321
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,136
The Blue Angels are coming.

322
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,170
If you need an
introduction, let me know.

323
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,806
Far fucking out!

324
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,180
Shh!

325
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,948
I've always wanted
to meet a Blue Angel.

326
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,455
Look at those poor poopies.

327
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,890
See you during your liberty!

328
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,554
It grows an inch by then!

329
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,223
You ain't going to be
liberty for you boys.

330
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,788
You'll be home before then.

331
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,028
Start from one again!

332
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,160
1...

333
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,833
- 2...
- 3...

334
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:16,042
Flyin' low and feelin' mean.

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,374
Flyin' low and feelin' mean.

336
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,415
Spot a family by a stream.

337
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,542
Spot a family by a stream.

338
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,554
Pickle a pair and
hear 'em scream.

339
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,420
Pickle a pair and
hear 'em scream.

340
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,857
'Cause napalm sticks to kids.

341
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,760
'Cause napalm sticks to kids.

342
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,092
That's disgusting!

343
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,224
What are you doing here, Seeger?

344
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,268
Am I threatening you?

345
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,236
You'll get your ass shot down.

346
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,241
I wouldn't mind being the
first woman combat flier.

347
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,742
Go in my place.

348
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,743
Jets?

349
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,744
Uh-huh.

350
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,745
Mayo?

351
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,746
Jets.

352
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,783
Only two go to jets.

353
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,750
Who's going with me?

354
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,252
- Me!
- Me!

355
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,220
Talking in the ranks again.

356
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,723
You three just added 2 miles

357
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,227
to this little hike
for everybody.

358
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,025
Family of gooks
all sittin' in a ditch!

359
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,726
Family of gooks
all sittin' in a ditch!

360
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,929
Little baby suckin'
on his mama's tit!

361
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,563
Little baby suckin'
on his mama's tit!

362
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,132
Chemical firms
don't give a shit!

363
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,577
Chemical firms
don't give a shit!

364
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,082
That napalm sticks to kids!

365
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,618
That napalm sticks to kids!

366
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,587
Get up here! Up those stairs!

367
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,646
Let's go! Come on!

368
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,628
Go!

369
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,130
Move! Move! Move!

370
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,462
Go! Get up here!

371
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,502
Move it up here!

372
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,662
Come on, let's go!

373
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,502
Come on, let's go! Go!

374
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,804
Get up here! Move!

375
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,139
Get up here!

376
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,494
All right, everybody,
on your feet!

377
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,521
I don't want to see nothing
coming out of your mouths either!

378
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,534
Let's get in shape around here!

379
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,365
Stand straight up!

380
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,074
All right, get out of the way!

381
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,973
Lift your head and hold it high.

382
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,843
Lift your head and hold it high!

383
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,850
The best in the
regiment is runnin' on by.

384
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:42,287
The best in the
regiment is runnin' on by!

385
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,293
That could be you
after 13 weeks...

386
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,294
Those who might survive!

387
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,160
You don't deserve
to look at them!

388
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,723
Della Serra, turn your back!

389
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,736
You are the most pathetic class

390
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,136
I've ever been assigned to!

391
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,639
You big chump.

392
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:06,304
Four weeks, and you
still can't shine a buckle.

393
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,813
Shoot me a Kotex, buddy.

394
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,874
Be careful where you stick that.

395
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,157
Five minutes to
inspection, Mayo.

396
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,715
Where's your money?

397
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,871
Boonies.

398
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:38,502
You better hope Foley
never finds out about that.

399
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,569
Hey, Perryman.

400
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,512
Look what I got here.

401
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,518
Ooh...

402
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,678
Ooh...

403
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,187
Look at that.

404
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,189
Look at them buckles.

405
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,690
Look good, huh?

406
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,386
10 bucks.

407
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,395
15 for the boonies.

408
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,897
Who the hell's got 10 bucks?

409
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,364
I spend every penny

410
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,367
keeping my family in that motel.

411
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,097
You're breaking
my heart, Perryman.

412
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,696
Who's doing this for you?

413
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,700
Some enlisted guy, right?

414
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,281
Hey, tell me something.

415
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,782
Watch the sheets.

416
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,786
Is that piss-ass
change you making

417
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,290
worth all of us getting
kicked out of here

418
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,292
on an honors violation, huh?

419
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,059
I don't see anybody else
complaining about it, Perryman.

420
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,155
Ready...

421
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,427
Go!

422
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,254
Look out, Worley,
coming through.

423
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,991
The hell you say, son.

424
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,590
Here I come.

425
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,838
My name's going on that wall.

426
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,430
Underneath mine.

427
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,701
Fuck!

428
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,778
Aahhh!

429
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,944
Give me the rope!

430
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,719
Shit!

431
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,226
Goddamn, Mayonnaise!

432
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,641
10:25. Not bad...

433
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,803
for a beginner.

434
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,312
Piece of cake.

435
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,848
Let's go! Come on, Schneider!

436
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,008
Come on, Schneider!

437
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,754
Let's go! Let's go!

438
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,847
Kick ass!

439
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,598
Let's go! You're
bringing up the rear!

440
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,107
You ain't getting out of here

441
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,113
till you get over
that wall, See-gar.

442
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,614
I'll make it, sir!

443
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,013
Hurry up.

444
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,377
Come on. Get over there!

445
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,624
You really want to
be a man, See-gar?

446
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,628
You didn't get enough
of your daddy's attention

447
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:47,132
'cause he really wanted a son?

448
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,033
That's what'll beat you
every time, See-gar.

449
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:54,437
The mental attitude of a
person of the female persuasion.

450
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,476
Deep down under
all that bullshit,

451
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:00,911
you're still thinking like
a second-class citizen!

452
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,438
You can never
give orders to men!

453
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,916
Aw, walk around.

454
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,887
Walk around... sugar britches.

455
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,790
Bernoulli's Equation gives
us the total amount of energy

456
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,760
contained in the air flow.

457
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,820
"P" is static pressure in
pounds per square foot.

458
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:22,834
"Rho" is air density
in slugs per cubic foot,

459
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,962
and velocity is in
feet per second.

460
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,904
2,000 pounds per square foot

461
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,407
for your static pressure.

462
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,172
Air density of 1,
which is sea level.

463
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,453
Let's see them.

464
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,628
What about the buckles?

465
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,471
Okay. All right.
20 bucks, right?

466
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,107
Hey, bud.

467
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,477
Beat it.

468
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,980
What are you laughing about?

469
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,484
I thought that's how you did it.

470
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,610
Did what?

471
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,984
Did what? Come on, Santy Claus.

472
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,989
You aren't going
to tell, are you?

473
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,992
Not if you make
it worth my while.

474
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,994
Free boonies for the duration.

475
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,996
That's fair.

476
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,497
Tell you what.

477
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,000
You get me through aerodynamics,

478
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,061
you can write your
own ticket, my friend.

479
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,066

Hey, 2:00. Moving
in. Della Serra.

493
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,252
Radar's up. Scoping
the target area.

494
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,866
Uh-oh, zero in.

495
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,367
Slick it back.

496
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,370
Who'll be the lucky deb?

497
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:42,374
Is it the blonde?
Is it the brunette?

498
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,034
Score! He got her.

499
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:47,307
Oh, my God, check Perryman.

500
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,281
Five years of
marriage, still in love.

501
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,045
That's what life's all about.

502
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,884
Aah-oooh!

503
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,947
- Hey, See-gar!
- Hey, See-gar!

504
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,292
Hey, Zack,

505
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,832
remember those
bodacious tatas and her pal?

506
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,958
Right there they are, bud.

507
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,403
We ought to do
something about it.

508
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,180
So nice to meet you.

509
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,149
The boys speak highly of you.

510
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,153
Lynette, he has
several people to meet.

511
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,654
I'm so sorry.

512
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,155
Captain Rufferwell.

513
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,525
Mrs. Rufferwell!

514
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,822
Hello, Captain.

515
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,996
How are you?

516
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,159
Could you introduce
us to these ladies?

517
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,928
Paula, Lynette.

518
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,139
Miss Paula Pokrifki,

519
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,641
Miss Lynette Pomeroy,

520
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,143
may I present

521
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,270
Officer Candidate Sid Worley

522
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,815
and Officer Candidate
Zachary Mayo.

523
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,819
Well, I hope you
have a good time.

524
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,522
We already met.

525
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,716
We did?

526
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,225
Uh-huh.

527
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:11,024
You said it would
grow an inch by now.

528
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,622
That was you guys?

529
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,132
Yeah.

530
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,973
Would you like to dance?

531
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,565
Sure.

532
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,903
It's grown out more
than an inch, pal.

533
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,994
Would you like to get a drink?

534
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,495
Sure.

535
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,088
Let's go.

536
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,505
What kind of name is Pokrifki?

537
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,508
Polish. What kind
of a name is Mayo?

538
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,044
Italian. My mom was Irish.

539
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,442
No, thanks.

540
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,504
I think I got her ears.

541
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,948
The rest is all wop.

542
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,453
Where are you
from, Mayo the wop?

543
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,045
Everywhere, nowhere...

544
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,547
Paula the Polack.

545
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,026
Seriously.

546
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,527
Seriously.

547
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,961
Seriously.

548
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,464
My father's a rear
admiral, 7th Fleet.

549
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,966
You're kidding.

550
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,470
No. We lived in ports
all over the world.

551
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,529
Katmandu...

552
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,972
Moscow, Nairobi.

553
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,474
Really?

554
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:34,035
Hell, I've never been
out of Washington.

555
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,546
Wait a minute.

556
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,480
You're kidding me, right?

557
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,486
We don't have any
naval bases in Moscow.

558
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,044
No.

559
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,090
No, I didn't think so.

560
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,086
So, you got a girl,
Mayo the wop?

561
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,921
No.

562
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,725
I ain't looking for one either.

563
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,405
What are you looking for?

564
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,278
I've heard about these girls

565
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,406
who come here
looking for a husband.

566
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,950
Not me.

567
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,452
Yeah?

568
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,454
Why are you here?

569
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,956
To meet interesting people,

570
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,458
improve myself.

571
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,496
What do you do, go to school?

572
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,464
No, I got a job.

573
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,966
I work at National Paper.

574
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,003
It's a real good job.

575
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,504
I'm saving money to travel.

576
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,599
Think I'd like to go to Moscow.

577
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,850
You been through
the Dilbert Dunker yet?

578
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,818
My father and my
brother made it through.

579
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,821
I guess I can, too.

580
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:52,323
Oh, is your brother a flier?

581
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,187
He was. He got killed.

582
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,661
Vietnam?

583
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,197
Yeah.

584
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,300
My brother died over there, too.

585
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,803
He wasn't no flier, though.

586
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,307
I was only 12 when it happened.

587
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,843
I really don't remember
much about him.

588
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,647
I sure remember Tommy.

589
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:19,242
Mind if we talk about
something else?

590
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,213
We don't have to talk
about anything at all.

591
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:06,965
Think you'll make it
to getting your wings?

592
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,432
Who knows?

593
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,935
Guys a lot smarter than me

594
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,437
been dropping out like flies.

595
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,940
You've got to program yourself.

596
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,441
It'll happen.

597
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,412
You just got to see
yourself making it.

598
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,473
I read this article
in <i>Cosmo</i> about that.

599
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,041
I swear.

600
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,955
Paula...

601
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,550
you are a very,
very pretty girl.

602
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:50,398
Do you want to go
somewhere else?

603
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,900
Come on.

604
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,572
Fall out, Worley.

605
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:13,431
Something tells me you
girls have been here before.

606
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,024
Whatever gave you that idea?

607
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,436
Oh, stop it!

608
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,973
You're going to ruin it.

609
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,440
I'm sorry.

610
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,033
I'll do it.

611
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,145
You sure this is okay?

612
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,213
Don't worry. I'll respect
you in the morning.

613
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,281
You're crazy, girl.

614
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,883
You'll respect me.

615
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,496
Couldn't wait to
get out of there.

616
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,975
Didn't you like the band?

617
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,409
Not much.

618
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,913
You didn't like <i>Tie
A Yellow Ribbon?</i>

619
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,882
I thought their rendition was...

620
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,432
Let's go down to the beach.

621
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,024
That sounds good.

622
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,534
Halt!

623
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,544
Fall out!

624
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,701
Look at Foley.

625
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,704
Do you believe it?

626
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,239
Showboat.

627
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,708
All right, listen up.

628
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,644
I'm the base martial
arts instructor.

629
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,205
You must desist
in thinking of me

630
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,148
as the drill instructor.

631
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,312
Just think of me...

632
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,820
as the enemy.

633
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,551
Do you believe this guy?

634
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:23,061
May I have a volunteer, please?

635
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,561
Daniels.

636
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:25,995
Get up here.

637
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,727
Put him in the hospital.

638
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,769
He can't touch me.

639
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,770
It's against the law.

640
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,237
Come on, Topper!

641
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,241
Come on up here, son.

642
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,799
Hang tough, buddy!

643
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,448
Hello, pussy.

644
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,916
How bad do you want to survive?

645
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,251
This officer candidate doesn't
understand the question.

646
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,816
Let's see if I can
clarify it a little.

647
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,699
You want to stop me, pussy?

648
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,668
Are you relying on my generosity

649
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,604
to stop me from killing you?

650
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,106
I can't breathe.

651
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,165
Break loose.

652
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,676
Break loose!

653
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,508
I can't... breathe.

654
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,844
Get away from here!

655
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,053
You're not hurt.

656
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,557
I could have killed you.

657
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,956
Move off.

658
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,892
Get out of here!

659
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,521
Get back to your seat!

660
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:38,401
You think I was really
harsh on your classmate?

661
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,237
Wait until you get shot
down behind enemy lines.

662
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,971
The only thing between
you and a P.O.W. camp

663
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,570
is what you learn from me.

664
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,582
Now that I got your attention,

665
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,710
we shall proceed with the class.

666
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,608
God, I hope she shows.

667
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,109
She's going to show.

668
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:22,113
A rich, socialite Okie like you

669
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,617
ought to be a big catch here.

670
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,117
I ain't rich.

671
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,120
You're an officer's kid.

672
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,712
So what?

673
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,626
Man, I spent six years

674
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:40,631
living right on top of the
raunchiest whorehouse in the P.I.

675
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,224
<i>"Oy! Oy, palequero!</i>

676
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,729
You want numbah one fucky-fucky?

677
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,644
Long time, short time.
$10! Cheap-cheap!"

678
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,144
10 bucks?

679
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,238
"10 dollah. 10 dollah!"

680
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,584
Lynette, honey,
how's it hanging?

681
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,144
Don't drool on her, boy.

682
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,647
Hi.

683
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,821
Pansy-ass fly-boys.

684
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,104
I remember you.

685
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,663
Mayo the wop.

686
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,165
Yep, that's me.

687
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:30,004
It's good to see you.

688
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,175
I was looking forward to it.

689
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,687
Me, too.

690
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,179
Yeah.

691
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,125
Uh, excuse me.

692
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,652
You guys want to
just hang out here,

693
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,666
or can I suggest
an alternate plan?

694
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:53,637
Like pick up a bottle
and go to a motel?

695
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,673
Just like that. Yeah.

696
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,675
What do you think?

697
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,142
Huh?

698
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,679
I'll vote for a motel.

699
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,177
My kind of group.

700
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,680
Troy, here they come.

701
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,063
Well! Make way
for the warmongers.

702
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,622
What did you call us?

703
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,565
I called you a warmonger.

704
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,126
Ain't that what you are?

705
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,695
Yeah, right.

706
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,320
I'd like to ask you something.

707
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,379
What do you want?

708
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,391
You come up here,
you rich college boys.

709
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,361
You're strutting around
in your ice cream outfits

710
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:54,365
like you own the goddamn place.

711
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,196
Who do you think you are?

712
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,203
Man, I don't want to fight you.

713
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,704
Got that? I don't want to fight.

714
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,331
Go back inside and cool down.

715
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,876
I ain't finished
talking, sailor boy!

716
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,849
Oh, God.

717
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,857
That's enough, man.

718
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,918
Oh, shit! Check his nose.

719
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,899
He broke his nose, man.

720
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,868
You asshole! Faggot!

721
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:38,709
God, I never seen
anything like that in my life.

722
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,211
Did you see that guy's nose?

723
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,716
Lynette, will you
just shut up, please?

724
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,274
Well, excuse me for living.

725
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,788
Asshole!

726
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,157
I should have walked away.

727
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,718
Zack, he didn't
give you a choice.

728
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,765
A man's always got a choice.

729
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,012
Where did you learn
how to fight like that?

730
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,072
I don't want to talk
about it now, all right?

731
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,149
All right.

732
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,991
It wouldn't kill you
to open up to me.

733
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,926
What do you want,
you want to fuck?

734
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:37,525
Get on the bed.
Take your clothes off.

735
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,969
I'll give you a good fuck.

736
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,972
Where's that coming from?

737
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,440
I wouldn't fuck you now...

738
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,977
Then get the hell out!

739
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,707
Who do you think
you're talking to?

740
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,181
I'm not some whore
you brought in here.

741
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,186
I'm trying to be your friend.

742
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,189
Then be a friend.
Get out of here.

743
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,690
Fine.

744
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,157
Fine.

745
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,888
Man, you ain't nothing special.

746
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,487
You got no manners. You
treat women like whores.

747
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:10,899
You got no chance
of being no officer.

748
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,180
Hey. Shh!

749
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,681
Shh!

750
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:26,684
Shh!

751
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,185
Shh!

752
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,686
It's okay.

753
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:31,188
It's all right.

754
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,689
Shh!

755
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:34,191
Shh!

756
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,749
I'm sorry.

757
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,253
I'm sorry.

758
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,097
Are you hungry?

759
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,201
Yeah. Yeah, I'm starved.

760
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,855
Skivvies?

761
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,480
Pretty sexy, huh?

762
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,926
Sporty.

763
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,655
Control yourself, baby.

764
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,833
Ahh!

765
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,173
Mmm, good!

766
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,184
Look, Paula...

767
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:13,190
I try real hard not
to fool anybody

768
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,249
about who I am,

769
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,261
what I want.

770
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:21,766
I know who you are
and what you want.

771
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,198
And what do you want?

772
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,600
I want to have a good time

773
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,264
until you have to leave.

774
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,705
That's it?

775
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,333
Mm-hmm.

776
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,213
Hey!

777
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,342
Last night was incredible.

778
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:43,344
I thought so, too.

779
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,225
Zack, am I your fantasy?

780
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,726
What?

781
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:54,732
I dare you not to
fall in love with me.

782
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:58,736
How can you
resist? I'm like candy.

783
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:00,738
You're better than candy.

784
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:05,743
It's going to be hard to
get enough, very hard.

785
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,210
Very hard!

786
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,713
You're getting feisty on me,

787
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,806
you little cocky Polack!

788
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:29,099
What do you do with a girl

789
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,726
when you're through with her?

790
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,431
You say something
or just disappear, huh?

791
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,337
I never had a girl.

792
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,788
I forgot to thank
you for breakfast.

793
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,346
Anytime, sailor.

794
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:01,923
Heads up, Perryman.
When you hit the water,

795
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,731
you might get the wind
knocked out of you. Don't panic.

796
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,864
You've got a second and a half

797
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,909
before the cage
flips upside-down.

798
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,444
Go, Joe!

799
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,387
Now, the most important thing

800
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,425
is to watch your bubbles.

801
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,392
When that cage
flips upside-down,

802
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,019
you're going to be disoriented.

803
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,394
You won't have your bearings,

804
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,456
like Perryman down there.

805
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,128
The bubbles will
determine which way is up.

806
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,363
Holy shit.

807
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,268
All right, time's up.

808
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,432
Go down for him, Jason.

809
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,908
If you panic, you
can die down there,

810
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,071
and this is only
a swimming pool.

811
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,580
Out in the Pacific,

812
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,709
you won't have a
frogman to save your ass.

813
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,089
Totally unsatisfactory,
Perryman.

814
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,525
Do it again.

815
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,895
Two more chances to
make it, or you're out.

816
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,558
All right. Next!

817
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,898
Hold it. Change in order.

818
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,403
Mayo...

819
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,406
since you're
hotshot of the week,

820
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,907
you're next.

821
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,409
Aye, aye, sir.

822
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,411
Seeger, you're behind him.

823
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:22,969
Yes, sir.

824
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,920
You ought to be
good at this, Mayo.

825
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,422
Something you can do alone.

826
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,481
Take him up, Joe!

827
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,493
You never know when this program

828
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,495
will trip you up, huh, Mayo?

829
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,996
It could be the grade

830
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:42,499
or some little flaw
in your character

831
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,262
that comes out under stress.

832
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,596
Let it go, Joe!

833
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,495
All right, way to go!

834
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,793
Okay, Seeger. You're next.

835
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,890
Okay, Seeger, let's go.

836
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,594
Get a move on.

837
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,466
Joe, take her up!

838
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:28,444
Don't you cry now,
sugar britches!

839
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,741
Go, Joe!

840
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,230
All right, Seeger! Whoo!

841
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,731
All right.

842
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,324
Good girl.

843
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:55,405
Oh, gosh, that was great!

844
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,169
Think they'd let us do it again?

845
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,411
Not bad, Seeger.

846
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:07,110
But you still got to
get over that wall.

847
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,783
Next!

848
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,412
Daniels, move it.

849
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,390
Take it easy now.
Just a joyride.

850
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,934
Does this hit with
a plane's impact?

851
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,971
It's nothing
compared to a plane.

852
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,472
Don't forget to
watch the bubbles.

853
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,509
Okay, Joe, take him up!

854
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,114
All right, Daniels.

855
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:47,624
Let's have that thumbs up.

856
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,150
Come on. Where's
the thumbs up at?

857
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,697
All right. Go, Joe!

858
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,854
Hold it. Take it easy.

859
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,339
Pull it up!

860
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,738
Can't get it right now!

861
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,910
All right, let me through!

862
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,993
Grab him!

863
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,757
All right, pull him out!

864
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,265
Hold him!

865
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,824
Put him on his stomach!

866
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,768
Take his helmet off!

867
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,328
Goddamn!

868
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:09,771
Take it off.

869
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,331
Oh, Christ!

870
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,070
He killed himself.

871
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,578
Somebody get me a corpsman.

872
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,012
On the double!

873
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,548
Yes, sir!

874
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,050
Okay. Everybody just stand back.

875
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,552
Come on, Topper.

876
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,053
Oh, God!

877
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,248
Come on.

878
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,881
Come on, buddy.

879
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:31,027
Come on, man.

880
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,528
Come on, Topper.

881
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,588
Come on.

882
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,397
Breathe, man. Breathe.

883
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,038
Hey!

884
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,539
All right.

885
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:45,075
All right!

886
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,571
All right.

887
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,407
Is the corpsman on the way?

888
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,986
Yeah.

889
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,379
Stand back.

890
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,754
Give him room.

891
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,259
Get back.

892
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,796
Somebody go check
on that corpsman.

893
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,764
He's going to be all right.

894
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,459
Take it easy.

895
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,931
Prepare for inspection!

896
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,812
Shit.

897
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,073
I am not going to make it.

898
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,325
Help me out, Sid.

899
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,826
Got a spare, man?

900
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,362
My spare sucks.

901
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,865
You know where
the hardware store is.

902
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:45,198
Zack, I need a buckle, man.

903
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,338
I can't risk it.

904
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,875
You got time. He's up there.

905
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,342
Can't do it.

906
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,347
I got to see my
family this weekend.

907
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:02,546
Wouldn't want you to get
an honor violation, Perryman.

908
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,144
Okay.

909
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,147
Okay.

910
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,656
Attention on deck!

911
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:23,665
In every class,

912
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,576
there's always one joker who
thinks he's smarter than me.

913
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,017
In this class, that
happens to be you,

914
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,246
isn't it, Mayonnaise?

915
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,529
Perryman, Worley...

916
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,690
let us have this room.

917
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,199
On the double.

918
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,429
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

919
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:53,526
Stow it.

920
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,508
Mayo...

921
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,408
I want your D.O.R.

922
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,043
No, sir.

923
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:08,210
You can kick me
out, but I ain't quitting.

924
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,517
Get into your fatigues, Mayo.

925
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,530
By the end of this weekend,

926
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,065
you'll quit.

927
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,934
Casey Jones was
a son of a bitch!

928
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,478
Casey Jones was
a son of a bitch!

929
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,104
Drove his train
in a 30-foot ditch!

930
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,581
Drove his train
in a 30-foot ditch!

931
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,448
Came on out with
his dick in his hand.

932
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,715
Came on out with
his dick in his hand.

933
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,814
Said, "Listen, ladies,
I'm a hell of a man."

934
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,655
Said, "Listen, ladies,
I'm a hell of a man."

935
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,218
Went to his room and
lined up a hundred.

936
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,764
Went to his room and
lined up a hundred.

937
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,426
Swore up and down
he'd fuck every one.

938
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,800
Swore up and down
he'd fuck every one.

939
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,430
Fucked 98 till his
balls turned blue.

940
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:04,475
Fucked 98 till his
balls turned blue.

941
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,770
Then he backed off,

942
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,186
jacked off, and
fucked the other two!

943
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,610
He backed off,

944
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,118
jacked off, and
fucked the other two!

945
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,445
Wave good-bye to your buddies.

946
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:15,145
I forgot. You don't
have buddies.

947
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,652
Only customers.

948
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,656
You having fun, Mayonnaise?

949
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,157
Yes, sir!

950
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,658
Don't hear you!

951
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,194
Yes, sir!

952
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,465
98...

953
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,967
99...

954
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:35,028
Get your face all the
way down in there!

955
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,531
100.

956
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,769
You ready to quit now, Mayo?

957
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,474
No, sir!

958
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,540
Look over there, Mayo.

959
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,017
Look at her.

960
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,714
She decided to stay

961
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,155
instead of taking
liberty this weekend.

962
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,659
She may not make it,

963
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,821
but she's got more
heart and character

964
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,728
than you'll ever have!

965
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:08,128
Life's dealt you some
shitty cards, hasn't it?

966
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,674
I'm doing all right, sir!

967
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,074
6...

968
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,634
Bullshit.

969
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,577
I done some checking.

970
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,138
I looked through your files.

971
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,583
I know about your mama.

972
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,587
I know your
father's an alcoholic

973
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,589
and a whore chaser.

974
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,091
That's why you don't mesh,

975
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,593
because deep down...

976
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,926
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

977
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,989
Deep down inside...

978
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:40,003
you know the others
are better than you!

979
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,005
Isn't that right, Mayo?

980
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,506
No, sir!

981
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,041
No, sir!

982
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,503
What's the matter, Mayo?

983
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,014
You getting tired?

984
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,448
I'm not tired.

985
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:54,951
Move it, boy!

986
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,011
This is where the fun starts.

987
01:00:58,088 --> 01:00:59,522
Move it!

988
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:04,084
You got all day tomorrow
to look forward to!

989
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,867
6 inches off the ground.

990
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:15,428
Give me 6 to 90.

991
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:21,178
Why don't we quit
this little charade

992
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,681
over a couple of beers at TJ's?

993
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:28,685
You're as close to
officer material as me.

994
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:31,688
This candidate believes
he'd make a good officer.

995
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,192
You only give a
shit about yourself.

996
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,693
All your classmates know it.

997
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,698
They wouldn't trust you
behind a plane's controls.

998
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,200
You'd probably steal my F-14

999
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,237
and sell it to the Cubans.

1000
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:50,240
No, sir! I love my country.

1001
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:53,835
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo.

1002
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,146
Talk to me.

1003
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:00,013
Why would a slick
hustler like you

1004
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,018
sign up for this abuse?

1005
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,519
I want to fly jets.

1006
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,556
So does my grandmama.

1007
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,523
I've wanted to
since I was a kid.

1008
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:09,526
We're not talking about flying.

1009
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,494
We're talking about character.

1010
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,995
I've changed since
I've been here.

1011
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,998
The hell you have.

1012
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,499
I've changed, sir!

1013
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,001
You've just polished your act.

1014
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,004
You've just shined it up!

1015
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,007
Now, tell me what
I want to hear.

1016
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,736
I want your D.O.R.

1017
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,675
I ain't going to quit.

1018
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,837
Spell it!

1019
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,006
D-O-R.

1020
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,448
Then you and your daddy

1021
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,815
can go whore-chasing together!

1022
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,582
No, sir! I ain't going to quit!

1023
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,521
Then you can forget it.

1024
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,183
You're out!

1025
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,194
Don't you do it!

1026
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,957
Don't... you...

1027
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,257
I got nowhere else to go!

1028
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,427
I got nowhere else to go!

1029
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,436
I ain't got nothing else.

1030
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,775
I got nothing else.

1031
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,220
All right, Mayo.

1032
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,713
On your feet.

1033
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,648
Let's get back to the barracks.

1034
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:40,809
Hey, Foley!

1035
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,443
Zack, don't give up!

1036
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:45,182
You got that queer on the run!

1037
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,188
Oh, no!

1038
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,952
Kiss this, Foley!

1039
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,459
Hang in there, Zack!

1040
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,519
Those friends of yours?

1041
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,291
Don't give up, Mayo!

1042
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:55,364
Yes, sir.

1043
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,866
We're with you, Zack!

1044
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,458
Don't quit, Zack!

1045
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,527
You can make it!

1046
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,038
You got some urinals to clean.

1047
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,438
Move out.

1048
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,975
Hey, Foley's a queer!

1049
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,376
He got his balls
shot off in the war!

1050
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:29,055
You're still here, huh, Mayo?

1051
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,410
Sid.

1052
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,349
Yeah?

1053
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,753
Thanks.

1054
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,855
Sid.

1055
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,793
Look at that.

1056
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:11,766
That son of a bitch.

1057
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,885
Want me to get a towel?

1058
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,420
I'll get one.

1059
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,389
I don't want you to move.

1060
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,892
I don't want to move.

1061
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,793
Somebody's got to move sometime.

1062
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,421
Eventually.

1063
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:18,634
"They found them
there weeks later,

1064
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,263
shriveled from lack
of food and water."

1065
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,939
Bye, Zachary.

1066
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,361
I laughed all week,

1067
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,829
thinking about you
guys on that boat.

1068
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,957
We were so drunk.

1069
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,801
That looks...

1070
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,511
pretty sharp, Paula.

1071
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,139
Pretty sharp.

1072
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,814
I'd love to be
one of those girls

1073
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,321
in the flight program.

1074
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,483
I think it would
be a gas to fly.

1075
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,049
So what's stopping you?

1076
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:23,499
You know, those
magazines, what they say,

1077
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,228
it's just... I don't know.

1078
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,703
It's not so easy for a girl.

1079
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:33,072
That's no excuse for
not getting what you want.

1080
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,168
Just go get it.

1081
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:42,709
Who says I'm not
going after what I want?

1082
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,211
Not me.

1083
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,325
My mama's 39 years old.

1084
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:53,886
She still works
over at that factory.

1085
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:57,833
Every time I look at her,

1086
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,893
I know exactly
what I don't want.

1087
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,403
My old lady...

1088
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:12,279
took a bottle of pills one
day when I was at school.

1089
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,839
Oh, God.

1090
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:22,019
The thing that
got me about it...

1091
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,353
she didn't leave a note.

1092
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,860
Nothing. She just checked out.

1093
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,867
I always hated her for that.

1094
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,579
Oh, God.

1095
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,807
That must really hurt.

1096
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:49,045
Hurt? No.

1097
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,047
You're all alone in the world.

1098
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,953
Once you got that down,

1099
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,552
nothing hurts anymore.

1100
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,335
I bet most people
would buy that line

1101
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,394
when you feed it to them.

1102
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,275
Hmm?

1103
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,833
Hmm?

1104
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,520
Hey, are you really serious

1105
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,532
about having him over?

1106
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,092
I haven't made up my mind yet.

1107
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:44,038
How far would
you go to get Zack?

1108
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,099
What do you mean?

1109
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,542
You know what I mean.

1110
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,604
Would you let
yourself get pregnant?

1111
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,115
No way, Lynette.

1112
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,548
Come on. Would you?

1113
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,109
I never used to think

1114
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,712
I'd do something like that.

1115
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,985
I don't know anymore.

1116
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:04,152
Nine weeks ain't long enough

1117
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,322
for a guy to fall in love.

1118
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,831
That doesn't
justify trapping him.

1119
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,300
Getting pregnant?
What a thought.

1120
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,802
It's real backward.

1121
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,305
It ain't any more backward

1122
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,809
than the way these
hotshot assholes use us

1123
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:21,811
till they've had enough,

1124
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,814
then ditch us like we's trash.

1125
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:27,851
Don't you ever feel used, Paula?

1126
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:33,322
Don't you feel the son of
a bitch should pay for it?

1127
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,917
No. I never feel like that.

1128
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,359
Well, I do.

1129
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,382
Thanks again for the flowers.

1130
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,350
It was my pleasure.

1131
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,877
Those are the most
beautiful things I ever saw.

1132
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,757
Wipe that stuff off your mouth.

1133
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,287
Zack?

1134
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,892
This is great.

1135
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,231
Sir?

1136
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,941
How many more
weeks till graduation?

1137
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,779
Oh, I've got three more.

1138
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,285
Three more weeks.

1139
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,288
Those are the
roughest, aren't they?

1140
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,415
That's what they tell me.

1141
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,825
Sir, why do you keep
staring at my food?

1142
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,805
Or are you staring at me?

1143
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,104
Not staring at you.

1144
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:02,111
He doesn't mean anything by it.

1145
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:04,477
Do you, Joe?

1146
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:08,450
No. I don't mean anything by it.

1147
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,350
Like some more chicken, Zack?

1148
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:20,796
No. No, thanks.

1149
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,297
I've had it.

1150
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,800
I can't eat another bite.

1151
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,132
I'm stuffed, too.

1152
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:28,967
This is the best meal

1153
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:31,507
I've had in a long time.

1154
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,042
Let's go, Zack.

1155
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,543
Thank you, Mama.

1156
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,976
Thank you, Zack.

1157
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,445
Thanks again, ma'am.

1158
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,873
Go on and eat.

1159
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,318
Mama, mama!

1160
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:49,325
I'm sorry. I'm so
embarrassed, Zack.

1161
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:52,328
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

1162
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:56,332
That's okay. A great free meal.

1163
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:58,391
A nice, relaxing meal.

1164
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,996
Those people are so uptight.

1165
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,006
I felt so sorry for you.

1166
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:05,507
Don't feel sorry for me.

1167
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,339
I'm used to it. It's hereditary.

1168
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:13,349
After this, you go to basic
flight in Pensacola, right?

1169
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,318
Yeah. Pensacola.

1170
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,320
And, uh...

1171
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,322
going to Beeville, Texas,

1172
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,358
when I get jets.

1173
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,260
So, after that...

1174
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,320
don't you think about...

1175
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,331
I mean, come on.

1176
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:31,765
What's after that?

1177
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,427
Family, kids...

1178
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,836
Don't you think about all that?

1179
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,067
No.

1180
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,769
Is that what you think about?

1181
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,436
Sometimes.

1182
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,907
If I could do a
better job than them,

1183
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,350
I'd love it.

1184
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,853
What would you do different?

1185
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,355
Everything.

1186
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:56,859
First, I'd marry a
man I really loved.

1187
01:14:56,926 --> 01:15:00,920
So why did your
mom marry this guy

1188
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,364
if she didn't love him?

1189
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,368
My real father
wouldn't marry her.

1190
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,835
Your real father?

1191
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,371
My real father.

1192
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:13,341
I want to show
you my real father.

1193
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,935
Pop.

1194
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:26,555
Your real father was an
officers candidate like me?

1195
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:28,614
About 22 years ago.

1196
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,626
Jesus.

1197
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:35,028
No wonder this guy
was looking at me funny.

1198
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,066
He always looks funny.

1199
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,414
It's time I got
back to the wars.

1200
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,542
I know, I know.

1201
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:01,814
Thank your mom for dinner, okay?

1202
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,223
Great chicken, huh?

1203
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,158
I loved the chicken.

1204
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,753
If you get a chance,

1205
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,265
why don't you call me?

1206
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,325
I have survival
training this week,

1207
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,338
so I can't make any promises.

1208
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,771
No promises.

1209
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,777
I didn't have to
show you that picture

1210
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,779
if I didn't want to.

1211
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,781
I wanted to tell you that.

1212
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,441
I know.

1213
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,612
Be careful on that thing.

1214
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,088
Yeah.

1215
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:17,966
You and Paula still seeing
those flight candidates?

1216
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,502
Any reason we wouldn't be?

1217
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,969
3:40 in the afternoon.

1218
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:26,168
You haven't said what
you're doing this weekend.

1219
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:30,407
Hi. I'd like to speak
with Zack Mayo.

1220
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:34,176
Could you look for him?

1221
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,684
Tell him it's Paula.

1222
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,414
Liberty time, boys and girls.

1223
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:42,081
Fall out!

1224
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,493
Aye, aye, sir!

1225
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:46,995
Whoo-hoo!

1226
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,530
Where's my bread?

1227
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,998
Come on, Perryman. Come on.

1228
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,535
Seeger, don't forget TJ's.

1229
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,002
I won't.

1230
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,733
Hey, Mayo, you got a call.

1231
01:17:57,806 --> 01:17:59,434
Somebody named Paula.

1232
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,103
Tell her I already split.

1233
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,772
Whoo!

1234
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,322
I see.

1235
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,551
Okay.

1236
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,559
Right after survival training,

1237
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:21,961
they start thinking they
can make it without you.

1238
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,966
Suddenly, they stop calling.

1239
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:28,061
Suddenly, they own
the goddamn world.

1240
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,475
They said that he already left.

1241
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,977
I don't think he did.

1242
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:39,982
He hasn't called by
now, he won't call.

1243
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,018
Bunny, just shut up!

1244
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,347
You don't know so much.

1245
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,411
Clock me out, Lynette.

1246
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,979
Paula, what are you doing?

1247
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,084
May they all crash and burn.

1248
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:56,857
Paula, wait!

1249
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,366
Where are you going?

1250
01:18:58,434 --> 01:18:59,663
Let me go, Mama.

1251
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,203
You're going to look for Zack.

1252
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,431
Don't do it.

1253
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,563
I love him.

1254
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,665
I can't let him run off.

1255
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,176
How you going to stop him?

1256
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,008
I'll think of a way.

1257
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,944
No!

1258
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:11,946
No?

1259
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:14,449
I can't let you do this.

1260
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,951
Don't go. Please don't go.

1261
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,716
What are you crying about?

1262
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:23,725
'Cause I know
what you're feeling!

1263
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,624
What am I feeling?

1264
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,424
Don't do it. Let him go.

1265
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:30,125
Don't trick him or trap him.

1266
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,100
I wouldn't do that.

1267
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:35,296
I'd never try to trap him.

1268
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:38,808
If you find him,
you'll say anything.

1269
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,901
And God help you after that.

1270
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,415
Mama, you're right.

1271
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,626
Daddy, Zack's 2/10 of a second

1272
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:00,663
off the obstacle course record.

1273
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,665
He'll break it before he leaves.

1274
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:07,169
Lucky you weren't
here when I was.

1275
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:10,673
You couldn't quit
like you can now.

1276
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,938
When I and my oldest
boy went through it,

1277
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,445
you quit, you became a swabby.

1278
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:18,981
That's interesting, sir.

1279
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:22,143
How come you
haven't written Susan?

1280
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:27,956
We haven't had time to write.

1281
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,492
I've only written y'all once.

1282
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,027
It's incredible.

1283
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:35,361
Right?

1284
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,024
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,638
Who is this Susan?

1286
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,643
That's my girl back home.

1287
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:51,203
I'm marrying her
when I get out of here.

1288
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,607
She was Tommy's girl.

1289
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:59,053
They were supposed to get
married before he got killed.

1290
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,024
I never told you

1291
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:07,029
because I didn't want
you to think I was a shit

1292
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:08,496
for fucking Lynette.

1293
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:10,499
Man, I ain't your parents.

1294
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:13,400
Do you love this girl?

1295
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,904
Greatest chick you'll ever know.

1296
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,462
She loves kids.

1297
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,236
Works with handicapped
kids every afternoon.

1298
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,413
That ain't what
I'm talking about.

1299
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,973
I asked you if you loved her.

1300
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,416
Everybody loves her.

1301
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:32,478
I won't make that
reunion tonight.

1302
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,920
Why not?

1303
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,925
I'm meeting
Lynette at the Tides.

1304
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,484
Best head in 52 states.

1305
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,427
What can I do?

1306
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,988
No, no, no.

1307
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,933
You should've done what I did...

1308
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,993
Break it off clean,

1309
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,005
have it done with, over.

1310
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,563
It's the best.

1311
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:56,945
She was torn up
you didn't call her.

1312
01:21:57,012 --> 01:22:00,244
I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

1313
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,217
Women. Women, women, women.

1314
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,087
They say, "A good
time, a lot of laughs,

1315
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:15,756
no problems."

1316
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:21,026
Doesn't work that way, does it?

1317
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:26,975
Look out, TJ's!

1318
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,533
Here I come.

1319
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,036
See you later, man.

1320
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:38,086
What are you smiling about?

1321
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:40,088
You're lucky you're here.

1322
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,590
What are you talking about?

1323
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:44,058
A toast.

1324
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,595
We made it. To survival.

1325
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:48,096
To survival.

1326
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,132
In spite of Perryman.

1327
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:53,566
Uh-uh. In spite of Foley.

1328
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:57,003
Is that your deb over there?

1329
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:11,452
She's pulling rank on you.

1330
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,955
That's a flight
instructor she's with.

1331
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,836
Back in a minute.

1332
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,232
What are you doing here?

1333
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:02,237
It was time for me to see TJ's

1334
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:04,364
once before I left.

1335
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,301
You come here a lot?

1336
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,314
Once in a while.

1337
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,219
I'm sorry I didn't call.

1338
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:20,222
This week's been unbelievable.

1339
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,723
It's okay.

1340
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,225
How did survival training go?

1341
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:25,727
I survived.

1342
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,319
You survived. Obviously.

1343
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,823
How was your week?

1344
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,735
It was good.

1345
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:37,239
I might get a raise next month.

1346
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,831
That's great.

1347
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:43,745
You guys are graduating
in a couple of weeks?

1348
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,246
Yeah.

1349
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:48,751
I'm starting to believe
I'll actually make it.

1350
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:50,251
You'll make it.

1351
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,757
I told you... You saw
it, and it happened.

1352
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,849
Yeah, you told me.

1353
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:01,630
I got to go.

1354
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,763
I have a date.

1355
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,357
Look, there's
something I wanted...

1356
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,361
What?

1357
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,939
I just... I wanted to thank you.

1358
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,714
I wouldn't have
made it through this

1359
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:23,241
if I didn't have something
to look forward to.

1360
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,719
I had a good time.

1361
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:28,279
Good luck in Pensacola, and...

1362
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:32,294
get jets, huh?

1363
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,300
See you, Zack.

1364
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:49,812
Give me another one.

1365
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,809
In fact, give me the bottle.

1366
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:03,291
Come here, baby doll.

1367
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,826
Come here.

1368
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,822
Come over here.

1369
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:14,596
Sit down for a second.

1370
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,662
I'll tell you something.

1371
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,779
Had to have one more taste.

1372
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,839
That stuff come in
anything besides strawberry?

1373
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,344
I'll bring some
coconut next time.

1374
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,328
I've really got to go.

1375
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,863
Mmm.

1376
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:51,139
Shouldn't you have
got your period by now?

1377
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,698
I'm a little late. That's all.

1378
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,369
How late are you?

1379
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,048
Why? What's the difference?

1380
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:01,640
If anything happened,

1381
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:05,051
it would be my responsibility.

1382
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,656
Exactly how late are you?

1383
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,523
What do you care?

1384
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:14,085
Suppose I was pregnant.

1385
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:19,396
I'd never make you do
something you didn't want to do.

1386
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:20,936
Oh, I know.

1387
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,905
But that's not the
only issue here.

1388
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,738
There's more to it than that.

1389
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:30,369
What other issue is there?

1390
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:38,253
My responsibility as
its father, for one thing.

1391
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,755
If I got you pregnant,

1392
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,259
I'd want to do the
right thing by you.

1393
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:46,761
I'll pay for the abortion,

1394
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,764
be with you through
it, comfort you.

1395
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,391
We'd go through it together.

1396
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:56,395
So how late are you?

1397
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,402
Let's just wait and
see what happens.

1398
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,905
See you later.

1399
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,908
I'll call you.

1400
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:12,411
Fuck!

1401
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,922
Last chance for the record!

1402
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,925
Go for the record!

1403
01:28:16,992 --> 01:28:19,484
This is it, Mayonnaise. Go!

1404
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,821
Go!

1405
01:28:31,373 --> 01:28:32,807
Come on!

1406
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,809
Go for it, Mayo!

1407
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:36,276
Go get it!

1408
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:46,788
Go, Mayo! Push it!

1409
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:49,689
Put your name on that wall!

1410
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,358
Mike, let's catch that animal!

1411
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,845
Let's do this together, Seeger.

1412
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:20,555
Come on, Seeger.

1413
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,784
Go for the record.

1414
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,157
Come on!

1415
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,733
Come on! You got it!

1416
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:34,292
Come on, man!

1417
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,235
Hey! Where you going?

1418
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,795
Seeger, get up.

1419
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,307
Forget it.

1420
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,808
You want jets?

1421
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:43,243
Then get up!

1422
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,746
You're going over! Right here!

1423
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,249
Three steps. Right, left, right.

1424
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:50,547
Hand over hand.

1425
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,087
Come on, See-gar.

1426
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,587
Ready? Let's go!

1427
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:55,590
Walk that wall, Seeger!

1428
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:57,091
Walk that wall!

1429
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,592
Hand over hand!

1430
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,094
Hand over hand!

1431
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,153
Walk it! Walk it!

1432
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,596
Walk it, Seeger!

1433
01:30:03,665 --> 01:30:05,099
Seeger, walk!

1434
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,759
Seeger!

1435
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:08,929
Don't you let go!

1436
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,939
You walk that wall!

1437
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:13,498
Pull! Pull! Pull,
Candidate Seeger!

1438
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,067
One leg! You got it!

1439
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,079
Pull over! Pull over!

1440
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:20,172
Pull yourself over!

1441
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:44,362
Where's Sid?

1442
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:52,971
What makes you
think she's not lying?

1443
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:56,450
She went to a doctor.
She's pregnant.

1444
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:58,453
So get an abortion.

1445
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,955
I'd love to, believe me.

1446
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:03,457
She won't even talk about it.

1447
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:04,959
She's Catholic.

1448
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,621
You're not marrying this girl.

1449
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:09,130
If I don't,

1450
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,565
she'll have the baby on her own.

1451
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,570
Women do it all the time.

1452
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:19,574
I can't let her have
a kid by herself.

1453
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,576
It's my kid, too.

1454
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,271
You sure?

1455
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:24,813
It's mine.

1456
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:34,755
I'm sorry, all right?

1457
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,292
What if Foley was right?

1458
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:40,761
She got knocked up to trap you.

1459
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,264
Is it still your responsibility?

1460
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,800
No matter how it happened,

1461
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,769
the child would still be mine.

1462
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,773
I wouldn't know where it was.

1463
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,309
Is everything
your responsibility?

1464
01:31:57,712 --> 01:31:58,771
Sit.

1465
01:31:58,847 --> 01:31:59,940
Adjust.

1466
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:00,948
Pray.

1467
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,450
Attack.

1468
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,282
It's like your
brother getting killed.

1469
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,686
It's the same damn thing...

1470
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:10,555
Him getting killed
instead of you.

1471
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,959
Isn't that why you
promised to marry Susan?

1472
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:17,466
You're acting out some
bullshit code of ethics.

1473
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,502
It may be bullshit to you,

1474
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:23,470
but I wasn't raised that way!

1475
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,473
We're responsible for others.

1476
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,978
It's the only thing that
separates us from animals!

1477
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,480
I can't shit on people

1478
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,516
and sleep at night.

1479
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:36,483
You're responsible
to yourself first.

1480
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:37,985
If you can't handle that,

1481
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,487
you've got bigger problems

1482
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,989
than making some girl pregnant.

1483
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,720
Gentlemen, relax.

1484
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:04,513
Without an oxygen
mask at 30,000 feet,

1485
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,516
your insides will feel
like this rubber glove.

1486
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,179
Your coordination
will deteriorate.

1487
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,745
Look for the warning signs...

1488
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:17,254
Giddiness, shortness
of breath, claustrophobia.

1489
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:20,762
They can hit you at any moment.

1490
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:24,266
The instant you feel
yourself losing control,

1491
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,267
go back on oxygen.

1492
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,735
Does everyone
understand the exercises?

1493
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:30,237
Okay. Everybody set?

1494
01:33:30,305 --> 01:33:33,241
Let's see a thumbs up, please.

1495
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:36,437
Very good. Everybody
remove your mask.

1496
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:39,970
All right. Begin
the exercises now.

1497
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,487
Queen of diamonds.

1498
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,891
Nine of diamonds.

1499
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:55,420
<i>If you have any problems,
put your mask on.</i>

1500
01:33:55,497 --> 01:33:58,467
<i>If you can't, raise your hand.</i>

1501
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:00,968
<i>The corpsman will assist you.</i>

1502
01:34:01,035 --> 01:34:03,937
<i>How you doing, Mayo and Seeger?</i>

1503
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:05,473
<i>Having trouble?</i>

1504
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:08,999
<i>Concentrate. Try to
make your palms meet.</i>

1505
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,472
Ace of spades.

1506
01:34:16,918 --> 01:34:18,978
<i>How you doing, Worley?</i>

1507
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:23,987
<i>Worley, are you all right?</i>

1508
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:28,756
<i>Worley, can you hear me?</i>

1509
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,196
Ace of spades.

1510
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:32,700
<i>Worley, put your mask on!</i>

1511
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:35,259
<i>Put your mask back on!</i>

1512
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,702
Sid, you okay?

1513
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:39,206
I got to get out!

1514
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:43,211
Worley, sit down!
Corpsman, we got a problem!

1515
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,610
I want out!

1516
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,648
<i>Corpsman, get that mask on!</i>

1517
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,444
It's all right. Breathe.

1518
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,382
Get out of here!

1519
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:52,386
It's all right. Breathe!

1520
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:54,979
Mayo, they're watching!

1521
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:57,457
<i>We'll stabilize the pressure!</i>

1522
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,892
It's okay. Everything's okay.

1523
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,395
Everybody's watching you.

1524
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:02,896
Hold on. Shh.

1525
01:35:02,964 --> 01:35:05,399
<i>We'll stabilize
the pressure now!</i>

1526
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:09,460
<i>Stay where you are.
Leave your masks on!</i>

1527
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,165
He's got it.

1528
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,707
He's okay.

1529
01:35:12,774 --> 01:35:15,471
No problem. He's okay.

1530
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:18,541
Colors!

1531
01:35:35,163 --> 01:35:36,688
Secure the halyard!

1532
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:41,531
Charlie, take care of that.

1533
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:42,603
Okay, Mayo.

1534
01:35:45,173 --> 01:35:46,698
What's going on?

1535
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:51,111
You didn't kick him out?

1536
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:55,617
Did he tell you what
he's been going through?

1537
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:57,117
That doesn't matter.

1538
01:35:57,185 --> 01:36:01,122
What matters is he
freaked out at 25,000 feet.

1539
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:03,124
That can't happen ever.

1540
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:06,127
He's got a girl. She's pregnant.

1541
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:07,628
That don't matter.

1542
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:09,129
Don't matter?

1543
01:36:09,197 --> 01:36:11,632
You've got two weeks left!

1544
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:15,136
That can happen to
you, too, Mayonnaise.

1545
01:36:15,203 --> 01:36:17,138
He ain't bullshitting you.

1546
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:19,299
I'm talking to
you, motherfucker!

1547
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:20,933
Don't fuck it up for you.

1548
01:36:21,009 --> 01:36:23,740
What did you call me?

1549
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:33,154
I thought the D.I.s
were supposed to help.

1550
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:36,157
What kind of a person are you?

1551
01:36:36,224 --> 01:36:39,319
Better lock it up,
or you'll go with him.

1552
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:42,159
Go back to the barracks.

1553
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,165
I don't get this.

1554
01:36:44,232 --> 01:36:47,669
He's the best
candidate in the class!

1555
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:50,671
The best student,
the best leader,

1556
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:53,173
the best friend to everybody.

1557
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:55,005
Bend your goddamn rules!

1558
01:36:55,076 --> 01:36:58,604
He didn't drop
me. I went to him.

1559
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,945
What are you talking about?

1560
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:02,950
I'm glad it's over.

1561
01:37:03,017 --> 01:37:06,510
I was here for everybody but me.

1562
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:11,459
I was here for my big brother.

1563
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:14,858
Hey, buddy.

1564
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:16,761
Sid, wait a minute.

1565
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,197
Sid!

1566
01:37:24,706 --> 01:37:27,801
Request permission
to carry on...

1567
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,309
sir!

1568
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:31,846
Get the fuck out of here.

1569
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:48,496
Yes, sir. Keep the change.

1570
01:37:48,563 --> 01:37:50,031
Thanks, pal.

1571
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:55,696
Lynette!

1572
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,669
Hi, baby.

1573
01:38:02,744 --> 01:38:04,178
Hi, Sid.

1574
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,645
Come out here.

1575
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,648
How come you're out of uniform?

1576
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,149
I got something for you.

1577
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,651
Wait. I'm a mess.

1578
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:14,177
All right, if you don't want it.

1579
01:38:15,156 --> 01:38:16,681
All right.

1580
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,625
What?

1581
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:21,561
Well, if you don't want it.

1582
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:22,688
What?

1583
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:29,694
Oh, my God!

1584
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:34,601
Oh, my God. It's beautiful!

1585
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:37,611
It cost me my whole savings.

1586
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,112
Oh, God!

1587
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:40,705
Oh, Sid! Oh...

1588
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,182
So, does this mean...

1589
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,380
Yes, ma'am, that's
what it means!

1590
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:49,714
Oh, Sid!

1591
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:52,255
Let's do it now!

1592
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:55,262
I wonder where
we'll get stationed.

1593
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:58,731
I've always wanted
to go to Hawaii.

1594
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,235
We won't get stationed anywhere.

1595
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,897
I D.O.R.'ed.

1596
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:05,405
You what?

1597
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:06,941
I D.O.R.'ed.

1598
01:39:07,008 --> 01:39:10,206
I wasn't cut out to be a pilot.

1599
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,247
I was faking it.

1600
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:16,080
I've been faking
everything up to now.

1601
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:18,745
But... what'll we do?

1602
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,652
Where would we go?

1603
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:22,781
Oklahoma.

1604
01:39:22,857 --> 01:39:27,386
I'll get my old job
back at J.C. Penney's.

1605
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:30,899
Hell, in two years,
I'll be floor manager.

1606
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,399
You'll love Oklahoma.

1607
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:35,733
You and Mama
will get along great.

1608
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,934
Money might be tight,
so we'll live at home.

1609
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,100
Sid.

1610
01:39:41,175 --> 01:39:42,643
There's no baby.

1611
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,072
What?

1612
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,115
I'm not pregnant.

1613
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:59,988
I got my period this morning.

1614
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:02,155
There's no baby, Sid.

1615
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,159
I'll be goddamned.

1616
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:31,855
What do you say we
get married anyway?

1617
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:33,394
I love you.

1618
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:37,531
I don't think I really knew that

1619
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,910
till just now, just this second.

1620
01:40:39,934 --> 01:40:42,028
I have never been happier

1621
01:40:42,103 --> 01:40:45,039
than I have been in
the last seven weeks.

1622
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:47,098
I've never felt so relaxed.

1623
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:50,167
I've never felt so loved
for who I really am.

1624
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:05,024
Lynette, marry me.

1625
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:08,256
Make me the happiest
man in the world.

1626
01:41:19,774 --> 01:41:21,367
I'm sorry, Sid.

1627
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:24,935
But I don't want to marry you.

1628
01:41:27,615 --> 01:41:29,379
I really like you,

1629
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:32,887
and we've had ourselves
some really great times.

1630
01:41:32,954 --> 01:41:35,219
But I thought you understood.

1631
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:38,225
I want to marry a pilot.

1632
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:41,456
I want to live my
life overseas...

1633
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:44,124
the wife of an aviator!

1634
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:52,902
Damn you!

1635
01:41:52,974 --> 01:41:54,636
Goddamn you!

1636
01:41:56,310 --> 01:42:00,077
Nobody D.O.R.s after 11 weeks!

1637
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:01,308
Nobody!

1638
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:18,256
Hi, ma'am.

1639
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:20,824
Have you seen Paula around?

1640
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:23,128
Paula!

1641
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:24,204
Paula!

1642
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:27,334
I'm looking for Sid.

1643
01:42:27,408 --> 01:42:30,401
He D.O.R.'ed and
split. Nobody's seen him.

1644
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,539
I don't know where to look.

1645
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,074
Same room?

1646
01:43:01,142 --> 01:43:03,236
Yes, sir.

1647
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,539
Number three.

1648
01:43:04,612 --> 01:43:07,275
Yep.

1649
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,816
That's the one.

1650
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:11,785
What do you think of this?

1651
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:13,753
That's nice.

1652
01:43:13,821 --> 01:43:15,255
Watch this.

1653
01:43:15,322 --> 01:43:16,790
I think you'll like it.

1654
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,409
Damn it!

1655
01:43:47,188 --> 01:43:48,747
Oh, shit.

1656
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:05,929
Lynette.

1657
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:09,274
Has Sid been here?

1658
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:11,369
Already come and gone.

1659
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:12,845
What happened?

1660
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,347
Can you believe it?

1661
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:17,943
He D.O.R.'ed in the 12th week.

1662
01:44:19,787 --> 01:44:21,779
How can you win?

1663
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,951
Lynette...

1664
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:33,890
What did you tell
him about the baby?

1665
01:44:33,968 --> 01:44:35,903
That there isn't one...

1666
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:37,461
as of today.

1667
01:44:39,707 --> 01:44:42,677
I got my period this morning.

1668
01:44:47,648 --> 01:44:49,913
I couldn't believe it.

1669
01:44:49,984 --> 01:44:53,352
He still wanted to marry me.

1670
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,321
What did you say?

1671
01:44:55,389 --> 01:44:57,381
I said no, of course.

1672
01:44:57,458 --> 01:45:00,758
I don't want no
Okie from Muskogee.

1673
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:03,388
I can get that right here.

1674
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,490
You little bitch!

1675
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:08,434
Who do you think you are,

1676
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:10,869
playing with people like that?

1677
01:45:10,938 --> 01:45:12,372
He loves you!

1678
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:14,340
You just shit on him!

1679
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:17,207
You made up
everything, didn't you?

1680
01:45:17,278 --> 01:45:19,213
There wasn't any baby.

1681
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,215
Of course there was a baby!

1682
01:45:21,282 --> 01:45:24,184
I'd never lie about
something like that!

1683
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:27,178
Would I, Paula?

1684
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,687
You little cunt!

1685
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:44,563
God help you.

1686
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:47,938
You're no different
than I am, Paula.

1687
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,772
Oh, yes, I am.

1688
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:51,107
Oh, no, you're not!

1689
01:46:10,164 --> 01:46:12,633
Let me see if he's here, okay?

1690
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,724
Okay.

1691
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:21,336
You seen Sid Worley around here?

1692
01:46:23,177 --> 01:46:24,668
Yeah, he's here.

1693
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,020
Sid.

1694
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,089
Sid.

1695
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:48,431
The guy said he just got here.

1696
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:52,538
Sid.

1697
01:46:58,545 --> 01:46:59,706
Sid?

1698
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:03,707
Hey, man.

1699
01:47:10,124 --> 01:47:11,649
Sid, you okay?

1700
01:47:15,062 --> 01:47:16,655
Sid.

1701
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,495
Shit! My God!

1702
01:47:25,973 --> 01:47:27,407
Oh, God.

1703
01:47:33,647 --> 01:47:35,172
Call an ambulance.

1704
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:40,010
Oh, Sid.

1705
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:45,683
Oh, God.

1706
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,529
Call an ambulance.

1707
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:59,102
You dumb, fucking Okie.

1708
01:47:59,173 --> 01:48:01,199
I was your friend.

1709
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:09,116
Why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

1710
01:48:09,183 --> 01:48:11,118
You didn't even try.

1711
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:17,951
You didn't say good-bye to me.

1712
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:04,068
The base chaplain said
he'd call Sid's parents.

1713
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:06,004
Why can't I learn?

1714
01:49:06,073 --> 01:49:08,975
Just like her all over again.

1715
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,277
Just like her.

1716
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:12,971
Don't do this to yourself.

1717
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:15,448
You didn't kill your mother.

1718
01:49:15,516 --> 01:49:17,451
You didn't kill Sid.

1719
01:49:17,518 --> 01:49:18,952
They killed themselves.

1720
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:20,487
Yeah.

1721
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:23,649
There's nothing you
could have done about it.

1722
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:26,125
I got to get out of here.

1723
01:49:26,193 --> 01:49:28,128
Want some money for a cab?

1724
01:49:28,195 --> 01:49:29,629
I don't deserve that.

1725
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:31,130
Okay. All right.

1726
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:33,360
You're not the only
one who feels awful.

1727
01:49:33,434 --> 01:49:36,461
Maybe I had
something to do with it.

1728
01:49:36,537 --> 01:49:39,200
I knew what Lynette was doing.

1729
01:49:39,273 --> 01:49:41,799
Look, you got no problems!

1730
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:44,811
Another class will be
coming through soon.

1731
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:47,677
You and Lynette...
Right back into business.

1732
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:49,182
That's not fair.

1733
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,184
I never lied to you.

1734
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,516
I never did what
Lynette's doing.

1735
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:54,987
I'm not Lynette.

1736
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:56,990
No.

1737
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:58,685
I love you.

1738
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:02,161
I've loved you since I met you.

1739
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:03,788
Don't you understand?

1740
01:50:05,566 --> 01:50:08,468
No! I don't want you to love me!

1741
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:10,697
I don't want anyone to love me.

1742
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:12,706
I just want out!

1743
01:50:16,577 --> 01:50:18,876
I don't know,
but it's been said!

1744
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:21,040
I don't know,
but it's been said!

1745
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,380
Air Force wings
are made of lead!

1746
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,385
Air Force wings
are made of lead!

1747
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:29,412
Left, right, left,
right, column right.

1748
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,890
Hut!

1749
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,893
I don't know,
but I've been told.

1750
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,054
I don't know,
but I've been told.

1751
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,223
Navy wings are made of gold!

1752
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,391
Navy wings are made of gold!

1753
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,059
Platoon...

1754
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,899
halt!

1755
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,439
Sir, this officer candidate
requests permission

1756
01:50:45,506 --> 01:50:48,408
to see you in private, sir!

1757
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,445
The whole class
knows about Worley.

1758
01:50:51,512 --> 01:50:53,447
We're sorry.

1759
01:50:53,514 --> 01:50:55,415
I bet you are.

1760
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:58,179
I want to see
you in private, sir.

1761
01:50:58,252 --> 01:50:59,845
Not now.

1762
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,853
Now!

1763
01:51:00,921 --> 01:51:01,921
Forward...

1764
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:03,856
Sir, I request permission...

1765
01:51:03,924 --> 01:51:05,415
Left, right, left, right.

1766
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:06,926
Left, right, left.

1767
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:09,259
Sir, this officer candidate
requests permission

1768
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,423
to see you in private!

1769
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:12,397
Sir!

1770
01:51:12,466 --> 01:51:14,401
Not now. I'm busy.

1771
01:51:14,468 --> 01:51:15,959
Get cleaned up.

1772
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:19,098
I don't need your shit!

1773
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:22,234
I came back to quit! D.O.R.!

1774
01:51:22,309 --> 01:51:23,902
Platoon... halt!

1775
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:28,415
I don't need you. I
don't need the Navy!

1776
01:51:28,482 --> 01:51:30,417
I don't need anybody.

1777
01:51:30,484 --> 01:51:33,283
Okay, Mayo. I see what you want.

1778
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:36,790
You said you wanted
to meet me in private?

1779
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,325
You got it!

1780
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:39,985
The blimp hangar. Now!

1781
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,585
Move it!

1782
01:51:41,662 --> 01:51:43,756
You move it.

1783
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,425
We ain't going
there to talk, boy.

1784
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,798
Move!

1785
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,070
Fall out.

1786
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:53,139
Fall out!

1787
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:55,665
This is between me and him.

1788
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:37,779
All right, Mayo.

1789
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:42,518
Let's see what you got.

1790
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:45,324
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1791
01:52:45,392 --> 01:52:46,451
Quiet.

1792
01:52:51,431 --> 01:52:54,299
I see you've had some
training, Mayonnaise.

1793
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:00,340
Come on, Foley.

1794
01:53:00,407 --> 01:53:02,035
Lookie, lookie here.

1795
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,562
Your blood's as red as mine,

1796
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,164
isn't it, Mayo?

1797
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:47,849
Come on, come on.

1798
01:53:47,921 --> 01:53:49,389
Get up!

1799
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:40,440
You can quit now if you want to.

1800
01:54:40,507 --> 01:54:42,499
It's up to you.

1801
01:55:13,673 --> 01:55:16,541
Sir, the officers are present.

1802
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:18,772
Guests, please rise.

1803
01:55:20,447 --> 01:55:21,938
Class 1581,

1804
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:25,952
raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

1805
01:55:26,019 --> 01:55:27,851
"I do solemnly swear...

1806
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,913
I do solemnly swear...

1807
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:31,618
that I will support and defend

1808
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:34,126
the Constitution of the
United States of America...

1809
01:55:34,194 --> 01:55:36,629
that I will support and defend

1810
01:55:36,696 --> 01:55:38,790
the Constitution of the
United States of America...

1811
01:55:38,865 --> 01:55:41,801
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

1812
01:55:41,868 --> 01:55:44,531
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

1813
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:47,039

1823
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:14,862
so help me God."

1824
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:16,961
so help me God.

1825
01:56:17,037 --> 01:56:18,596
Please be seated.

1826
01:56:20,707 --> 01:56:22,232
Gunnery Sergeant Foley.

1827
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:24,576
Sir!

1828
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:30,116
Well done, Sergeant.

1829
01:56:31,184 --> 01:56:32,709
Thank you, sir.

1830
01:56:45,899 --> 01:56:47,663
Class...

1831
01:56:47,734 --> 01:56:49,828
1-5-8-1...

1832
01:56:50,971 --> 01:56:51,971
Fall out!

1833
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:54,906
Aye, aye, sir!

1834
01:56:56,476 --> 01:56:59,139
Foley's Fire-eaters
finally finished!

1835
01:57:14,728 --> 01:57:17,129
Daddy! What did you think?

1836
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:19,757
Mayo, come and meet my family.

1837
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:23,827
No. I'm going to
get my first salute.

1838
01:57:35,181 --> 01:57:36,672
Congratulations,
Ensign Chadwick.

1839
01:57:45,292 --> 01:57:46,692
Congratulations, Ensign Seeger.

1840
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,854
Thank you, sir.

1841
01:57:48,929 --> 01:57:51,455
Gunnery Sergeant, Ensign Seeger.

1842
01:57:52,799 --> 01:57:54,961
Sir.

1843
01:58:05,645 --> 01:58:07,739
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo.

1844
01:58:11,718 --> 01:58:14,688
I won't ever forget
you, Sergeant.

1845
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:16,586
I know.

1846
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:19,751
I wouldn't have made
this if it weren't for you.

1847
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:23,354
Get the hell out of here.

1848
01:58:24,831 --> 01:58:26,356
Thank you, Sergeant.

1849
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:38,535
Congratulations,
Ensign Della Serra.

1850
01:58:40,013 --> 01:58:41,879
Thank you, Sergeant.

1851
01:58:55,528 --> 01:58:57,463
Every time I say, "Understand?"

1852
01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:00,398
the group will say, "Yes, sir!"

1853
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,901
Understand?

1854
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:03,402
Yes, sir!

1855
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:05,962
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

1856
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:07,905
Where you been all your lives?

1857
01:59:07,974 --> 01:59:09,909
Listening to punk rock

1858
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:12,741
and bad-mouthing
your country, I'll bet!

1859
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,644
Where you from, boy?

1860
01:59:14,714 --> 01:59:16,273
Tucson, Arizona, sir.

1861
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:17,749
Where?

1862
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:19,251
Tucson, Arizona, sir!

1863
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:22,289
Only two things
come out of Arizona...

1864
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:23,823
Steers and queers!

1865
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,324
Which one are you, boy?

1866
01:59:25,392 --> 01:59:26,826
I don't see no horns,

1867
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:28,384
so you must be queer!

1868
01:59:28,461 --> 01:59:29,326
No, sir!

1869
01:59:29,396 --> 01:59:30,396
What?

1870
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:31,556
No, sir!

1871
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:35,159
I will use every
means necessary,

1872
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:36,669
fair and unfair,

1873
01:59:36,736 --> 01:59:38,671
to trip you up!

1874
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,648
Turn it, Bunny.

1875
01:59:55,722 --> 01:59:58,123
No. Back the other way.

1876
01:59:58,191 --> 02:00:00,160
Keep going, keep going.

1877
02:01:08,228 --> 02:01:11,096
Way to go, Paula!

1878
02:01:11,164 --> 02:01:13,497
