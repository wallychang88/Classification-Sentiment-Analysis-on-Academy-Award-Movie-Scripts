1
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,730
"United 1523, did you hear your company...
Did you hear..."

2
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,420
"We were just answering your call."

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,090
"We did hear that yelling, too."

4
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,610
"We couldn't tell what it was either."

5
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,920
"United 93..."

6
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,880
"- Has he turned to the east now?
- Please state your emergency."

7
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,120
"The flight attendant is advising
our reps that the pilot and
everyone's been stabbed."

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
"And we can't breathe."

9
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,780
"I don't know.
I think we're getting hijacked."

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,540
"Hijacked aircraft headed towards New York."

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,620
"- Is this real world or exercise?
- No, this is not an exercise."

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,100
"Can anybody get up to the cockpit?"

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,400
"What's going on, Betty?"

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,940
"Betty, talk to me."

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,940
"A plane just crashed
into the World Trade Center."

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,570
"I think we might have lost her."

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,280
"Hey, Mom, I'm sure that you've heard..."

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,910
"...that a plane crashed into
World Trade Center One."

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,330
"We're fine.
We're in World Trade Center Two."

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,510
"I'm on a plane that's been hijacked."

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,080
"I hope to be able to see
your face again, baby."

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,460
"I love you. Bye."

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,250
"We got reports of another incoming plane."

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,050
"We may have to take
cover in the stairwell."

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,380
"Lieutenant Brown, Ladder 18.
One of the towers just collapsed."

26
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,970
"- Hello, ma'am?
- Help!"

27
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,010
"That tower just came down
on top of everybody!"

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,820
"Are they gonna be able
to get somebody up here?"

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,370
"Of course, ma'am. We're coming up to you."

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,270
"Well, there's no one here yet,
and the floor's completely engulfed."

31
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,100
"We're on the floor and we can't breathe."

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,440
"Hold on one second, please."

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,600
"I'm gonna die, aren't I?"

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,980
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,320
"- I'm gonna die.
- Ma'am..."

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,150
"I'm gonna die, I know it."

37
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,780
"Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm."

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,110
"Please, God."

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,570
"You're doing a good job, ma'am."

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,180
"You're doing a good job.
You're doing fine."

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,030
"It's so hot. I'm burning up."

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,450
"Ma'am, you are fine.
They're gonna come get you."

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,410
"Can anyone hear me?"

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,830
"Oh, my God."

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

46
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,730
I own you, Ammar.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
You belong to me.

48
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,570
Look at me.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,320
If you don't look at me when
I talk to you, I hurt you!

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,660
You step off this mat, I hurt you!

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,250
If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you!

52
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,250
Now, now look at me!

53
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,580
Look at me, Ammar!

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,760
Come on.

55
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,450
Nobody talks to him.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,910
Roger that.

57
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,950
Are we gonna board these windows
up or what?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,340
Just off the plane from Washington.

59
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,630
Rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation.

60
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,760
And you get this guy.

61
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,430
They're not always this intense.

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm fine.

63
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,440
Well, just so you know,
it's gonna take a while.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,150
He has to learn how helpless he is.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,900
Come on, let's get a coffee.

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,820
No, we should go back in.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,330
There's no shame if you want
to watch from the monitor.

68
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,920
All right.

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,880
Might want to put this on.

70
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,840
You're not wearing one.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,350
Is he ever getting out?

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,560
Never.

73
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,190
Let's go.

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,030
Right now,

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,370
all this is about, simply,

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,750
is you coming to terms
with your situation.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,710
It's you and me, bro.

78
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,760
I want you to understand that I know you,

79
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,720
that I've been studying and following you
for a very long time.

80
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,060
I could've had you killed in Karachi,

81
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,810
but I didn't, I let you live,
so that you and I could talk.

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,060
Then you beat me when my hands are tied.

83
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,520
So I won't talk to you.

84
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,570
Well, life isn't always fair, my friend.

85
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,610
Did you really think that when we got you,
I would be a nice fucking guy?

86
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,410
You're a mid-level guy.

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,620
You're a garbage man in the corporation!

88
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,620
Why should I respect you, huh?

89
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Why?

90
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,670
And you're a money man.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,250
Paperboy.

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,920
A disgrace to humanity.

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,220
You and your uncle murdered
3,000 innocent people.

94
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,260
Yeah.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,270
I have your name on a $5,000 transfer
via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker.

96
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,610
And you got popped with

97
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,990
150 kilograms of high explosives
in your house!

98
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,620
And then you dare question me?

99
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,020
Come on, man, I'm fucking with you.

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,710
I don't want to talk about 9/11 yet.

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,130
What I want to focus on
is the Saudi group.

102
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,190
That there is Hazem Al-Kashmiri.

103
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,150
And I know this dude is up to some
serious shit.

104
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,320
What I want from you is his Saudi e-mail.

105
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,610
Ammar, bro, I know that
you know this dude.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,570
Just give me his e-mail and
I will give you a blanket.

107
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,200
I will give you a blanket and
some solid food.

108
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,920
I know that you know him.

109
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,050
I told you before, I won't talk to you.

110
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,390
Have it your way. Let's go.

111
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,680
Come on.

112
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,190
When you lie to me,

113
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,650
I hurt you.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,130
Grab me the bucket.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,170
Come on, grab the bucket!

116
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,090
Put some water in it.

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,890
Come on, let's go!

118
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,980
Come on, give it to me.

119
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,980
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef.

120
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,150
You guys met in Iran, back in the '90s.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,070
I don't know!

122
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,490
Fuck you!

123
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,670
Give me the e-mails of the rest
of the Saudi group.

124
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,630
Give me one e-mail and I will stop this!

125
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,670
Who's in the Saudi group?

126
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
And what's the target?

127
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,930
Where was the last time you saw bin Laden?

128
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,260
Where was the last time you saw bin Laden,
huh?

129
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,270
You know, when you lie to me, I hurt you.

130
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,030
This is what defeat looks like, bro.

131
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,820
Your jihad is over.

132
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,870
Get him up.

133
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,010
Try to understand the concept here.

134
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,970
Okay, I have time, you don't.

135
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,600
I have other things to do, but you don't.

136
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,600
It's cool that you're strong.
I respect it, I do.

137
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,110
But in the end, everybody breaks, bro.

138
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,730
It's biology.

139
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,120
Can you open the trunk, ma'am?

140
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,870
It's clear.

141
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,340
How'd it go the other night?

142
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,430
It was good. I mean,
the local cops needed

143
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,720
...a little tactical help,
but he's Tier fucking One, baby.

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,070
That's your moneymaker right there.

145
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,410
And this is the guy that's
K.S.M.'s nephew?

146
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,470
- Yeah.
- What's his issue?

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
He's being a dick.

148
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,960
If he's trying to outsmart you,
why don't you tell him about your Ph.D.
"(Ph. D.: Philosophiæ doctor)"

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,750
Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to turn up
the heat on this asshole.

150
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,630
He needs to give up the Saudi group now.

151
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
He's got to have that,
given the family ties.

152
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,100
He's tight with his uncle, he's got
his prints all over the 9/11 money.

153
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,130
He's got them in his head,
he needs to disclose them.

154
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
All right.

155
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,280
Good.

156
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,620
Bill, she's good to go.

157
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,160
I'll get her the right one tomorrow.

158
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,870
Was I lying or what?

159
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,380
Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,
our illustrious station chief.

160
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,580
Joe and I did Iraq together.

161
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,630
It's nice to meet you.

162
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,840
You, too, sir.

163
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,430
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

164
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,530
And she's been having a great time
since she got in.

165
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,890
Isn't that right?

166
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,810
Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?

167
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,560
It's kind of fucked up.

168
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,890
You volunteered for this, didn't you?

169
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,100
No.

170
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,070
Third floor, northeast corner.

171
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,120
You don't think she's a little young
for the hard stuff?

172
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,750
Washington says she's a killer.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,170
Children's Crusade, huh?

174
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,150
They want to put the next generation
on the field.

175
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,130
Listen, I've got a meeting with ISI
in 20 minutes.

176
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,050
They're slow-rolling us in Lahore,
you might want to bitch about that.

177
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,070
My fellow Americans...

178
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Did I tell you this?

179
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,290
That this dude in Malaysia,
he tells the Malaysian station

180
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,870
that his nephew works with a guy
who knows a guy...

181
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,500
- Here we go.
- Hold on.

182
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,920
He goes to a big feast in Bangkok
about a year ago.

183
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,210
Guest of honor?

184
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,920
Usama bin Laden.

185
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,550
I said, "Was Tupac there, too?"

186
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,010
This is worth five million bucks.

187
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,930
You know we're gonna have to
chase it down.

188
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,600
Hey, that's me, man, no job too small.

189
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,480
That's why I have a gift for you,
my friend.

190
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,310
- Everyone, this is Maya.
- Hey.

191
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,390
Maya, everyone.
Please don't ask her how it's going

192
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,460
...with Ammar, 'cause she's not gonna
fucking tell you.

193
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,070
Ammar is withholding?

194
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,950
Washington assesses Abu Faraj
is officially our new number three.

195
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,570
He's the best man for it.

196
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,450
Yeah, the London station's already asking
if he's contacting anybody in the U.K.

197
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,350
- Like we're just keeping it from them?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,420
Jordanians are being really helpful
with Ammar's transit papers.

199
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,080
Any imminent threats in here?

200
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,460
They want a consulate, a Marriott,
it's low security.

201
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,340
And they've got Majid Kahn
talking about gas stations in the U.S.

202
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,590
And that's a conversation?

203
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,400
Honestly, there are 600 questions
in there.

204
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,100
I'd do Heathrow, the Saudis...

205
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,810
Does it matter what Faraj thinks about
Heathrow?

206
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,410
How much latitude does he get
to pick targets?

207
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,580
I think he'll give up the Saudis,

208
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,270
but Heathrow's gonna be tough.

209
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,730
Anyway, anything from last night?

210
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,530
Quetta base thinks they have
a bead on the Arabs that escaped.

211
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,850
They're meeting with ISI this afternoon,
hopefully set up...

212
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,700
- a raid down there.
- Great.

213
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,830
And Lahore reporting ISI was painfully
slow last night, again.

214
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,390
They're beginning to think it's not
incompetence.

215
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,660
I agree. I spoke to the chief about that.

216
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,170
- Yeah.
- Anything on bin Laden?

217
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,630
A farmer on the Afghan border
near Tora Bora reports

218
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,610
..."a diamond-shaped pattern in the hills,
tall male in the center of the diamond

219
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,380
..."flanked by four guards."
Consistent with UBL's movements.

220
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,940
That's supposed to be his royal guard?

221
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,590
No, that's pre-9/11 behavior.

222
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,680
We have no reason to believe
he's changed security tactics.

223
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,360
We invaded Afghanistan, that's a reason.

224
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,730
Hey, boss, I got a guy, for $5,000 bucks,

225
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,020
he can set up a taxi stand and
snoop around a bit.

226
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,570
No. Don't need him.
Sorry, the diamond sighting's bullshit.

227
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,650
See if the Paks will send someone
to talk to the farmer.

228
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,990
Anything else? No?

229
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,640
All right, let's put some runs on
the board against Faraj, okay?

230
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,540
Talk to the case officers who didn't see
fit to make it today and thank them.

231
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,330
Tora Bora?

232
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,920
Yeah. Good.

233
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,190
Come on. Here we go. Here we go.

234
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,320
Let's just...

235
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,240
Let's take it easy today, huh?

236
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,260
Hungry?

237
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,850
The food in here sucks,
so I got you some of this.

238
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,230
Good, huh?

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,160
Richard Reid.

240
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,460
Oh, man, I was thinking about him.

241
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,500
Guy gets a bomb in a shoe on a plane.
Un-fucking-believable.

242
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
You know him, don't you?

243
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,590
Yes.

244
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I'm glad you said that.

245
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,680
I got an e-mail from you to him.

246
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,350
I got all your coms for years, bro.

247
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,820
Who...

248
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,280
Who else is in your Saudi group?

249
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,160
I just handed out some cash for them.

250
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,410
I didn't know who the guys were.

251
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,170
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

252
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,460
Please.

253
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,810
I believe you.

254
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
I do, I believe you.

255
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,230
Good, huh?

256
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,620
Do you want the water again?

257
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,240
Or do you want something else?

258
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,170
Water?

259
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,340
Please.

260
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,880
Just give me a name.

261
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,420
I don't know.

262
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,430
I don't know! I don't know!

263
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,760
Come on, let's go.

264
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,230
Bring him up.

265
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,230
Here we go.

266
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,980
You see how this works?

267
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,910
You don't mind if my female colleague
there checks out your junk, do you?

268
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,990
No?

269
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,200
Good.

270
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,240
Dude, you shit your pants?

271
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,870
You stay here. I'll be back.

272
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,390
Your friend is an animal.

273
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,810
Please, help me.

274
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,100
Please.

275
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,110
You can help yourself by being truthful.

276
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,080
This is a dog collar.

277
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,210
- No!
- Come on.

278
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,380
No!

279
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,880
Come on. Come on.

280
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,680
There you go. There you go.

281
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,680
You determine how I treat you.

282
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,320
Come on. Come on.

283
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,320
I got you.

284
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,500
Come on.

285
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,830
You're my dog, I gotta walk you.

286
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,750
What the fuck do you think is going on,
Ammar?

287
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,260
Wahleed has already told me that you know.

288
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,340
Here we go. Come on, you're almost there.

289
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,970
There we go. There we go.

290
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,350
All right. This box here, this box sucks.

291
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,440
Now, I'm gonna put you in it.

292
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,660
When is the attack?

293
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,750
What? What?

294
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,710
Sunday.

295
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,000
Sunday where? No, whoa, whoa.
Sunday where?

296
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,420
Sunday? This Sunday or next Sunday?

297
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,090
Where? Where?

298
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,390
Monday.

299
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,720
What?

300
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,970
Tuesday.

301
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,430
Come on, Ammar, is it Sunday or Monday?

302
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,060
Partial information will be treated
as a lie.

303
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,900
- Come on, let's go.
- Thursday.

304
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,440
Come on, which day is it?

305
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,570
Partial information, you're gonna go
in the box!

306
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,910
Partial information is treated as a lie!

307
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,240
Let's go!

308
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,330
- Saturday!
- In the box you go.

309
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,660
In the box you go.

310
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,660
Saturday!

311
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,830
Come on.

312
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,750
Monday!

313
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,090
Tuesday!

314
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,550
- There we go.
- Friday!

315
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Come on, let's go, come on!

316
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,090
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

317
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Sunday.

318
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,140
Monday.

319
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,690
Thursday.

320
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,150
Ammar, which day is it?

321
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,360
Tuesday.

322
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,980
Which day?

323
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,700
Friday.

324
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,160
Ammar, which day?

325
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,910
Thursday.

326
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,630
Friday.

327
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,910
"A targeted attack against Westerners
and foreigners."

328
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,410
"When you look at the breakup
of casualties, you can see"

329
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,870
"...that non-Muslims were killed and
so were Americans."

330
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,790
Don't worry about the Saudis.
They'll take care of business.

331
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,210
Yeah, now.

332
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,630
You warned them,
they didn't take you seriously.

333
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,420
This is what happens. It's not on you.

334
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,090
Who said that, huh, Zeid?
Fuck him. This is on me.

335
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,300
- Ammar is on me. And it's on her.
- No, no, no, no.

336
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,760
You had what, days, brief custody,
unresponsive ally?

337
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,450
We cannot let this be a win-win for A.Q.

338
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,480
The way you do this is look ahead.

339
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,140
London, Heathrow, mass casualties.
That plan is still active.

340
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,110
Ammar doesn't have a clue about
what happened.

341
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,900
- He knows.
- How?

342
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,610
You have to be really careful with people
in K.S.M.'s circle, they're devious.

343
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,650
He's not gonna talk about attacks
on the homeland.

344
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,330
He's gonna withhold operational details on
the K.S.M. network and probably bin Laden.

345
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,250
But he's been in complete isolation.

346
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,450
He doesn't know we failed.
We could tell him anything.

347
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,460
What, bluff him?

348
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,040
He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless.

349
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,010
You don't remember, do you?

350
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,970
Well, short-term memory loss
is a side effect of sleep deprivation,

351
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,970
so it should come back to you.

352
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,390
I don't know.

353
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,610
How can I remember?

354
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,940
After we kept you awake for 96 hours,

355
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,740
you gave us the name of some
of your brothers,

356
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,160
and you helped save the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

357
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,490
Which is the smart thing to do.
You're starting to think for yourself.

358
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,200
Come on, eat up, man.

359
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,500
Some hummus. Tabouleh.
Don't know what that is.

360
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,040
Some figs. You earned it.

361
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,050
So, you flew via Amman to Kabul, yeah?

362
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,020
Hang out with your uncle. Mukhtar.

363
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,600
How did you know that?

364
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,100
Told you, man, I know you.

365
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,110
All right, you got me.
You did, you got me.

366
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,520
Flight manifests.

367
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,280
It must be pretty fucked up for you
guys after 9/11.

368
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,200
What'd you do after the invasion?
Before you went back to Pesh.

369
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,950
After 9/11, we had to choose,

370
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,960
fight to protect our turf, or run.

371
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,130
And you chose to fight, yeah?

372
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,920
We wanted to kill Americans.

373
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,220
Yeah.

374
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,760
We tried to get into Tora Bora,
but the bombing was too high.

375
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,390
We couldn't cross.

376
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,390
I'm sorry, who's the "we"
in that sentence?

377
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,940
Me and some other guys
who were hanging around at that time.

378
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,070
You know, I can always go and
eat with some other dude,

379
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,730
hang you back up to the ceiling.

380
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Hamza Rabia.

381
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,040
Khabab Al-Masri.

382
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
And Abu Ahmed.

383
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,510
Who's Abu Ahmed?
I've heard of the other guys.

384
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,100
He was a computer guy with us at the time.

385
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,690
After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh,
as you know.

386
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,440
And he went north, I think.

387
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,690
To Kunar.

388
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,320
What's his family name?

389
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,410
Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti.

390
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,200
Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed." It's a kunya.
"(kunya: teknonym in Arabic names, the name of
an adult derived from his or her eldest child.)"

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.

392
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,000
She got you there, dude.

393
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,550
I swear to you both, I don't know
his family name.

394
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,550
I would have never asked him
something like that.

395
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,630
It's not how my uncle worked.

396
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,260
I know.

397
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,890
My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden.

398
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,770
I did see him once. About a year ago,
in Karachi.

399
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,610
He read us all a letter from the Sheik.

400
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,240
A letter?

401
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,990
What'd it say?

402
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,410
Cigarette?

403
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:05,930
He said, "Continue the jihad.
The work will go on for a hundred years."

404
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,850
"You and I are gonna talk about some of
the guys in the training camps. Yeah?"

405
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,650
"Okay."

406
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,690
"Some of these brothers have done
some bad things."

407
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,410
"What I want to do is I want to separate
themfrom the people like you."

408
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,030
"Definitely, yeah."

409
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,540
"All right, a guy called Abu Ahmed
from Kuwait."

410
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,950
"Yes, I remember him."

411
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,250
"A nice guy."

412
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,710
"How close was he? What was his
relationship to the leadership?"

413
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,710
"- I don't know.
- Did he eat with you guys?"

414
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,900
"Did he eat with the good guys
or did he eat with the leadership?"

415
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,720
"I don't know, sir.
I have no idea about..."

416
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,050
"Yes, you do. You don't need
an idea about..."

417
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,970
"When you met Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,"

418
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,190
"was this one of the facilitators?"

419
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,940
"Is this Abu Ahmed?"

420
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,110
"Yes."

421
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,490
"K.S.M., your boss."

422
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,240
"I call him Mukhtar."

423
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,700
"Mukhtar. "Po-tay-to," you say "Po-tah-to."

424
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,330
"I say "fucking K.S.M.," you say "Mukhtar,"
okay?"

425
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,210
"After Mukhtar was captured,"

426
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,380
"what did Abu Ahmed do?"

427
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,710
"Abu Ahmed, I believe..."

428
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,380
"I believe he went to work for the Sheik."

429
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,760
"In Karachi in 2003, or 2004."

430
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,140
"He was carrying a letter from bin Laden?"

431
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,030
"Is that him?"

432
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,370
"- Is that him?
- Abu Ahmed."

433
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,040
"- Say it again?
- Abu Ahmed."

434
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,290
"Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed."

435
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,710
"Abu Ahmed."

436
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,090
"Who knows who works directly
for bin Laden."

437
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,260
"Let's say he's part of the mix."

438
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,230
"Were there other people
who carried messages from bin Laden?"

439
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
"Sure."

440
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,730
"How many other people?"

441
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,940
"Let's talk about them."

442
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,290
How's the needle in the haystack?

443
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,710
Fine.

444
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,090
Facilitators come and go.

445
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,640
One thing you can count on in life
is that everyone wants money.

446
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,600
You're assuming that Al-Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.

447
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,600
They're radicals.

448
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Correct.

449
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,860
You're assuming that greed won't
override ideology

450
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,770
...in some of the weaker members.

451
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,820
Money for walk-ins worked great
in the Cold War,

452
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,940
I'll give you that.

453
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,900
Thank you.

454
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,110
He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.

455
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,820
Who did he work for?

456
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,460
It was mostly with Abu Faraj.

457
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,300
They were always together.

458
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,300
What did he do for Faraj?

459
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,850
He carried messages from Faraj
to bin Laden

460
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,140
and from bin Laden back to Faraj.

461
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,410
We need to ask him something
to see if he's telling the truth.

462
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,270
We don't know if he really knew Faraj.

463
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,200
He just told me the names of
all of Abu Faraj's children.

464
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,250
I think he's telling the truth.

465
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,960
20 detainees recognize that photo
of Abu Ahmed.

466
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,650
They say he's part of an inner circle
of guys

467
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,630
...that was hanging out
in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

468
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,640
A lot of them say that after 9/11,
he went to work for K.S.M.

469
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,600
When K.S.M. was captured,
he went to work for Abu Faraj,

470
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,430
primarily as a courier from Faraj
to bin Laden.

471
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,930
Well, that's good, but you still...

472
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, but we don't know if Abu’s
on the outside of the network,

473
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,420
a series of cutouts and dead drops,

474
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,900
or if he has a direct connection
to bin Laden.

475
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,190
I mean, does bin Laden invite him
into the living room

476
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,950
...and hand him a letter directly or is Abu
just the last guy in a long line of couriers,

477
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,130
and that's why everybody knows him?

478
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,260
That's not all you don't know.

479
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,990
You don't have his real name,
you don't have a clue of where he is.

480
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,390
Yes, but we know that he's important.

481
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,100
The fact that everybody's heard
of Abu Ahmed,

482
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,670
but nobody will tell me where
he is suggests that.

483
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,540
Maybe.

484
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,940
Detainees could withhold his location
for any number of reasons.

485
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,000
Perhaps they don't know.

486
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,970
Perhaps this Abu is actually a cover story
and he's really a fucking unicorn.

487
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,430
But the withholding doesn't reveal
what you want it to, does it?

488
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,680
No.

489
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,810
And if you did find him, you don't know
that he'd be with bin Laden.

490
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,230
We don't know what we don't know.

491
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,870
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

492
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,080
It's a tautology.
"(Tautology: formula that is true
in every possible interpretation.)"

493
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,480
Listen, not one single detainee has said
that he's been located with the big guy,

494
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,250
just that he delivers messages,
am I wrong?

495
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,790
- No.
- No.

496
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,670
It's still good work.

497
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,340
Let me know when you get some
actionable intelligence.

498
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,380
Preferably something that leads
to a strike.

499
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,840
"This is what remains of the number 10 bus,"

500
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,300
"which was traveling through
Tavistock Square near Euston Station."

501
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,590
"There'd been explosions"

502
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,390
"...near Liverpool Street and
Edgware Road stations, too."

503
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,100
"Dozens of the survivors were
critically injured,"

504
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,730
"but many of the wounded were also keen
to share their stories."

505
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,730
"We'd just pulled out of Edgware Road."

506
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,990
"And next thing I know, there's a loud...
A large flash of light."

507
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,820
"Felt a burning sensation on my hands,
put my hands up to my face."

508
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,750
"I was on the floor by that point."

509
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,170
"Yeah, I can't recall anything prior to that,
any noise, any bang."

510
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,250
"Normal life in one of the busiest parts
of the capital has now been suspended,"

511
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,340
"as just a few yards down the road here
they continue to care for the injured."

512
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,310
"And all around, groups of Londoners are
standing on corners, asking themselves"

513
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,230
"...what has happened here
and who could possibly have done this."

514
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,070
Come on.

515
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,200
You, too. Come on.

516
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,170
You Agency guys are twisted.

517
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,760
Detainee's ready for you.

518
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,640
Come on.

519
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,790
I want you to understand that I know you.

520
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,380
I've been following you
and studying you for a long time.

521
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,050
I chased you in Lahore.

522
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,780
I had you picked up instead of killing you
because you're not a violent man

523
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,300
...and you don't deserve to die.

524
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,510
Thank you.

525
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,510
But you do have deep ties to Al-Qaeda

526
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,810
...I want to ask you about

527
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,690
...before you get sent to your
next location, which might be Israel.

528
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,060
However, depending on how candid
you are here today,

529
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,650
I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.

530
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,990
What do you want to know?

531
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions
based on your knowledge of Al-Qaeda

532
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,160
...and your position as key financier
for the organization.

533
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,330
I have dealt with the Mukhabarat.

534
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,620
I have no wish to be tortured again.

535
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,670
Ask me a question, I will answer it.

536
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,340
What can you tell me about
Atiyah Abd Al-Rahman?

537
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,760
He works for Zawahiri.

538
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,010
He's in charge of military tactics.

539
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,180
In what context have you ever
heard the name Abu Ahmed?

540
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,440
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.

541
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,230
He is his most trusted courier.

542
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,650
What makes you say that?

543
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,030
He brought me many messages
from the Sheik.

544
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,950
Where did you last see him and
where is he now?

545
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,960
You will never find him.

546
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,540
Why is that?

547
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,540
Even I couldn't find him.

548
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,710
He always contacted me out of the blue.

549
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,550
He is one of the disappeared ones.

550
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,520
You know how this works?

551
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,400
God willing, we won't have to use it.

552
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,210
Just act naturally.

553
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,870
You're in luck.
I got you a one-on-one with Faraj.

554
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,130
Seriously? Thank you!

555
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,420
Don't you thank me until you hear
what I want for it.

556
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,380
I want you to take care of all this
before your favorite subject.

557
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,880
Deal.

558
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,530
Don't you want to see what's
in the folder?

559
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,060
You want family ties, financial networks,
media sources, disgruntled employees,

560
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,770
imminent threats, homeland plots,

561
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,270
foreign sales, health status,
financial resources...

562
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Thank you!

563
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,360
Tradecraft, recruiting tactics.
Anything else?

564
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,650
No, I think that covers it.

565
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,110
Yeah.

566
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,030
"If what they say is true,"

567
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,290
"the Shaolin and the Wu Tang
could be dangerous."

568
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,460
"What do you like to be called?
Faraj? Farij?"

569
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,330
"Fuzzy? Come on."

570
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,670
"Hey, what do you like?
You like a bit of"

571
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,010
"...you guys like a bit of Bob Marley?
Bit of reggae?"

572
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,290
"Kick back, take it easy
after you've blown some shit up?"

573
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,340
"No?"

574
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,600
"You got some Libyan music you like?"

575
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,400
"You did the U.K. bombings, right?"

576
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,110
"You know, you're the second number three
I've captured."

577
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,070
"I got K.S.M."

578
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,580
Can I be honest with you?

579
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,290
I'm bad fucking news.

580
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,960
I'm not your friend.

581
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,130
I'm not gonna help you.

582
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,140
I'm gonna break you.

583
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,180
Any questions?

584
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,600
No?

585
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,440
All right, you haven't eaten in 18 hours.
We need to keep your energy up.

586
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,100
You hungry?

587
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,990
A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed
was bin Laden's courier

588
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,820
...and that he worked very closely
with you.

589
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,950
You are thinking of Abu Khalid.

590
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,080
Who?

591
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,250
Al-Baluchi.

592
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,830
My courier for the Sheik.

593
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,460
Okay.

594
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,760
So you're telling me all the other
brothers are wrong

595
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,050
...and there's some famous Baluchi guy

596
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,550
...working for you and bin Laden
that I've never even heard of.

597
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,470
Why should you have heard of him?

598
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,520
What does this Baluchi guy look like?

599
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,480
Tall. Long white beard.

600
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,940
Thin.

601
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,610
He uses a cane.

602
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,740
Kind of like Gandalf.

603
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,650
Who?

604
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,240
When was the last time you saw him?

605
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,290
A month ago. In Karachi.

606
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,290
But I don't know where he is now.

607
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,710
Sometimes, I wouldn't even see him.

608
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,840
He would just tell me where to leave
the messages.

609
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,510
You're not being fulsome in your replies.

610
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,810
You cannot force me to tell you something
I don't know.

611
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,600
You do realize this is not
a normal prison.

612
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,480
You determine how you're treated.

613
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,020
And your life is gonna be very uncomfortable
until you give me the information I need.

614
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,280
Where exactly is Abu Ahmed living
at the moment?

615
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,960
"Faraj is completely denying knowing
Abu Ahmed."

616
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,510
That's using every measure we have.

617
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,190
Well, he's either gonna
keep withholding

618
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,430
...or he's gonna die from the pressure
you're putting on him.

619
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,180
Hey, you want to take a run at him?

620
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,270
No.

621
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,810
- No?
- No.

622
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,440
Since when no?

623
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,730
You know, I was meaning to tell you,
I'm getting out of here.

624
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,610
You okay?

625
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,280
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...

626
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,780
You know, I think I've seen too many
guys naked.

627
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,680
It's got to be over a fucking hundred
at this point.

628
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,620
I need to go and do something
normal for a while.

629
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,210
Like what?

630
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,540
Go to Washington.

631
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,390
Do the dance, see how that
environment works.

632
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,130
You should come with me.

633
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,300
Yeah, be my number two. You're looking
a little strung out yourself.

634
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,270
I'm not gonna find Abu Ahmed from D.C.

635
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,820
They killed my monkeys.

636
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,320
Some bullshit about escaping.
You fucking believe that?

637
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,830
- Sorry, Dan.
- Yeah, I know.

638
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,160
Look, Maya, you got to be real
careful with the detainees now.

639
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,620
Okay? Politics are changing,

640
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,140
and you don't want to be the last one

641
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,670
...holding a dog collar
when the oversight committee comes.

642
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,050
- I know.
- Yeah?

643
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,180
And watch your back when
you get back to Pakistan.

644
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
Everyone knows you there now.

645
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,150
Sorry.

646
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,980
Fucking checkpoints.

647
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,240
- Maya?
- Yeah?

648
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,780
We're socializing. Be social.

649
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,160
Okay.

650
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,210
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
but it is time to cut the umbilical cord.

651
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,500
No, it's not.

652
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,590
So Faraj went south on you, it happens.

653
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,010
There are still cells in London and Spain
who are planning the next round of attacks.

654
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,680
I can work on it at the same time.

655
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,680
- Plus, I think it's a good thing he lied.
- No.

656
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,770
Not at the expense of protecting
the homeland, you can't...

657
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,650
Wait a minute, why is it a good thing?

658
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,400
You sound just like Bradley,
he doesn't believe in my lead, either.

659
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,780
It's a good thing because the fact that

660
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,660
...Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed
 is very revealing.

661
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,870
The only other thing Faraj lied about
was the location of bin Laden himself.

662
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:03,290
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed is just
as important to protect as bin Laden.

663
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,420
That confirms my lead.

664
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,130
Or it's confirmation bias.

665
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,890
We're just worried about you, okay?

666
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,350
Is that okay to say?

667
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,020
I mean, look how run-down you are.

668
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,820
Where's Jack?

669
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,740
Probably stuck in some
checkpoint somewhere.

670
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,240
You two hooked up yet?

671
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,910
Hello, I work with him.
I'm not that girl that fucks.

672
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,410
It's unbecoming.

673
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,330
So? Little fooling around
wouldn't hurt you.

674
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,920
So no boyfriend.

675
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,420
You got any friends at all?

676
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,890
It's Jack.

677
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,930
Hey.

678
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,980
That's okay.

679
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,520
He's stuck in traffic.

680
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:29,630
Come on!

681
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,220
There's an exit!

682
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,980
Oh, no! Shit.

683
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,110
Come on, over here!

684
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,290
"The blast left a crater 10 meters,
or 30 feet wide, in front of the hotel."

685
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,960
"Police tell CNN the driver
of the truck bomb"

686
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,630
"...tried to talk his way past
the hotel's steel security gate."

687
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,010
"When armed guards said no,
police said the driver"

688
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,220
"...detonated more than 2,000 pounds
of explosives."

689
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,770
"The Marriott, one of the most
popular destinations for locals"

690
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,850
"...and Westerners in Islamabad,
now destroyed."

691
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,720
The Jords have a mole!

692
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,510
What?

693
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,430
He made this video to prove
his bona fides.

694
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,600
Shut up!

695
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,730
Humam Khalil Al-Balawi.

696
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,560
He's a Jordanian doctor.

697
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,650
He's right there in the inner circle.

698
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,530
I don't buy it.

699
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,590
Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns
on Al-Qaeda?

700
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,510
The Jords have worked him for a year,
dinners, money.

701
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,620
They convinced him it's his patriotic duty
to turn on Al-Qaeda and get rich doing it.

702
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,290
Yeah, well, so the Jords say.

703
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,500
Yeah, you're right.

704
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,290
We can't rely on this or the Jords.

705
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,330
We've got to evaluate him face-to-face.

706
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,150
He may not be that smart.
He may be full of shit.

707
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,250
But we have to talk to him and find out.

708
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,840
The key is to meet him, so we can figure
out for ourselves what he can actually do.

709
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,480
He really asked for a dialysis machine?

710
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,150
Maybe we can fill the damn thing
with poison.

711
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,070
The meeting with Balawi's off.

712
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,370
He can't come to Islamabad.

713
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,120
Can't or won't?

714
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,870
He's not gonna travel.

715
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,210
Security risk.

716
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,590
"I've said repeatedly that America
doesn't torture."

717
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,230
"And I'm gonna make sure that
we don't torture."

718
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,630
"Those are part and parcel of an effort"

719
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,810
"...to regain America's moral stature
in the world."

720
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,830
"Can you give us some sense of
when you might start..."

721
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:32,060
He wants us to go to him.

722
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:36,150
He'll meet us in Miranshah
with the Tribals.

723
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,610
He knows we're white.
We'd get kidnapped there.

724
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,240
Maybe do it somewhere else.

725
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,780
Germany or the U.K.?
He's got a clean passport.

726
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,830
He's not gonna travel out
of Al-Qaeda territory.

727
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,160
And you're not going to him.

728
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,490
I'm not, believe me.

729
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,210
We're stuck.

730
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,500
What about Camp Chapman?

731
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,840
Afghanistan.

732
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,670
That could be safe territory.

733
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,440
"This may be going overboard,
but I baked him a cake."

734
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,650
"Muslims don't celebrate with cake."

735
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,280
Don't be so literal, everyone likes cake.

736
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,190
"It's not too late for you to come,
you know. It'll be fun."

737
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,700
No, I don't want to be a straphanger.

738
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,410
It's your show, you were the first
to see the potential in this.

739
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,080
"Come on!"

740
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,250
"We've got lots of wine."

741
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,120
Cool. Bring me back a bottle.

742
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,080
"I will do."

743
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:44,300
Not to get technical, but this guy is actually
the first big break we've had since 9/11.

744
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,300
To big breaks and the little people
that make them happen.

745
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,230
So far, everything he's said we've
cross-checked, and it's proved legit.

746
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,520
And I think the money is persuasive.

747
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,150
$25 million?

748
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,650
That buys a new life.

749
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,490
Do you think he might be
exaggerating his access?

750
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,240
Possibly.

751
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,580
But Al-Qaeda needs doctors,
and they are short-staffed,

752
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,170
and that could explain his rise.

753
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,760
In six months to a year,
if he doesn't fuck up,

754
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,180
he could be called in to treat bin Laden.

755
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,800
At that moment, with 25 million
on the table,

756
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:35,020
I think he gives up the big man.

757
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,980
And if he doesn't, we kill him.

758
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,030
- John?
- Yeah.

759
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,910
When he arrives, let me set the tone,

760
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,250
and then I'll flip it to you
and you can talk about asset protection.

761
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,330
Roger that.

762
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,330
Lauren.

763
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,790
I know you want to get some
questions in there,

764
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,050
but give Balawi a little time
after John speaks.

765
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,050
We'll cover the basics,
have his birthday cake,

766
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,550
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty.

767
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,470
Is that order okay?
Or do you want to introduce everyone?

768
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,230
I'll introduce you, you introduce your team.
He knows this is a high-level meeting.

769
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,810
Quick question.

770
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,360
All this taking place inside
our main building?

771
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,270
Right. And, Lauren,

772
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,400
Washington will want real-time updates,
so please stay on top of that.

773
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,610
Be concise.

774
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,950
The director's in the loop.

775
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,250
And I wouldn't be surprised
if he doesn't update the President.

776
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,790
Yeah, I'm on it.

777
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,540
Now, I just got to get his ass down here.

778
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,480
Why are there gate guards there?
We talked about this.

779
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,460
No one is supposed to be there
when my source arrives.

780
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,760
You might have spooked him already.

781
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,280
Well, procedures only work

782
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,410
- ...if we follow them every time.
- This is different!

783
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,120
I'm sorry I can't explain,
but it's for a good cause.

784
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,830
Look, I'm responsible for
everybody's safety, okay?

785
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,040
It's not just about you.

786
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,830
I just need them to go away for a minute.

787
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,920
You can search him as soon
as he gets here.

788
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,880
All stations, this is Whiplash.

789
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,010
"Go ahead and stand down."

790
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,600
Copy that.

791
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,620
Thank you.

792
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,000
"Okay, he's coming."

793
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,790
We're gonna search him when he gets here.

794
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,340
"Sure."

795
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,580
Okay, let's go!

796
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,230
Is he supposed to limp like that?

797
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,900
Get your hand out of your pocket.

798
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,190
Hey.

799
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,880
- Hey!
- Get your hand out of your pocket!

800
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,900
- Hey!
- Do it now!

801
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,030
- Come on.
- Do it now!

802
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,140
"The CIA says seven of its employees"

803
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,430
"...were killed and six others wounded
in a suicide bombing"

804
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,220
"...at a base in Afghanistan."

805
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,230
"It was one of the deadliest
attacks in CIA history."

806
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,150
"The Associated Press has learned
that the chief"

807
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,900
"...of the CIA's post in the province
is among the victims."

808
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,570
"Former officials say
she was the mother of three children."

809
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,650
"The Taliban claim responsibility
for the bombing..."

810
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,620
You okay?

811
01:01:56,170 --> 01:02:00,380
I didn't think this day
could get any worse,

812
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,880
but... bad news from Saudi intelligence.

813
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,640
The courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.

814
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,600
It's a detainee video.

815
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,670
"He's dead."

816
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,670
"In Afghanistan. 2001."

817
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,420
"I buried him with my own hands."

818
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,880
"He's dead."

819
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,090
"In Afghanistan. 2001."

820
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,800
No.

821
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,430
"Where was this?"

822
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,260
"Kabul."

823
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:56,100
No, I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

824
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,100
Sorry, Maya.

825
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,900
I always liked this lead.

826
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,190
Fuck.

827
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,180
Sorry, I just got here.

828
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,600
What are you gonna do?

829
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,610
I'm gonna smoke everybody
involved in this op

830
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,870
...and then I'm gonna kill bin Laden.

831
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:08,710
Right.

832
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,910
I want to make something absolutely clear.

833
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:41,000
If you thought there was some secret cell
somewhere, working Al-Qaeda,

834
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,250
then I want you to know that you're wrong.

835
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,710
This is it.

836
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,720
There's no working group
coming to the rescue.

837
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,890
There's nobody else hidden away
on some other floor.

838
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,970
There is just us.

839
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,430
And we are failing.

840
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,650
We're spending billions of dollars.

841
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,070
People are dying!

842
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,740
We are still no closer to defeating
our enemy.

843
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,580
They attacked us!

844
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,750
On land, in '98.

845
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,410
By sea, in 2000.

846
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,580
And from the air, in 2001.

847
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:33,130
They murdered 3,000 of our citizens
in cold blood.

848
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,470
And they have slaughtered
our forward deployed!

849
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,930
And what the fuck have we done
about it, huh?

850
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,520
What have we done?

851
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:50,940
We have 20 leadership names,
we've only eliminated four of them!

852
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,070
I want targets.

853
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,540
Do your fucking jobs.
Bring me people to kill.

854
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,900
Hi. I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found this.

855
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,650
It's him.

856
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:39,320
He was one of 10 names on a watch list
sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.

857
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,780
Ibrahim Sayeed.

858
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,280
They told us to watch out for him.

859
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:45,660
Apparently, they think his whole family
and extended family is bad

860
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,710
...and has ties to K.S.M.

861
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,830
He was picked up for fake papers
and a doctored exit visa

862
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,690
...leaving Afghanistan, traveling
through Morocco

863
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,960
...en route to Kuwait.

864
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,760
Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti.

865
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
This must be Abu Ahmed.

866
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,100
Doesn't matter, but I wish I had
that five years ago.

867
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,690
How come I never saw it before?

868
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,940
Nobody saw it, most likely.

869
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,740
There was a lot of white noise after 9/11,
countries wanting to help out.

870
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:21,950
We got a million tips, and you know,
things got lost in the shuffle.

871
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,120
Human error.

872
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,370
Anyway, I thought you should know
about it.

873
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,050
I just want to say, I've heard a lot
about you.

874
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,640
You inspired me to come to Pakistan.

875
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,640
Maybe you'd let me buy you
a kebab sometime.

876
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,810
Don't eat out.

877
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,350
It's too dangerous.

878
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,330
Yeah?

879
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,080
Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.

880
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,750
Really?

881
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:16,090
Yeah. He's been in the files this
whole time. The family's named Sayeed.

882
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,760
Okay, but he's dead,

883
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,940
so doesn't that make him
a little less interesting to you?

884
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,130
"He may not be."

885
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,680
"We now know Abu Ahmed is one
of seven brothers."

886
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,930
All the brothers in the family look alike.
Three of them went to Afghanistan.

887
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,770
"Isn't it possible that when
the three eldest brothers"

888
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,480
"...grew beards in Afghanistan,
they started to look alike?"

889
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,820
I think the one calling himself
Abu Ahmed is still alive.

890
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,530
The picture we've been using is wrong.

891
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:43,360
It's of his older brother, Habeeb.
He's the one that's dead.

892
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,680
Okay, and what are you basing this on?

893
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,620
"We have no intercepts about
Abu Ahmed dying,"

894
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,080
we just have a detainee who
said he buried a guy

895
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,370
...who looked like Abu Ahmed.

896
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,960
But if someone as important
as Abu Ahmed had died,

897
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,590
they'd be talking about it online

898
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,250
"...in chat rooms all over the place."

899
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,630
"Plus, the detainee said that
Habeeb died in 2001."

900
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,760
We know Abu Ahmed was alive then,
trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.

901
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,560
That means it's probably
one of the other brothers

902
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,310
"...that's dead."

903
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,540
In other words, you want it to be true.

904
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,520
Yes, I fucking want it to be true!

905
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,650
Calm down.

906
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,490
I am calm.

907
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,320
State your request.

908
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,870
Move heaven and earth,

909
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,410
and bring me this fucking
Sayeed family's phone number.

910
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,290
"Okay, I'll go and talk to the Wolf."

911
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,780
I need a couple hundred thousand bucks.

912
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,750
Four max.

913
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,880
Where you gonna get that?

914
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,590
From you.

915
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,300
- You think so?
- Yeah.

916
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,610
This could crack open the facilitator

917
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,220
...Maya's been looking for by giving us
a phone number.

918
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,180
She's your killer, Wolf.
You put her in the field.

919
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,470
Come on.

920
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:39,020
"Allah rewards those that strive and
fight over those that sit behind a desk."

921
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:47,240
As you know, Abu Ghraib and
Gitmo fucked us.
"(Gitmo: Naval Station Guantanamo Bay)"

922
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,830
The detainee program is now flypaper.
We got senators jumping out of our asses.

923
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,830
And the director is very concerned.

924
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,040
They will not stop until they have a body.

925
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,630
I ran it.

926
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,380
I'll defend it.

927
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,840
Done.

928
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:35,040
I tell you what, man, it's good to be
back in Kuwait.

929
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,200
And it's good to see you again.

930
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,710
It's been a while.

931
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,710
I need a favor.

932
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,930
Why I should help you?

933
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,340
Because we're friends.

934
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,180
You saying we are friend.

935
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,930
How come you only call me when
you need help?

936
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:01,020
But when I need something,
you are too busy to pick up the phone.

937
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,150
I don't think we are friend.

938
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,650
All right, fair enough.

939
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:08,530
How about a V10 Lamborghini?

940
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,530
How's that for friendship?

941
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,320
Poor fucker had to get out of bed.

942
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,290
Hey.

943
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,670
- Thank you very much for this. Appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

944
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,210
All right.

945
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,260
- Is this a Balboni?
- Yeah.

946
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,760
Fuck me dead.

947
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,100
That's nice.

948
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,520
Really nice. What are you thinking?

949
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,480
Maybe a convertible?
Get a bit of wind in the hair?

950
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:46,940
Put the top down?

951
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,450
I think I will choose this one.

952
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,910
Give us a minute? Thank you.

953
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,830
That's a nice choice, my friend.

954
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:59,700
Speed yellow. Go big or go home, huh?

955
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,290
Nice choice.

956
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,670
Sayeed?

957
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,380
Who is it?

958
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,220
Who do you think? Guy's a terrorist.

959
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,350
His mother lives here.

960
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,020
I just need her phone number.

961
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,810
There will be no repercussions in Kuwait?

962
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,190
Somebody might die, at some point,
in Pakistan.

963
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,990
We got a deal?

964
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,780
Hey, Jack.

965
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,580
Sayeed family call in progress,
but you're not gonna like this.

966
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:25,000
"The Ground Branch guys are dragging
their heels."

967
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,330
- "There's no team deployed right now."
- Fuck.

968
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,940
"He hasn't said anything incriminating,"

969
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,170
"but he's at the Rawal Call Center
in Rawalpindi."

970
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,550
Hey!

971
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,550
Why haven't you deployed a team
to stay in Rawalpindi?

972
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,220
For one thing, it's dangerous.

973
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,520
For another, the area is too
congested for us

974
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,940
...to be effective without some
predictive intelligence.

975
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,900
Yeah, but that's why you should
forward deploy,

976
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,210
so you can shorten your response time.

977
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,360
Still, it wouldn't work.

978
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,480
Why?

979
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,970
The guy never stays on the phone
long enough.

980
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,700
You haven't tried.

981
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,450
Look, I don't have the personnel.

982
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,620
That's bullshit, man.

983
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,120
Yeah? As it is, my guys don't get any sleep
tracking the threats within Pakistan.

984
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
Right, I understand.

985
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,840
But, you know, I don't really care
if your guys get sleep or not!

986
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:37,280
This guy you're obsessed with,
what's his name again?

987
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,990
Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti's the war-name.

988
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,870
His true name, we think,
is Ibrahim Sayeed.

989
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,660
Family lives in Kuwait.

990
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,790
We've been listening in on their calls.

991
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:51,210
Wasn't it, like, eight brothers

992
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,880
...and a million cousins,
that we know about?

993
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,630
Anyone could be calling home.

994
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,990
- I know.
- I mean, it's not like

995
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:00,130
...he's saying, "Hey, Mom,
it's me, the terrorist."

996
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,600
Yeah, I know.

997
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,060
But, look, over the course of two months,

998
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,860
he's called from six different pay phones,
from two different cities,

999
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,560
never using the same phone twice.

1000
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,230
And when his mother asked him
where he was, he lied.

1001
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,610
He said that he was in a place
in the country

1002
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,070
...with bad cell reception,
implying he was in the Tribals,

1003
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,740
when in fact, he was in a market
in Peshawar.

1004
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:24,320
I'm sorry, but that's not normal
guy behavior, that's tradecraft.

1005
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,700
Well, maybe he just doesn't like his mom.

1006
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:38,590
Look, if he talks about an operation
or refers to anything remotely fishy,

1007
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:40,130
I'll get on him, okay?

1008
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,420
No, no. Not okay.

1009
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,590
Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart

1010
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,470
...to tip his hand by talking about ops
on the phone.

1011
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,850
He works for bin Laden.

1012
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,690
The guys that talk about ops
on the phone don't get that job.

1013
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,990
A lot of my friends have died trying
to do this.

1014
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,700
I believe I was spared so
I could finish the job.

1015
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:13,140
<i>It is in surveillance video and
pictures like this"

1016
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,100
"...of the explosive-laden vehicle
just moments before it was parked"

1017
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,020
"...that police hope to find the man
who wanted so badly last night"

1018
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,360
"...to leave a body count
in Times Square."

1019
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,280
"There are some people around the world
that find our freedom so threatening"

1020
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,160
"...that they're willing to kill
themselves and others"

1021
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,600
"...to prevent us from enjoying it,
but we're not gonna let that..."

1022
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,930
I really need to talk to you about beefing up
our surveillance operation on the caller.

1023
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,120
We don't have a surveillance operation
on the caller.

1024
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,210
Someone just tried to blow up
Times Square,

1025
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,110
and you're talking to me about
some facilitator

1026
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,300
...who some detainee seven years ago said
might have been working with Al-Qaeda?

1027
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,680
He's the key to bin Laden.

1028
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,850
I don't fucking care about bin Laden.

1029
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:55,020
I care about the next attack.

1030
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,810
You're gonna start working
on the American Al-Qaeda cells.

1031
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,150
Protect the homeland.

1032
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,940
Bin Laden is the one who keeps telling
them to attack the homeland!

1033
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,280
If it wasn't for him,

1034
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,860
Al-Qaeda would still be focused
on overseas targets.

1035
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:10,700
If you really want to protect the homeland,
you need to get bin Laden.

1036
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,080
This guy never met bin Laden!

1037
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,580
This guy's a freelancer working off
the fucking Internet.

1038
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,080
No one's even talked to bin Laden
in four years.

1039
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,460
He's out of the game.

1040
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:23,000
He may well even be dead.
He might as well be fucking dead.

1041
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,670
But you know what you're doing?
You're chasing a ghost

1042
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,650
...while the whole fucking network grows
all around you!

1043
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,510
You just want me to nail
some low-level Mullah-crack-a-dulla,

1044
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,600
so you can check that box
on your resume that says

1045
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,470
...while you were in Pakistan,
you got a real terrorist!

1046
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,850
But the truth is, you don't understand
Pakistan!

1047
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,150
And you don't know Al-Qaeda!

1048
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:43,900
Either give me the team I need
to follow this lead,

1049
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,110
or the other thing you're gonna have
on your resume

1050
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,700
...is being the first station chief to be
called before a Congressional committee

1051
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,080
...for subverting the efforts
to capture or kill bin Laden!

1052
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,580
You're fucking out of your mind.

1053
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,630
I need four techs in a safe house
in Rawalpindi,

1054
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:08,550
four techs in a safe house in Peshawar.

1055
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:10,970
Either send them out,
or send me back to D.C.

1056
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,640
...and explain to the director
why you did it.

1057
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,410
I've been looking for you.

1058
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,290
More importantly, he's been
looking for you.

1059
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,750
Yesterday, your caller bought himself
a cell phone.

1060
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,250
And every time his phone rings,
this phone will ring.

1061
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:50,050
Did I hook you up?

1062
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,380
- Did I?
- Oh, my God!

1063
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,300
I love you!

1064
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,900
"My guess is that he lives close to
where he's making the calls."

1065
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,230
"And it makes sense he'd be living
in Rawalpindi,"

1066
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,570
"because there's an Al Jazeera
office there."

1067
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,200
It'd be convenient for him
to drop the tapes off

1068
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:17,780
...if he's messengering either from
bin Laden or through an intermediary.

1069
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:22,710
So when he wants to make a call,
he leaves the house, walks a few blocks,

1070
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,710
"then switches on the phone."

1071
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:28,290
"We need to keep canvassing
the neighborhood until we find him."

1072
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:43,730
We got a shooter.

1073
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,980
We're blocked.

1074
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,830
Let me talk to them.

1075
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,780
They said white faces don't belong here.

1076
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,080
If they don't move, shoot them.

1077
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,730
He still on?

1078
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,940
He's east of us. Try the market.

1079
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,150
Okay, heading east.

1080
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,460
Fuck.

1081
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:08,000
"We got a signal on Tipu Road
for 10 minutes."

1082
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,670
"Then he went to Umar Road
for five minutes."

1083
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,710
"Nogaza Road."

1084
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,670
"Darya Abad, that's in the Umar Road area."

1085
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:19,050
"In Rawalpindi, Haider Road."

1086
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,300
"Roomi Road."

1087
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,530
"He went to the Convoy Road,
which is near the hospital."

1088
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:26,140
"All right? So that's Haider,"

1089
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:31,390
"Roomi Road, Said, Nogaza, Taimur."

1090
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,270
"He made a call from Haifa Street."

1091
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,980
That's the spice district.

1092
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,440
Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh,
30 minutes.

1093
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:41,820
"Wazir Bagh Road, five."

1094
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,120
"Nishter Abad, five."

1095
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,500
"Phandu Road, five minutes."

1096
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:56,250
"The Grand Trunk Road, 45 seconds."

1097
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,510
"There's no pattern. Sometimes he calls
every two weeks, sometimes every three."

1098
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,630
"There's no consistency."

1099
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:07,100
"I can't predict when he's gonna make
another call 'cause the guy's erratic."

1100
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,570
"Right there! Back up!"

1101
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,160
"Meanwhile, our chief foreign
correspondent Richard Engel confirms"

1102
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,460
"...the CIA's top spy in Pakistan
has been pulled out of there."

1103
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,710
"He's been receiving death threats
after being named"

1104
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:24,130
"...publicly in a lawsuit by the family
of a victim of a U.S. drone attack."

1105
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,970
"Richard Engel quotes a senior
intelligence official"

1106
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,890
"...as saying the officer is returning
to the U.S."

1107
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:34,230
"...after the decision was made the terrorist
threats against him, in Pakistan,"

1108
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:37,770
"were of such a serious nature,
it would not be smart not to act."

1109
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,320
ISI fucked you.

1110
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,780
I'm so sorry, Joseph.

1111
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,900
Still on tower three.

1112
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,520
Five.

1113
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,070
Signal getting stronger.

1114
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:25,780
Ten. Fifteen.

1115
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,070
"Keep going."

1116
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,360
"Twenty. Fifteen. Ten."

1117
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:31,530
"Signal's getting weaker."

1118
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,330
We lost him. No signal.

1119
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,210
Heading south.

1120
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,430
He's up at five again.

1121
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:54,600
Fifteen. Twenty.

1122
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,930
He's moving fast.

1123
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,430
He's in a vehicle.

1124
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,020
Weaker now. He's shifted.

1125
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,730
We're back to five.

1126
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:03,480
He's close by here somewhere.

1127
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:05,820
I don't get it.

1128
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:10,200
He's driving in circles.

1129
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:21,710
- No change?
- No.

1130
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,680
Now let's hope he comes back around.

1131
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,920
Okay.

1132
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,170
Fifteen.

1133
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,710
Twenty.

1134
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,130
Thirty.

1135
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,130
Forty.

1136
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,390
Fifty.

1137
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,720
We're within 10 meters of him.

1138
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,480
Back to 40.

1139
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:27,770
He's here somewhere.

1140
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:30,610
Look at the cars. Look at the cars.
He's in a vehicle.

1141
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,680
The guy with the phone in the white car.

1142
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,620
You see him?

1143
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,540
Is that him?

1144
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,540
- Could be.
- You got him?

1145
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,290
- Got him.
- Okay, I'm breaking off.

1146
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,220
The guy you've been looking for,
geolocated, on his cell phone

1147
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,680
...in his white car.

1148
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,970
Thank you so much.

1149
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,730
If you're right,

1150
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,650
the whole world's gonna want in on this.

1151
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,400
So you got to stick to your guns now.

1152
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:21,740
Okay. No, it's great to speak to you, too.
I'm amazed that you're still here.

1153
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:24,870
No, I can do...

1154
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,790
Let me have a look.

1155
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,000
Why don't we say 1:30.

1156
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,880
Yeah.

1157
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,340
Can you just hold the line, please?

1158
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,970
I need a picket line along
the GT highway

1159
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:40,600
...and men spaced at intervals
along the road and at every exit.

1160
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,430
Maya, I know.

1161
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,680
So you agree with me now,
this is important.

1162
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:48,270
No, I've just learned from
my predecessor

1163
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,360
...that life is better when
I don't disagree with you.

1164
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,110
"Our current hypothesis is that he lives"

1165
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,410
"...somewhere along the highway,
in one of the towns,"

1166
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:43,030
"or a medium-sized city called Abbottabad,
or up near Kashmir."

1167
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,750
"Kashmir's interesting because
it's a way station for the Tribals."

1168
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,440
"Abbottabad is interesting
because we know"

1169
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:55,750
"...from detainee reporting that
Abu Faraj stayed there briefly in 2003."

1170
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,180
"The good news is he's driving
a white SUV."

1171
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,600
"SUVs are actually pretty rare
in Pakistan."

1172
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,980
"If he was driving a sedan or a compact,
we'd be fucked."

1173
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,640
"Obviously, this assumes he doesn't
change vehicles."

1174
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,120
Good morning.

1175
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,370
Good morning, Amad.

1176
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,440
"Any American in Pakistan is a target."

1177
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,020
They don't necessarily know I'm CIA.

1178
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,820
Doesn't matter.

1179
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,570
You're on a list.

1180
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,110
Yeah.

1181
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:46,950
And you of all people should know that
once you're on their list, you never get off.

1182
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,370
Next time, there may not be
bulletproof glass to save you.

1183
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:57,000
We'll keep up on the surveillance
as best we can.

1184
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:34,780
"The high-res version.
Can you get closer than that?"

1185
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,310
"Yeah, we can up-res this image."

1186
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,100
"- Even more?
- Yeah, do that."

1187
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,160
"- Make a PDF, e-mail it to me, cc George.
- Okay, that's good."

1188
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,940
"- Thank you very much.
- Thank you."

1189
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:46,250
"I'll take that. Thank you very much."

1190
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,280
- Take that to her.
- You got it.

1191
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,800
"You could clean that audio as well.
Just take the low end out."

1192
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:07,340
Hey.

1193
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:11,180
All right. So tell me how
I'm doing so far.

1194
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,140
Basically, we got a guy who
rolled with Al-Qaeda

1195
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,390
...and did services for him.

1196
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:15,810
We lost him for seven years.

1197
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:19,520
Now we find him again, and, boy,
does he have a really nice house.

1198
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,690
Is that it?

1199
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:22,400
Pretty much.

1200
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,190
All right, let's go talk to the boss.

1201
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,530
You should sit back there.

1202
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,370
- Sorry.
- No.

1203
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:43,960
So, they're gonna ask if bin Laden
is at the end of this rainbow,

1204
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,130
is the Pak military with him?

1205
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,630
The question isn't,
"Are the Paks protecting bin Laden?"

1206
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,890
The question is, "Would he allow himself
to be protected by the Paks?"

1207
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:55,600
I mean, why would he trust them?
He tried to kill Musharraf.

1208
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:05,900
- Hello.
- Sir.

1209
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:09,900
All right, go ahead.

1210
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,990
So, a little context here.
If you take a right out of Islamabad,

1211
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:17,080
drive about 45 minutes north,
you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad.

1212
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,830
Now, it's a mostly middle-class community,
some ex-military.

1213
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,500
Not particularly interesting to us.

1214
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:25,830
Except we did find this compound,
which is unique.

1215
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:29,670
We've got a 16-foot wall around
the entire perimeter.

1216
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,170
The windows are blacked out.

1217
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,220
There's even a seven-foot privacy wall here,
so even if we got up high,

1218
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,720
we couldn't get a vantage point.

1219
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,220
I mean, it's a fortress.

1220
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:41,560
Well, can't you put a camera somewhere?

1221
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,270
In these trees here, maybe?

1222
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:44,940
Get a look into the main house?

1223
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,060
It'd probably be discovered.

1224
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,150
Well, we have to get a look
into the house, don't we?

1225
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,910
All right.

1226
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:01,790
What's this, this cluster of buildings
down here?

1227
01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:03,960
The PMA. It's the
Pakistani Military Academy.

1228
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,920
It's their West Point.

1229
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,470
And how close is that to the house?

1230
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:18,890
About a mile.

1231
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,470
4,221 feet.

1232
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,470
It's closer to eight-tenths of a mile.

1233
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,480
Who are you?

1234
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,230
I'm the motherfucker that found
this place, sir.

1235
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,980
Really?

1236
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:38,310
All right, I want to know more about who's
inside this house by the end of the week.

1237
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,330
Sir.

1238
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,750
"Motherfucker."

1239
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:56,050
Good.

1240
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,940
Morning, George!

1241
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:18,450
21 days.

1242
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:20,950
It's been 21 days since
we found the house.

1243
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:22,330
Nothing's happened.

1244
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,400
- Yeah?
- "Maya, it's Steve."

1245
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,820
Swing by. I want to show you something.

1246
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:03,120
Okay.

1247
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,890
Okay, you can leave it paused for now,
but we're gonna...

1248
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:07,550
- play through that, go straight...
- Hey.

1249
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,750
- Maya. Come see.
- Yeah.

1250
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:14,500
- Okay, this is from a few minutes ago, okay?
- Yeah.

1251
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:16,050
So remember, we've got two males,

1252
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:18,420
- two females and seven kids.
- What's that?

1253
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,930
Okay, I'm saying that's Bushra,
the brother's wife.

1254
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:22,720
Well, how do you know the gender?

1255
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,820
Well, look, this is a clothesline
right here, for laundry.

1256
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,140
Men don't mess with the wash.

1257
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,310
Okay, now, watch. It takes her
about four seconds

1258
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:30,020
...to move from there to the front door,

1259
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,900
- so she's on the older side.
- What's that up there?

1260
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,530
Those are kids, they're shuffling around,
sword-fighting or something with sticks.

1261
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:40,200
You can see their height relative to this,
these are cows.

1262
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,000
So they're probably between
seven and nine.

1263
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,780
- Boys, definitely.
- Your female's moving fast.

1264
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:47,870
Okay, that's what I wanted to show you.
Can we pause this, please?

1265
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:49,540
That's not the same lady.

1266
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,290
That's female number three.

1267
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,550
So you found two males, three females.

1268
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:57,960
That's correct.

1269
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,800
So if there are three females,
there ought to be three males.

1270
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,970
"Observing Muslim women live
with their parents"

1271
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,270
...or with their husbands.

1272
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:11,060
We think there's a third family
living in the house.

1273
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,310
So this third male that you've identified
as possibly being bin Laden,

1274
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,230
do I give up all hope
of ever seeing a photograph of him?

1275
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,650
Hope? Yeah.

1276
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,740
You give up your hope right now.

1277
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,410
We scan for heat signatures,

1278
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:30,160
but we can't validate if it's a man
or a woman up there.

1279
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:35,630
"We talked about burrowing a pinhole camera,
but there's a high risk of discovery."

1280
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,090
"We found a safe house,"

1281
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:43,590
"but we can't get a vantage point
to fire a telescope over the balcony wall."

1282
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,050
"We have explored the possibility of
digging tunnels,"

1283
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,720
"of sending hot air balloons,
of rerouting"

1284
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:53,770
"...supply C-130s to take a peek,
but that might be too alerting."

1285
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:57,650
"We've looked for ways of collecting
available DNA from his trash,"

1286
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:00,860
"you know, looking for his toothbrush,
but they burn the trash."

1287
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:04,150
"We started a vaccination program."

1288
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,030
"We sent a doctor to the house,
see if he could pull blood."

1289
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:12,750
"But that didn't work out."

1290
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:16,290
"We thought about sending a guy
with a bucket"

1291
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,460
...to pull a sample from the sewer
to analyze his fecal matter.

1292
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:21,420
What was wrong with that, exactly?

1293
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,220
What was wrong with that?

1294
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:27,180
The sample would be too diluted.

1295
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,140
And it's asking too much to get a voice
confirmation with him on the phone?

1296
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,480
They don't make telephone calls
from the compound.

1297
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,560
We pulled the cell tower nearby.

1298
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:41,070
And I'm also gonna give up hope that
he might ever get in that white SUV

1299
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:46,280
...and drive around a bit and
we could see him.

1300
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,070
Don't they get groceries?

1301
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,990
The unidentified third male does not
get groceries.

1302
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,370
He does not leave the compound.

1303
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:54,790
He does not present himself
for photographs.

1304
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:59,750
When he needs fresh air,
he paces around beneath a grape arbor.

1305
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,340
But the leaves are so thick,
they obscure our satellite views.

1306
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:07,930
This is a professional attempt
to avoid detection.

1307
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:09,930
Okay? Real tradecraft.

1308
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:12,930
The only people we've seen
behave in this way

1309
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,930
...are other top-level
Al-Qaeda operatives.

1310
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:17,940
We did a Red Team on your analysis.

1311
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:22,440
According to them, this behavior could
belong to someone other than Al-Qaeda.

1312
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,650
They did give a 40% chance

1313
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:28,700
...that the unidentified third man
is a senior Al-Qaeda operative.

1314
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:31,530
But they also said there's a 35% chance
he's a Saudi drug dealer,

1315
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,410
15% chance he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler,

1316
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,410
10% chance he's one of the relatives
of the brothers.

1317
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,710
Basically, we agree with you.

1318
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:42,090
The house screams security,
it screams someone who wants privacy,

1319
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:45,340
it even screams bad guy,
but it does not scream bin Laden.

1320
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:48,090
You get the point, if you can't prove
it's bin Laden,

1321
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,800
at least prove it's not someone else.

1322
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:52,600
Like a drug dealer.

1323
01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:01,310
You know we lost the ability to prove that
when we lost the detainee program.

1324
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,020
Who the hell am I supposed to ask?

1325
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:09,700
Some guy in Gitmo who's all lawyered up?
He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden.

1326
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:14,450
You'll think of something.

1327
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:36,770
He'd be the first successful drug dealer
never to have dealt drugs.

1328
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:41,650
He has no Internet access to the house.
He makes no phone calls, either in or out.

1329
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:45,650
Who's he selling to? Who's he buying from?
How's he making his money?

1330
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:49,440
And if you were to say he's retired,
I'd say, where's the swimming pool?

1331
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:52,360
Where's the gold cage with the falcons?

1332
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,870
And why does he send his courier
to the two cities in Pakistan

1333
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:59,200
...we most associate with Al-Qaeda

1334
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:02,620
...that have nothing particularly
to do with heroin production?

1335
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,210
The President is a thoughtful,
analytical guy.

1336
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,050
He needs proof.

1337
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:21,390
Go ahead, you guys.

1338
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,400
I got to say, your job...

1339
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:31,360
I just don't get the rhythms of politics.

1340
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,450
You think this is political?

1341
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,630
If this was political,
we'd be having this conversation

1342
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:38,030
...in October when there's
an election bump.

1343
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:43,750
This is pure risk, based on deductive
 reasoning, inference, supposition,

1344
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:47,540
and the only human reporting you have
is six years old

1345
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:49,960
...from detainees who were questioned
under duress.

1346
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:52,630
The political move here is to tell you
to go fuck yourself

1347
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:58,100
...and remind you that I was in the room
when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.
"(WMD: Weapon of Mass Destruction)"

1348
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,770
At least there you guys brought
photographs.

1349
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:04,810
You know, you're right.
I agree with everything you just said.

1350
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,520
What I meant was, a man in your position,

1351
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,440
how do you evaluate the risk of
not doing something?

1352
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:18,580
The risk of potentially letting bin Laden
slip through your fingers.

1353
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,750
That is a fascinating question.

1354
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:26,880
Hey...

1355
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:33,470
I'm not saying we're gonna do it,

1356
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:37,430
but the President wants to know,
if we were gonna act,

1357
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:39,720
how would we do it?

1358
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,140
Give us options.

1359
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,720
Technically, these don't exist.

1360
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,930
I actually tried to kill this program
a couple of times.

1361
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,430
They've gone through
an initial round of testing,

1362
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:27,100
and they have excellent radar defeat.

1363
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:30,110
We just haven't tested them
with people in them yet.

1364
01:47:30,190 --> 01:47:31,980
You'll notice the stealth panels,

1365
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:34,570
similar to what we use on the B-2.

1366
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:37,400
The rotors have been muffled
with decibel killers.

1367
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:40,620
It's slower than a Black Hawk
and lacks the offense and the stability,

1368
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:42,870
but it can hide.

1369
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:46,830
So, excuse me, but what do we need
this for in Libya?

1370
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:49,710
I mean, Qaddafi's anti-air
is virtually nonexistent.

1371
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,040
Maya, do you want to brief him?

1372
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:05,470
There are two narratives about
the location of Usama bin Laden.

1373
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:07,180
The one that you're most familiar with

1374
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,310
...is that UBL is hiding in a cave
in the Tribal Areas,

1375
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,440
that he's surrounded
by a large contingent of loyal fighters.

1376
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:17,690
But that narrative is pre-9/11
understanding of UBL.

1377
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:21,570
The second narrative is that he's living
in a city.

1378
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:25,160
Living in a city with multiple points
of egress and entry,

1379
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,830
access to communications,

1380
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:31,080
so that he can keep in touch
with the organization.

1381
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:34,540
You can't run a global network
of interconnected cells from a cave.

1382
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:37,050
We've located an individual we believe,

1383
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:41,220
based on detainee reporting,
is bin Laden's courier.

1384
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:44,260
He's living in a house
 in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

1385
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,760
And we assess

1386
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:51,190
... that one of the other occupants
of the house

1387
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:52,600
...is UBL.

1388
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,740
General.

1389
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,210
Excuse me.

1390
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:19,010
So, UBL, you got an intel source
on the ground?

1391
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,180
- No.
- No?

1392
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,800
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?

1393
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,310
'Cause the truth is we've been
on this op before, it was '07,

1394
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:33,060
and it wasn't bin Laden, and we lost
a couple of guys.

1395
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:37,230
Totally understand. bin Laden uses a courier
to interact with the outside world.

1396
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,730
By locating the courier,
we've located bin Laden.

1397
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,990
That's really the intel?

1398
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:43,820
That's it?

1399
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,910
Quite frankly, I didn't even want
to use you guys,

1400
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:48,220
with your dip and your Velcro
and all your gear bullshit.

1401
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,700
I wanted to drop a bomb.

1402
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:52,500
But people didn't believe in this lead
enough to drop a bomb.

1403
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:55,420
So they're using you guys as canaries,

1404
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,750
in the theory that if bin Laden
isn't there,

1405
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,630
you can sneak away, and no one
will be the wiser.

1406
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:04,340
But bin Laden is there.

1407
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,720
And you're gonna kill him for me.

1408
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:15,520
They're nervous downtown.

1409
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,560
I don't think we'll get an approval
this decision cycle.

1410
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,830
It's her against the world.

1411
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:35,870
Yeah.

1412
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,500
I'm about to go look the President
in the eye,

1413
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:45,380
and what I'd like to know,
no fucking bullshit,

1414
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:48,470
is where everyone stands on this thing.

1415
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:53,470
Now, very simply, is he there
or is he not fucking there?

1416
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,150
We all come at this through the filter
of our own past experiences.

1417
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:01,860
Now, I remember Iraq WMD very clearly.
I fronted that.

1418
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:05,530
And I can tell you the case for
that was much stronger than this case.

1419
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:07,360
A fucking yes or a no.

1420
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,990
We don't deal in certainty,
we deal in probability,

1421
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,750
and I'd say there's a 60%
probability he's there.

1422
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:19,920
I concur, 60%.

1423
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:23,920
I'm at 80%. Their OPSEC is what
convinces me.

1424
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:26,180
"OPSEC: OPerations SECurity is a term originating
in U.S. military jargon, as a process that
identifies critical information."

1425
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,180
You guys ever agree on anything?

1426
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,090
Well, I agree with Mike.

1427
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:32,310
We're basing this mostly
on detainee reporting,

1428
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,430
and I spent a bunch of time
in those rooms.

1429
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:37,480
I'd say it's a soft 60, sir.

1430
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,940
I'm virtually certain
there's some high-value target there.

1431
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:42,440
I'm just not sure it's bin Laden.

1432
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:46,740
Well, this is a little bit of
a clusterfuck, isn't it?

1433
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,860
I'd like to know what Maya thinks.

1434
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,990
We're all incorporating
her assessment into ours.

1435
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,620
100% he's there.

1436
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,210
Okay, fine, 95%, 'cause I know
certainty freaks you guys out.

1437
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:01,330
But it's 100.

1438
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:17,390
They're all cowed.

1439
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,940
What do you think of the girl?

1440
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:24,570
I think she's fucking smart.

1441
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,360
We're all smart, Jeremy.

1442
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,790
May I join you?

1443
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,040
How is the food down here anyway?

1444
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:44,000
It's okay.

1445
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,960
How long have you worked for the CIA?

1446
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:50,220
Twelve years. I was recruited out
of high school.

1447
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,880
And do you know why we did that?

1448
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,800
I don't think I can answer
that question, sir.

1449
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:57,930
I don't think I'm allowed to answer.

1450
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,930
All right.

1451
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,440
What else have you done for us?

1452
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,400
Besides bin Laden.

1453
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,690
Nothing.

1454
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:10,860
I've done nothing else.

1455
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,580
Well, you certainly have a flair for it.

1456
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,150
"No. Yeah."

1457
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:49,650
"All right, let's be serious, now."

1458
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,490
"Don't fuck around on this one, dude."

1459
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:53,690
"You're just fucking around 'cause
I'm up by two games."

1460
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,620
"How many you got?"

1461
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,380
So, Patrick, be honest with me.

1462
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,130
You really believe this story?

1463
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,260
I mean, no offense. No offense, I know.

1464
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:16,640
But Usama bin Laden?

1465
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,850
Yeah.

1466
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:21,140
What part convinced you?

1467
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:23,430
Her confidence.

1468
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:28,020
That's the kind of concrete data point
I'm looking for.

1469
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:31,230
I tell you, buddy, her confidence
is the one thing that's keeping me

1470
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,480
...from getting ass-raped in a Pakistani
prison. I'm gonna be honest with you, bro.

1471
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,740
I'm cool with it.

1472
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,460
Yeah?

1473
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:49,590
"Maya, I wanted you to hear it first."

1474
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,810
You know that thing we talked about?

1475
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,880
- "It's gonna happen."
- When?

1476
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,550
Tonight.

1477
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:58,260
"Good luck."

1478
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,890
"- 50 bucks?
- 50 bucks."

1479
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:01,600
"- 50 bucks!
- 50 bucks."

1480
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:04,430
50 bucks.

1481
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:09,440
"Lucky shot."

1482
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:15,360
"Go."

1483
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:41,820
"Apache One, you are clear."

1484
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,750
Copy.

1485
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,420
Copy that.

1486
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,240
"Thirty seconds to first turn."

1487
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:51,370
Hey, Justin, what are you listening to?

1488
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,700
Tony Robbins.

1489
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:55,210
Tony Robbins, really?

1490
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,590
You should listen to it.
I got plans for after this, big-time.

1491
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:01,190
I want to talk to all of you about it.

1492
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:25,240
Who here has been in a helo crash before?

1493
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:30,660
Okay, so we're all good.

1494
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:49,300
"We just crossed the border.
Now entering Pakistan."

1495
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,760
Pakistani comms, no chatter.

1496
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:18,000
"Three minutes. Stand by for doors open."

1497
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,140
"Two minutes."

1498
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:13,840
"Should be coming up just off our nose,
11 o'clock."

1499
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:22,900
"Eyes on target."

1500
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:29,360
Stay tight.

1501
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,320
"Thirty seconds."

1502
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:43,520
Hey! Slide right, slide right!

1503
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:45,600
"- Too much updraft off these walls!
- Hey!"

1504
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:51,650
"We've lost power. Go to lockout."

1505
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,660
"Hey!"

1506
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:02,790
"Hard landing."

1507
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:05,290
"Fuck!"

1508
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:22,970
"Prince five-one is down.
Prince five-one is down."

1509
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,390
"Black Hawk down in the animal pen."

1510
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:41,490
"This way!"

1511
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,290
"This mission is still a go.
I repeat, we are a go."

1512
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:53,710
"Alpha team is in the animal pen,
making entry for AC-1."

1513
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,430
"No ropes. Wheels down."

1514
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:45,470
"Prayer room's clear."

1515
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:17,670
"Breacher!"

1516
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:44,660
"Echo team is away.
Prince five-two exiting Alpha Oscar."

1517
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:56,960
"Three, two, one. Execute!"

1518
02:07:08,030 --> 02:07:09,030
"Ibrahim!"

1519
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:12,200
"Come on out!"

1520
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:29,430
"- Get down!
- Down, down, down, down!"

1521
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,510
"Down! Throw your hands in the air!"

1522
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:33,600
"Down, down, down, down! Down!"

1523
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:36,180
You've killed him.

1524
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,600
"All right, go, I got her."

1525
02:08:05,170 --> 02:08:06,420
"Down, sit down."

1526
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:48,050
"Echo 11 on perimeter."

1527
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,130
"Ready to breach at P-2."

1528
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:57,470
"Fire in the hole."

1529
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:04,310
Failed breach, failed breach.

1530
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:07,690
Back it up! Back it up! Main gate!

1531
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:21,670
We got an unlocked door.

1532
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:41,890
Abrar.

1533
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:22,640
It's okay. It's okay.

1534
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:24,810
"This is Echo 11."

1535
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,400
"We're going to breach the main gate."

1536
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,860
"Negative. This is Echo 01."

1537
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:29,610
"I'm internal, in the corridor."

1538
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:30,980
"I'll let you guys in."

1539
02:10:31,070 --> 02:10:32,110
"Roger that."

1540
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,280
Shut that fucking kid up, please.

1541
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:20,990
Talk to me.

1542
02:11:21,490 --> 02:11:23,120
No fucking way we can blow this thing.

1543
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,330
God fucking damn it,
can you pop it manually?

1544
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,120
No.

1545
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:29,210
"Alpha 3, this is Echo 11."

1546
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:31,500
We're at our primary set point,
prepping to breach.

1547
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:34,670
"Wait one. We're internal
on the south side."

1548
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:36,470
This is a negative breach.

1549
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:39,090
Roger. Ready to make our entry out here.

1550
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,780
Yeah, roger that.
We're coming to meet you.

1551
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:43,430
Stay with these kids
and don't let them in that back room.

1552
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:03,660
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1553
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:05,580
Yeah.

1554
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:08,420
I forgot, were we supposed
to crash that helo?

1555
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:10,920
Ibrahim tried to shoot through the door.

1556
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,630
- Yeah?
- I popped him from outside.

1557
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:16,210
I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife.

1558
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,970
She still alive?

1559
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,840
She's gonna bleed out.

1560
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:22,850
- What a fucking mess.
- Yeah.

1561
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:28,390
Go, go, go.

1562
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,420
This is Echo 09.

1563
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:55,670
We have unknowns gathering
on the southwest rooftops.

1564
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,390
Locked gate blocking the stairs.

1565
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,270
Breacher up.

1566
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:17,570
Back it up, back up.

1567
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,170
Hey, back it up.

1568
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:34,630
Watch out.

1569
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:37,170
Execute.

1570
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:43,090
- Go, go.
- This is Echo 05 moving to level two.

1571
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:57,610
Hakim, get those guys back.

1572
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:22,800
Khalid.

1573
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,890
Echo 02 moving to deck three.

1574
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:50,660
Clear.

1575
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,180
Hakim, get them back or
I'll start smoking them.

1576
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:09,600
Wait, wait, wait.

1577
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:21,110
Go back, they will kill you!

1578
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:24,740
They will kill you!

1579
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:28,620
Go back!

1580
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:30,950
Come here!

1581
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,250
No vest.

1582
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:37,710
All clear.

1583
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:43,170
Oh, fucking shit.

1584
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:56,800
Usama?

1585
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Usama?

1586
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Usama?

1587
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:20,500
Down.

1588
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:21,580
All right, get him.

1589
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:39,350
Got a possible jackpot.

1590
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:40,900
"Roger that. Possible jackpot."

1591
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:42,110
"Shoot."

1592
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:46,530
It's okay, it's okay.

1593
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,530
- Come on.
- Get down.

1594
02:16:53,490 --> 02:16:55,120
- Dude.
- It's okay.

1595
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,290
Do you even realize what you just did?

1596
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:02,290
Who is he?

1597
02:17:02,330 --> 02:17:03,920
Hey, hey, hey!

1598
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,040
Who is he?

1599
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:06,130
He is Al Noori Hasan.

1600
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:09,130
Yo, she says it's not him.

1601
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:10,300
Talk to the kid.

1602
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:14,970
It's okay.

1603
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:25,520
Daughter, what is his name?

1604
02:17:34,990 --> 02:17:36,660
Name, name.

1605
02:17:39,790 --> 02:17:41,290
- We need them down.
- All right.

1606
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:56,600
Okay, come on, come on. Come on.

1607
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,770
"This is Red 02."

1608
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:08,570
"Geronimo."

1609
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:13,360
"For God and country."

1610
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:15,530
"Geronimo."

1611
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,380
All stations, target secure,
target secure.

1612
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:27,130
Roger. Copy that. Target secure.

1613
02:18:27,210 --> 02:18:29,210
"Target secure. Commence SSE."

1614
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:33,050
"Proper SSE right now."

1615
02:18:33,630 --> 02:18:35,260
"Books, DVDs, CDs."

1616
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:41,310
"Every fucking hard drive.
Do not leave a hard drive."

1617
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:43,100
"Hey, open that for me."

1618
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:46,400
"Let's go, guys."

1619
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:50,270
Yo, what's up?

1620
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:55,200
I shot the third-floor guy.

1621
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:00,240
Why don't you get to work? Grab a bag.

1622
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:03,250
"QRF is inbound, eight miles out."

1623
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,420
Pak Air Force is responding.

1624
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,300
Fourteen minutes to intercept.

1625
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:21,510
"Any station, this is Red 02.
We need a body bag."

1626
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:26,270
This is Echo 09. Stand by.

1627
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,440
Hakim, I got this. Get it to them.

1628
02:19:34,570 --> 02:19:36,030
Let's go, buddy.

1629
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:42,240
Echo 05, this is Red 02.
How long do you need for SSE?

1630
02:19:42,330 --> 02:19:44,330
We're gonna need at least 10 minutes, sir.

1631
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:46,870
Echo 05, you have four mikes.

1632
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:49,380
This is a gold mine.
I need more time than that.

1633
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,800
Echo 05, if you're not at the L.Z. at four
mikes, I'm gonna leave your ass behind.
"(L.Z.: Landing Zone)"

1634
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:56,470
The Paks have scrambled the F-16s.

1635
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,800
Four minutes!

1636
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:16,110
"Prince five-two, inbound for L.Z."

1637
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:40,050
Where do you need the bag?

1638
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,300
"Third deck."

1639
02:20:58,650 --> 02:21:00,360
- Here!
- Here.

1640
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:16,670
And up.

1641
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:24,140
"All right, let's move it out."

1642
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:37,360
Let's go! Now!

1643
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:03,510
"You've got one mike to blow
that downed helo."

1644
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:42,420
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1645
02:23:08,530 --> 02:23:11,660
"QRF-46 inbound for L.Z., 30 seconds out."

1646
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,790
"Chopper 4-6, we are demoing 5-1."

1647
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:18,250
"Chopper 4-6, wave off."

1648
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,670
"4-6, wave off! Wave off!"

1649
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:28,130
Up!

1650
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:40,350
Well done, Patrick.

1651
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:42,850
Thank you.

1652
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:44,620
- Move him through!
- "All right, listen up, gentlemen,"

1653
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:45,650
"read the signs."

1654
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:48,900
First floor, hard drives, files, anything!

1655
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:51,650
"Second floor, opposite, down on the right!"

1656
02:25:52,990 --> 02:25:55,160
Third floor, ladies' underwear.

1657
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:57,970
"That's right, there can't be
hat many of them, right?"

1658
02:25:57,990 --> 02:25:59,830
"- And mark all media!
- CDs, DVDs."

1659
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:01,410
"- Who's got a Sharpie?
- CDs."

1660
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:02,500
"CDs."

1661
02:26:04,210 --> 02:26:06,670
- Right here.
- Good job, man.

1662
02:26:07,130 --> 02:26:08,970
- This all right?
- "Move it along, bring it in."

1663
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:19,950
- Nice job.
- "All right, all media, CDs, DVDs."

1664
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:21,330
"- I want them! That's all second floor
right there."

1665
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:23,190
"Who's logging on this table?"

1666
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:24,810
"Where do the hard drives go?"

1667
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:27,060
"- Mark on tables.
- Yes, sir."

1668
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:29,610
"You got Ziploc bags and Sharpies,
use them."

1669
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:33,400
"No, mark all media."

1670
02:26:33,530 --> 02:26:34,740
"Good job."

1671
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:36,280
"Gentlemen, watch your backs."

1672
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:38,620
"Slow down!"

1673
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:39,870
"Thank you, sir."

1674
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:41,620
"- Good job.
- Slow down."

1675
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:44,330
"- Video cameras?
- Video cameras, where was it found?"

1676
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:51,260
"Second floor!"

1677
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:52,720
"All right."

1678
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,090
"Yes, sir. One moment, please."

1679
02:27:08,730 --> 02:27:09,900
"One moment, please."

1680
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:42,520
"Sir, the Agency expert gave
visual confirmation."

1681
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:44,810
"Yes, sir, the girl, 100%."

1682
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:46,440
"Thank you, sir."

1683
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:43,620
Are you Maya?

1684
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:45,240
Yeah.

1685
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:46,830
"That's the only name they gave me."

1686
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:48,060
You can sit wherever you want.

1687
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,580
You're the only one on the manifest.

1688
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:55,920
"You must be pretty important."

1689
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:58,840
"You got the whole plane to yourself."

1690
02:28:58,930 --> 02:29:00,930
"Where do you want to go?"
