[Cell phone chiming]

14
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,848

[Continues in mandarin]

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,520
[In English] You should go in to steam
the tablecloths for tonight.

17
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,790
I'm going to paint over that

Huh? Oh.

21
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,022
[In English] Like, this afternoon?

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,266

Hey... hey.

Thank you for doing this.

38
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,339
You look really pretty right now.

39

- Oh, you like this-this hot mormon look?
- [Chuckling]

40
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,805
I'm just telling you now in case my mom
says something dumb,

41
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,392
like you're fat or whatever.

42
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,155
I thought you said when she says
shit like that, it means she cares.

43
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,399
- Hi, Evelyn. Mrs. Wang!
- Hey, mom.

44
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:55,152
I only cook enough food for three people.
Now I have to cook more.

45
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,075
It's joy. She brought Becky.

46
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,161

Hi, Mr. Wang!

50
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,341
Hi, Becky. Thank you for coming.

51
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,760
Please call me waymond. Here, sit.

52
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,513
[Evelyn] You know,
he doesn't have to stay here.

53
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,806
[Joy] Who's "he"?

54
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,349
- [Evelyn] Becky.
- Becky's a "she."

55
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,644
[Scoffs] You know me.
I always mix up "he, " " she."

56
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,439
In Chinese, just one word, ta, so easy.

57
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,692
And the way you two are dressed, I'm sure
I'm not the only one calling him "he."

58
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,819
I mean, her "him." Ugh!

59
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,197
Anyways, my English is fine.
And we have Google.

60
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,883
So you don't have to come
and be a translator.

61
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,677
- You stay here...
- [Becky speaking indistinctly]

62
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,495
- And she can go.
- Look, I honestly think it's weird, okay?

63
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,705
But Becky wants to help.

64
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,540
- [Becky chuckling]
- [Joy] Right, Becky?

65
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,418
I always learn something when I hang out
with the elderly.

66
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,336
Old people are very wise.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,880
Hmm. It's okay.

68
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,215
We'll take gong gong with us
to the meeting.

69
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,594
Uh, you and Becky
can stay here and decorate. Hmm?

70
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,597
[Speaking mandarin]

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,408
[In English] Where is he?
When can I meet him?

72
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,432
[Joy] Ahem.

73
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,162
- [Doorbell buzzes]
- [Evelyn gasps softly]

74
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,188

[Door opens]

76
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,778
- Morn.
- What?

77
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,155
Mom, just wait.

78
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,656
Wait? Wait? No time to wait today.

79
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,074
- Just please...
- [Door opens]

80
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,620
Joy, any other time,
I beg you to come and eat,

81
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,830
or call me or anything,
but today, very busy.

82
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,666
- Morn, this is what it's always like...
- Wrong white paint.

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,627
I know you haven't always
liked Becky, okay?

84
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,545
- But...
- I like Becky. She is very nice.

85
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,923
You are very lucky...

86
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,008
[Speaking mandarin]

87
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,167
[In English] She's half-Mexican.

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,390
Ugh!

89
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,980
No shoes in washer. Broken, you pay.

90
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,315
[Evelyn sighs]

91
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,110
But gong gong, his heart cannot take it,
especially after such a long flight.

92
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,339
You want him to come all the way
from China to die like that?

93
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,364
He's not gonna die.

94
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,716
[Woman] That's not what I said
when I said I wanted to cook...

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,825
Ooh. [Speaking mandarin]

96
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,137
- [In English] How can I help you?
- Hold on, I can't hear you. Hold on.

97
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,722
- [Man, over phone] Okay.
- How can I help you?

98
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,973
Yeah, I'm here to pick up some shirts.

99
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,600
- I called, like, three times.
- Okay, give me your ticket.

100
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,726
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- I find for you.

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,144
- No, I have the ticket.
- [Man] Babe...

102
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,379
She's asking for it
'cause that's the way it works.

103
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,923
- [Man speaks indistinctly]
- They don't read minds.

104
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,886
- Don't fuck with me.
- Then hang up. Thank you.

105
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,263
We've been together for three years. Don't
you think gong gong would want to know?

106
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,722
Let him enjoy his party tonight.

107
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,723
[Scoffs]

108
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,661
You think Becky will get through the party
without introducing herself to him?

109
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,603
- [Sing-songy] Evelyn!
- Have you met Becky?

110
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,414
Guess whose $20 got eaten
by the machine again?

111
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,438
[Evelyn sighs]

112
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,361
- Waymond! Customers need you.
- All right, coming.

113
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,990
Evelyn, you know, my wife used to wear
that exact same perfume,

114
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,157
god rest her soul.

115
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,867
Are you coming to the party tonight?

116
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,578
Yeah, I got my ticket right here.

117
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,707
[Speaking mandarin]

118
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,918
[In English] Sorry. It was too crowded
here so I moved some upstairs.

119
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,437
I think the clothes are happier there.

120
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,504
[Joy sighs]

121
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,424
[Breathing deeply]

122
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,345
See? They're happier here.

123
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,432
[Speaking mandarin]

124
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,008
[In English] No more Google eyes!
[Mumbling indistinctly]

125
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,873
[In English] Mom, can we please
talk about Becky?

126
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,107
[Speaking mandarin]

127
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,377
[In English] I still don't know
what his brain is thinking.

128
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,069
Can Becky come tonight or not?

129
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,589
- Stop changing the subject.
- I'm not.

130
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:29,366
You know, it is like our auditor.
She is a terrible person.

131
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,660
She keeps targeting
the Chinese in the community.

132
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,121
[Evelyn sighs]

133
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,374
You know, two years of meetings,
she puts a lien on our laundromat,

134
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,753
and you know what your father does?
He brings her cookies.

135
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,254
[Mumbles indistinctly]

136
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,340
[Suspenseful music playing]

137
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,092
Every day I fight, I fight.
I fight for all of us.

138
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,471
Every day is a battle here.

139
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,723
[Evelyn sighs]

140
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,185
Your father, he doesn't care
about the way things are...

141
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,603
[Continues speaking indistinctly]

142
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,815
I try to make our lives easier
and more simple.

143
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,943
[Speaking mandarin]

144
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,720
[Waymond, in English]
You should have told me earlier.

145
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,305
- That's really impressive.
- [Evelyn speaking mandarin]

146
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,707
[In English] Evelyn, you have to see Rick
dance. Look, he knows all of the moves.

147
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,210
[Chuckles]

148
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,729
[Joy, whispering]
I can fucking kill myself.

149
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,397
[Waymond] Did you know Rick
is in community theater?

150
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,423
He wants to be an actor,
just like you did.

151
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,800
[Jingle playing over TV]

152
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,761
[Speaking mandarin]

153
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,263
[Singing in English]
J“ ...Just put your hand j“

154
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,307
j“ in my hand j“

155
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,576

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,604
[Man and woman]
J“ and we 7! Spin through eternity j“

157
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,147
[woman] J“ and away we go j“

158
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,817
j“ life can be so delicious j“

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,068
j“ delicious j“

160
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,153
[actors continue singing
indistinctly over TV]

161
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,325
- I love this!
- [Rick and waymond laugh]

162
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,744
Rick, you're so terrific.

163
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,621
[Speaking mandarin]

164
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:01,250
I just don't know how to be any fucking
clearer. It's like she can choose.

165
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,811
Either you come to the party with me,

166
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,171
and gong gong is eternally ashamed
until he forgets it all, and then he dies.

167
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,966
Or you don't come with me,
and then he still dies. What?

168
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,529
- [Mutters indistinctly]
- [Joy gasps!

169
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,054
- What are you saying?
- That was a joke.

170
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:17,141
Uh, that's not a very funnyjoke, honey.

171
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,642
- Hey, guys...
- This is only $10.

172
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,328
I thought you people were

[In English] I... look...

280
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,809
I was just hoping you could enlighten me

281
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,770
as to how, as a laundromat owner...

282
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,900
A karaoke machine could constitute
a business expense?

283
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,526
[In English] I am a singer.

That will not be necessary.

290
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:24,669
But I will need a separate schedule c
for each of these businesses,

291
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,756
because based on
what you're trying to deduct,

292
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,842
you're also a novelist and a chef.

293
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,719
Last time, you told me that...

294
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,013

and a watsu technician.

298
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,232
I'm sorry, what... what is watsu?

299
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,443
[Waymond] It's a water massage.

300
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,863
[Deirdre] What's a water massage?

301
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,491
[Waymond] Like for back pain.
You go get a water massage.

Like I'm talking to my ex-husband.

311
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,556
Like I said to you before,
comingling of your...

312
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,700
It's you messing with my head.

313
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,641
- Shh!
- What's with...

314
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,685
- Don't shh me.
- You got to relax your body.

315
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,688
- Don't... [muffled screaming]
- [Whispering] Calm down, please.

316
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,440
- Calm down.
- [Muffled exclaiming]

317
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,444
Relax your body
in the other universe. Please.

318
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,587
[Deirdre] ...These deductions
at your place of business.

319
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,072
[Alpha waymond] Go into auto-pilot.

320
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,196
[Deirdre] You can't then deduct it
if it's an off...

321
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,119
Good. Good.

322
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,538
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet,

323
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,457
so hopefully I'll have
some time to explain.

324
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,335
I'm not your husband.
At least not the one you know.

325
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,296
I'm another version of him
from another life path, another universe.

326
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,007
I'm here because we need your help.

327
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,719
Very busy today. No time to help you.

328
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,137
Shh.

329
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,473
There's a great evil
that has taken root in my world

330
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,476
and has begun spreading its chaos
throughout the many 'verses.

331
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,436
I have spent years searching for the one

332
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,773
who might be able to match to this great
evil with an even greater good,

333
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,608
and bring back balance.

334
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
All those years of searching
have brought me here,

335
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,653
- to this universe.
- [Deirdre] Mrs. Wang...

336
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,881
- To you.
- [Deirdre] Hello...

337
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,531

to take in right now.

338
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,824
- Got to do it.
- Mrs. Wang.

339
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,159
[Sing-songy] Hello?

340
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,080
Look, I'm sure
you have a lot on your mind,

341
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,958
but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more

342
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:14,339
than the conversation we are now having
concerning your tax liability.

343
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,093
Uh, need I remind you that there is
already a lien on your property?

344
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,053
Repossession is well
within our rights.

345
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,764
I know. I am paying attention.

346
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,270
Do you see these?

347
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,777
You don't get one of these

00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,783
you are about to be graced

526
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,578
by the presence of our sovereign leader,

527
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,163
jobu tupaki.

528
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,418
Now let me assure you of one thing.

529
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,504
Just like the rest
of your miserable lives,

530
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:06,300
this is nothing more
than a statistical inevitability.

531
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,388
[Jobu] Duck.

532
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:12,598
- Duck.
- [Gasps]

533
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,351
Duck...

534
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,939
[Bagel Deirdre] Jobu tupaki has seen all
and knows all.

535
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,942
She knows what makes you tick.

536
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:27,029
On what fragile branches
your self-worth rests.

537
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,949
- [Jobu] This one.
- [Gaspsi

538
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,243
[gasps]

539
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,286
[Evelyns screaming]

540
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,545
[Jobu tutting]

541
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,628
Hang on.

542
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,090
Don't die yet, all right, buddy?

543
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:50,636
[Sighs] Ugh.

544
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,179
[Sighs]

545
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,806
[Radio static buzzing]

546
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,933
[Shushes]

547
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,646
- [Shushes]
- [Woman whimpers]

548
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,149
It's not her.

549
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,211
[Reporter].. Police are looking for all
information. This is a developing story.

550
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,879
- What we do know...
- [Jobu] They might be close.

551
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,114
We do have unconfirmed
photos of the suspects.

552
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,198
[Static clicking]

553
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,868
An unidentified man went
berserk at the regional office

554
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,620
for the internal revenue service
in simi valley this morning.

555
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,223
Police aren't releasing any information...

556
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,559
- Is that where your parents are?
- This is a developing story.

557
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,394
- But we do have unconfirmed...
- [Becky] Are you okay?

558
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,458
Photos of the suspects.

559
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,962
- If you recognize them...
- Hey!

560
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,046
Are you okay?

561
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,215
Help identify them.

562
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,762
If you recognize these two,

563
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,015
police are seeking help
identifying the assailants.

564
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,683
[Inaudible]

565
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,358
My husband won't even kill a spider.

566
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,444
How can you be the same person?

567
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,446
You underestimate
how the smallest decisions

568
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,073
can compound into significant
differences over a lifetime.

569
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,952
Every tiny decision creates another
branching universe, another...

570
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,621
Were you not paying attention before?

571
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,873
Of course.
You're just very bad at explaining...

572
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,166
Shh!

573
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,005
Don't push me.

574
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,301
[Gasps, whispers] Oh, my god!
We have to go back.

575
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,510
We forgot my father!

576
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,180
Don't worry, we're monitoring him.
He's safe.

577
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,574
- I don't know, are you sure?
- Yes.

578
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,934
[Man] There is a route out there.

579
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,644
Hey, look, come on!

580
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,938
Look, this is your universe,

581
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,982
one bubble floating
in the cosmic foam of existence.

582
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,777
Every surrounding bubble
has slight variations.

583
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,154
But the further away
you get from your universe,

584
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,823
the bigger the differences.
This is where I am from...

585
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,076
The alphaverse.

586
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,663
The first universe to make
contact with the others.

587
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,915
You can call me Alpha waymond.

588
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,714
In this world, you were a brilliant woman.

589
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,842
In your search to prove the existence
of other universes,

590
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,012
you discovered a way
to temporarily link your consciousness

591
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,764
to another version of yourself,

592
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,185
accessing all of their memories,
their skills, even their emotions.

593
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,398
- Like... you with the Fanny pack?
- Exactly.

594
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,776
- It's called 'verse jumping.
- "'Verse jumping".

595
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,404
I need you to learn
how to do it right now.

596
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:14,780
Right now?

597
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,325
It may be our only chance
of getting out of here alive.

598
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,748
[Headset powering up]

599
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,709
- [Beeps]
- [Inhales sharply]

600
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,793
[Exhales]

601
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,046
Two guards coming this way.

602
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,132
On my signal, try to blend in.

603
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,758
[Muttering indistinctly]

604
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:38,595
Why don't you get your Evelyn to do this?

605
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,639
My Evelyn is dead.

606
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,266
Go! Oh, my god!

607
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,410
Oh, my god, what is going on?

608
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,060
Help us! Help us!

609
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,562
[Speaking mandarin]

610
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:51,984
[Breathing heavily]

611
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,071
[In English] How did I die?

612
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,158
I've seen you die a thousand ways
in a thousand worlds.

613
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,454
In every single one, you were murdered.

614
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,332
What? Why would anybody want to kill me?

615
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,709
She's an omniversal being
with unimaginable power.

616
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,171
An agent of pure chaos,
with no real motives or desires.

617
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,924
- Jobu tupaki.
- You're just making up sounds.

618
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,368
- Shh!
- [Indistinct radio chatter]

619
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,056
We need another exit.

620
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,186
So, let her destroy the other bubbles.
You said there are so many of them.

621
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,939
[Scoffs] Maybe it's okay if we lose some,
but just leave me out of it.

622
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,652
- [Evelyn sighs]
- It's not so simple.

623
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,407
She's been building something.

624
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,286
We thought it was
some sort of black hole,

625
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,165
but it appears to consume
more than just light and matter.

626
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,250
We don't know exactly what it is.

627
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,461
We don't know what it's for.

628
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,963
But we can all... feel it.

629
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,634
You've been feeling it, too, haven't you?

630
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,427
Something is off.

631
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,639
Your clothes never wear
as well the next day.

632
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,849
Your hair never fails
in quite the same way.

633
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,061
Even your coffee tastes...

634
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,270
Wrong.

635
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:14,733
Our institutions are crumbling,

636
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,653
nobody trusts their neighbor anymore,

637
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,631
and you stay up at night
wondering to yourself...

638
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,573
How can we get back?

639
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,413
This is the alphaverse's mission...

640
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,790
To take us back
to how it's supposed to be.

641
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,709
But that begins with finding the one

642
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:36,004
who can stand up to jobu's
perverse shroud of chaos.

643
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,842
And you think it's me?

644
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,095
Why else would we risk everything
to get you out of here?

645
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,441
Oh, there you are.

646
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,068
Oh, miss Deirdre!

00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,237
I'm sorry I punched you, but...

648
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,616
Look, I think I finally understand why...

- [Evelyn gasps]
- [Headset powering up]

650
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,620

She jumped somewhere. Brute force.

A sumo wrestler?

- Bodybuilder?
- Doesn't matter.

[Grunting softly]

668
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,915
Paper cuts only happen when you
aren't trying. It's impossible.

- [Alpha waymond] No.

She can jump.
Somewhere she can fight.

01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,030
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

1059
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,199
Did you see her dance that man to death?

1060
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:09,536
There is no way I am the Evelyn
you are looking for.

1061
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,997
No, I see it so clearly.

1062
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,628
I'm no good at anything.

1063
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,588
Exactly.

1064
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:21,924
I've seen thousands of evelyns,

1065
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,551
but never a Evelyn like you.

1066
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:27,429
You have so many goals
you never finished,

1067
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:30,015
dreams you never followed.

1068
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,434
You're living your worst you.

1069
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,773
I can't be the worst.
What about the hot dog one?

1070
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,192
No. Can't you see?

1071
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,485
Every failure here

1072
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,989
branched off into a success
for another Evelyn in another life.

1073
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:50,077
Most people only have a few significant
alternate life paths so close to them.

1074
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,830
But you, here,

1075
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,041
you're capable of anything

1076
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,544
because you're so bad at everything.

1077
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,549
[Alpha gong gong laughing]

1078
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:04,758
What good is all that power

1079
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:09,138
when her mind is already succumbing
to that chaos, huh?

1080
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:12,016
- [Knocking on door]
- [Joy] Hello?

1081
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,600
Hello? Mom, dad? What's going on?

1082
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,311
No. Do not answer.

1083
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:18,772
- It's one of her tricks.
- [Banging on door]

1084
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,734
Sir, our readings indicate
it's not jobu tupaki.

1085
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:25,183
- But if she is not here...
- [Continues banging on door]

1086

[Alpha gong gong]
Do not engage! Run! Run!

1089
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,459
Watch these two here
while I deal with job...

1090
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,795
I'm not risking the safety
of the alphaverse for this.

1091

- [Earpiece chimes]
- [Snoring]

1092
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:48,469
Get us as far away
from joy as you can.

1093
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,928
- Why?
- I'll be back. I promise.

1094
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,332
No, no, no, wait.
Why don't you...

1095
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,304
- Huh?
- [Knocking on door]

1096
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,059
- [Joy] Hello?
- Joy?

1097
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,494
- No, no... that's not...
- Joy is here.

1098
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,746
- No, no, no, that's not joy.
- Hello?

1099
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:01,273
- Joy? Joy, I'm coming.
- Let me in.

1100
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,109
Okay, be patient. This is heavy.

1101
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,197
- Joy, why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

1102
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,616
- Hey, gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

1103
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,160
I'm sure there is a very good
explanation for all of this...

1104

[Evelyn speaking mandarin]

1108
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,625

[Joy scoffs]

1111
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,153

1115

[In English] You are like puppets.

1116
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:46,401
You know? Puppets?

1117
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:49,446
You can do things you normally cannot do.

1118
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,073
It's like that movie.

1119
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,450
Um, you-you... that movie...

1120
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:54,844

- What?
- Huh?

1123
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,832
Raccaccoonie. You know,
the one with the chef...

1124
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,543
[Makes chopping sound]
And he makes bad food. Ptoey.

1125
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,753
And then this raccoon sit on his head,

1126
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:08,799
ooh, control him,
and then he cooks good food!

1127
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,926
[Snickering] Do you mean ratatouille?

1128
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,511

No. No, no, no, no, no.
Raccaccoonie!

1130
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:15,973

- Raccoon?

[Sighs] Everybody
stop making up sounds.

- Oh. Okay.
- That's very funny, Evelyn.

1138
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,199
Okay, it sounds a little bit
ridiculous, but it's true.

- Ah ba.

Quickly, while she is distracted.

1145
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,340
- No.
- It's only protocol.

1146
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:53,260
It gives her one less universe to access.

1147
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,696
- [Joy] God...
- [Cell phone ringing]

1148

Hi, Becky. Hold on.

1150
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:00,142
How do you expect to defeat her
in every universe

1151
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,768
if you can't even kill her in one?

1152

- [Joy] Hey, babe.
- She's your granddaughter.

1153
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,859
- [Joy] I'm wearing a golf outfit.
- How do you think I feel?

1154
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:13,947
But this is a sacrifice that is necessary
to win the war.

1155

I should just go.

- Go.

- uh, because of raccoons.
- [Waymond grunts]

to your mind?

In my universe,

Please, I don't care about the bagel.

1616
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,903
I don't care about the alphaverse.
I only care about my joy.

1617

I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

1624

And I know the joy...

1625
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:45,602
And the pain of having you as my mother.

1626
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,274
[Evelyn] Then you know I would do...

1627
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,735
Only do the right thing for her.

1628

Foryou.

1629
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:59,908
"Right" is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid.

1630
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:03,245

You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:17,134
You should feel relieved.

1637
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:21,013
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

1638
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,141
You'll be free from that box.
Just like me.

No. I'm going back with my joy,

1644

I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.
