1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This man is worth $500,</i></font>

2
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and this man's going to collect.</i></font>

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's Jake Cahill,</i></font>

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and he lives by...</i></font>

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bounty Law.</font>

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't ever bring them in alive,
do you, Jake?</font>

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not when there's 3 of them
and one of me.</font>

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you looking at,
bounty killer?</font>

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot
about to get his jaw busted.</font>

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amateurs try and take men in alive.</font>

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Amateurs usually don't make it.
<i>- Whether you're dead or alive,</i></font>

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you're just a dollar sign
to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.</font>

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thursdays at 8:30, only on NBC.</i></font>

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, everybody.</font>

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Allen Kincade on the set of the exciting hit
NBC and Screen Gems television series <i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if you think you're seeing double,
don't adjust your television sets</font>

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because, well, in a way, you are.</font>

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my right is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead
and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton.</font>

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to my left is Rick's stunt double,
Cliff Booth.</font>

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, gentlemen, and thanks
for taking the time to visit with us.</font>

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's our pleasure, Allen.</font>

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Rick, explain to the audience
exactly what it is a stunt double does.</font>

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.</font>

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say Jake Cahill gets shot off his horse.</font>

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, can I fall off a horse?</font>

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.</font>

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But say I fall off wrong and I sprain
my wrist or I twist my ankle.</font>

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that can put an undue burden on production
because now maybe I can't work for a week.</font>

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Cliff here is meant
to help carry the load.</font>

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?</font>

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, carrying his load? Yeah,
that's about right.</font>

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Join me next week on the set of
<i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i></font>

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where I'll be talking to those comical
cutups, Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.</font>

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.</font>

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you.</font>

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The black one. And the flowers.
- Flowers, Ava, flowers.</font>

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And there's the small one.
- Can I see your tickets?</font>

39
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good boy.</font>

40
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gina, Gina, Gina.</font>

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The face in the misty light.</font>

42
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.</font>

43
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh... I have a meeting with
a very handsome cowboy man.</font>

44
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's waiting for you in the bar.</font>

45
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

46
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since I just finished watching
a Rick Dalton fucking film festival,</font>

47
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I know who you are. Put it there.</font>

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's my pleasure, Mr. Schwartz.</font>

49
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And thank you for taking an interest.
- Schwarz, not Schwartz.</font>

50
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it to hell. I'm sorry about that.</font>

51
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.</font>

52
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marvin, call me Rick.</font>

53
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rick?
- Yeah.</font>

54
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, is that your son? Ha-ha.
- My son?</font>

55
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's my stunt double, Cliff Booth.</font>

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Good to meet you.</font>

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've worked together
since the last two seasons of <i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

58
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop, so he gave me a ride.</font>

59
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's a big fucking lie.</i></font>

60
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rick got his driver's license taken away
for too many drunk-driving tickets.</i></font>

61
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Cliff drives him everywhere now.</i>
- Oh, fuck.</font>

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, sounds like a good friend.
- I try.</font>

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna send you greetings from my wife,
Mary Alice Schwarz.</font>

64
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that's nice.</font>

65
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks a lot.</font>

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a Rick Dalton double feature
in our screening room last night.</font>

67
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that's both flattering
and embarrassing.</font>

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you see?</font>

69
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:43,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">35 mm prints of <i>Tanner</i>
and <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i></font>

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope the, uh, Rick Dalton double feature</font>

71
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wasn't too painful for you and the...
And the missus.</font>

72
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. "Painful." Stop. What are you saying?</font>

73
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.
Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns.</i></font>

74
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here you go.
- Thanks.</font>

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And we thoroughly enjoyed</i> Tanner.</font>

76
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, that's nice.
- It's really good. And anyway, she goes to bed.</font>

77
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i></font>

78
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I light up,
I pour myself a cognac and I watch...</i></font>

79
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i></font>

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a picture.</font>

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.</font>

82
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is so much fun.</font>

83
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the shooting.</font>

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I love that stuff. You know, the killing.
- A lot of killing. Lot of killing, yeah.</font>

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, gentlemen, the plan
is, we reverse our forces</font>

86
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">und drive the Allies back into the sea!</font>

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genius.
Panzer divisions come in,</font>

88
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we drive them here to the ocean.</font>

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be up against the wall.</font>

90
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.</font>

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the spot...</font>

92
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermann!</font>

93
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the curtains.</font>

94
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody order fried sauerkraut?!</font>

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn, you Nazi bastards! Ha-ha-ha!</font>

96
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you operating the
flamethrower, isn't it?</font>

97
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was.
Yeah, yeah.</font>

98
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,</font>

99
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's one shit-fuck crazy weapon
you do not wanna be on the wrong side of.</font>

100
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, oh, boy.</font>

101
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I practiced with that dragon, uh,</font>

102
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 hours a day for 2 weeks.</font>

103
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just because I wanted to look good
in the picture, but because I was...</font>

104
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was shit-scared of the damn
thing, to be honest.</font>

105
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mike fucking Lewis!</font>

106
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crisping them Nazis to hell!</font>

107
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit, that's...</font>

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, that's too hot.
Anything we can do about that heat?</font>

109
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.</font>

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I came to the office early today,</font>

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.</font>

112
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jody Janice,</font>

113
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wanted for cattle rustling in the
state of Wyoming, $425 dead or alive.</font>

114
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you brought him here to collect.</font>

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know where here is.</font>

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just the closest place.</font>

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caught up with him about
5 miles outside of town.</font>

118
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, bounty killer,</font>

119
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the name of this town is Janicetown.</font>

120
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that boy you killed...</font>

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was Jody Janice.</font>

122
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was the baby boy of
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.</font>

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?</font>

124
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll be sure and introduce you</font>

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he gets here.</font>

126
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

127
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Starring Rick Dalton.</i></font>

128
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then a couple of the jokers over in archival
sent over a kinescope of a little treat featuring you.</i></font>

129
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an old piano</font>

130
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they play it hot
Behind the green door</font>

131
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know what they're doing</font>

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door</font>

133
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish they'd let me in</font>

134
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I can find out
What's behind the green door♪</font>

135
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've been doing guest shots</font>

136
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on episodic TV shows the
last couple of years?</font>

137
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.
I'm doing a pilot for CBS right now.</font>

138
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called... It's called <i>Lancer.</i>
I play the heavy.</font>

139
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a, ahem, Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i></font>

140
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a <i>Land of the Giants. Green Hornet.</i></font>

141
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did that show, uh...</font>

142
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid Scott Brown. Yeah.</font>

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i> that airs this Sunday.</font>

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You always play the
bad guy on these shows?</font>

145
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

146
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, and they have a fight
scene at the end of them?</font>

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not... Not...
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i> or <i>F.B.I.,</i></font>

148
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?</font>

149
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm... I'm the heavy.</font>

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.</font>

151
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i> for example. Right?
- Mm-hm.</font>

152
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.</font>

153
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna build up his bona fides, right?</font>

154
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you hire a guy from a
canceled show to play the heavy.</font>

155
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then at the end of the show, when they fight,</font>

156
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's hero besting heavy.</font>

157
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what the audience sees</font>

158
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.</font>

159
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see?
- Mm-hm.</font>

160
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then next week, it's Ron Ely.</font>

161
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And next week, it's Bob Conrad,</font>

162
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wearing his tight pants, kicking your ass.</font>

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

164
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In another couple of years, playing punching
bag to every swinging dick new to the network,</font>

165
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's gonna have a psychological effect
on how the audience perceives you.</font>

166
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

167
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Rick,</font>

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?</font>

169
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mannix? The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?</font>

170
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?</font>

171
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about Batman and Robin?</font>

172
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ping! Pow! Choom! Zoom!</font>

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down goes you.</font>

174
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down goes your career as a leading man.</font>

175
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns</font>

176
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and win fucking fights?</font>

177
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ticket, señor?</font>

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, what's the matter, partner?
- Well...</font>

179
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's official, old buddy.</font>

180
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm a has-been.
- What are you talking about?</font>

181
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did that guy tell you?
- He told me the goddamn truth, is what he told me.</font>

182
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa.</font>

183
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, shit.
- Hey.</font>

184
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that.
- Here. Put these on.</font>

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.
- Son of a bitch.</font>

186
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what's got you so upset, man?</font>

187
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If coming face-to-face with the failure
that is your career ain't worth crying about,</font>

188
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- then I don't know what the fuck is.
- Right. That guy in there turn you down?</font>

189
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.</font>

190
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then what's the problem?
- I gotta do Italian goddamn movies!</font>

191
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.</font>

It doesn't matter whether I cry in public.</font>

I like driving you around.</font>

230

You ever seen an Italian Western, huh?</font>

- No, you haven't met him.</font>

249
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,472

- Why?</font>

250

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

251
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,836

253
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was Polanski.</font>

254

258
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.</font>

259
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't rent. Eddie O'Brien taught me that.</font>

260
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,631

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my next-door fucking neighbor.
Heh-heh.</font>

267
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, shit.
I mean, who knows what could happen?</font>

lines to learn for tomorrow.</font>

- All right.</font>

276
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, 7:15 a.m.
- 7-15.</font>

277
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Out the door.
- Out the door.</font>

278
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In the car.
- All right, see you then.</font>

279
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, coming in. Hello.</font>

280
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,717

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, sweetheart.</font>

283
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was your day?</font>

284
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait till you see what I got for you.</font>

285
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait until you see what I got for you.</font>

286
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what I got for you.</font>

287
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna blow your mind, man.</font>

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ho-ho-ho! Come here. Come here.</font>

289
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that a whine?</font>

290
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I tell you about whining?
You whine, you don't eat.</font>

291
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will throw this shit in the trash.
I don't wanna, but I will.</font>

292
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?</font>

293
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

294
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I waited at the bar till closing
time, but he never came back.</i></font>

295
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i></font>

296
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't know. Everything was fine.</i></font>

297
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We had dinner at my house.</i></font>

298
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- And afterwards, you know, while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.</font>

300
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then, at the club, Gabe was doing great.</i></font>

301
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i></font>

302
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i></font>

303
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.</font>

304

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepe, get your behind behind that bar!
I got a guest.</font>

307
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Johnny says...</i></font>

308
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i></font>

309
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- How's the beans?</i>
- I've had worse.</font>

310
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i></font>

311
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A toast.</i></font>

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my wife and all my sweethearts.</font>

313
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May they never meet.</font>

314
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Señor Madrid, care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?</font>

315
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I would be delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i></font>

316
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the bottle with you.</font>

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And Pepe comes over.</i></font>

318
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours with the fiddle?</font>

319
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She's asleep.</i></font>

320
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, wake her the heck up, get her down here with
her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guests.</font>

321
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sí, señor, but please don't
hurt her this time, I beg you.</i></font>

322
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't gonna hurt her.
Just want her to play the fiddle.</font>

323
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold
piece, she play her little chili pepper heart out.</font>

324
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Johnny, what else you heard about me?</font>

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard, but Lancer has money.</i></font>

326
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>At some point,
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.</i></font>

327
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

328
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll open the door for you.</font>

329
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look good.</font>

330
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think Steve's gonna be there too.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

331
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, look. They're here.</font>

332
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Playboy Mansion, Mr. Polanski.</font>

333
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how are you doing, baby?</font>

334
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! How are you?</font>

335
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Cass!</font>

336
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

337
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, baby!</font>

338
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

339
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

340
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna tell you a story.</font>

341
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was engaged to him.</font>

342
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then she flew to the UK...</font>

343
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make a film with him,</font>

344
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.</font>

345
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then they moved to Los Angeles,</font>

346
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the three of them have been inseparable.</font>

347
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

348
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

349
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jay loves Sharon, that's what's up.</font>

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he knows...</font>

351
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as sure as God made little green apples...</font>

352
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that one of these days,
that Polish prick's gonna fuck things up,</font>

353
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.</font>

354
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, one thing's for sure.</font>

355
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

356
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

357
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sharon absolutely has a type.</font>

358
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cute, short, talented guys who
look like 12-year-old boys.</font>

359
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

360
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never stood a chance.</font>

361
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, Dr. Sapirstein.</font>

362
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, here we are.</font>

363
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!</font>

364
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a sec. Hold on, guys.</font>

365
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>

366
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you can talk to him.
Just talk to him.</font>

367
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that set in place.
Hey.</font>

368
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahem. I think the wind blew down
my TV antenna last night,</font>

369
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so while I piss-fart around with wardrobe,
you mind going home and fixing it?</font>

370
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can. Can you talk to the
stunt gaffer about me today?</font>

371
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That way I'll know if I'm working this week or not.
- Yeah.</font>

372
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been meaning to tell you.</font>

373
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,</font>

374
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the gaffer from <i>The Green Hornet,</i>
so there really ain't no point.</font>

375
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.</font>

376
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need you. Not today.</font>

377
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go home, fix my antenna, do whatever.
See you at wrap.</font>

378
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

379
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.</font>

380
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey.</font>

381
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy, I'm Rick Dalton.
You know where I'm supposed to go?</font>

382
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer.
- Where's the makeup trailer?</font>

383
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight back the way you came, hard right.</font>

384
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

385
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick Dalton.</font>

386
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam Wanamaker.</font>

387
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Sam. Sorry about the wet hand.</font>

388
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm used to it with Yul.</font>

389
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you to know, I'm the one who cast you,
and I could not be more delighted you're doing this.</font>

390
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, thank you, Sam. I...
I appreciate it. It's a good part.</font>

391
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, it is. Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?
- Uh...</font>

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not yet, no. No.
- Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.</font>

393
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. Mm. Well, it sounds exciting.</font>

394
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, lightning in a bottle.</font>

395
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?
- Hi.</font>

396
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And this is Rebekka, who does costumes.
- Hello.</font>

397
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Howdy.</font>

398
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want a whole new look for Caleb.</font>

399
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want this Western costumed
the way they costumed <i>The Big Valley</i></font>

400
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and <i>Bonanza</i> for the last decade.</font>

401
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.</font>

402
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, nothing anachronistic,
but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?</font>

403
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.</font>

404
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mm. Mm.
- First off, I want to give him a mustache.</font>

405
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A big, droopy, Zapata-like mustache.</font>

406
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, about his jacket.</font>

407
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to give him a hippie jacket.</font>

408
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight</font>

409
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and look like the hippest guy in the room.
- Far out.</font>

410
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a Custerjacket.
Fringes all down the arm.</font>

411
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,
he could hit the Strip in it tonight.</font>

412
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my girl.</font>

413
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?</font>

414
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go with a different hairstyle.</font>

415
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Something more hippie-ish.</font>

416
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You... You...
You want me to look like a hippie?</font>

417
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, think less hippie, more...</font>

418
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hells Angel!</font>

419
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...</font>

420
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam. Sam, uh...</font>

421
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you got me covered up in all this...</font>

422
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This junk, how's the
audience gonna know it's me?</font>

423
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I hope they don't.
- Mm.</font>

424
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.</font>

425
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want them to see Caleb.</font>

426
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hired you to be an actor, Rick.</font>

427
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a TV cowboy. You're better than that.</font>

428
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i></font>

429
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>he's best friends with Randy,
the gaffer from</i> The Green Hornet,</font>

430
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>so there really ain't no point.</i></font>

431
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Randy.</font>

432
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cliff.</font>

433
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you're still with Rick, huh?
- Still here.</font>

434
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He in there?
- Yeah. Just knock.</font>

435
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, just put him in the
wardrobe, all right?</font>

436
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it gonna hurt?
Then if you need him, you got him, all right?</font>

437
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,</font>

438
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
I just don't... Please, I...</font>

439
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Randy,
I'm asking you to help me out, man.</font>

440
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the answer's no, the answer's
no, not no with excuses.</font>

441
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man.</font>

442
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't a fucking Andy
McLaglen picture, you know?</font>

443
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes</font>

444
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sit around talking to each other all day
on the chance that I might use them.</font>

445
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a 4-man team here, Rick. If I need
more than that, I gotta get it approved.</font>

446
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.</font>

447
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,</font>

448
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"
but that's not the case, and you know it.</font>

449
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's a great fucking match for me.
- Yeah, no...</font>

450
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you could do anything you want to him.
Shit, throw him off a building, right?</font>

451
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Light him on fire.
Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?</font>

452
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get creative. Do whatever you want.
He's just happy for the opportunity.</font>

453
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rick.
- Yeah?</font>

454
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't dig him.</font>

455
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.</font>

456
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, is there some old
beef between the two of you?</font>

457
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?</font>

458
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dude killed his fucking wife.</font>

459
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man. You don't
believe that old shit, do you?</font>

460
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Rick, I do.</font>

461
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I work with my wife, and she believes it.</font>

462
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She doesn't want his creepy ass around.</font>

463
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this is probably
the shittiest weather ever.</font>

464
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat
with the shittiest person.</font>

465
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie, my sister, said, "He's a loser.
He's a loser."</font>

466
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all said it, "He's a fucking loser,"
and I didn't believe them.</font>

467
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.</font>

468
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're not gonna talk to me?</font>

469
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you don't feel like fighting?</font>

470
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I feel like fucking fighting</font>

471
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I've been up here by myself for four
hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.</font>

472
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

473
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a goddamn war hero. Fuck.</font>

474
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, appreciate it.</font>

475
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.</font>

476
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,
but you don't stunt, I don't pay you.</font>

477
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Appreciate the opportunity, Randy.
I won't let you down.</font>

478
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know my wife Janet, don't you?
- Yeah.</font>

479
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steer clear of her.</font>

480
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.</font>

481
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I admire is, in his sport,
there's an element of true combat.</font>

482
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the
ring, that's not two athletes posturing.</font>

483
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's combat.</font>

484
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two men trying to kill each other right now.</font>

485
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't beat him...</font>

486
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he kills you.</font>

487
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's beyond athletics.</font>

488
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's beyond <i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?</font>

489
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's two warriors engaged in combat.
That's what I admire.</font>

490
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In martial arts tournaments,
they won't let you fight like that.</font>

491
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very frustrating.</font>

492
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stand in front of a guy,
and you just wanna let him have it.</font>

493
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't.</font>

494
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.</font>

495
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston. Joe Louis.</font>

496
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.</font>

497
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do what they need to do to win.</font>

498
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They unleash as much punishment as
they have to to defeat the other guy.</font>

499
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in martial arts tournaments,
I do to win what they do to win.</font>

500
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I unleash all my power.</font>

501
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kill people.</font>

502
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?</font>

503
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that would never happen.</font>

504
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MAN: But if you did,
what do you think would happen?</font>

505
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd make him a cripple.</font>

506
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you. What's your name?</font>

507
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Me?
- Yeah, you.</font>

508
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name's Cliff.</font>

509
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.</font>

510
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stuntman?
- Yeah.</font>

511
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.</font>

512
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what they tell me.</font>

513
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I say something funny, stuntman?</font>

514
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?</font>

515
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I don't want any trouble.
I'm just here to do a job.</font>

516
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're laughing at what I'm saying.
But I'm not saying anything funny.</font>

517
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you think is so funny?</font>

518
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I think is...</font>

519
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're a little man with a
big mouth and a big chip,</font>

520
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think you should be embarrassed</font>

521
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to suggest you'd be anything more than a
stain on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.</font>

522
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.</font>

523
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would really enjoy closing it,
especially in front of all my friends.</font>

524
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.</font>

525
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means, we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you, I go to jail.</font>

526
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody accidentally kills anybody
in a fight, they go to jail.</font>

527
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called manslaughter. And I think
all that "lethal weapon" horseshit</font>

528
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is just an excuse so you dancers
never have to get in a real fight.</font>

529
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

530
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a friendly contest?</font>

531
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No punching in the face.</font>

532
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 out of 3.</font>

533
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who puts who on the ground first?</font>

534
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?</font>

535
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a great idea, Kato.</font>

536
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, Bruce, that guy's kind of famous.
- That guy?</font>

537
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

538
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed his wife and got away with it.</font>

539
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy?</font>

540
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy.</font>

541
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, Kato.</font>

542
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try that again.</font>

543
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

544
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is going on here?</font>

545
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.
What the fuck are you thinking?</font>

546
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that.</font>

547
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking "Janet" me, you prick.</font>

548
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. What's up, babe?</font>

549
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, Randy, is that your loser asshole,</font>

550
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wife-killing buddy boy here was beating
the shit out of Bruce.</font>

551
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

552
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.</font>

553
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck, man?</font>

554
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just say,
nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.</font>

555
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.</font>

556
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that dent in the car
says something different.</font>

557
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

558
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck did you do to my car?!</font>

559
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck did you do to her car?</font>

560
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I threw this little prick into it,
but I did not know it was her car.</font>

561
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!</font>

562
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Janet!
- What?</font>

563
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will handle this.
- Then fucking handle it, Randy.</font>

564
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cliff...</font>

565
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get the wardrobe off, get your
shit, and get off the lot.</font>

566
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fair enough.</font>

567
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aww. What's the matter?</font>

568
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you
were dancing to Paul Revere and the Raiders?</font>

569
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they not cool enough for you?</font>

570
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this shaggy asshole?</font>

571
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Can I help you?</font>

572
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Hey, man. I'm looking for Terry.</font>

573
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a friend of Terry's and Dennis Wilson's.</font>

574
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.
This is the Polanski residence now.</font>

575
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? He moved?</font>

576
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dang.</font>

577
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...? You know where?</font>

578
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure, really, but the owner of the
property, Paul, might. He's in the guest house.</font>

579
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is it, Jay?</font>

580
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, honey. It's a friend of Terry's.</font>

581
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, just take the back path.
- Thank you kindly.</font>

582
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>

583
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.</font>

584
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know theyjust broke for lunch, but you need
to wait at least an hour before you can eat.</font>

585
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.</font>

586
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my book.
Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?</font>

587
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just go straight through the Western town, take
a right and a left, and you see it right there.</font>

588
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah, that's better. That's better. Yeah.</font>

589
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we move to number 2?</font>

590
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is his bounce?</font>

591
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a bounce there?</font>

592
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.</font>

593
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just make it a quick one.</font>

594
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.</font>

595
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

596
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

597
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

598
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would it bother you if I sat next to you
and read my book too?</font>

599
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

600
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you bother me?</font>

601
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll try not to.</font>

602
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>

603
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bleh.</font>

604
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Sorry about that.</font>

605
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't eat lunch?</font>

606
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a scene after lunch.</font>

607
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

608
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.</font>

609
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe it's the job of an actor...
And I say "actor," not "actress,"</font>

610
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the word "actress" is nonsensical.</font>

611
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the actor's job to avoid
impediments to their performance.</font>

612
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.</font>

613
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...</font>

614
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's meaningful.</font>

615
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.</font>

616
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mar... Marabella what?</font>

617
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marabella Lancer.</font>

618
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?</font>

619
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we're on set, I'd prefer to only
be referred to by my character's name.</font>

620
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It helps me invest in
the reality of the story.</font>

621
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've tried it both ways, and I'm always just a
tiny bit better when I don't break character.</font>

622
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I can be a tiny bit
better, I want to be.</font>

623
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau.</font>

624
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was pronounced Caleb "Dakota."</font>

625
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty sure it's "DeCoteau."</font>

626
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- DeCoteau.
- Mm-hm.</font>

627
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DeCoteau. DeCoteau.</font>

628
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm.</font>

629
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you reading?</font>

630
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a biography on Walt Disney.</font>

631
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fascinating.</font>

632
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a genius, you know.</font>

633
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, a once-in-every-50-or-100-years
kind of genius.</font>

634
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, 12?</font>

635
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm 8.</font>

636
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you reading?</font>

637
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a Western.</font>

638
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean? Is it good?</font>

639
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pretty good.
- What's the story?</font>

640
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't finished it yet.</font>

641
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't ask for the whole story.</font>

642
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the idea of the story?</font>

643
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

644
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.</font>

645
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the story of his life.</font>

646
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guy's name is Tom Breezy,</font>

647
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.</font>

648
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s</font>

649
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and young and good-looking,</font>

650
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he could break any horse
that you could throw at him.</font>

651
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back then, he just had a way.</font>

652
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now he's into his late 30's and he takes
a bad fall, and it messes up his hip.</font>

653
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not... He's not... He's not
crippled or anything like that, but...</font>

654
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's got spine problems he never
had before, and he spends, uh...</font>

655
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.</font>

656
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.</font>

657
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's not bad.</font>

658
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you in it?</font>

659
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About midway.</font>

660
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening to Easy Breezy now?</font>

661
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's, um... He...</font>

662
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not the best anymore.</font>

663
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, far from it. And...</font>

664
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...</font>

665
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">use...</font>

666
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slightly more useless each day.</font>

667
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Caleb.</font>

668
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

669
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds like a really sad book.</font>

670
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor Easy Breezy.</font>

671
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm practically crying and
I haven't even read it.</font>

672
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- About 15 years, you'll be living it.
- What?</font>

673
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, pumpkin puss. I'm just...</font>

674
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just teasing you.</font>

675
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something? You, uh...</font>

676
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might be right about this book.</font>

677
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.</font>

678
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like names like "pumpkin puss,"</font>

679
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but since you're upset,
we'll talk about that some other time.</font>

680
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.
- Hey, beggars can't be choosers.</font>

681
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on in.
- Thanks.</font>

682
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.</font>

683
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.</font>

684
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.</font>

685
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take care.
- You too.</font>

686
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, hey.
- Hello.</font>

687
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help you, young lady?</font>

688
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

689
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to pick up a first edition of Thomas
Hardy's <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.</font>

690
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's under Polanski.</font>

691
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you're talking books there, kid.
- Oh, I know.</font>

692
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah. Oh, man.</font>

693
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just read it.
- Yeah.</font>

694
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.</font>

695
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.</font>

696
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim Stacy. This is my show. Welcome aboard.</font>

697
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're real glad to have a pro like you
playing the heavy on the pilot.</font>

698
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I gotta tell you, I came damn close
to being in <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i></font>

699
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No kidding.
- Yeah.</font>

700
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you, I...</font>

701
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got my part by sheer luck.</font>

702
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up until two weeks before
shooting, Fabian was in the part.</font>

703
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he breaks his shoulder doing a
<i>Virginian.</i> That's how I got it, so...</font>

704
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

705
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.</font>

706
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it true you almost got the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i></font>

707
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.</font>

708
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 17 escape attempts.
- 18.</font>

709
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never had an audition. Never had a meeting.
Never met John Sturges.</font>

710
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, no, I don't think you could say I...</font>

711
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost got the part, but...</font>

712
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.</font>

713
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I suppose what's called in the American Army a hotshot pilot.
- Tsk.</font>

714
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the story goes, for a brief moment,</font>

715
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">McQueen almost passed on the movie,
and during that brief moment,</font>

716
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, apparently, was on a list of four.</font>

717
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have other plans?</font>

718
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't seen Berlin yet from the ground or
from the air, and I plan on doing both before the war's over.</font>

719
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and who?</font>

720
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?</font>

721
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.</font>

722
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, man.
- Yeah.</font>

723
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gotta hurt.</font>

724
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I didn't get it,</font>

725
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">McQueen did it,</font>

726
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, frankly, I never had a chance.</font>

727
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 days isolation, Hilts.</font>

728
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Hilts.</font>

729
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">20 days.</font>

730
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

731
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?</font>

732
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cooler.</font>

733
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One, please.
- 75 cents.</font>

734
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I'm in the movie?</font>

735
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

736
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'm in the movie.</font>

737
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Sharon Tate.</font>

738
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.</font>

739
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I play Miss Carlson, the Klutz.</font>

740
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>

741
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i></font>

742
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's me,
the girl from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i></font>

743
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Really.</font>

744
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Rubin! Come out here.</font>

745
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i></font>

746
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.</font>

747
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.</font>

748
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who ends up doing dirty movies.</font>

749
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ohh.</font>

750
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's in this movie.
- Sharon Tate.</font>

751
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.
Thank you for coming to our theater.</font>

752
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you like to come in and see the show?
- Could I?</font>

753
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By all means.</font>

754
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

755
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, can I get a picture?
- Oh, sure.</font>

756
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

757
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, why don't you stand over by the
poster so people will know who you are.</font>

758
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Could you?</font>

759
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like some refreshments?</font>

760
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.</font>

761
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can I ask you a personal question?</i>
<i>I wish you would.</i></font>

762
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How did a nice boy like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i></font>

763
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I turned to them after I was rejected
by the Daughters of the American Revolution.</i></font>

764
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i></font>

765
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Mr. Helm?
- Yes?</i></font>

766
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh!</i></font>

767
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm Freya.</i></font>

768
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Welcome to Denmark, Mr. Helm.</i></font>

769
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- These are for you. Street maps, places of interest.
- Hm.</i></font>

770
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- This is for you too.
- Hm.</i></font>

771
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>What year was that?
- 1949.</i></font>

772
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>Oh, that's a very good year.
- I'm here to help you in any way I can.</i></font>

773
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- That's very nice of you.
- Is there anything you'd like me to do?</i></font>

774
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Yes, ma'am, a couple things.
- Yes, sir.</i></font>

775
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i></font>

776
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.</i></font>

777
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.</i></font>

778
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm sorry about...</i></font>

779
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Welcome to Denmark.</i></font>

780
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is some kind of hotel you've got here.</i></font>

781
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Half a bottle is better than none.</i></font>

782
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, partner.</font>

783
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably come by to see you later.</font>

784
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's far enough, jughead.</font>

785
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name's not jughead.</font>

786
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you doing around here, boy?</font>

787
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thirsty. That's a saloon, ain't it?</font>

788
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, that's a saloon.</font>

789
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.</font>

790
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.</font>

791
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how bored and restless you get
when you run out of tamales.</font>

792
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, Mr. Gilbert, if I was you,</font>

793
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd find out that jughead's name.</font>

794
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to introduce the two of you.</font>

795
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This here is Bob Gilbert.</font>

796
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Businessman?</font>

797
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

798
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?</font>

799
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a fella by the name of Madrid.</font>

800
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Johnny Madrid.</font>

801
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Johnny Madrid?</font>

802
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He ain't from round here.</font>

803
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, really.</font>

804
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is he, Caleb?</font>

805
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're about to find out...</font>

806
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Businessman.</font>

807
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready when you are, Gilbert.</font>

808
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Johnny Madrid.</font>

809
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long has it been?</font>

810
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since that time in
Juárez, about 3 years ago.</font>

811
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, come on in and have a drink.</font>

812
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, in that case...</font>

813
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">buy you a drink, Caleb?</font>

814
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, Johnny.</font>

815
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about some mezcal?</font>

816
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like that time in Juárez.</font>

817
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of people died that day.</font>

818
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, they did.</font>

819
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we had a good time.</font>

820
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't we?</font>

821
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we did.</font>

822
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you, DeCoteau.</font>

823
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepe! Get your behind behind that bar.</font>

824
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a guest.</font>

825
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's the beans?</font>

826
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had worse.</font>

827
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 dollar.</font>

828
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my wife and all my sweethearts.</font>

829
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May they never meet.</font>

830
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Señor Madrid, you care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?</font>

831
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.</font>

832
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the bottle with you.</font>

833
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Johnny...</font>

834
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what brings you to Arroyo del Oro?</font>

835
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know me, Caleb.</font>

836
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Money.</font>

837
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who's paying around here?</font>

838
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you.</font>

839
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

840
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what have you heard about me?</font>

841
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard about the Lancer Ranch.</font>

842
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the cattle you've appropriated.</font>

843
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of land, a lot of cows,
a lot of money, no law to speak of,</font>

844
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing but an old man
and some Mexican ranch hands to shoo you off.</font>

845
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours with the fiddle?</font>

846
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's asleep.</font>

847
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:55,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake her the heck up, get her down here with her
fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guest.</font>

848
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, please, don't hurt her this time.</font>

849
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't gonna hurt her.</font>

850
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want her to play the fiddle.</font>

851
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Line? "Go... Go fetch her and tell her" what?</font>

852
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece..."</font>

853
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,</font>

854
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she play her little chili
pepper heart out, right?</font>

855
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Got it.</font>

856
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't gonna hurt her.</font>

857
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want her to play the fiddle.</font>

858
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,</font>

859
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she play her little chili pepper heart out.</font>

860
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

861
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Johnny,</font>

862
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what else you heard? Hmm?</font>

863
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,</font>

864
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Lancer's got money.</font>

865
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At some point,</font>

866
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's gonna hire some guns</font>

867
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and push back.</font>

868
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."</font>

869
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe...</font>

870
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goddamn it! I fucked this whole thing up, Sam.
- Keep going!</font>

871
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.</font>

872
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we just go back? Please, can we just cut?</font>

873
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, really, Sam, please.</font>

874
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Maybe he already has."
All right, all right!</font>

875
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!</font>

876
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right! Whoo!</font>

877
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a goddamn outlaw, Rick. Come on, now.
Ahem. Whoo!</font>

878
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it. I got it.</font>

879
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back a bit, would you?</font>

880
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's right. Back to one.</font>

881
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.</font>

882
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.</font>

883
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hm. I'm gonna use it.</font>

884
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And...</font>

885
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">action.</font>

886
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,</font>

887
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,360

891
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

892
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I don't like Lancer.</font>

893
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I don't like his boots.</font>

894
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I don't like the way
he uses those boots to step on people.</font>

895
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck was that?!</font>

896
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!</font>

897
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

898
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piece of shit.</font>

899
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.</font>

900
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgot your fucking lines, embarrassed yourself
like that in front of all those goddamn people!</font>

901
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:03,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you were drinking all night, fucking drinking
again, 8 goddamn fucking whiskey sours.</font>

902
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking bullshit.</font>

903
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking miserable drunk.</font>

904
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.</font>

905
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I practiced them, and now I don't
look like I goddamn practiced them!</font>

906
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sitting there like a fucking baboon!</font>

907
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! 8 fucking whiskey sours.</font>

908
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't stop at fucking 3 or 4.
I have 8!</font>

909
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?! You're a fucking alcoholic.
You fucking drink too much, huh?</font>

910
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every fucking night. Every fucking night.</font>

911
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it, that's fucking it!</font>

912
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fucking it.</font>

913
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stop drinking right now, all right?</font>

914
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a promise to yourself.
You're gonna stop fucking drinking.</font>

915
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck it.</font>

916
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

917
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:52,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You show that little fucking girl.
You're gonna show that goddamn Jim Stacy.</font>

918
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna show all of them on that goddamn
fucking set who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?</font>

919
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something.</font>

920
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get these lines right,</font>

921
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna blow your
fucking brains out tonight.</font>

922
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Your brains are gonna be
splattered all over your goddamn pool.</font>

923
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean it, motherfucker.</font>

924
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your shit together.</font>

925
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Better? Okay.
- It's great.</font>

926
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

927
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

928
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

929
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, you fucking pig!</font>

930
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

931
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, hot stuff.</font>

932
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Looks like third time's the charm.
- Mm.</font>

933
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How were those pickles?</font>

934
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real good. They were the fancy kind.</font>

935
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mm.
- Mm.</font>

936
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a lift?</font>

937
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

938
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to Chatsworth.</font>

939
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chatsworth?</font>

940
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day
till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?</font>

941
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tourists love to drive me.</font>

942
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm their favorite part of their L.A.
vacation, you know?</font>

943
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl</font>

944
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they gave a ride to the movie ranch
for the rest of their lives.</font>

945
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?</font>

946
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- That's where you're going? Spahn Movie Ranch?</font>

947
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh.
- Why you going there?</font>

948
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I live there.</font>

949
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Alone?
- No.</font>

950
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and my friends.</font>

951
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:25,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you and a bunch of friends like
you all live at Spahn Movie Ranch?</font>

952
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

953
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hop in. I'll take you there.</font>

954
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great!</font>

955
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.
- I know where it is.</font>

956
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?</font>

957
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

958
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

959
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just surprised how accurate
that description of me really is.</font>

960
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies
at Spahn Ranch.</font>

961
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you used to make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?</font>

962
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:16,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if by "the old-timey days,"
you mean television 8 years ago, yeah.</font>

963
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you an actor?</font>

964
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm a stuntman.</font>

965
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a stuntman.</font>

966
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's way better.</font>

967
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that way better?</font>

968
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actors are phony.</font>

969
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- They just say lines that other people write</font>

970
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.</font>

971
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, real people are being murdered
every day in Vietnam.</font>

972
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want me to suck your cock while driving?</font>

973
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old are you?</font>

974
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

975
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old are you?</font>

976
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, man.</font>

977
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the first time anybody
asked that in a long time.</font>

978
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the answer?</font>

979
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We gonna play kiddie games?</font>

980
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18. Feel better?</font>

981
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got some ID, you know,
like a driver's license or something?</font>

982
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you joking?</font>

983
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not.</font>

984
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:50,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to see something official that verifies that
you're 18, which you don't have because you're not.</font>

985
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.</font>

986
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you.</font>

987
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

988
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.</font>

989
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.</font>

990
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm too old to do is
go to jail for Poontang.</font>

991
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prison's been trying to get me all my life.
It ain't got me yet.</font>

992
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The day it does,</font>

993
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it won't be because of you.</font>

994
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense.</font>

995
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You all right, honey?</i></font>

996
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?</font>

997
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm fine, Scott.</i></font>

998
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They haven't hurt you?</i>
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.</font>

999
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right out.</font>

1000
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The war.</i></font>

1001
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I rode with the British cavalry in Indi...</i></font>

1002
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand by, guys. We're going in 5.</font>

1003
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lancer's boys are here!</font>

1004
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old man here?</font>

1005
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nada.</font>

1006
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the son is.</font>

1007
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Heh-heh.</font>

1008
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one from Boston.</font>

1009
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1010
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You from Boston?</font>

1011
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1012
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Boston one!</font>

1013
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep the others outside.</font>

1014
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the brother come in.</font>

1015
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard him, Boston.</font>

1016
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on in, Boston. Heh.</font>

1017
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, honey?</font>

1018
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you they'd come to parlay.</font>

1019
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, honey?</font>

1020
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, she's just fine.</font>

1021
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you, shorty?</font>

1022
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, Scott.</font>

1023
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They haven't hurt you?</font>

1024
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet, I ain't.</font>

1025
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that can all change...</font>

1026
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like that.</font>

1027
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say...</font>

1028
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where'd you get that limp?</font>

1029
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- From the war.
- Mm.</font>

1030
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which side?</font>

1031
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rode with the British cavalry in India.</font>

1032
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd they call that outfit?</font>

1033
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bengal Lancers.</font>

1034
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, now, now, that is funny.</font>

1035
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.</font>

1036
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you get it?</font>

1037
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Bengal Lancer"? Hm?</font>

1038
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1039
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it now.</font>

1040
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is kind of funny.
- It is.</font>

1041
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do know kidnapping is a hanging offense.</font>

1042
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So is blowing the heads off little girls.</font>

1043
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they can only hang me once, right?</font>

1044
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1045
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you come down here for a...</font>

1046
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a Boston social?</font>

1047
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?</font>

1048
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say $50,000 would buy me</font>

1049
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.</font>

1050
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a lot of money.</font>

1051
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she's a lot of little girl.</font>

1052
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or don't you agree?</font>

1053
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I agree.</font>

1054
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's next?</font>

1055
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch
to fill you in on all the details...</font>

1056
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the one detail I'm gonna
fill you in on right now is this:</font>

1057
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:41,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want no beaner bronco buster
handing me that $50,000.</font>

1058
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want the old man himself.</font>

1059
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:50,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...</font>

1060
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I heave this little pitcher down a well!</font>

1061
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got that, Boston?!</font>

1062
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1063
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1064
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, messenger boy.</font>

1065
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deliver my message.</font>

1066
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.</font>

1067
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Settle into it.</font>

1068
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy it.</font>

1069
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And cut!</font>

1070
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

1071
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella, with that throw, did I?</font>

1072
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. I'm good. I got pads on.</font>

1073
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I throw myself on the floor just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.</font>

1074
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gate's clean.</font>

1075
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick, Rick, Rick.</font>

1076
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put her there.</font>

1077
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was it.
- Really?</font>

1078
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was absolutely fantastic.</font>

1079
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.</font>

1080
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, and your idea about throwing the little girl
on the ground, that just worked like a charm.</font>

1081
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I figured you said Shakespeare, so... Yeah.
- That's right. That was...</font>

1082
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I mean by "scare me."</font>

1083
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.</font>

1084
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...</font>

1085
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.</font>

1086
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where the hell did that come from?
- I don't know. Improv.</font>

1087
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was wonderful. It was just...
That was a triple alliterative improv.</font>

1088
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't hear those too often.</font>

1089
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay? We're all good.
- All right. We don't...?</font>

1090
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done. That was fantastic.</font>

1091
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- Okay, moving on. We're in the bordello.</font>

1092
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next setup!</font>

1093
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the best acting I've
ever seen in my whole life.</font>

1094
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1095
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick fucking Dalton.</font>

1096
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a car.</font>

1097
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a strange car.</font>

1098
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snake, go see who's outside.</font>

1099
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So who is it?</font>

1100
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't for sure yet.</font>

1101
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.</font>

1102
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep an eye on him.</font>

1103
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1104
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell is everybody?</font>

1105
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where's Gypsy?</font>

1106
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's down by the chop shop.</font>

1107
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Hello!</font>

1108
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gypsy! I want you to come meet my new friend.</font>

1109
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:08,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some old-looking dude in a Hawaiian
shirt who just gave Pussycat a ride home.</font>

1110
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just gave her a lift?</font>

1111
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope. She's bringing him
down the ranch to meet everybody.</font>

1112
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.</font>

1113
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.</font>

1114
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.</font>

1115
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think nothing of it.</font>

1116
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We love Pussy.</font>

1117
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we do.</font>

1118
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?</font>

1119
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody left for Santa Barbara.</font>

1120
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1121
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlie's gone? Everybody left?</font>

1122
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not everybody-everybody,
but mostly everybody.</font>

1123
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drag.</font>

1124
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really wanted Cliff to meet Charlie.</font>

1125
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Charlie's really gonna dig you.</font>

1126
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.</font>

1127
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you got to come back.</font>

1128
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

1129
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how's it all comparing to your glory days?</font>

1130
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, things have changed.</font>

1131
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a bad mount, Connie.</font>

1132
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to ride horses every
day back in Tennessee.</font>

1133
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that right?
- Every day?</font>

1134
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, every week.</font>

1135
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1136
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't she just darling?</font>

1137
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So my name is Lulu.</font>

1138
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Tex.</font>

1139
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:33,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna be leading you on a great trail ride
through the beautiful Santa Susana canyons.</font>

1140
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Curt, I hear you're
already an experienced rider.</font>

1141
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?</font>

1142
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex?</font>

1143
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come here.
- So if you're both experienced riders,</font>

1144
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:47,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.</font>

1145
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready to have some fun?</font>

1146
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Pussycat brought back some guy with her.</font>

1147
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gypsy wants you to go give him a look-see.
- Yeah. Sure thing.</font>

1148
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and here's someone you
absolutely have to meet.</font>

1149
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of our most favorite sons.</font>

1150
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:22,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tex, come on over here and say hi to Cliff.</font>

1151
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.</font>

1152
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.</font>

1153
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copeville.</font>

1154
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Ever been to Houston?</font>

1155
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Course I have.</font>

1156
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I spent 2 weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.</font>

1157
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In August, no less.</font>

1158
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.</font>

1159
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.</font>

1160
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man...</font>

1161
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlie's gonna dig you.</font>

1162
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hawaiian guy seems to be okay.</font>

1163
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's talking all friendly.</font>

1164
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy your day!
Thank you.</font>

1165
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.</font>

1166
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he comes this way, let me know.</font>

1167
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, does George Spahn still own this ranch?</font>

1168
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, George still owns it.</font>

1169
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.</font>

1170
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he still live right there?</font>

1171
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1172
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he here now?</font>

1173
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess so.</font>

1174
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So George gave you all permission to be here?</font>

1175
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Course he did.</font>

1176
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And y'all take care of him?</font>

1177
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we take care of George.</font>

1178
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We love George.</font>

1179
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anything wrong
with me saying hello to an old friend?</font>

1180
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't see him right now.</font>

1181
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I see him right now?</font>

1182
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he's napping.</font>

1183
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is his nap time.</font>

1184
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.</font>

1185
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never know.</font>

1186
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He might have just woke up.</font>

1187
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.</font>

1188
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, y'all, beat it.</font>

1189
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll handle this guy.</font>

1190
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1191
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You the mama bear?</font>

1192
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I help you?
- I hope so.</font>

1193
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.</font>

1194
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very nice of you,
but unfortunately, you picked the wrong time.</font>

1195
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George is taking a nap right now.</font>

1196
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that is unfortunate.</font>

1197
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it is.</font>

1198
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.</font>

1199
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know George?</font>

1200
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.</font>

1201
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When was the last time you saw George?</font>

1202
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'd say about...</font>

1203
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8 years ago.</font>

1204
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1205
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.</font>

1206
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he wakes up,
I'll let him know you came by.</font>

1207
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd really like to say a quick
hello now while I'm here.</font>

1208
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Came a long ways.</font>

1209
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know when I'll get back this way again.</font>

1210
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I understand,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.</font>

1211
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible?</font>

1212
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that impossible?</font>

1213
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because me and George like to watch TV
on Sunday night... <i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i></font>

1214
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but George finds it hard to keep awake
that late, so I make him take a nap now</font>

1215
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I don't get gypped
out of my George TV time.</font>

1216
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

1217
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:31,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.</font>

1218
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With my own two eyes,
I'm gonna get a good look at George.</font>

1219
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this...</font>

1220
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ain't stopping me.</font>

1221
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1222
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suit yourself.</font>

1223
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He back there?</font>

1224
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Door at the end of the hallway.</font>

1225
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might have to shake him awake.
I fucked his brains out this morning.</font>

1226
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He may be tired.</font>

1227
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Mr. 8 Years Ago?</font>

1228
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George is blind, so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.</font>

1229
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George, you awake?</font>

1230
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George?</font>

1231
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George?</font>

1232
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George?</font>

1233
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:50,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- George!
- Jesus.</font>

1234
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.</font>

1235
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.</font>

1236
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Who are you?</font>

1237
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Cliff Booth.</font>

1238
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doing.
- John Wilkes Booth?</font>

1239
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Cliff Booth.</font>

1240
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's that?</font>

1241
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to shoot <i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.</font>

1242
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.</font>

1243
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who?
- Rick Dalton.</font>

1244
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dalton Brothers?</font>

1245
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Rick Dalton.</font>

1246
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's that?</font>

1247
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was the star of <i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

1248
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who are you?</font>

1249
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was Rick's stunt double.</font>

1250
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rick who?
- Uh...</font>

1251
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It don't matter, George.</font>

1252
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:40,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were colleagues from the past, and I
just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.</font>

1253
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?</font>

1254
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't see shit.
Would you call that "the matter"?</font>

1255
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:50,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The man can't see shit, okay?
- I know. I'm sorry about that. I was told.</font>

1256
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Squeaky sent me to bed.</font>

1257
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would that be the little redhead out front?</font>

1258
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,600

1259
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First you wake me up, and now you're
pretending that I didn't tell you</font>

1260
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was fucking blind!</font>

- Come on, George. All right.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you touched me today.</font>

1268
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came to visit me.</font>

1269
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I got to go back to sleep.</font>

1270
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to watch <i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.</font>

1271
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I watch it with Squeaky.</font>

1272
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.</font>

1273
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens when she gets pissed
off, George?</font>

1274
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1275
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't like to disappoint her.</font>

1276
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?</font>

1277
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just who the fuck are you?</font>

1278

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Cliff Booth.</font>

1279
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a stuntman.
We used to work together, George.</font>

1280
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just want to make sure you're okay.</font>

1281
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.</font>

1282
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:38,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Squeaky?
- Yeah.</font>

1283
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She loves me.</font>

1284
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So suck on that.</font>

1285
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take care, George.</font>

1286
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it.</font>

1287
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You embarrassed me.</font>

1288
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sorry about that.</font>

1289
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:35,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd your little talk with George go?
Are we kidnapping him?</font>

1290
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the word I'd use.</font>

1291
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that you've talked to him,
do you believe everything's all right?</font>

1292
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly.</font>

1293
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This was a mistake. You should leave.
- Way ahead of you.</font>

1294
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George isn't blind!</font>

1295
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the blind one!</font>

1296
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do that?</font>

1297
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that's not my car.</font>

1298
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my boss's car.</font>

1299
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if something were to happen to my
boss's car, well, I'd get in trouble.</font>

1300
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for you, he's got a spare.</font>

1301
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fix it.</font>

1302
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,156

1307
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,156

to wipe my face first?</font>

1308
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:15,799

01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Hawaiian guy's back at the ranch
kicking Clem's face in.</font>

1316
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh, shit!</font>

1317
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take over for Tex.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, uh...</font>

1324
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to come in and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i></font>

I got a 6-pack in the back.</font>

Sharon changed into her comfy house attire.</i></font>

1531
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel better?</font>

1532
02:10:45,481 --> 02:10:47,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is drastically better.</font>

1533
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:53,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It was after 1 1:45 by the time
the yellow cab dropped Rick and Cliff</i></font>

1535
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Right here.</font>

1536
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. <i>Grazie,</i> amigo.</font>

1537
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much do I owe you?
3 dollars.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Brandy was glad to see them return.</i></font>

1539
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, brother.
- Thanks.</font>

1540
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:08,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Andiamo.</i> More margaritas.</font>

1541
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Around midnight,
a completely drunk Rick Dalton started making</i></font>

1542

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>a blender of frozen margaritas.</i></font>

1543
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1544
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're walking.</font>

1545

a leash to an excited Brandy's dog collar.</i></font>

1546

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1547
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:39,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember you.</font>

1548
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:44,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.</font>

1549
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:46,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much?
- 50 cents.</font>

1550
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 cents.</font>

1551
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,511

1553
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1554
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:25,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And away we go.</font>

1555
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:31,513

the hottest day of the year.</font>

1556

it, actually, it might be true.</font>

1557
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn.</font>

1558
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking private road.</font>

1559
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn property taxes up the butt.</font>

1560
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn.</font>

1561
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:15,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunch of goddamn fucking hippies.</font>

1562
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1563
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you!</font>

1564
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:27,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, asshole, I'm talking to you!</font>

1565
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:31,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell do you think you're doing
bringing that noisy hunk of shit</font>

1566
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:33,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">around here at midnight?</font>

1567
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:36,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a private road, all right?</font>

1568
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:38,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you? And who are you here to see?</font>

1569
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody, sir. We just got lost
and a little turned around.</font>

1570
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:43,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, horseshit.</font>

1571
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:49,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking hippies came up here
to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?</font>

1572
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time you want to try
that, fix your fucking muffler.</font>

1573
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:56,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, we're really sorry we disturbed you.
- Look, chief, you don't belong here.</font>

1574
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:01,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, take this mechanical asshole
and get it off my fucking street!</font>

1575
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1576
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:18,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dennis Hopper!
Move this fucking piece of shit!</font>

1577
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Just give me a
moment to turn it around.</font>

1578
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive it backwards, numbnuts,</font>

1579
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:26,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but fucking drive it, and drive it now!
- Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.</font>

1580
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your horses. We're leaving.</font>

1581
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?</font>

1582
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:38,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!</font>

1583
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty fucking hippies.</font>

1584
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:02,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There in his fancy fucking
house, thinking he's handled it.</font>

1585
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:05,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's seen us. He's awake. He's alert.</font>

1586
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:10,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all awake. They're listening to
fucking records. Everybody's fucking awake!</font>

1587
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>

1588
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:14,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did Charlie say?
- He said:</font>

1589
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:18,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Go to Terry's old house and
kill everybody in there."</font>

1590
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:22,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."</font>

1591
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:25,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, he either said that,</font>

1592
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'm a liar.</font>

1593
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:32,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?</font>

1594
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1595
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you?</font>

1596
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you calling me a liar?</font>

1597
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:42,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, of course not.</font>

1598
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1599
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it.</font>

1600
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:47,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?</font>

1601
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:48,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

1602
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.</font>

1603
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.</font>

1604
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:56,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at me?</font>

1605
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was older, but, yeah, I think so.</font>

1606
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:02,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So who's this Rick guy?
- Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.</font>

1607
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:05,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a
cowboy show in the '50s called <i>Bounty Law.</i></font>

1608
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:07,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, Katie.</font>

1609
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:10,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I don't know the name
of every fascist on TV in the '50s.</font>

1610
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:15,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.</font>

1611
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:18,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.</font>

1612
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:21,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes.</font>

1613
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dig this!</font>

1614
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we've been having our trip sessions, I've
been expanding on this one idea in my head.</font>

1615
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:33,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, dig it. We all grew up
watching TV, you know what I mean?</font>

1616
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:38,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you grew up watching TV,
that means you grew up watching murder.</font>

1617
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:39,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hm.</font>

1618
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every show on TV
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i> was about murder.</font>

1619
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:47,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So my idea is...</font>

1620
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:49,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we kill the people who taught us to kill.</font>

1621
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, where the fuck are we, man?
We are in fucking Hollywood, man.</font>

1622
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:59,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The people an entire generation grew up
watching kill people live here.</font>

1623
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:03,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury.
I say fuck them.</font>

1624
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we cut their cocks
off and make them eat it.</font>

1625
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:08,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a great idea, Sadie.</font>

1626
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:12,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two ready to kill some piggies?</font>

1627
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:24,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. Oh, shit.</font>

1628
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:28,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car.
Can I go...? Can I go back and get it?</font>

1629
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.</font>

1630
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on. Wait a minute.</font>

1631
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:35,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in.</font>

1632
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1633
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:41,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Thank you.</font>

1634
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.</font>

1635
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:47,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.</font>

1636
02:18:57,560 --> 02:18:59,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that fucking bitch!</font>

1637
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:02,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.
There's a fucking house right there.</font>

1638
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:06,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do we do now?
- We do what we came to do.</font>

1639
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.</font>

1640
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any more questions? Hmm?</font>

1641
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:16,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, pig killers, let's kill some piggies.</font>

1642
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:18,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1643
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:32,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, someone's hungry.</font>

1644
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1645
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's feeding time.</font>

1646
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brandy, couch.</font>

1647
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:58,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't you mo...</font>

1648
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

1649
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh...</font>

1650
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The train has left the station.</font>

1651
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad idea.</font>

1652
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:30,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1653
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:20,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.</font>

1654
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:21,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Go.</font>

1655
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1656
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.</font>

1657
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:20,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I do not want to get into it tonight.</font>

1658
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:32,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Can I help you?</font>

1659
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:39,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1660
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many other people are here?</font>

1661
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, just the one sleeping in the back there.</font>

1662
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get him and bring him
into the living room.</font>

1663
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:53,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What if he says no?
- Don't take no for an answer.</font>

1664
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!</font>

1665
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1666
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:06,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are real, right?</font>

1667
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.</font>

1668
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:20,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1669
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo! Woo-hoo!</font>

1670
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:31,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to the living room.
What is going on, huh?</font>

1671
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:37,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go!
<i>- Si, si.</i></font>

1672
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:41,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck's that?</font>

1673
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1674
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:44,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Francesca.</font>

1675
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Uh...</font>

1676
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:55,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What...?</font>

1677
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:58,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I know you.</font>

1678
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know all three of you.</font>

1679
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Spahn Ranch.</font>

1680
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:06,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Whoo!</font>

1681
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:11,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.</font>

1682
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:15,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, I remember your white little face.</font>

1683
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you were on a horsie.</font>

1684
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1685
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:22,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... You are...?</font>

1686
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:24,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the devil,</font>

1687
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:27,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm here to do the devil's business.</font>

1688
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:34,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.</font>

1689
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:37,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.</font>

1690
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1691
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

1692
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:37,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you.</font>

1693
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you come into my
house, motherfucker!</font>

1694
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, man.</font>

1695
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

1696
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?!</font>

1697
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>

1698
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:25,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

1699
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:31,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Francesca! Francesca, honey!</font>

1700
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:53,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>
Sir, around what time was it</font>

1701
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:55,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you confronted the intruder?</font>

1702
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:58,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was about midnight.</font>

1703
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:59,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Around midnight?
- Yeah.</font>

1704
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:00,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know it was midnight?</font>

1705
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:03,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was in the kitchen.</font>

1706
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I was making margaritas, and...</font>

1707
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard the sound of a noisy muffler.
I looked up at the clock.</font>

1708
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:13,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It said... The kitchen clock said midnight.</font>

1709
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 12 o'clock exactly?
- I mean, it could have been 12:05.</font>

1710
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:19,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again</font>

1711
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the woman attacked you in the pool.</font>

1712
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:23,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1713
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:26,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what did these perpetrators do?</font>

1714
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:29,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perpetrators? They were hippie assholes.</font>

1715
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:32,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of them burst through
the front door there,</font>

1716
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:37,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the guy hippie said he was the devil.</font>

1717
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:39,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he said, "I'm here to...</font>

1718
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do some devil shit."</font>

1719
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:44,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or... That's not verbatim, but...</font>

1720
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:47,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."</font>

1721
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And away we go.</font>

1722
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</font>

1723
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:12,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What hospital you going to, Cliff?
I'll meet you there, huh?</font>

1724
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:14,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to meet me in no hospital.</font>

1725
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you go take care of your lady.</font>

1726
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, she just took five
fucking sleeping pills.</font>

1727
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.</font>

1728
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:25,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys will probably have to come
out here again just to wake her ass up.</font>

1729
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:28,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm not gonna die.
I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.</font>

1730
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:30,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.</font>

1731
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:36,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So no use waiting in some waiting room. Why
don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.</font>

1732
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:38,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come visit me tomorrow.</font>

1733
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:39,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring bagels.</font>

1734
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:42,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to do something for
me, check on Brandy.</font>

1735
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:46,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She may be a little shook up after that.
She may want to sleep with you.</font>

1736
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:49,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me?
She's sleeping with Francesca right now.</font>

1737
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:51,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might never get her back. Heh-heh.</font>

1738
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.</font>

1739
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:55,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you tomorrow, then.</font>

1740
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:00,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey.</font>

1741
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:06,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a good friend, Cliff.</font>

1742
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I try.</font>

1743
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:42,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1744
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:45,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1745
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:48,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Jay Sebring.
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.</font>

1746
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:51,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Rick Dalton, right?</font>

1747
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:54,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.</font>

1748
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.</font>

1749
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:59,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.</font>

1750
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:03,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman's
head, she just has to go next door, right?</font>

1751
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit.</font>

1752
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:09,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck happened?</font>

1753
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:12,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, these fucking hippie weirdos,</font>

1754
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:14,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they broke into my house.</font>

1755
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?</font>

1756
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know what the fuck they wanted.</font>

1757
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were they robbing me? I don't know.
Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?</font>

1758
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:26,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows? But they tried to
kill my wife and my buddy.</font>

1759
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:30,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.</font>

1760
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:34,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them,
and then, uh...</font>

1761
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:37,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, shit. I torched the last one.</font>

1762
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Torched"?</font>

1763
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:41,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I burnt her ass to a crisp.</font>

1764
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:44,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...</font>

1765
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:48,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got a flamethrower in my toolshed.
- Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i></font>

1766
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:51,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1767
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:53,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

1768
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the one.</font>

1769
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:57,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it still works too. Thank God.</font>

1770
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:59,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is everybody okay?</font>

1771
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:03,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the fucking hippies
aren't, that's for goddamn sure.</font>

1772
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:05,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. But I'm fine.</font>

1773
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, my wife's fine.</font>

1774
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:11,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're just a little shook up, is all.
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.</font>

1775
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:13,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1776
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:16,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Jay, honey, is everything all right?</i></font>

1777
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:18,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's okay now, honey.</font>

1778
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:21,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, but some hippies broke
into the house next door.</font>

1779
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, my God.</i></font>

1780
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i></font>

1781
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:27,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is everybody okay?</i></font>

1782
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:31,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.</font>

1783
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rick Dalton?</i></font>

1784
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's me.</font>

1785
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh! Well, hello, neighbor.</i></font>

1786
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:42,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is everybody okay?</i></font>

1787
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:45,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sharon, everybody's fine.</font>

1788
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:46,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you okay?</i></font>

1789
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:51,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yes, I am. Thank you for asking that.</font>

1790
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rick, would you like to come up to the house
for a drink and meet my other friends?</i></font>

1791
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure.</font>

1792
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1793
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:08,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, hooray. Great. I'll buzz you up.</i></font>

1794
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1795
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.</font>

1796
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:28,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.</font>

1797
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay. Pleasure's all mine.</font>

1798
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:33,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like you had a hell of a night.</font>

1799
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:56,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. This is Rick Dalton,
better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,</font>

1800
02:38:56,760 --> 02:39:00,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.</font>

1801
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:03,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.</font>

1802
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:08,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But since the Red Apple tobacco company's
been around since 1862,</font>

1803
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:11,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.</i></font>

1804
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:17,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, back in Jake's day, Red Apple came
in a pouch, and he had to roll his own.</i></font>

1805
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:20,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.</font>

1806
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:23,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the best drag with
the best tobacco flavor,</font>

1807
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with less burn on your throat than any
other non-filtered cigarette, heh-heh.</font>

1808
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

1809
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.</font>

1810
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:41,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm.</font>

1811
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better drag, more flavor,</font>

1812
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:45,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">less throat burn.</font>

1813
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:50,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the Red Apple way.</font>

1814
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So look for this life-size standee of
me, Jake Cahill,</font>

1815
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:58,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wherever fine Red Apple
tobacco products are sold.</font>

1816
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:01,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a bite and feel all right.</font>

1817
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:05,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a bite of a Red Apple.</font>

1818
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:06,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them Jake sent you.</font>

1819
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:12,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And cut.
- This cigarette tastes like fucking shit.</font>

1820
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:16,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, by the way, who chose this photo?
I have a double chin. All right?</font>

1821
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:17,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody notices that crap?</font>
