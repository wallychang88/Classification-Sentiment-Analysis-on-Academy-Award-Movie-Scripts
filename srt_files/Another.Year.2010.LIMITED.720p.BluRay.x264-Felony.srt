1
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,909
So how long's this been going on for?

2
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:48,412
I don't know.

3
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:49,997
A few weeks?

4
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,041
- A long time.
- A year?

5
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,213
I suppose so.

6
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:58,923
A whole year?

7
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:02,092
You've taken your time to come
and see me, haven't you?

8
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,969
You think it's going to stop, don't you?

9
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,888
I'll just take your blood pressure.

10
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,057
Can you pop your arm on the desk
for me?

11
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,392
There you go.

12
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:13,229
If you straighten it up
and push up your sleeve...

13
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,731
Are you dozing in the daytime?

14
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,901
Sometimes.

15
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,363
So, I just need something
to help me sleep.

16
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,449
I know. How much sleep
are you getting at night?

17
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,660
I'm not getting any. That's why I'm here.

18
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,703
I understand, sweetheart.

19
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,373
OK. It's just going to go tight.

20
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,182
Have you got any particular worries
at the moment?

21
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,853
No financial problems?

22
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,397
No. I don't know
what that's got to do with it.

23
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,441
What about at home?

24
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,444
How are things with husband?

25
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:09,702
OK, if you just lean forward and take a
few deep breaths, in through your mouth.

26
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,129
And again.

27
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:29,263
It's lovely and clear.

28
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,143
- Have you got any kids?
- Yes.

29
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,563
- Are they still at home with you?
- Son is, works with his father.

30
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,357
Daughter's left, only see her
when she wants something.

31
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:43,736
And how about you?
Have you started your menopause?

32
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,987
Yes.

33
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,573
Everything OK?

34
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,953
So, will you give me some sleeping tablets?

35
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:55,456
Maybe, but it might not solve your problem.

36
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,917
Give me a night's sleep, though,
wouldn't it?

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,420
- How much alcohol are you drinking?
- I don't drink. My husband drinks.

38
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:02,880
Is it a problem?

39
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:04,006
No.

40
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,177
Are you taking any drugs, medication?

41
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:10,971
How about coffee?

42
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,182
Are you drinking a lot to keep awake?

43
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:14,642
Coffee, yes.

44
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:15,809
- Tea?
- Yes.

45
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,604
Well, we might have to look at that,
mightn't we?

46
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,651
OK.

47
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:27,571
Your blood pressure is slightly up,
but I'm not overly concerned about that.

48
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,824
But I do want you to have a blood test,
to check your thyroid.

49
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:33,827
You can make an appointment at reception.
All right?

50
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,912
Yes.

51
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:41,669
Now, I will give you something to help
you sleep but just enough for a week.

52
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,589
- What good's that?
- Insomnia isn't a disease.

53
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:49,552
Sleeping tablets won't make it go away.
We need to find the cause.

54
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,806
Now, you're obviously anxious,
and a little depressed.

55
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,852
So I want you to come back
and speak to our counsellor.

56
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,481
- What for?
- I think she'd be able to help you.

57
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,528
But you'll give me the prescription now?

58
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:09,989
Yes, but will you see the counsellor?

59
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:13,117
I think it will do you some good.

60
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:17,788
You think about it for a moment.

61
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,106
Tom!

62
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,150
Give us it.

63
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:33,614
- Don't do your back in.
- I know.

64
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:37,117
It doesn't get any easier.
Job for a younger man, this.

65
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,995
Joe used to love it here.

66
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,290
Did you speak to my son and heir?

67
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,584
I left him a message on his answerphone.

68
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,672
It's going to rain again.

69
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:39,847
- Now, then.
- Hello, boss.

70
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,474
- What you got?
- You hit rock, then?

71
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,937
Yeah, we just gone through.
This is the fourth, so I reckon, what, 17½?

72
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,063
Give or take.

73
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:51,275
- 17½? It's got to be a scour hollow.
- Probably.

74
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:52,860
- All right, Mick?
- All right.

75
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:53,819
Hello.

76
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,205
How long will it take us to get back?

77
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,082
- 25, with traffic. Are you hungry?
- I am.

78
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,709
Good.

79
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:11,504
There you go.

80
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,465
Yes, London clay. Thank you.

81
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,300
- Thanks, Andy. See you.
- Cheers.

82
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,510
Ta-ta.

83
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,531
- Dusting of mica.
- Let's have a look.

84
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,367
Hmm, it's quite nice.

85
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,707
Very nice.

86
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,046
- It's just a dusting, isn't it?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:04,598
What would you say was the happiest
moment in your life?

88
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,560
What do you mean?

89
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,812
Your nicest memory.

90
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:13,399
Have a think.

91
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,329
When your children were born?

92
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,253
- Your wedding day?
- I don't know.

93
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:37,882
Take your time.

94
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,717
I can't remember.

95
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,969
- Can't or won't?
- Mm?

96
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,388
Can't or won't remember?

97
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:47,433
Don't know what I'm doing here.
I didn't want to come.

98
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,810
Don't want to talk about my family.
Why should I?

99
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:52,771
None of your business.
All I need is a good night's sleep

100
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:54,607
and nobody's helping me.

101
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,401
Janet, I want to help you.
That's why we're here.

102
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:01,697
I know it's not easy
to talk about personal things.

103
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:07,411
Suppose the boot was on the other foot,
and someone came to you,

104
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:12,416
say, your daughter, and said,
"I haven't been sleeping for months."

105
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,418
What would you say to them?

106
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,462
"Go to the doctor."

107
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,506
What else would you say?

108
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:21,383
I don't know.

109
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,094
What would you ask her?

110
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:29,767
Is she eating all right?
I don't know, something like that.

111
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:32,520
Good.

112
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,772
Anything else?

113
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,777
That a couple of months of proper sleep
would sort it out.

114
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,737
Sort what out?

115
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,365
The sleeping.

116
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:45,741
OK.

117
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,497
On a scale of one to ten...

118
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,459
...how happy
would you say you are, Janet?

119
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,503
- One.
- One.

120
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:01,090
I think there's room for improvement there,
don't you?

121
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:05,553
What is the one thing that would improve
your life, apart from sleep?

122
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:09,098
- A different life.
- A different life.

123
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,686
Change is frightening, isn't it?

124
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,108
Nothing changes.

125
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,446
Hope to see you next week, Janet.
Same time.

126
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,991
I'll be here, but it's up to you. No pressure.

127
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,409
Bye.

128
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,794
- Bye-bye, Sam.
- Bye.

129
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,759
Look at you!

130
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,553
You look like you're fit to burst.

131
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:50,514
I am fit to burst.
Big boy's wrestling his way down.

132
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:52,558
If he pops out, give me a shout.

133
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,852
Sweetheart, I'll do more than shout.

134
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,316
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hello, Mary.

135
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,359
You're a sight for sore eyes.

136
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:06,530
- Can you process these for me?
- Oh, well, seeing as it's you.

137
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:08,991
- How are you?
- I'm snowed under, to be honest,

138
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,743
and I've got a headache.

139
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,995
Have you seen the doctor?

140
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:14,371
Hello, Gemma.

141
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,248
Do you fancy a drink tonight?

142
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,958
- I'd love one.
- Great. Are you sure?

143
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,044
- I've only got an hour.
- That's all right.

144
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:22,338
- Tom's cooking supper.
- Oh, lovely.

145
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,381
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

146
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,815
Do you know, Gerri, I've never been with
a man who could cook.

147
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,776
- Haven't you?
- No.

148
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:46,654
- They could do other things.
- That doesn't get you fed.

149
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:49,198
No, it keeps a girl happy, though.

150
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,742
- And you can't cook.
- No. Well, I can a bit.

151
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,286
- But it's not really my thing.
- No, it's not.

152
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,830
Oh, no, don't remind me about that,
Gerri.

153
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,543
You could put an ad in the paper
"Chef wanted".

154
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:05,381
Yeah. "Chef/boyfriend
required for gorgeous girl."

155
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:07,424
No, "Mature woman with cat."

156
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,388
No, "Maturish".
We don't want to put them off, do we?

157
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,064
It's lovely the way you and Tom
do everything together.

158
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:25,401
- We're very lucky.
- Yeah. You are, but you deserve it.

159
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:29,071
- You're both such lovely people.
- Oops, my halo's slipping.

160
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,115
Yeah, Saint Gerri.

161
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:35,578
No, but I'm really comfortable
with where I am in my life, as you know.

162
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,205
I've got my lovely little garden flat,
a good job.

163
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,709
I've got my health, touch wood,
I've got my independence.

164
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,378
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not all rosy.

165
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:47,923
I have good days and bad days
like everyone else, but, hey!

166
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,509
Are you going to do something
about your garden?

167
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:53,262
Oh, don't remind me!
I'm really guilty about that.

168
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,806
- I've neglected it, haven't I?
- Yes, you have.

169
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,393
But yesterday I was brushing my teeth
and I looked out the window

170
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:02,730
and I saw these two daffodils
peeping over the top of the grass.

171
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,064
I must get it cut.

172
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:06,108
- Get yourself that lawn mower.
- I know.

173
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,903
Couldn't I just get a man in?
It wouldn't cost much.

174
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:13,490
- Hmm. "Gardener/chef/ boyfriend."
- Yeah!

175
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:18,329
But I don't want to spend too much money
because I'm going to get myself a little car.

176
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,915
- Are you?
- Yeah, I've decided it's about time.

177
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,417
- It's a big step.
- I know. It's exciting, isn't it?

178
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,462
I mean, I've got a little bit of money.
Not a lot, but enough.

179
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,923
But I'll have to cut back on, you know,

180
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:31,675
shoes, clothes, jewellery,
my knick-knacky things.

181
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:35,638
But that's OK because I've got loads of
clothes. My wardrobe isn't big enough.

182
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:39,517
In fact, I'm not doing anything this
weekend, so I'll get up really early,

183
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,978
sort my winter clothes into plastic bags
and shove them under the bed.

184
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:46,273
- Can I top you up?
- No, I'm going now, Mary.

185
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:48,359
- Won't you help me finish it?
- No, really.

186
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:52,112
- Oh, all right. Well, I think I'm going to
stay for a little while.

187
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,951
How's Joe?
Have you heard from him this week?

188
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:59,578
- No, but I'm sure he's fine.
- Still no girlfriend?

189
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:01,622
I've no idea.

190
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:05,125
He must have something on the go,
a good-looking boy like him.

191
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,710
- See you on Thursday.
- Oh!

192
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,504
You're coming for supper on Saturday.

193
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,340
Oh, lovely. Thank you, Gerri.
Give my love to that lovely Tom.

194
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:13,342
- I will. You take care.
- Yeah.

195
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,855
Sorry I'm late. I'm sorry.

196
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,767
What's for supper?

197
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,061
Arrabbiata. Are you hungry?

198
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,439
I'm starving.

199
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,192
Hello.

200
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,944
Have a taste.

201
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,863
I hope it's not too hot.

202
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:17,907
You can never tell with chillies.

203
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,495
- No.
- No?

204
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,207
Oh, it's coming out my ears.

205
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,709
Good. Glass of wine?

206
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,129
No, I've had a couple.
Oh, go on, just a smidgeon.

207
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,923
That's the spirit.

208
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,676
- How was your day?
- Good.

209
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:41,180
I was out and about, getting my hands dirty.

210
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,642
- How about you?
- Disappointing.

211
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,810
Pass me the parsley.

212
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,229
No breakthroughs?

213
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:50,731
I had my alcoholic tutor in again.

214
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,149
Yeah?

215
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,735
- He was pissed as a fart.
- Really?

216
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,530
It was very upsetting, actually.

217
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,324
How did you handle it?

218
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:03,077
I bought him a double Scotch.
No, I had to challenge him.

219
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,079
I told him it was up to him.

220
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,248
How did he take that?

221
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,333
Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.

222
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,752
- Well, at least he came.
- Hmm.

223
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,380
- Have we heard from Joe?
- No.

224
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:16,382
But I haven't checked my e-mails.

225
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,176
I'll ring him later. I'd love to see him.

226
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,553
He's all right.

227
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,268
Mr Gupta?

228
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,103
Joe Hepple, nice to meet you.

229
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:30,980
- I just came with him.
- Ah, good.

230
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,023
Just follow me this way, please.

231
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,944
This way.

232
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,624
Excuse the mess.

233
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:56,422
You sit there, Mr Gupta,
and... l'll pop you there.

234
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:07,975
OK, now we've opened all these letters,

235
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:12,021
and I've seen all I need to see
for the time being.

236
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,607
Obviously, it's a sizeable correspondence

237
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:19,028
and, understandably, Mr Gupta hasn't
exactly been in a position to open them,

238
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,780
seeing as he's been in hospital
for the past ten weeks.

239
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:25,326
But, you're looking fit and raring to go,
Mr Gupta.

240
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,702
Huh?

241
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,832
- Excuse me.
- Hm?

242
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,251
- How long will this take?
- Not too long.

243
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,378
It's just I have to get back to work.

244
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:38,797
What do you do?

245
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,926
Er, I'm... Restaurant family business.

246
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,011
Oh, tasty.

247
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,013
OK.

248
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:51,185
Erm... it's important for Mr Gupta
to understand that at this point

249
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:53,646
he's in no danger of being evicted.

250
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,651
Acha?

251
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,532
OK?

252
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:07,409
I'll take you briefly through
what is going to happen in court.

253
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:10,788
Erm... l'll be representing Mr Gupta
on the day.

254
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:12,873
We'll put the case to the judge...

255
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:14,583
...and...

256
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:19,421
he will agree to adjourn which will then
give us time to sort things out, OK?

257
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,841
So, I'll... Excuse me.

258
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:23,217
Hello?

259
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,622
- I'll get it!
- All right.

260
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,250
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Gerri.

261
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,502
- It's stopped raining, thank goodness.
- I know.

262
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,254
- Welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

263
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,089
I bought you a little present, some thyme.

264
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:04,258
- That's lovely. Thank you.
- It's nothing much.

265
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:05,759
- Oh, there he is.
- Hello, love.

266
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,469
Hello, Tom.

267
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:09,638
Oh! I'm sorry, I just had to have a cigarette

268
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:12,099
- and I know you don't like the smell.
- Don't be daft.

269
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,602
- I'm trying to give up, aren't I, Gerri?
- Oh, are you?

270
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,812
Only I've just had a bad experience
on the tube.

271
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:18,939
- What happened?
- There was this man.

272
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,275
- What did he do?
- Well, he was looking at me.

273
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:25,112
I mean, every time I looked up,
he was looking at me.

274
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:27,531
- Oh, dear.
- It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.

275
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,116
Well, you're here now.

276
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:32,286
Exactly, and I'm very happy
to be here with both of you.

277
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,038
This is for you, Tom.

278
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,789
- Ah!
- It's nothing special.

279
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,082
Buenos Aires.

280
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,961
Yeah, because I thought you went there,
didn't you, the two of you, Argentina?

281
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,713
- No, we didn't, no.
- No.

282
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,131
- Didn't you?
- No.

283
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:46,467
Tom's been to Brazil, digging his holes.

284
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,887
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so stupid sometimes.

285
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,847
- That's all right.
- Oh, honestly,

286
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,141
Pow! What are you going to do with me,
eh?

287
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:58,020
I'm just going to run upstairs.
Is that all right? I won't be a minute.

288
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:07,905
- I haven't seen you since Christmas.
- Really?

289
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,366
- Oh, it's just the three of us tonight?
- Yes.

290
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,618
- I did tell you.
- Did you?

291
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,412
- Mm.
- We wanted you all to ourselves, Mary.

292
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:18,666
Oh, thank you, Tom.
That's what all the boys say.

293
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,377
No, I wasn't sure what to wear.

294
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,296
I didn't know if it was going to be
one of your big dinner parties,

295
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,883
- or just us, you know, casual.
- I think you got it just about right, Mary.

296
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,761
- You look lovely.
- Oh, thank you, Gerri.

297
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,390
- Oh... sorry.
- Did you have a late night?

298
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:37,142
Oh! I stayed up watching the film.

299
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,271
I couldn't wake up this morning.

300
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,606
No, but it was lovely having a lie-in
on my day off.

301
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,024
- We stayed in.
- Did you?

302
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,694
- We listened to some music.
- Amongst other things.

303
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,947
- I thought Joe might be coming.
- I don't think so.

304
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,200
- He's coming tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a shame. I won't see him.

305
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,411
Did Gerri tell you about me getting a car, Tom?

306
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:56,453
Yes.

307
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,206
- What do you think?
- Exciting. What are you going to get?

308
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,711
Oh, well, I don't know.
Something small and... red.

309
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:06,672
Small and red?
Well, that narrows it down.

310
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:09,008
- Yeah.
- I hope you're hungry.

311
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,886
- I'm starving, Gerri, you know me.
- We'll have to fatten you up.

312
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,263
Oh, it's lovely having your dinner cooked
for you.

313
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,724
You don't really bother
when you're by yourself.

314
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:18,475
- You look well.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

315
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,102
You're nice and slim.

316
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:22,146
Am I?
Well, I've always been slim, haven't I?

317
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:25,232
- Unlike me. Middle-aged spread.
- Shut up.

318
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,067
You're perfect. Gorgeous in every way.

319
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,111
And you know it.

320
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,912
Sit yourself down, Mary.
Help yourself to another drink.

321
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,541
How is that dressing coming along?

322
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,585
As well as can be expected.

323
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:59,892
I hear you're going to the Emerald Isle again,
Tom.

324
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:03,020
That's correct. Rent a cottage, take the car.

325
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:06,065
- Put the tent in the back.
- And the sleeping bags.

326
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:09,401
- If it's nice we might do a bit of camping.
- Oh, no.

327
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:12,738
I wouldn't fancy sleeping in a tent,
thank you very much.

328
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:16,951
No, I never had you down
as one of nature's Girl Guides, Mary.

329
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,994
No, Tom.

330
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:23,332
But I am always prepared.

331
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:26,210
- Yes, but what for?
- For anything, Gerri.

332
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,170
- You know me.
- Yes, I do.

333
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:32,925
I'm not going to get a holiday this year.

334
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:38,389
But then I never do, do I, Gerri?
Because I haven't got anyone to go with.

335
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,018
It's all right for you two,
you've got each other.

336
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,062
We're going to the Ring of Kerry.

337
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,233
The what?

338
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,360
- The Ring of Kerry. It's an area.
- Tralee,

339
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,404
- Dingle Bay.
- Oh, lovely.

340
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:55,322
You've been there before, haven't you?

341
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,533
- That was Donegal.
- Oh.

342
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,827
The geologist stands on the beach

343
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,663
with his back to the sea and looks at the cliffs

344
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:06,125
whilst the geologist's wife stands on the beach

345
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,794
with her back to the cliffs
looking at the sea.

346
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:17,928
You see, I can't afford to buy my car
and have a holiday.

347
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:24,685
But, if I had more money,
then I could do both.

348
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:28,147
But when you've got your car, Mary,
you'll be able to go wherever you want,

349
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,441
- very reasonably.
- Exactly, Tom.

350
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:32,776
That's exactly why I'm getting it.

351
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,365
You see, I like just taking off
and escaping, don't I, Gerri?

352
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:39,867
Hm.

353
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,370
I feel like I'm being somebody else.

354
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,457
- Really? Who's that, then?
- Tom!

355
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,337
I like to get on the train...

356
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:57,927
But, you see,
the car is cheaper than the train, isn't it?

357
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,678
Not environmentally.

358
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,307
Oh, what you mean...?

359
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,270
Those are my carbon footprints, Gerri.

360
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,564
Yes, I know.

361
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:16,612
Financially, cars are cheaper.
That's why there's no incentive to go by train.

362
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,906
Well, what about the airlines?

363
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:23,202
No government wants to increase
the duty on aviation fuel.

364
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:24,537
No.

365
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,122
And this government
won't invest in the railways,

366
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,041
so anything we do is a piss in the ocean.

367
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:30,251
Absolutely.

368
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,461
And then there's the big corporations,

369
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:35,297
who keep their lights on all night
in empty office blocks.

370
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:37,967
We're all expected to do our bit with eco bulbs.

371
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,010
I know.

372
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:44,431
Should I stop recycling, then, Gerri?

373
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:46,642
- No.
- You've got to set an example.

374
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,645
- Yeah.
- Plant a few tomatoes.

375
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:51,063
And courgettes.

376
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:58,153
I am very environmentally friendly, actually.

377
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,114
- Are you?
- Yeah.

378
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:01,949
I don't fly.

379
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:06,203
I don't live in a house
that's more than I need.

380
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:08,873
I don't cook.

381
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:11,876
- Other people cook for you, though.
- Who?

382
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,586
You get takeaways, don't you?

383
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:17,381
That doesn't count.
Everybody gets takeaways.

384
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:20,718
You've built whole motorways, Tom.

385
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,554
How environmentally friendly is that?

386
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:24,763
Exactly!

387
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,893
More cars! More cars!
At least I'm buying an old car.

388
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:30,561
- Recycled.
- Yeah.

389
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:34,815
Yet we're constantly told that
the measure of a thriving economy

390
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,401
is the sale of new cars.

391
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,111
Yes, but, Tom...

392
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:43,115
...if I buy a new car...

393
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,203
...that's another car.

394
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:50,039
You're absolutely right, Mary.

395
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:52,875
And would you like some coffee?

396
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:57,505
No, thank you.

397
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:59,757
I'd like my usual.

398
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,605
Are you all right, Gerri?

399
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:16,774
Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

400
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:18,859
How are you?

401
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,949
I'm happy.

402
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:26,700
Good.

403
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,789
I just wanted to say...

404
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:36,710
...that if you ever need to share anything...

405
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:40,339
...I'm here for you.

406
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:46,470
I'm a very good listener.

407
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:48,389
Thank you, Mary, but I'm fine.

408
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:50,432
Yeah, I know.

409
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,115
It's very kind of you, Mary.

410
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,871
Oh, Gerri.

411
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:20,421
Everybody needs someone to talk to,
don't they?

412
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:22,464
Yes, Mary, they do.

413
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:30,556
Oh, well, onwards and upwards.

414
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,017
You'd better stay the night.

415
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,852
No. No.

416
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,729
Well, I think you should.

417
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,732
All right, Gerri, you're the boss.

418
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,775
We'll find you a T-shirt again.

419
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,570
Will you?

420
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:51,118
I've found you a toothbrush.

421
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,455
I sometimes wonder what he's doing.

422
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,542
If he thinks about me. I bet he does.

423
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,586
How old was he?

424
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,548
He'll be 64 now.

425
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:07,134
64?
Blimey, he's older than me.

426
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:09,637
- Almost a pensioner.
- He'll be past it now, Mary.

427
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,639
- Give us your hand.
- Oh, no, Tom.

428
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:13,265
He was lovely.

429
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:15,559
Well, we all grow old.

430
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:20,481
Oh, no, but he was very, very, sexy, Gerri.
Do you know what I mean?

431
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,691
Too much information.

432
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:24,735
I bet he regrets it deep down.

433
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,738
I hope he does.

434
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,200
He was my big love...

435
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:34,495
...but he was married.

436
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,708
Well, what can you do, Tom?

437
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,294
You can't walk around
with a label saying,

438
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:46,757
"Don't fall in love with me,
I'm married," can you?

439
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:48,509
Some people wear a ring.

440
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:50,261
He didn't.

441
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:54,306
But he wasn't a bad person.

442
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:00,229
He loved me.

443
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:04,441
Sounds to me
like he was a duplicitous shit.

444
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,026
Tom?

445
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,452
Do you think it was my fault, Tom?

446
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:17,329
No, I don't, Mary.

447
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:19,748
Honest.

448
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:22,168
It takes two to tango.

449
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:25,004
Oh, so you think it was my fault, Gerri?

450
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,965
- I didn't say that.
- No, I know you didn't, really.

451
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:34,180
I blame my big heart.

452
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,557
Well, we all have to make choices,
don't we?

453
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:42,188
Why do I always get it wrong, Gerri?

454
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:50,029
I mean, look what happened
when I got divorced from that shit.

455
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:56,493
I let him palm me off with 5,000...
nothing pounds

456
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:58,370
and what am I left with now?

457
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,039
Sod all.

458
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:08,005
I'm living in a poky rented flat when
I should have my own home at my age.

459
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:12,635
It's not fair.

460
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,064
Bastard.

461
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,799
My goodness.

462
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,467
Hm?

463
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:56,470
- She gets worse.
- I know. Desperate.

464
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,934
I feel a bit guilty.

465
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,728
What?

466
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:06,438
Well, you know.

467
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:08,482
No.

468
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,114
No. You're right.

469
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:21,745
I don't think I really enjoyed history at school.

470
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,747
Didn't you?

471
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,499
Maybe I did.

472
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:31,964
It's just that the older you get,
the more relevant it seems.

473
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:33,716
Hm.

474
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,759
To state the bleeding obvious.

475
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:46,312
We'll be part of history soon.

476
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,897
Exactly.

477
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,777
- Aha!
- Aha!

478
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:56,405
What are you doing riding
on the pavement, young man?

479
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:58,115
I'm breaking the law, officer.

480
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,325
- 'Ey up.
- Hiya.

481
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,118
- How long did it take?
- About an hour.

482
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:02,953
- Are you knackered?
- I'm ready for bed.

483
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,872
- Late night?
- Hangover.

484
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,665
- Do you want a hand?
- Yes, please.

485
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:08,709
- I'll stick this away.
- All right.

486
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:12,755
Oh, he's back. That was quick, Tom.

487
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:14,798
- Didn't you get the manure?
- Compost.

488
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:17,092
- Here's Joe!
- Hi, Mary.

489
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:18,802
Hello, Joe, what a surprise.

490
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,971
- Are you all right?
- I'm great. How are you?

491
00:33:21,055 --> 00:33:24,141
- Oh, continental! He's all sweaty.
- I've been riding all morning.

492
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:25,768
Have you? I like your hat.

493
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,102
- Aha!
- Aha!

494
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:29,688
Ah, that's right.
Never forget to kiss your mum.

495
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:32,441
- I never do.
- No, you're a good boy, aren't you?

496
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:34,652
- Yeah.
- I remember when you were this big.

497
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,320
You were a naughty boy.

498
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,364
- I still am from time to time.
- Oh, really?

499
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,658
- I like your coat.
- Oh, thank you.

500
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:43,827
I think I'm a bit overdressed for
a Sunday morning. What do you think?

501
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:47,164
- Is that what you wore in bed?
- I slept in your bed. Is that all right?

502
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:50,251
- As long as you cleaned the sheets.
- No, I didn't. Is that a problem?

503
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,169
- We'll have to wait and see.
- Oh, right.

504
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:54,213
Oh, sorry, Tom. I'm in your way.

505
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:58,551
All of these strong men.

506
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:01,470
- Look at his muscles.
- That's why we had him.

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,223
All right, well, I'm off, then.

508
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:06,475
- You want a lift to the station?
- It's all right.

509
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,853
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fine. I could do with a walk.

510
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:10,646
Yeah.

511
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:13,482
- Sorry about... you know...
- It's OK.

512
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:15,734
- It was good to see you.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

513
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,403
Are you all right?

514
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:19,154
Yeah, you know.

515
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:21,198
Had a bit of a wild night, Joe.

516
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,411
Well, I'd best be off.

517
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:30,708
Oh, thanks for saving me that breakfast.
It was really delicious.

518
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,877
- You're very welcome, Mary.
- Yeah.

519
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,379
It's lovely to see you, Joe.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

520
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:37,423
- See you soon.
- Yeah, hopefully.

521
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,551
Well, have a lovely day together, all of you.

522
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:43,053
- Right. Ta-ta, then.
- Yeah, OK. Bye.

523
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:45,389
- See you on Tuesday, Gerri.
- Bye, Mary. Take care.

524
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,640
Bye.

525
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,559
- Bye Joe.
- Bye.

526
00:34:48,642 --> 00:34:50,603
- Bye.
- Bye.

527
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:19,507
There you go.

528
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,967
- Delicious.
- Present for you.

529
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:32,603
Matt's getting married.

530
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:33,938
Oh, Mathew!

531
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:35,564
Oh, is he? Matt with the guitar?

532
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:37,066
No, that's Paul.

533
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:40,277
Oh, Matt, yeah.

534
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,654
That's great.

535
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,031
- Have you met the lady in question?
- Certainly have.

536
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,867
- Is she worthy of him?
- No, they hate each other.

537
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,036
You mean, is he worthy of her?

538
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,955
Oh, beg your pardon, Mrs Pankhurst.

539
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,459
Where's the stag do this time?
Buenos Aires?

540
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,461
- No, Dublin.
- Ooh, lovely.

541
00:35:57,503 --> 00:36:00,464
Another capital city brought to its knees.

542
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,466
Well, we'll try and leave it as we find it.

543
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,969
- When are you going?
- July. The wedding's August.

544
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:07,388
Lovely. I'll make some tea.

545
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:17,022
So, when's it going to be your turn?

546
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:18,649
A week on Wednesday?

547
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:21,610
- Oh, you didn't say.
- I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

548
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:24,405
- I knew.
- Oh, no, I haven't bought a hat.

549
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:32,705
Any news?

550
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:36,083
Nobody...?

551
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,377
No, still quiet on that front.

552
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:42,798
What?

553
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,829
Sorry, love. Excuse me.

554
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:42,149
Who's that a-knocking on my door?

555
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:43,567
It's only me!

556
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:45,444
- Bugger off!
- Hello, Tom, mate.

557
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:47,905
Hiya, Gerri, love.

558
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:50,658
- Hi, Ken, how are you?
- I'm all right.

559
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,535
- Oh, crushed ribs.
- Sorry.

560
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,537
- Give us your bag.
- I'm bursting for a pee.

561
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,664
I'll just run upstairs. Is that all right?

562
00:37:57,915 --> 00:38:00,668
I'll put it on your bed.
You're in Joe's room.

563
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,970
- Ooh, that's better. I needed that.
- I'll take your coat.

564
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:12,638
Thanks, mate.

565
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,391
- Ooh, Gerri.
- Careful, Ken.

566
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:17,601
- Would you like a beer?
- Oh, I'd love one, ta.

567
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:19,728
Hup! Ha, ha, ha!

568
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:26,277
- Maniacs.
- Oh...

569
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:28,404
Mm.

570
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:33,701
Mm.

571
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:37,288
- It's great this.
- Thank you.

572
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,539
Mm!

573
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,875
Better?

574
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,626
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

575
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,420
- Haven't you?
- No.

576
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,881
It's great to see you both. Cheers.

577
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:48,382
Cheers.

578
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,800
Cheers.

579
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,016
- Mm.
- So how's your flat, Ken?

580
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,768
Oh, same old, same old.

581
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,103
You employed a cleaner yet?

582
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:04,190
If I got a cleaner in, she'd turn round,
walk straight out again.

583
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,066
It might give her a purpose in life.

584
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,110
- Bit of a mess, but it suits me.
- Yeah.

585
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,862
Five minutes walk to work.

586
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:13,991
I usually get the bus, but if I'm late,
I have to leg it, if I miss the bus.

587
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:16,285
I stop at the caff to pick up breakfast.

588
00:39:17,328 --> 00:39:19,747
I have a croissant
if they haven't got any iced buns.

589
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,498
Cup of tea.

590
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,250
I have to smuggle it in.

591
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:25,753
Just because of that Steve.
He's a right fascist.

592
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:28,005
- That's your boss, isn't it?
- Yeah, my boss.

593
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,632
My supervisor.

594
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,717
- Is he still there?
- Oh, yeah.

595
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,053
He's only been with us three...
no, two years.

596
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:37,848
35, looks 12, treats me like a child.
Bloody graduate.

597
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:40,684
- You're a graduate.
- We're all graduates, aren't we?

598
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:43,312
- Oh, yeah, so we are!
- You forgot.

599
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,105
Would you like some salad, Ken?

600
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:47,358
- No, no. I'm all right, ta.
- Sure?

601
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:53,030
I mean, you spend nearly 40 years trying to get
people out of the dole queue and into jobs.

602
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:54,907
What thanks do you get? I'm sick of it!

603
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,867
At your age, you can walk away, can't you?

604
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,786
Hm. I don't know.

605
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:02,248
You've got a good retirement package.
Index linked pension.

606
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:04,583
- I could have gone two years ago.
- Why didn't you?

607
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,961
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Isn't it?

608
00:40:07,044 --> 00:40:09,547
What would you do with your time
if you retired, Ken?

609
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,675
Pub.

610
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,552
Eat, drink, be merry.

611
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:18,347
I don't know.

612
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:23,519
How's Joe?

613
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:25,980
- He's fine. You'll see him on Sunday.
- He's well.

614
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:28,399
Oh, great. Has he got a girlfriend?

615
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:31,527
- No, I don't think so.
- Not that we know of.

616
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,279
Who else is coming to the barbeque?

617
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,738
Jack and Janey.

618
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:36,615
Tanya, GP from work.

619
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,285
- Mary.
- Oh, Mary.

620
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:40,828
Is she?

621
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:44,665
Then, of course, there's yourself, sir.
The guest of honour.

622
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,000
Hooray!

623
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,751
I don't know about that.

624
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,172
What else you been up to?

625
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:52,840
Oh, nothing much.

626
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,010
Mm! Oh, no, hey.

627
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:58,012
Guess where I went the other week.

628
00:40:58,095 --> 00:40:59,889
- Where?
- Hull versus Derby.

629
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,766
- Ho, ho, ho! Who'd you cheer for?
- Derby, of course.

630
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,519
I had to keep quiet,
I got stuck with the home mob.

631
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:08,856
- Was there owt worth cheering?
- No, it were crap.

632
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:11,358
I don't think my brother
ever missed one home game.

633
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,196
No. Me and my dad used to stand
with him on the terraces.

634
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:18,365
You used to leave Carl at your mum's
on a Saturday afternoon. Remember?

635
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:20,034
Oh, yeah.

636
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:22,620
You could hear the roar of the crowd
from the front room.

637
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,830
Of course you could.
It was three streets away.

638
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,373
Our house used to shake.

639
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:28,792
Ours did. They all did.

640
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:33,380
During the Clough glory years, we were
at the centre of the footballing universe.

641
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,382
- You never went.
- I did occasionally.

642
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,009
I wasn't manic, like him.

643
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:42,598
I don't think Ronnie can afford to go now,
the price of season tickets.

644
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:46,060
How is Ronnie?
I haven't seen him for years.

645
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,145
- He's 70 now, you know.
- Is he?

646
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:49,980
- Carl's 41.
- Bloody hell.

647
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:53,150
- Linda's still working.
- She's kept him all his life.

648
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:55,402
- She's worn out, poor woman.
- Is Carl the same?

649
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:57,196
As far as we know.

650
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:58,948
Very sad.

651
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:00,658
Linda's heartbroken.

652
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:03,244
- So's Ronnie.
- He's cut himself off.

653
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:04,870
I used to have a drink with Ronnie.

654
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:08,082
When my dad was in the home, I'd
go to Derby, he was always in the pub.

655
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:10,209
Yep, that's one of the advantages

656
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:13,379
of being free from the tyranny
of regular employment.

657
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,714
- He never bought a round.
- Are you accusing my brother

658
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:17,925
- of being a mean bastard?
- Yeah, I am.

659
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,844
- You're right, he is.
- I know.

660
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:22,471
Mm.

661
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,943
I mean, I...

662
00:42:39,363 --> 00:42:43,659
You get to a certain age...
I can't go to the places I used to.

663
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:45,494
They don't like old fogies.

664
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:47,621
- You don't have to go.
- They're my pubs.

665
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:49,039
Not any more, they're not.

666
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,876
Except they're not like pubs now,
they're all poncy bars.

667
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,128
Exactly, things change.

668
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:57,464
When I started at work,
we'd all socialise together.

669
00:42:57,548 --> 00:43:01,802
On a Friday night, everybody would go
to the pub for a drink, go for a curry.

670
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:03,304
But now...

671
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:05,014
It's hard, isn't it?

672
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:10,352
I mean, who would I go on holiday with?

673
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,606
There's nobody, let's face it.

674
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,694
The only time I went on holiday
was with Pam.

675
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:23,908
Spain. Nightmare.

676
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:25,492
Didn't you go away with Andrea?

677
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:27,953
No, she went off with her sister.
You remember?

678
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:29,371
Oh, yeah.

679
00:43:29,455 --> 00:43:31,081
Stood me up, the bitch.

680
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:34,627
It leaves a nasty taste, doesn't it?

681
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:38,589
Girls in bikinis covered with suntan oil.

682
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:42,927
Boys flexing their muscles on the beach.
No, it's not for me.

683
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,386
Oh, I don't know.

684
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,305
Sounds nice.

685
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:49,808
You could try a cultural holiday.

686
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,311
No, I'm not one for culture.

687
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:54,021
Pub culture.

688
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:58,984
Young people, young people.
Everything's for young people.

689
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:03,989
These bars, you know, they're full of
young people shouting about nothing.

690
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:06,742
I seem to remember you got banned
from a number of pubs in Hull

691
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:08,619
for shouting about nothing,

692
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:10,496
when you were a young person.

693
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:12,831
Right.

694
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:17,670
"Ken, we like you.

695
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:19,922
You're a good bloke,
you're good on the darts,

696
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:22,466
but if you talk about politics again,
you're barred."

697
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:33,644
No, but these kids,
they're just bloody noisy.

698
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:37,022
Isle of Wight Festival, 1968.

699
00:44:37,064 --> 00:44:39,191
We were noisy, weren't we?

700
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,443
- We weren't, he was.
- You were noisy.

701
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:44,029
- You were noisy.
- I know I was noisy.

702
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:46,866
Remember Plastic Penny?

703
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:49,118
Plastic Penny.

704
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:51,912
- Where are they now?
- You fancied Plastic Penny.

705
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,087
It's the young person's prerogative to be noisy.

706
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:02,298
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's all my own fault.

707
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:06,218
I'm not meeting the right people.
I'm stuck in a rut.

708
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,595
It's not your fault, Ken.

709
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:10,723
You are stuck in a rut.
That's why you can't face retirement.

710
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:12,516
Yeah, I know.

711
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:17,646
I'm dreading getting on that train
Sunday night. I always do.

712
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,524
- Why?
- I know what I'll be thinking.

713
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:23,861
There's nothing for me in Hull any more.

714
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:26,530
Except my job.

715
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:29,658
Most of my friends have gone.

716
00:45:29,742 --> 00:45:32,244
Hit you hard when Gordon died, didn't it?

717
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:33,537
And his wife.

718
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:35,331
Is she gone?

719
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:36,498
Yes.

720
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:38,292
Oh, yeah, they're both gone now.

721
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:43,088
Funnily enough, I was thinking about him
on the way down.

722
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:46,759
I looked out the windows
when we were in Lincolnshire,

723
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:49,595
I saw this fucking tree.

724
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:56,894
It rem...

725
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:04,443
It reminded me of his funeral.

726
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:08,572
Oh, Ken.

727
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,078
Ken.

728
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:16,497
Ken.

729
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:19,166
Come on.

730
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,585
Gerri, I'm sorry.

731
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,504
It's all right.

732
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,428
I'm sorry, Tom.

733
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:49,238
How you doing?

734
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:52,908
- I feel like shit.
- You look like shit.

735
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:54,743
I know.

736
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:57,538
- Apart from that, how are you doing?
- I still feel like shit.

737
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,585
I'll race you to the top.

738
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:04,920
- What?
- Snake Pass, I'll race you.

739
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:06,463
Oh, yeah.

740
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:09,717
When was the last time you sat on a bike?

741
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,261
1896, penny-farthing.

742
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:19,101
I tell you what.

743
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:23,814
You and me, we'll walk from Edale
to Matlock Bath.

744
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,318
Take as long as it takes.

745
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:30,404
Stay in nice pubs along the way.
What do you reckon?

746
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:31,989
I'll tell you what.

747
00:47:32,072 --> 00:47:33,866
I'll stay in the pubs, you do the walking.

748
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:35,784
Bugger that, you're carrying the bags.

749
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,665
How about it?

750
00:47:45,419 --> 00:47:47,254
Serious, we'll go in the autumn.

751
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:58,891
What are we going to do with you, then,
eh?

752
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,691
You can't go on like this, that's for sure.

753
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,502
So, is it every man for himself
or are we having teams?

754
00:49:08,586 --> 00:49:09,712
Teams.

755
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:13,883
If I might make so bold, I would suggest
that the best plays with the worst, Jack.

756
00:49:13,966 --> 00:49:16,177
- Good idea.
- In other words, you're with Ken.

757
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,928
- Thanks.
- It's me and you, Ken.

758
00:49:18,012 --> 00:49:19,889
- Is there anything on it?
- Bottle of wine.

759
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:21,182
You're on.

760
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:23,058
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.

761
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:24,727
- It's you!
- Ah, right!

762
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,687
- Shall I kick off?
- You take the honour.

763
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,731
So, this father and son team.

764
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:32,067
- The double Hepple.
- Yes, take on these unknown mavericks.

765
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:33,736
- That's us, Ken.
- Good luck, Tom.

766
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,529
And good luck to you, Mo.

767
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:41,952
Can I just say what a great pleasure it is
to be playing with you once again?

768
00:49:42,036 --> 00:49:43,746
Yep, yeah. Watch and learn, Ken.

769
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:45,456
There's wine on it.

770
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:47,124
Right.

771
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,835
Off we go.

772
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,179
- At-choo!
- I knew it!

773
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:02,515
- I knew you were going to do that!
- Ha, ha, ha!

774
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:05,476
All my life I've had to put up
with this nonsense from you

775
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,479
and I'm not going to have it any longer!

776
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:15,152
Don't scare the wildlife, Ken.

777
00:50:15,236 --> 00:50:17,321
How many times a night do you go?

778
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:19,365
I lose count.

779
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:21,617
You gotta get it sorted out, Ken.

780
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,035
Yeah.

781
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:27,790
- Oh, what a beauty.
- Lovely.

782
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:29,333
Good shot, partner?

783
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:31,335
- Oh, sorry. Good shot, Jack.
- Thank you.

784
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,172
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

785
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:38,300
- You want it out, Joe?
- Yep.

786
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:41,011
Good luck, partner.

787
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:42,805
It's all down to this.

788
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:53,858
Looks good.

789
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:55,776
Oh!

790
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,153
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

791
00:50:58,237 --> 00:50:59,780
- My partner.
- Oh, yes.

792
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:38,235
Gerri!

793
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,862
- Tom!
- Here she is.

794
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:41,989
- Hello, Mary.
- Sorry I'm so late.

795
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:44,783
- What happened?
- It's taken me three hours to get here.

796
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:48,412
I left home at two. I had to ask
a policeman in the end, I got so lost.

797
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:50,789
- You got lost?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

798
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:52,708
- You've been here loads of times.
- I know.

799
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,211
- You know the way.
- Yeah, but I came in my car, Gerri.

800
00:51:55,294 --> 00:51:56,712
- Oh, God!
- What's happened?

801
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:59,590
Oh, I'm so stupid.
Why do I always spoil everything?

802
00:51:59,673 --> 00:52:02,134
- I wanted it to be a surprise.
- You've bought a car?

803
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:03,719
- Yeah!
- God help us.

804
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:06,222
I got it ever so cheap.
I was really chuffed with myself

805
00:52:06,305 --> 00:52:10,643
because they wanted 700,
but I offered 600, but we settled at 650.

806
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:13,479
They were a nice couple of guys.
I think they were brothers.

807
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:15,356
- One of them had a gold tooth.
- Did he?

808
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:17,233
Yeah. But, they wanted cash.

809
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:21,570
So I had to go to the cash point on
Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.

810
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:24,073
So, I couldn't collect it till after work on Friday.

811
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:25,866
But they rang on Friday morning

812
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,410
to find out what time I was going
to go round with the money.

813
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:31,914
And had I sorted out the insurance?
Well, that hadn't even crossed my mind!

814
00:52:31,997 --> 00:52:35,417
So, I spent the whole of my lunch break
on Friday sorting that out

815
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:39,088
and it was really expensive
because I haven't driven since 1984.

816
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:42,716
But I didn't tell you on Thursday, Gerri,
because I knew I was coming here today

817
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,385
and I wanted to surprise you all.

818
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:46,428
It is a surprise.
Shall I take that from you?

819
00:52:46,512 --> 00:52:48,138
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.
- Thank you.

820
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:49,932
Oh, Tom, sorry.

821
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:52,893
- Can I have a little glass, please?
- Sure?

822
00:52:52,977 --> 00:52:54,728
You shouldn't drive if you're drinking.

823
00:52:54,812 --> 00:52:58,065
I know, Gerri, but you're allowed
a couple of glasses, aren't you, Tanya?

824
00:52:58,148 --> 00:53:00,359
- Small ones.
- Yeah, yeah. Is that all right, Tom?

825
00:53:00,442 --> 00:53:01,986
Yeah.

826
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:04,655
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hi.

827
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:06,490
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, don't be daft.

828
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:08,284
- Hi, Tanya.
- Hello.

829
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,536
Oh, we really miss you at work,
don't we, Gerri?

830
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,289
- Sweetheart.
- When are you back off maternity leave?

831
00:53:13,372 --> 00:53:15,082
- Give us a chance.
- Oh, yeah.

832
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:16,709
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

833
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,336
- Oh, it's really lovely to see you.
- You too.

834
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,298
- Hi, Ken. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

835
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:24,633
- Come and sit down, Mary.
- Have a seat, Mary.

836
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,635
- Is anyone sitting here?
- No.

837
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,555
- No.
- Oh, this is lovely. Hiya, Jack.

838
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:31,640
I thought you were going to miss me out, Mary.

839
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:34,393
Oh, sorry. Where's Janey?

840
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,562
She's a bit under the weather
this afternoon.

841
00:53:36,645 --> 00:53:38,814
Oh, sorry to hear that. Oh, I'm starving.

842
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:40,733
Oh, the baby!

843
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:43,152
- Oh, yeah, the baby.
- I'm sorry, Tanya.

844
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:45,321
- That's all right.
- Oh, hello, little Isaac.

845
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:47,489
Say hello. Don't mind the funny lady.

846
00:53:47,573 --> 00:53:49,366
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognise him.

847
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,118
Oh, he's asleep.

848
00:53:51,202 --> 00:53:53,037
Oh, hasn't he grown?
He's got ever so big.

849
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,830
- They do that.
- Here you are.

850
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:57,374
- Oh, thanks, Tom.
- I'll give him to you.

851
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:01,795
- Where do you want him?
- Oh, that's better.

852
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:04,173
Are you OK?

853
00:54:04,256 --> 00:54:05,758
We've saved you some food, Mary.

854
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,594
- I hope it's still warm.
- Oh, thanks, Gerri. That will be fine.

855
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:11,722
- I'll do you some fresh, if you like.
- Oh, no, don't worry about me.

856
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:14,225
- So you didn't get arrested, Mary?
- No, I didn't, Joe.

857
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:15,935
He was very kind to me, actually.

858
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,728
What CC is your car?

859
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:22,024
- What do you mean?
- How big's the engine?

860
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:23,817
Oh, I don't know.

861
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:27,613
It's about this big, I think.

862
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,827
- What's so funny?
- Don't be cruel.

863
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:36,872
He means, how powerful is it, Mary?
How many cubic centimetres?

864
00:54:36,956 --> 00:54:38,499
- Oh.
- You should know that.

865
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:40,876
On the back there's numbers,
like 1.6 or 1.9.

866
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,963
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah.
Well, that's boys' stuff, isn't it?

867
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:46,257
- It's not important.
- No, Tanya.

868
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:49,844
I think I'm gonna have a cigarette
before I eat this.

869
00:54:49,927 --> 00:54:52,429
- I'll get out your way.
- Shall we take Isaac over there?

870
00:54:52,513 --> 00:54:55,641
Oh, well, I thought you wouldn't mind
cos we're outside.

871
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:57,893
- We don't, Mary. You carry on.
- You're all right.

872
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:00,479
- You're all right.
- It's OK. I fancy a swing.

873
00:55:02,314 --> 00:55:05,985
- Have one of these, Mary.
- It's all right. I've got my own, thank you.

874
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,028
- Here.
- Oh...

875
00:55:09,947 --> 00:55:11,365
Thanks.

876
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,286
I'll have a smoke with you.

877
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:19,623
Well, I don't really smoke, normally.

878
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:22,084
I just have the occasional one or two.

879
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,968
How are you doing?

880
00:55:32,386 --> 00:55:34,680
Yeah, I'm really well, thanks, Ken.

881
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,142
Still on your own, are you?

882
00:55:38,225 --> 00:55:40,561
Yeah, I am and I like it like that, you know.

883
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:42,479
You're like me.

884
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:53,991
He's good.

885
00:55:54,074 --> 00:55:55,826
He's great.

886
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,870
- He's a hungry bugger.
- Is he?

887
00:55:57,953 --> 00:55:59,496
Just like his dad.

888
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,165
Is he a good dad?

889
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:02,166
Yeah.

890
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:03,959
Is he a nappy changer?

891
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:05,294
Ish.

892
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:07,338
I expect you're too capable.

893
00:56:08,422 --> 00:56:10,382
- Oh, I am.
- Like Gerri was.

894
00:56:11,258 --> 00:56:12,843
Like Gerri was what?

895
00:56:12,927 --> 00:56:16,263
- Mind your own business.
- We're talking about you, not to you.

896
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:20,684
Hey, thanks for popping round on Friday.
Janey really appreciated it.

897
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:22,186
- How is she?
- Not good.

898
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:23,229
No.

899
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:27,316
It's exhausting all the time, just getting up
and down the stairs, knocks her out.

900
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,734
I noticed.

901
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:33,739
She could do with losing a few pounds,
but she's not getting any exercise, so...

902
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,783
- How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm all right.

903
00:56:35,866 --> 00:56:38,869
We stay cheerful, you know?
We don't let things get us down.

904
00:56:38,953 --> 00:56:40,287
That's the spirit.

905
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:50,339
No, it's all right, Ken. I can pour my own wine,
thank you very much.

906
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:51,382
Sorry.

907
00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:53,384
Look at the food in this fridge.

908
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:55,344
I haven't got anything in mine.

909
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:57,179
I'll see you later, all right?

910
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:01,058
Here she comes.

911
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:03,394
- Can I come in the middle?
- Of course you can.

912
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:05,479
Never come between a mother and her son.

913
00:57:07,147 --> 00:57:08,941
Oh, this is my second one, Gerri.

914
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:11,193
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, and then that's it.

915
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:13,279
This could be the making of you, Mary.

916
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:14,363
Yeah.

917
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:15,990
I think so, Gerri.

918
00:57:16,073 --> 00:57:19,785
I mean, just driving here today,
I felt like a whole person.

919
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,829
- Did you?
- Yeah, a free spirit.

920
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:25,207
I mean, even though the journey
was a complete nightmare,

921
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:29,420
from beginning to end - it was awful,
people were getting so cross with me.

922
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:31,422
It's a lovely little car.

923
00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:33,591
I want you to come out and see it later.

924
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:37,303
I feel really good behind the wheel,
really special.

925
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:40,681
- You looked so lovely holding that baby.
- He's delightful.

926
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:43,851
I expect you're looking forward
to being a grandmother.

927
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:45,686
Hm, you should ask my son about that.

928
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,521
It's got nothing to do with me.

929
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:49,190
He's great, isn't he?

930
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:52,651
You should come out and have a drink
with us sometime, me and your mum.

931
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,402
Yeah?

932
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:56,322
- Yeah, why not? We often go, don't we?
- Occasionally, yes.

933
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,450
- Yeah, I know you do.
- It doesn't even have to be your mum.

934
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:01,535
- It could be just us.
- Just you and me?

935
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:05,414
Yeah, well, we've known each other a while,
haven't we? We're old friends.

936
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:07,166
Could you get me a refill, Joe?

937
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:10,336
- Yes, Mummy.
- Thank you.

938
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:15,925
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

939
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:18,511
- Can I get you a drink?
- Got one somewhere.

940
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,390
Oh, here comes Ken.

941
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:27,394
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

942
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,190
- He's a good lad.
- Yes.

943
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:37,404
He could be quite good-looking,
if he wanted to.

944
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:38,906
How's it going?

945
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:40,533
He's got a nice clean bum.

946
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:43,202
He should lose a couple of
stone, shouldn't he?

947
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:46,372
He was a good-looking man
when he was young.

948
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:47,915
- Was he?
- Mm.

949
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:51,168
He's got a good heart.

950
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,548
Life's not always kind, is it?

951
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,175
No, it isn't, Gerri.

952
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,190
I don't mind the grey hair.

953
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,571
I think that can look quite distinguished
on a man of his age, but...

954
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:22,616
You know.

955
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:40,134
- I'll give you a ring in the week.
- We'll have a proper game next time.

956
00:59:40,217 --> 00:59:41,969
- Ta-ta.
- See you.

957
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,561
Hi, Joe.

958
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:51,896
Hi.

959
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,939
- Have you come back to me?
- I have.

960
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,317
- They all come back in the end.
- Do they?

961
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,195
- In my nightmares.
- Oh, it's as bad as that, is it?

962
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:01,405
Oh, let's not open that can of worms.

963
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:04,366
- No, let's leave that closed.
- Not today, anyway.

964
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,287
Oh, how are you, Joe?

965
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:11,415
- Is life treating you kind?
- Can't complain.

966
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,210
- Really?
- Yes.

967
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:16,253
Nothing you want to share with me?

968
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:18,797
No, I don't think so.

969
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,634
Because you know that you can talk to me.

970
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,677
Any time you like.

971
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:26,430
Well, I'll come and find you if I need you.

972
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:27,973
Yeah. Yeah.

973
01:00:28,766 --> 01:00:31,143
I like to feel that I'm always there for you.

974
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:33,854
Thanks, Mary.

975
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:35,397
How are you?

976
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:39,985
Yeah, I'm all right.

977
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,612
No, I'm great, actually.

978
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:43,656
- Well, you look well.
- Do I?

979
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:45,074
Oh, thank you.

980
01:00:46,116 --> 01:00:47,576
I suddenly feel...

981
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,078
really liberated.

982
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:51,622
- Well, you're a free spirit now.
- I know.

983
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:54,083
You're your own woman.
The world's your oyster.

984
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:56,794
It's so exciting, isn't it?

985
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:58,504
I feel like Thelma and Louise.

986
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:03,259
This little car is going to change my life.

987
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:04,844
Well, let's hope so.

988
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,764
I do feel a bit guilty, though,
but at the end of the day...

989
01:01:09,807 --> 01:01:11,225
...so what?

990
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:13,060
It's my little present to me.

991
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:14,687
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

992
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:19,441
Because if I don't treat myself,
nobody else is going to, are they?

993
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:21,277
What are you going to call this car?

994
01:01:22,403 --> 01:01:25,114
Ooh, I don't know.
Why? Do you give names to things?

995
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:27,533
- I've got names for everything.
- Really?

996
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:30,202
- Like what?
- Well, my nose is called Roger.

997
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,037
Oh, you mean...

998
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,664
...your body parts!

999
01:01:33,747 --> 01:01:36,917
Yeah, I'm not going to introduce you
to everyone though.

1000
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:40,421
What, not even little Percy?

1001
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:42,047
You've already met my knee, then?

1002
01:01:44,049 --> 01:01:46,427
Oh, Joe, we must go out
and have a drink one night.

1003
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,470
- We have such a laugh.
- Yeah, we do.

1004
01:01:48,554 --> 01:01:52,224
You see, the thing about you and me is
that we've always just sort of clicked.

1005
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,934
- Haven't we?
- Yeah.

1006
01:01:54,018 --> 01:01:54,768
Yeah.

1007
01:01:57,813 --> 01:01:59,899
It's nice when that happens, isn't it?

1008
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:07,865
Do you remember
when you showed me your little box?

1009
01:02:07,948 --> 01:02:08,908
Yes.

1010
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:11,535
You wouldn't tell me what was in it.

1011
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:13,204
I'm still not going to tell you.

1012
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:14,455
I know.

1013
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:15,497
What?

1014
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,709
I'm not telling you.

1015
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:21,670
I still think about that.

1016
01:02:21,754 --> 01:02:23,714
We had a barbeque that day, didn't we?

1017
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:26,884
Oh! It still smells the same.

1018
01:02:26,967 --> 01:02:28,552
It's messy, isn't it?

1019
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:32,431
Your kids will enjoy playing in here, won't they?

1020
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:35,267
One day.

1021
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:41,690
So, is there anyone special in your life
at the moment, Joe?

1022
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:44,026
- No.
- Oh, good.

1023
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:47,196
No, what I mean is, that's all right.
You're comfortable with that.

1024
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:48,572
- Aren't you?
- Am I?

1025
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:52,326
Well, the thing is, Joe, you're young.
You still want to be out there, don't you?

1026
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,827
What, sowing my wild oats?

1027
01:02:53,911 --> 01:02:55,246
Well, yeah.

1028
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:58,624
Live life while you can.
Don't think about tomorrow.

1029
01:02:58,707 --> 01:03:01,126
Well, a lot of my friends
are getting married.

1030
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,421
Oh, but, yeah,
you wanna be careful, Joe, because...

1031
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:10,928
See, I got married in my 20s
and, granted he was the wrong man,

1032
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:12,763
but I was too young.

1033
01:03:12,847 --> 01:03:14,515
I couldn't handle it.

1034
01:03:14,598 --> 01:03:19,103
But when I was in my 30s,
I met the right man and I was mature.

1035
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,771
I was ready for it.

1036
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:26,694
I mean, he left me, but...

1037
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,864
What can you do?

1038
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,618
It's never too late, Mary.

1039
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,371
Oh, no, I know it isn't, Joe,

1040
01:03:37,454 --> 01:03:40,875
and, you know me, I'm very much
a glass-half-full kind of girl.

1041
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:43,586
But it's tricky, because...

1042
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:48,132
I meet these older men,
who want somebody younger,

1043
01:03:48,215 --> 01:03:50,467
and that's great, because I fit the bill.

1044
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,970
But...

1045
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:55,014
when they find out that...

1046
01:03:56,307 --> 01:03:58,976
...you know, I'm not as young
as they thought...

1047
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:01,187
they don't want to know.

1048
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:04,732
My looks work against me.

1049
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:10,112
How old do you think I look, Joe?

1050
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:15,910
60?

1051
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:18,370
70?

1052
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,039
Oh, stop it.

1053
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:32,343
Oh, it's all right.
You don't have to answer that.

1054
01:04:32,426 --> 01:04:34,595
So, when are we going to have this drink?

1055
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:36,847
I don't know. I'll have to check my diary.

1056
01:04:36,931 --> 01:04:38,849
- Yeah. You do that. Give me a call.
- I will.

1057
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:40,893
- Promise.
- I promise.

1058
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:53,030
Mate, got to get your train. We should get
cracking. I'll run you to the station.

1059
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:54,698
You've had too much to drink, Tom.

1060
01:04:54,782 --> 01:04:56,450
- No, I haven't.
- I think you have.

1061
01:04:56,534 --> 01:04:58,619
- I'm all right.
- We can get him a mini cab.

1062
01:04:58,702 --> 01:05:01,705
- No, I'll be fine on the tube.
- You don't want to get a mini cab.

1063
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:04,500
It might take 20 minutes to turn up.
We haven't got time.

1064
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,877
I had a really bad experience
in a mini cab once.

1065
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:09,421
- You're going on the tube, aren't you?
- Of course.

1066
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,716
Don't go on the tube, Joe. I can give you a lift.
You can be my navigator.

1067
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,260
- Ooh, that sounds fun.
- Yeah.

1068
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,887
You can give them both a lift.
All in the same direction.

1069
01:05:16,971 --> 01:05:20,140
- I'm not sure Mary can manage that.
- Of course I can. Oh, I don't know.

1070
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:22,685
- I'll be fine on the tube, honest.
- It's a great idea.

1071
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:25,938
- I don't know how to get to King's Cross.
- I do. We can all go together.

1072
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,983
- Great. Is that all right with you, Mary?
- Yeah, of course it is.

1073
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:30,651
It'll be good practice for me.

1074
01:05:30,734 --> 01:05:33,195
I'm going to run upstairs
before we go on the journey.

1075
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:34,864
I'm not sure about this.

1076
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:36,365
It'll be fine.

1077
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:37,992
Better pack my bag.

1078
01:05:38,075 --> 01:05:39,535
- Tom.
- What?

1079
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:43,372
What do you think, Tom?

1080
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:45,791
Well, it's small and red.
It's what you asked for.

1081
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,419
- What have you done, Mary?
- It's great, isn't it?

1082
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:50,045
- Nice bit of parking, Mary.
- Oh.

1083
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:53,132
Oh, God, I didn't lock it.

1084
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,634
It's a good job it didn't get pinched, isn't it?

1085
01:05:57,678 --> 01:05:59,471
By the way, Mary, it's a 1.4.

1086
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,514
Oh.

1087
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,143
You must come again.
Now you don't know the way.

1088
01:06:09,315 --> 01:06:10,858
Oi, where are you going?

1089
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:26,832
Oh, God, Joe.

1090
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,293
- What am I going to do without you?
- You'll be fine.

1091
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:31,587
Can't you stay just till we get to King's Cross?

1092
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,216
- We'll be all right, Mary.
- Ken! You don't even know London.

1093
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:36,759
It'll be signposted.

1094
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:40,429
It's so lovely having you next to me, Joe,
telling me where to go and what to do.

1095
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:41,972
It's been a pleasure, Mary.

1096
01:06:42,056 --> 01:06:45,017
Oh, please, I'll take you anywhere you want.
I'll take you home.

1097
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,560
Just here will do.

1098
01:06:46,644 --> 01:06:48,479
Oh, God. All right. Let me pull in.

1099
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,072
Oh, bye, then. But lovely to see you.

1100
01:06:58,155 --> 01:07:00,241
- Don't forget to give me a ring.
- No, I won't.

1101
01:07:00,324 --> 01:07:01,659
- Bye, Joe.
- Yeah, take care.

1102
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:03,536
- See you soon.
- Look after yourself.

1103
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,538
- Oh, Joe, where do I go?
- Straight ahead.

1104
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,665
- Left round the one-way system.
- Yeah. OK.

1105
01:07:07,748 --> 01:07:09,291
- Bye, then. Bye.
- Yeah.

1106
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:11,252
- I'll get in the front now.
- Oh, no, Ken.

1107
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:12,878
We haven't got time for this.

1108
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:15,589
Oh, for God's sake.

1109
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:20,386
Oh! No need to slam the door.

1110
01:07:31,272 --> 01:07:33,190
- You better hurry up.
- Yeah, I'll run.

1111
01:07:33,274 --> 01:07:34,984
Yeah, I'll see you soon, then.

1112
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,610
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Bye.

1113
01:07:36,694 --> 01:07:37,903
Bye, Ken.

1114
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,865
- I like you, Mary. Can I phone you?
- No, Ken. No.

1115
01:07:40,948 --> 01:07:44,201
- I could come down and see you.
- Take your hand off of me, please, Ken!

1116
01:07:44,285 --> 01:07:45,202
Sorry.

1117
01:07:45,286 --> 01:07:47,037
I'm going to have to be honest with you.

1118
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:50,457
I just don't have those kind of feelings
for you, Ken. I'm really sorry.

1119
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:51,500
Right.

1120
01:07:54,628 --> 01:07:55,379
Oh!

1121
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,464
Sorry, I got carried away.
I didn't mean to.

1122
01:07:57,548 --> 01:08:00,134
It's all right. Hurry up.
Your train is going in a minute.

1123
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:02,261
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, all right. Bye.

1124
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:05,681
God Almighty!

1125
01:09:26,053 --> 01:09:28,597
- I'll put the kettle on.
- The sooner the better.

1126
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:31,809
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1127
01:09:31,892 --> 01:09:34,311
What are you doing here, you daft bugger?

1128
01:09:34,395 --> 01:09:35,938
I've come to surprise you.

1129
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:36,981
Joe!

1130
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:39,817
- You certainly did that.
- It's lovely to see you.

1131
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,818
Ohh!

1132
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:41,902
Hello!

1133
01:09:41,986 --> 01:09:43,946
Sorry. He made me hide behind the door.

1134
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:46,699
- You frightened the life out of me.
- So, who's this, then?

1135
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,450
- Mum, Dad, this is Katie.
- Hello.

1136
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:51,787
- This is Tom and Gerri.
- Tom and Gerri? That's brilliant!

1137
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:53,205
Yeah, well...

1138
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,541
We've learnt to live with it over the years.

1139
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,585
- So, what's your name again?
- Katie.

1140
01:09:57,668 --> 01:09:58,627
Katie.

1141
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:00,838
- So have you been at the allotment?
- Yes.

1142
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:03,340
Gathering the last of the season's harvest.

1143
01:10:03,424 --> 01:10:05,593
We've brought back some lovely tomatoes.

1144
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:07,219
- Yeah.
- Sounds gorgeous.

1145
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:11,515
- We were going to have a sandwich.
- Are you both hungry?

1146
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:13,350
- I'm starving.
- She's starving.

1147
01:10:13,434 --> 01:10:16,478
- I'll just go and change.
- Let me get out of this filthy clobber.

1148
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:18,522
- You go on through, Joe.
- All right.

1149
01:10:21,358 --> 01:10:23,652
This is a lovely big kitchen, isn't it?

1150
01:10:23,736 --> 01:10:25,696
- It's gigantic.
- Shut up!

1151
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:28,657
- Thank you for the flowers, Katie.
- Glad you like them.

1152
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:30,618
- They're lovely.
- They're all right.

1153
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:32,661
- Sit yourself down.
- Thank you.

1154
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:36,040
- So how did you two meet?
- Our eyes met across a crowded bar.

1155
01:10:36,123 --> 01:10:38,042
We'd both been stood up by our dates.

1156
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:41,086
- Ah, the bonding of the jilted.
- Something like that.

1157
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,755
- Pretty much.
- When was this?

1158
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,382
- Oh, about three months ago, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1159
01:10:45,466 --> 01:10:47,760
- You never told us.
- Master of discretion.

1160
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,429
- I didn't know he had it in him.
- My enigmatic son.

1161
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,473
- You know me.
- Must be important.

1162
01:10:52,556 --> 01:10:55,643
- Oh, he's a dark horse.
- I wanted to keep you a secret.

1163
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:59,104
- You son's a weirdo!
- Yes, we know. He's having treatment.

1164
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,814
Help yourself. Tuck in.

1165
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:02,733
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

1166
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:05,736
- My mum and dad know all about you.
- Do they now?

1167
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:08,113
- And what do they do, Katie?
- Oh, my dad's a postman

1168
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,907
and my mum works
on a make-up counter.

1169
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,617
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you work at?

1170
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,620
- I'm an occupational therapist.
- Oh, are you? Where do you work?

1171
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,789
- At the Royal Free.
- That's a great hospital.

1172
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,291
- It's pretty good.
- Do you specialise?

1173
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,836
Yeah. Care of the elderly
and stroke rehab.

1174
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:23,128
What's straight rehab?

1175
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:25,422
Stroke rehab.

1176
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:27,049
You are going deaf.

1177
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:30,094
Oh, stroke rehab.
I thought you said straight rehab.

1178
01:11:30,177 --> 01:11:31,720
What's straight rehab?

1179
01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:34,223
What, for gay men who are on the turn?

1180
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:38,269
Or straight men, who tried being gay,
but want to be rehabilitated into straight.

1181
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,023
- Joe tells me you're a counsellor, Gerri.
- Yes, I am, for my sins.

1182
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:47,444
But it's great to come home and feel like
you've made a contribution, isn't it?

1183
01:11:47,528 --> 01:11:48,696
Yes, of course.

1184
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:50,489
Or not, as the case may be.

1185
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,449
Oh, I'm sure you contribute.

1186
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:55,327
Not me. I'm talking about you lot
in the caring professions.

1187
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,954
- I don't care.
- We know.

1188
01:11:57,037 --> 01:11:58,372
Hard man.

1189
01:11:59,373 --> 01:12:02,960
And I know you're a geologist, Tom,
but what exactly do you do?

1190
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:06,297
Ah, yes. Strictly speaking, I'm actually
an engineering geologist.

1191
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,340
- Which means that I...
- He digs holes.

1192
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,467
- I investigate...
- You dig holes.

1193
01:12:10,551 --> 01:12:11,969
All right. I dig holes.

1194
01:12:12,052 --> 01:12:14,763
That's just calling a spade a spade,
isn't it?

1195
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,391
- I always call it a shovel.
- You call it a fork.

1196
01:12:17,474 --> 01:12:21,645
I call it a trailer-mounted-tripod
cable-percussive boring unit.

1197
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:24,356
And that's why I love him.

1198
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,567
No, I investigate
the ground beneath our feet

1199
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,987
to test the feasibility of various
engineering and building projects.

1200
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:32,615
It sounds amazing. What are you
working on at the moment?

1201
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:36,619
Ah, yes. Well, right now, the main project
is an eight-metre-diameter tunnel,

1202
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:40,581
which is going to alleviate the pressure
on London's Victorian sewage system.

1203
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:41,624
Blimey.

1204
01:12:41,707 --> 01:12:43,667
Eight metres? That's big.

1205
01:12:43,751 --> 01:12:48,005
Oh, yeah. And it'll follow the path
of the Thames for 20 miles,

1206
01:12:48,088 --> 01:12:49,882
up to 80 metres underground.

1207
01:12:49,924 --> 01:12:51,592
And that's just for this household.

1208
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:54,220
So, it's quite a big number.

1209
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,972
I'm not doing it on my own.
There's a few of us.

1210
01:12:57,014 --> 01:12:59,725
- It won't be finished till after I'm dead.
- Oh, no.

1211
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,435
You'd better get a move on.

1212
01:13:05,105 --> 01:13:07,149
Help yourself.
Is there anything you want?

1213
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:09,652
- Some ham?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm a veggie, actually.

1214
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:10,986
- Are you?
- Mm.

1215
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:13,155
This cheese is gorgeous, though.
Thank you.

1216
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:14,990
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

1217
01:13:15,074 --> 01:13:17,368
- What have you got planned later?
- Ah, yes.

1218
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,912
- We're having a visitation.
- Sounds ominous.

1219
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,373
- Mary's coming for tea.
- Oh, I was right.

1220
01:13:22,456 --> 01:13:24,834
- Who's Mary?
- She's a friend from work.

1221
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,086
- Oh, right.
- Yes, she's... Yes.

1222
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:29,922
She's something else.

1223
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,423
I won't ask.

1224
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:37,555
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Joe!

1225
01:13:37,638 --> 01:13:39,598
How lovely to see you.

1226
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:41,684
This is a surprise. How are you?

1227
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:43,686
- I'm good.
- Oh, you look great.

1228
01:13:43,769 --> 01:13:45,729
- So do you.
- Oh, thank you.

1229
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:50,734
Hello, Mary.
I'm Tom. I'm his father. I live here.

1230
01:13:50,818 --> 01:13:52,194
Oh, Tom.

1231
01:13:53,237 --> 01:13:54,989
My two favourite men.

1232
01:13:55,072 --> 01:13:56,532
In you go.

1233
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:58,534
- You never rang me.
- I'm sorry.

1234
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:01,787
Whatever happened to that drink
we were gonna have?

1235
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:04,790
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, Joe, you shouldn't have.

1236
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:07,168
- Hello.
- Katie, this is Mary. Mary, this is Katie.

1237
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:09,253
- Hello, Mary. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

1238
01:14:09,336 --> 01:14:11,755
- This is Joe's girlfriend.
- I like your jacket.

1239
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,716
Your mum gave me a pot of basil. Smell that.

1240
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:15,885
- She's going to make him some pesto.
- Lovely.

1241
01:14:15,968 --> 01:14:18,345
- Shall I take your jacket, Mary?
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.

1242
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:21,098
- How are you, Mary?
- Yeah, I'm really good, thanks, yeah.

1243
01:14:21,182 --> 01:14:23,142
- How was your journey?
- It was all right.

1244
01:14:25,269 --> 01:14:28,272
- Oh, no, it wasn't actually.
- Didn't get lost again, did you?

1245
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:30,524
Oh, no, the journey was all right.
It's the car.

1246
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:33,319
- Is it OK?
- What happened?

1247
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,237
- It wouldn't start.
- Oh, no.

1248
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:37,990
Yeah, it's a nightmare.
I had to come on the tube.

1249
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,034
And it got broken into last night.

1250
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:42,077
- Oh, sorry to hear that.
- Oh, no.

1251
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:45,122
Yeah, I did my big weekly
supermarket shop yesterday,

1252
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:48,167
which is great, I couldn't do that
before I had the car.

1253
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,462
I went nice and early,
so it wouldn't be dark when I got back.

1254
01:14:51,545 --> 01:14:55,674
I brought three bags in, but I must have
left the fourth one on the front seat.

1255
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,302
I got in. I thought, that's great, that's done,

1256
01:14:58,385 --> 01:15:01,347
I can chill out now
and have a nice little glass of wine.

1257
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,474
I had a really nice evening, actually.

1258
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:04,517
Er...

1259
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,895
But then, this morning,
I'm in the bathroom, I'm sitting on...

1260
01:15:07,978 --> 01:15:10,564
Cos it's the toilet roll that I've left in the car.

1261
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:13,108
So, I rush out
and my window's been smashed.

1262
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,152
There's glass everywhere

1263
01:15:15,236 --> 01:15:17,446
and all my toilet rolls have been stolen.

1264
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:19,865
- It's probably kids.
- I think you're right.

1265
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:21,325
Are you insured, Mary?

1266
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:25,246
- Yeah, of course I'm insured.
- Well, that's something, isn't it?

1267
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,665
You can't drive a car without insurance.
It's illegal.

1268
01:15:27,748 --> 01:15:30,334
I know. At least you'll be able
to claim for your window.

1269
01:15:30,376 --> 01:15:31,669
I know.

1270
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:36,006
Anyway, I'm... I'm sick of it. I just left it.
It's just a car. What does it matter?

1271
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,925
Go on. Sit yourself down, Mary.

1272
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:40,719
- Put the kettle on, Tom.
- Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

1273
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:44,014
It's given me a lot of stress, Tom.

1274
01:15:44,056 --> 01:15:46,976
This car's been a catalogue of disaster, hasn't
it?

1275
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:48,227
I know.

1276
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,062
Cut your losses, Mary. Get rid of it.

1277
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,982
But I've spent so much on it, Tom.
I can't just sell it now.

1278
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:55,609
But if you keep it,
it's only going to get worse.

1279
01:15:55,693 --> 01:15:58,195
- Well, you know what I think, Mary.
- Yeah, yeah.

1280
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:00,573
I'm fed up with it, to be honest, Tom.

1281
01:16:00,614 --> 01:16:02,575
I've had three punctures.

1282
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,326
- Three punctures?
- Yeah.

1283
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:07,413
My exhaust has fallen off. I had to get
a new one. My carburettor went.

1284
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,623
You can't take it back
to the guys you got it from?

1285
01:16:09,707 --> 01:16:13,586
No. They'd guarantee the labour for three
months, but not the parts. Bastards.

1286
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,505
Other way round, isn't it?
Parts for three months, not labour.

1287
01:16:16,589 --> 01:16:17,548
No.

1288
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:20,426
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1289
01:16:20,467 --> 01:16:23,762
Oh, I don't know. Anyway...
my windscreen wiper got ripped off.

1290
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:26,098
I got three points for speeding, at £60 each.

1291
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,601
So, I've got nine points on my driving licence.

1292
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,019
- Haven't I, Gerri?
- Yes.

1293
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:31,645
It keeps making funny noises.

1294
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:35,024
I got towed away and I wasn't even
parked on a double-yellow line.

1295
01:16:35,065 --> 01:16:38,611
I've got seven parking tickets...
no, nine parking tickets.

1296
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,070
And then...

1297
01:16:40,154 --> 01:16:42,990
I broke down on the motorway
on the way to Brighton

1298
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:45,034
and I got towed to Crawley,

1299
01:16:45,117 --> 01:16:48,621
which is the last place I want to go,
because I grew up there and I hate it.

1300
01:16:48,662 --> 01:16:52,458
So, I had to get the train home and then
the train back to Crawley the next day

1301
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,335
and the guy kept trying to touch me up.

1302
01:16:54,418 --> 01:16:57,630
It cost me nearly £500 and I never even
got my weekend in Brighton.

1303
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,840
That was supposed to be my summer holiday.

1304
01:16:59,924 --> 01:17:00,758
Yes.

1305
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:02,635
- It's not fair, is it?
- No.

1306
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:05,429
- Well, never mind.
- Come and sit down, Mary. Relax.

1307
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:07,890
- Yeah, thanks, Joe.
- At least you're here now, eh?

1308
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:11,268
- What did you say your name was?
- Katie.

1309
01:17:12,144 --> 01:17:13,604
Oh.

1310
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,775
Well, the good news is, Mary,
I've made a cake in your honour.

1311
01:17:17,816 --> 01:17:19,193
Oh, thanks, Gerri.

1312
01:17:19,276 --> 01:17:21,654
She knew you were coming,
so she baked a cake!

1313
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,698
- Don't forget to give me the recipe.
- No, I won't forget, Katie.

1314
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:27,076
- You haven't tasted it yet.
- Oh, it smells nice.

1315
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:30,996
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having the recipe
for that. I've never baked a cake before.

1316
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,332
- Of course you can.
- You can have a cake-off!

1317
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,168
Oh, I don't think so.
I tried making a fruit cake once.

1318
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:38,796
Everything sank to the bottom.
It was horrible.

1319
01:17:38,879 --> 01:17:40,506
You're a good cook.

1320
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:41,966
Thank you.

1321
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:47,304
- What about these two, then, Mary?
- Such a surprise.

1322
01:17:47,388 --> 01:17:51,058
This monster hid this young lady
behind the sitting-room door.

1323
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:54,311
- Made me jump.
- I nearly gave poor Tom a heart attack.

1324
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:55,729
She passed the test.

1325
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:59,275
Surprised you passed the test.
I'd have got rid of you on the spot.

1326
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,026
A terrible way to treat someone.

1327
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,488
- Yeah.
- We had absolutely no idea.

1328
01:18:04,572 --> 01:18:06,323
- My big secret.
- Oh, thanks very much.

1329
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:08,367
It's obviously serious.

1330
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,705
Still, it's been really good to meet you both,
though, and we had a lovely lunch.

1331
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,415
You didn't say you were having lunch.

1332
01:18:14,498 --> 01:18:18,127
- We have lunch every day.
- I know you have lunch every day, Joe.

1333
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,545
Bread and cheese.

1334
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,298
- Nothing special.
- I thought it was special.

1335
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:25,926
We had some tomatoes from Tom
and Gerri's allotment. Have you tasted them?

1336
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:29,430
Loads of times. Gerri's always giving me
stuff, aren't you, Gerri?

1337
01:18:29,513 --> 01:18:32,183
- I'll give you some to take home, Mary.
- Oh, great.

1338
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:34,185
Oh, yeah, I can take them on the tube.

1339
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:37,563
So, what is it you do, then, Jackie?

1340
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:38,981
Katie.

1341
01:18:40,357 --> 01:18:43,194
- Katie.
- Don't worry. An occupational therapist.

1342
01:18:44,737 --> 01:18:45,696
Oh.

1343
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:48,866
She looks after stroke victims
and the elderly.

1344
01:18:48,949 --> 01:18:52,703
And... I grew up just down the road
from you, in Croydon.

1345
01:18:53,787 --> 01:18:57,041
- I only went to college in Croydon.
- Oh, right. Which college?

1346
01:18:58,292 --> 01:18:59,877
Croydon College.

1347
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,420
The aptly named.

1348
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:05,090
So which course did you do? Secretarial?

1349
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:07,468
What makes you think I'm a secretary?

1350
01:19:08,594 --> 01:19:10,554
Well, you are, aren't you?

1351
01:19:10,638 --> 01:19:12,765
- Gerri said...
- Yes.

1352
01:19:15,059 --> 01:19:16,018
Well...

1353
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,355
I got my diploma. I look after the doctors.

1354
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:20,856
Oh, brilliant.

1355
01:19:21,982 --> 01:19:24,610
So have you two worked together
for a long time?

1356
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,987
Ooh, about 20 years, haven't we, Mary?

1357
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:28,030
Yeah.

1358
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:31,116
- Mary's known Joe since he was ten.
- No way!

1359
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,911
I bet you've got some embarrassing stories.

1360
01:19:33,994 --> 01:19:35,996
I've got some really nice stories, actually.

1361
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,958
Joe and I have shared some really
special moments, haven't we?

1362
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:41,919
- Yes, Mary.
- It'll just have to be our secret, won't it?

1363
01:19:42,002 --> 01:19:43,629
She's almost like an auntie to him.

1364
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:45,047
I wouldn't say that.

1365
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,924
Well, we think of you as his auntie.

1366
01:19:46,966 --> 01:19:48,425
Auntie Mary.

1367
01:19:48,509 --> 01:19:50,302
I think that's really sweet.

1368
01:19:51,637 --> 01:19:54,056
- Right. Who wants some cake?
- Yes, please.

1369
01:19:59,103 --> 01:20:00,646
Auntie Mary.

1370
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,314
Thanks, Joe.

1371
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,025
Thanks, Mum.

1372
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,445
It must be really boring looking after old people.

1373
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:10,155
No, I love it.

1374
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,325
You get to know them really well
and, well...

1375
01:20:14,368 --> 01:20:16,620
...we're all going to be old, one day,
aren't we?

1376
01:20:16,704 --> 01:20:18,247
Touch wood.

1377
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,875
Some of us already are.

1378
01:20:22,668 --> 01:20:24,628
We look after old people, don't we, Gerri?

1379
01:20:25,462 --> 01:20:27,214
No, not in the same way.

1380
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,432
Amazing cake.

1381
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:38,058
Thank you, Katie.

1382
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:45,357
Right.

1383
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:47,193
We'll see you when we see you.

1384
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:49,695
- Soon. Hopefully.
- And you'll never know when.

1385
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,073
- Probably find you hiding in the shed.
- Or lurking in the bathroom.

1386
01:20:53,157 --> 01:20:54,700
- Or down the toilet.
- Oh, nice!

1387
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:56,994
- You must come to supper.
- Yes, please.

1388
01:20:57,077 --> 01:20:59,747
I hear you're both excellent cooks. No pressure.

1389
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,082
- Tom makes a mean curry.
- Oh, I love curry.

1390
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:06,045
- Well, there's been no litigation to date.
- I'll take my chances, then.

1391
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:07,546
- I'll speak to you later.
- Bye.

1392
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,298
- See you, boy.
- Bye-bye. Take care.

1393
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,634
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the flowers.

1394
01:21:11,717 --> 01:21:13,886
- A pleasure. Lovely to meet you.
- You, too.

1395
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,096
Bye, Mary. Really nice to meet you.

1396
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,140
Hope you get your car sorted out.

1397
01:21:18,224 --> 01:21:19,808
- Bye, Katie.
- Bye.

1398
01:21:19,892 --> 01:21:21,852
- Bye.
- See you soon.

1399
01:21:21,894 --> 01:21:23,938
- Yeah. Safe journey. Bye.
- Bye.

1400
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,566
How about that, then?

1401
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,694
- That's a turn-up for the books.
- You're not kidding.

1402
01:21:30,778 --> 01:21:33,614
- Excuse me, I've got a bit of work to do.
- All right.

1403
01:21:33,697 --> 01:21:37,826
I was going to bring you some flowers, Gerri.
I just couldn't find anywhere open.

1404
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:39,328
Don't be silly.

1405
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,169
Gerri?

1406
01:21:48,212 --> 01:21:49,463
What?

1407
01:21:49,547 --> 01:21:52,424
- What do you think of her?
- She's lovely, isn't she?

1408
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:56,720
Well, I don't know.

1409
01:21:56,804 --> 01:21:58,347
Joe likes her.

1410
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:00,182
Yeah, but, you know.

1411
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:02,268
They seem to connect.

1412
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:04,395
Well, he's only young, isn't he?

1413
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:06,689
He's 30 years old, Mary.

1414
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:11,193
No, but what I mean is,
he doesn't want to rush into anything.

1415
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,153
He's only known her for five minutes.

1416
01:22:13,237 --> 01:22:15,573
I think Joe knows what he's doing, actually.

1417
01:22:19,243 --> 01:22:21,036
Well, I hope so.

1418
01:22:24,874 --> 01:22:26,792
Don't forget your tomatoes, Mary.

1419
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:28,335
No, I won't.

1420
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,465
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

1421
01:22:44,518 --> 01:22:47,479
- I might head off in a minute.
- All right, then, Mary.

1422
01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:02,995
- Thank you for coming, Mary.
- Thanks, Gerri.

1423
01:23:03,037 --> 01:23:04,788
- I'll see you on Tuesday.
- Yes.

1424
01:23:04,872 --> 01:23:05,623
Yeah.

1425
01:23:05,706 --> 01:23:07,166
- Bye, then.
- OK, bye.

1426
01:23:19,678 --> 01:23:21,055
Very sad.

1427
01:23:21,138 --> 01:23:22,681
Really upsetting.

1428
01:23:22,723 --> 01:23:23,724
Yeah.

1429
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:25,851
- Are you surprised?
- Of course I am.

1430
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:27,478
No, I'm not, actually.

1431
01:23:27,561 --> 01:23:28,521
No.

1432
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,189
It's disappointing.

1433
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,567
So, when are you inviting her round next?

1434
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,905
Did you see this?

1435
01:23:39,365 --> 01:23:40,908
It's extraordinary.

1436
01:23:42,535 --> 01:23:44,370
- I like whatshername.
- Katie?

1437
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:47,122
- Yeah, she's a laugh, isn't she?
- She's lovely.

1438
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:50,209
He is a dark horse, our son.

1439
01:23:53,254 --> 01:23:55,214
I think you'll find that we men are.

1440
01:24:56,233 --> 01:24:58,194
Can you take that for me?

1441
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:21,842
Hasn't changed much, has it?

1442
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:26,931
Hello, mate.

1443
01:25:32,019 --> 01:25:33,646
How are you, Ron?

1444
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,566
Hi, Ronnie.

1445
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:40,152
- Do you recognise Joe?
- I've grown a bit.

1446
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:52,373
How are you managing, Ronnie?

1447
01:25:52,456 --> 01:25:54,416
I'll be glad when this is over.

1448
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,460
- This is the hardest day.
- Yeah.

1449
01:25:58,045 --> 01:26:00,005
- She was a lovely person.
- She was.

1450
01:26:00,089 --> 01:26:01,549
Very kind.

1451
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:08,389
Have you been eating
over the weekend, Ronnie?

1452
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,015
I had some beans.

1453
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:12,560
Need a bit more than that, though, don't you?

1454
01:26:12,643 --> 01:26:14,603
Do you want something now?

1455
01:26:14,687 --> 01:26:15,646
Nah.

1456
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:17,690
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1457
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,651
- We brought a load of sandwiches, Ron.
- Some beers.

1458
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:24,530
So where's Carl?

1459
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:26,365
I told him when and where.

1460
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:28,367
The question is, if he'll turn up.

1461
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:30,202
Well, that's up to him.

1462
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:31,871
He'd bloody better.

1463
01:26:33,747 --> 01:26:34,915
Cheers, Gez.

1464
01:26:34,999 --> 01:26:37,084
- The hearse will be here soon.
- Yeah.

1465
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:45,718
There you are, Ronnie.

1466
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,388
Can I have one of them beers now?

1467
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:51,432
Yeah, you're all right. Go on.

1468
01:27:01,901 --> 01:27:02,860
Ta.

1469
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:09,867
- Hello.
- Hello. Mr Hepple?

1470
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,703
Yes, I'm Tom Hepple.
I think we spoke on the phone.

1471
01:27:12,786 --> 01:27:14,455
This is my brother, Ronnie.

1472
01:27:14,538 --> 01:27:16,498
- Hello.
- He's Linda's husband.

1473
01:27:16,582 --> 01:27:19,752
- Are you all ready?
- Yes, we are, yes. Just the four of us.

1474
01:27:27,593 --> 01:27:29,595
Have you got the keys, Ronnie?

1475
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:30,888
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1476
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,527
Thank you.

1477
01:28:29,864 --> 01:28:31,115
Thank you.

1478
01:28:37,872 --> 01:28:39,331
- Mr Hepple?
- Yes.

1479
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,375
This is Robert, your minister.

1480
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:44,378
- I'm Tom Hepple.
- Oh, yes.

1481
01:28:45,963 --> 01:28:49,550
This is my brother, Ronnie,
Linda's husband.

1482
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:53,262
Robert Saunter.
I shall be taking the service.

1483
01:28:53,304 --> 01:28:55,681
We're expecting Ronnie's son,
Carl, to be here,

1484
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:57,808
but he doesn't appear
to have turned up yet.

1485
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:04,690
Right, well, we'd... best be started.

1486
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:05,941
Yes. Yes.

1487
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:07,985
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

1488
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:12,823
Thank you.

1489
01:29:16,911 --> 01:29:18,871
Air On The G String

1490
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:25,878
Thank you.

1491
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,839
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
says the Lord.

1492
01:29:29,632 --> 01:29:32,885
"Those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

1493
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:36,138
Everyone who lives and believes in me
will never die."

1494
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:41,852
I am convinced that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,

1495
01:29:41,936 --> 01:29:45,189
nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come,

1496
01:29:45,272 --> 01:29:48,776
nor height, nor depth,
nor anything else in all creation

1497
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:53,614
will be able to separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

1498
01:30:01,038 --> 01:30:05,167
We have entrusted our sister,
Linda Margaret, to God's mercy,

1499
01:30:05,209 --> 01:30:07,920
and we now commit her body to be cremated.

1500
01:30:09,338 --> 01:30:13,133
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

1501
01:30:13,217 --> 01:30:17,179
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

1502
01:30:17,263 --> 01:30:19,473
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1503
01:30:19,557 --> 01:30:21,892
who will transform our frail bodies

1504
01:30:21,934 --> 01:30:25,563
that they may be conformed
to his glorious body,

1505
01:30:25,646 --> 01:30:29,233
who died, was buried
and rose again for us.

1506
01:30:29,275 --> 01:30:31,277
To him be glory forever.

1507
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:32,611
Amen.

1508
01:30:33,696 --> 01:30:37,908
May God give you his comfort
and his peace, his light and his joy,

1509
01:30:37,992 --> 01:30:39,702
in this world and the next.

1510
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:41,787
And the blessing of God Almighty...

1511
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:49,253
...the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
be upon you and remain with you always.

1512
01:30:49,336 --> 01:30:51,088
Amen.

1513
01:30:52,173 --> 01:30:53,757
You are welcome.

Enigma Variations IX Nimrod

1515
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:14,028
You're joking, aren't you?

1516
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:15,654
Hello, Carl.

1517
01:31:15,738 --> 01:31:18,199
- Is that it?
- It's all over, Carl.

1518
01:31:19,325 --> 01:31:20,868
I'm really sorry.

1519
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:43,098
- That was just right.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

1520
01:31:43,182 --> 01:31:44,683
Thank you. God bless you.

1521
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:54,026
Unbelievable.

1522
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:55,694
Why couldn't you wait?

1523
01:31:55,778 --> 01:31:58,697
There's another one coming up behind us.
You can't wait.

1524
01:31:58,781 --> 01:32:01,492
- They can't wait five minutes?
- No. We asked them.

1525
01:32:01,575 --> 01:32:03,536
- Outrageous.
- What happened to you?

1526
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:06,539
- Motorway was fucked up.
- Should have taken that into account.

1527
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:08,207
- I did.
- Obviously not enough.

1528
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,960
I'll never forgive you for this.
You know that, don't you?

1529
01:32:11,001 --> 01:32:12,795
- Don't blame me.
- It's not his fault.

1530
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:15,047
I might have known
you'd pull a stunt like this.

1531
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:18,133
- Carl.
- What?

1532
01:32:18,217 --> 01:32:19,635
It's Joe.

1533
01:32:20,886 --> 01:32:22,429
Oh, yeah. All right?

1534
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,225
Carl, I'm really sorry.

1535
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:29,937
We're going back to the house,
to your mum's.

1536
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,480
If you want to come...

1537
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:35,025
- I gotta go back there, any road, so...
- All right. We'll see you there.

1538
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:36,777
Hello, I'm Tom. Ronnie's brother.

1539
01:32:37,903 --> 01:32:40,698
- We're going back to the house.
- Are you friends of Linda?

1540
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:43,993
How long have you worked with her?
Are you coming back to the house?

1541
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:46,620
- Good. We'll see you there.
- Do you have transport?

1542
01:32:49,373 --> 01:32:50,916
Do you know the way?

1543
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,793
We'll see you there, then.

1544
01:32:55,337 --> 01:32:57,298
Carl said he is going back.

1545
01:33:03,137 --> 01:33:05,097
When was the last time you saw Carl?

1546
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,683
A couple of years ago.

1547
01:33:07,766 --> 01:33:09,935
Just turns up out of the blue, doesn't he?

1548
01:33:10,019 --> 01:33:11,979
When he can be bothered.

1549
01:33:12,062 --> 01:33:13,939
When did we last see him?

1550
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:17,651
I can't remember.
Five, ten years ago?

1551
01:33:17,735 --> 01:33:19,486
It was the year your mum died.

1552
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:20,738
- Was it?
- Mm.

1553
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,365
1979.

1554
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:25,534
- No.
- No, '95.

1555
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:26,994
Yeah.

1556
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,371
Don't know.

1557
01:33:29,455 --> 01:33:32,374
So, hang on.
When did he stay with us in London?

1558
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:35,044
- That was in the '80s.
- You were nine.

1559
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:37,087
He always wore black, didn't he?

1560
01:33:37,171 --> 01:33:38,130
Mm.

1561
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:40,591
It's tragic.

1562
01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:42,635
He was such a lovely kid, full of fun.

1563
01:33:45,804 --> 01:33:47,181
Was he?

1564
01:33:53,437 --> 01:33:54,980
Hi. Come on in.

1565
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:57,024
- Thanks, love.
- Hello. Come in.

1566
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:58,067
Hiya.

1567
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:00,319
- Do you want to go through?
- Thank you.

1568
01:34:01,612 --> 01:34:04,156
- You find it all right?
- Aye, aye. No problem.

1569
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:07,910
- Shall I take your coat?
- Er... no, you're all right, duck, thanks.

1570
01:34:07,993 --> 01:34:09,745
Shall I take your coats, ladies?

1571
01:34:09,828 --> 01:34:11,580
- Thank you.
- Right.

1572
01:34:11,664 --> 01:34:14,124
Joe, is there another chair in there?

1573
01:34:15,376 --> 01:34:16,335
Yeah.

1574
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,259
It was a very nice service.

1575
01:34:23,342 --> 01:34:27,221
It was, wasn't it? Simple, straightforward.

1576
01:34:28,097 --> 01:34:30,975
That's what you wanted, wasn't it, Ronnie?
Nothing fancy.

1577
01:34:31,058 --> 01:34:32,643
No.

1578
01:34:34,854 --> 01:34:37,773
Good job it didn't rain.

1579
01:34:37,857 --> 01:34:40,317
- It's a nice spot that, isn't it?
- Mm.

1580
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:43,821
We've seen a few off from there,
haven't we?

1581
01:34:43,904 --> 01:34:46,198
- Aye, we have over the years.
- Aye.

1582
01:34:46,282 --> 01:34:48,075
Have you worked with Linda for long?

1583
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:50,286
About ten years.

1584
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:52,371
How about you, Maggie?

1585
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:53,914
Not as long as that, no.

1586
01:34:54,665 --> 01:34:56,166
She was a lovely lady.

1587
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:59,712
- She was, yeah.
- We weren't that close.

1588
01:34:59,795 --> 01:35:02,673
- She'll be much missed.
- It was such a shock.

1589
01:35:04,466 --> 01:35:06,260
Be a big change for you, Ronnie,

1590
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:08,470
having to look after yourself.

1591
01:35:09,388 --> 01:35:11,557
You get used to it though, Ronnie.

1592
01:35:12,391 --> 01:35:14,435
- Eight years for me, now.
- Is it?

1593
01:35:14,518 --> 01:35:15,728
Aye.

1594
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:19,982
It's Carl.

1595
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,115
All right, Carl?

1596
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:30,534
- 'Ey up, Carl.
- Excuse me, mate.

1597
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:36,624
- Do you want a drink, Carl?
- You got tea, beers...

1598
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,668
...couple of bottles of wine.

1599
01:35:40,377 --> 01:35:42,213
Sort myself out, ta.

1600
01:35:45,174 --> 01:35:49,470
- Are you local, then, Frank?
- Aye, aye, I'm just a few streets down.

1601
01:35:49,553 --> 01:35:51,889
- You know, Palmer's Street.
- Oh, yeah.

1602
01:35:51,972 --> 01:35:54,016
I haven't lived in Derby for 40 years.

1603
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:55,768
- How are you, Carl?
- All right. You?

1604
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:57,436
We're all fine.

1605
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,688
This must have been
a bit of a shock for you.

1606
01:35:59,772 --> 01:36:01,148
I'll say.

1607
01:36:01,732 --> 01:36:03,817
- Where are you living?
- Up in Yorkshire.

1608
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:06,862
- Are you working?
- Don't need an interrogation.

1609
01:36:08,531 --> 01:36:11,033
There's food out here
when you want it.

1610
01:36:11,116 --> 01:36:13,077
It's all changed.

1611
01:36:16,247 --> 01:36:18,624
- No post for me, then?
- No.

1612
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:21,168
None from you, either.

1613
01:36:21,252 --> 01:36:23,254
- Eh?
- There's none from you.

1614
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:26,048
Not lost your sense of humour, then?

1615
01:36:28,926 --> 01:36:30,386
Who sorted all this lot out?

1616
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:33,180
- We did.
- We brought it with us.

1617
01:36:33,264 --> 01:36:34,849
- From London?
- Yeah.

1618
01:36:34,932 --> 01:36:36,851
Nice.

1619
01:36:36,934 --> 01:36:38,853
You didn't get your arse in gear, Ronnie?

1620
01:36:38,936 --> 01:36:41,272
- He didn't need to, we offered.
- Did you?

1621
01:36:41,355 --> 01:36:44,275
- Yeah.
- It's his responsibility, though, in't it?

1622
01:36:45,693 --> 01:36:48,362
Don't underestimate
the shock he's had, Carl.

1623
01:36:48,445 --> 01:36:51,532
Yeah, I know.
Very fragile, in't he, your brother?

1624
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:55,494
- His wife's just died.
- His wife.

1625
01:36:56,704 --> 01:36:58,706
Didn't much care for her
when she was alive.

1626
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:01,375
- Did you?
- I beg your pardon?

1627
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,252
- Did you care for her, Carl?
- Tom?

1628
01:37:03,335 --> 01:37:05,045
- I cared for her in my own way.
- Carl.

1629
01:37:05,129 --> 01:37:07,256
- What way was that?
- She knew how I felt.

1630
01:37:07,339 --> 01:37:08,716
- Did she?
- Shut it.

1631
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:10,301
Don't tell me how to behave in my house.

1632
01:37:10,384 --> 01:37:12,595
- It's not your house.
- It is, as much as it is his.

1633
01:37:12,678 --> 01:37:13,470
Tom.

1634
01:37:18,893 --> 01:37:21,604
- And what are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you, Carl.

1635
01:37:21,687 --> 01:37:23,606
Well, I don't like it.

1636
01:37:30,821 --> 01:37:32,781
Don't feel you need to hang about, duck.

1637
01:37:35,201 --> 01:37:36,869
We best get going.

1638
01:37:36,952 --> 01:37:38,495
Excuse me.

1639
01:37:39,288 --> 01:37:41,457
I'm really sorry about this.

1640
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,752
Do you want your coats?
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

1641
01:37:44,835 --> 01:37:47,213
- Thank you for coming.
- Shall I drop you off?

1642
01:37:47,296 --> 01:37:48,714
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

1643
01:37:48,797 --> 01:37:51,091
- Thanks.
- Is that... Can you do that, Frank?

1644
01:37:51,175 --> 01:37:52,760
Aye, aye. Give them a lift home.

1645
01:37:55,012 --> 01:37:57,139
Look after yourself, Ronnie.

1646
01:37:57,223 --> 01:37:59,683
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about this.

1647
01:37:59,767 --> 01:38:02,686
- One of those things.
- Aye, well, not to worry, duck.

1648
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:03,896
- See you.
- Thanks.

1649
01:38:03,979 --> 01:38:05,814
- Take care. Ta-ta.
- Bye.

1650
01:38:09,401 --> 01:38:11,278
Bloody hell.

1651
01:38:14,698 --> 01:38:16,158
Are you all right, Ronnie?

1652
01:38:20,329 --> 01:38:22,414
I don't know what to do.

1653
01:38:23,457 --> 01:38:25,084
Ah, sod him.

1654
01:38:25,876 --> 01:38:27,920
He'll bugger off soon enough.

1655
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:55,656
Tell you what.

1656
01:38:57,741 --> 01:38:59,827
Why don't you come back with us?

1657
01:39:00,995 --> 01:39:02,621
To London.

1658
01:39:05,249 --> 01:39:07,918
No, no. You're all right.

1659
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,712
Well, why not?

1660
01:39:11,213 --> 01:39:13,382
Just for a few days, a week.

1661
01:39:14,258 --> 01:39:16,218
Whatever it takes.

1662
01:39:17,011 --> 01:39:19,555
Then we'll put you on the train back home.

1663
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,060
I don't know.

1664
01:39:28,397 --> 01:39:30,357
Think about it.

1665
01:39:50,503 --> 01:39:52,671
What do you reckon?

1666
01:39:52,755 --> 01:39:55,716
You might as well,
until you feel a bit better.

1667
01:39:57,801 --> 01:39:59,887
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1668
01:40:04,308 --> 01:40:05,768
- OK.
- Good.

1669
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:08,145
Chuck a few things in a bag.
We'll clear up.

1670
01:40:08,229 --> 01:40:10,231
- Yeah.
- Have you got a bag?

1671
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:11,440
I think so.

1672
01:40:11,524 --> 01:40:13,943
Your dad's coming home with us
for a couple of days.

1673
01:40:14,026 --> 01:40:15,819
Is he now?

1674
01:40:15,903 --> 01:40:18,239
- I think there's one under the bed.
- Right.

1675
01:40:18,322 --> 01:40:20,032
How did she go?

1676
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,035
Eh?

1677
01:40:26,038 --> 01:40:28,207
She were dead when I woke up.

1678
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:31,210
Satisfied?

1679
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:34,839
- Excuse me, Carl.
- I'll do that, Gerri.

1680
01:40:34,922 --> 01:40:37,049
- No, I'll do it.
- No, you leave it.

1681
01:40:37,132 --> 01:40:39,093
You sit yourself down.

1682
01:40:49,019 --> 01:40:51,689
What am I doing this for?
Save my mam the trouble?

1683
01:40:51,772 --> 01:40:53,649
- She's fucking dead now.
- Listen to me.

1684
01:40:53,732 --> 01:40:55,276
Nah, no, no, no, no.

1685
01:40:57,862 --> 01:40:59,905
I'm going to get a bottle of wine.

1686
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:01,949
Carl, we've got loads of wine.

1687
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:03,993
Carl.

1688
01:41:08,497 --> 01:41:10,457
He won't be back.

1689
01:41:15,546 --> 01:41:18,674
Pyjamas. Get some shirts.

1690
01:41:20,551 --> 01:41:22,928
- Are you going to change?
- Yeah.

1691
01:41:23,012 --> 01:41:25,181
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.

1692
01:41:46,243 --> 01:41:48,329
How you doing?

1693
01:41:48,412 --> 01:41:50,039
Are you all right?

1694
01:41:50,122 --> 01:41:52,124
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1695
01:41:53,459 --> 01:41:55,419
We'll be off soon.

1696
01:42:54,395 --> 01:42:56,230
Oh, hi.

1697
01:42:58,607 --> 01:43:00,025
Is Gerri in?

1698
01:43:02,403 --> 01:43:04,280
No.

1699
01:43:05,531 --> 01:43:07,157
Oh.

1700
01:43:09,326 --> 01:43:12,162
- Is Tom here?
- No, they're out.

1701
01:43:14,999 --> 01:43:16,375
What's it about?

1702
01:43:20,212 --> 01:43:22,882
I... I... I just wanted to see them.

1703
01:43:25,342 --> 01:43:27,052
They didn't say nothing.

1704
01:43:27,136 --> 01:43:29,096
Oh... Oh, no, they don't.

1705
01:43:30,848 --> 01:43:33,309
I just came on the spur of the moment.

1706
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:39,315
I'm a friend of Gerri's. I work with her.

1707
01:43:42,276 --> 01:43:46,155
Oh, have they gone to the allotment?

1708
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:48,616
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1709
01:43:55,706 --> 01:43:57,249
Can I come in?

1710
01:43:59,877 --> 01:44:01,754
Just to wait for them?

1711
01:44:03,547 --> 01:44:06,926
- I don't know.
- I'm really cold.

1712
01:44:08,219 --> 01:44:09,637
I'm here on my own.

1713
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:14,683
Oh, I'm not going to burgle you
or anything.

1714
01:44:17,561 --> 01:44:20,731
I can give you a description of the house,
if you like?

1715
01:44:25,778 --> 01:44:30,991
When you go in the kitchen,
the cooker's on the right...

1716
01:44:31,992 --> 01:44:35,329
...and the sink's straight in front of you
and on the left is...

1717
01:44:35,412 --> 01:44:36,956
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right.

1718
01:44:38,249 --> 01:44:39,875
Thanks.

1719
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,800
I'm Mary.

1720
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:52,555
What's your name?

1721
01:44:52,638 --> 01:44:54,849
Ronnie. Tom's my brother.

1722
01:44:54,932 --> 01:44:56,892
Oh, oh.

1723
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:01,647
Is it your wife that's just passed away?

1724
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:04,108
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry.

1725
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:06,151
That's all right.

1726
01:45:14,827 --> 01:45:17,496
Would you like me to make you
a cup of tea?

1727
01:45:17,538 --> 01:45:19,748
No, thank you.

1728
01:45:21,959 --> 01:45:24,295
Is it all right if I make one for myself?

1729
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:29,800
I don't think Gerri and Tom would mind.

1730
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,220
All right.

1731
01:46:08,672 --> 01:46:10,841
Have you come down for a few days?

1732
01:46:10,925 --> 01:46:12,968
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1733
01:46:16,514 --> 01:46:18,599
I haven't had any breakfast.

1734
01:46:20,017 --> 01:46:21,602
Did you have breakfast?

1735
01:46:21,685 --> 01:46:23,145
Yeah.

1736
01:46:23,229 --> 01:46:25,189
- With Tom and Gerri?
- Yeah.

1737
01:46:32,488 --> 01:46:34,448
Do you want a cuddle?

1738
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:46,210
You sure you don't want some tea?

1739
01:46:46,293 --> 01:46:48,462
- Aye, go on, then.
- Yeah.

1740
01:46:57,179 --> 01:46:59,014
Ooh, that's better.

1741
01:47:02,184 --> 01:47:04,144
It's really lovely to be here.

1742
01:47:05,437 --> 01:47:07,398
I haven't been for months.

1743
01:47:09,984 --> 01:47:12,736
They invite me a lot.
We're really old friends.

1744
01:47:19,994 --> 01:47:22,037
Are you sleeping in Joe's room?

1745
01:47:22,121 --> 01:47:23,372
Yeah.

1746
01:47:23,455 --> 01:47:25,291
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:47:25,374 --> 01:47:27,501
All his little bits and bobs.

1748
01:47:32,173 --> 01:47:33,632
Did he go to the funeral?

1749
01:47:33,716 --> 01:47:34,925
Yeah.

1750
01:47:36,552 --> 01:47:38,512
With his girlfriend?

1751
01:47:38,596 --> 01:47:40,556
- No.
- Oh.

1752
01:47:43,142 --> 01:47:44,894
They're coming round later.

1753
01:47:45,936 --> 01:47:47,938
Oh, are they?

1754
01:47:56,155 --> 01:47:58,282
Sorry I'm such a mess.

1755
01:47:59,992 --> 01:48:04,371
I didn't get to bed till five
and then I couldn't sleep.

1756
01:48:06,498 --> 01:48:08,751
I just got up and came straight here.

1757
01:48:17,801 --> 01:48:19,929
Does Gerri ever mention me?

1758
01:48:21,972 --> 01:48:22,932
No.

1759
01:48:23,766 --> 01:48:25,392
Mary.

1760
01:48:26,185 --> 01:48:27,520
No.

1761
01:48:45,079 --> 01:48:46,580
You look like Tom.

1762
01:48:48,249 --> 01:48:49,917
Oh, aye?

1763
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,293
Yeah.

1764
01:48:53,546 --> 01:48:55,297
You've got a nice face.

1765
01:48:57,633 --> 01:48:59,718
Tom's got a nice face, too.

1766
01:49:04,265 --> 01:49:06,267
What was your wife's name?

1767
01:49:07,017 --> 01:49:09,270
- Linda.
- Oh.

1768
01:49:10,521 --> 01:49:12,147
Was she nice?

1769
01:49:31,584 --> 01:49:33,169
Did you have dinner last night?

1770
01:49:33,252 --> 01:49:35,921
- We had chicken.
- Oh, lovely.

1771
01:49:37,715 --> 01:49:40,301
- They're good cooks, aren't they?
- Yeah.

1772
01:49:41,886 --> 01:49:43,512
I can't cook.

1773
01:49:44,346 --> 01:49:46,765
- Can you cook?
- Nah.

1774
01:49:52,479 --> 01:49:54,440
I didn't really eat anything yesterday.

1775
01:49:56,108 --> 01:49:57,776
Do you want some toast?

1776
01:50:02,907 --> 01:50:04,867
No, I'm all right, thank you.

1777
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,790
Wouldn't mind a cigarette, though.

1778
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:15,085
- Do you smoke?
- Yeah.

1779
01:50:15,169 --> 01:50:17,129
Oh, good.

1780
01:50:19,089 --> 01:50:21,926
Oh, yeah. My friend used to roll her own.

1781
01:50:25,054 --> 01:50:26,430
Do you want one of these?

1782
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:30,184
No, it's all right.
I'll have one of mine.

1783
01:50:31,101 --> 01:50:33,854
Oh, no, go on, then.
For old time's sake.

1784
01:50:33,938 --> 01:50:35,231
Yeah.

1785
01:50:37,942 --> 01:50:39,902
We have to go out there.

1786
01:50:42,279 --> 01:50:45,157
Oh, we can stay in here, can't we?
They won't know.

1787
01:50:58,963 --> 01:51:00,506
Ooh.

1788
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:03,592
Takes me back.

1789
01:51:06,095 --> 01:51:08,264
Did you ever smoke dope?

1790
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:11,433
Tried it a few times.

1791
01:51:12,184 --> 01:51:13,936
We used to.

1792
01:51:14,812 --> 01:51:16,897
Me and my best friend, Monica.

1793
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:20,776
Don't see her any more.

1794
01:51:22,903 --> 01:51:24,947
Did you like the Beatles?

1795
01:51:25,906 --> 01:51:27,283
They were all right.

1796
01:51:27,992 --> 01:51:30,494
I was more Elvis. Jerry Lee Lewis.

1797
01:51:30,578 --> 01:51:32,204
Yeah.

1798
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:35,124
# I'm all shook up

1799
01:51:35,207 --> 01:51:36,292
Heh.

1800
01:51:43,924 --> 01:51:45,342
Have you got any children?

1801
01:51:45,426 --> 01:51:46,719
Got a son.

1802
01:51:49,013 --> 01:51:50,472
Is he married?

1803
01:51:52,725 --> 01:51:53,976
Don't know.

1804
01:52:03,736 --> 01:52:05,779
You got kids?

1805
01:52:05,863 --> 01:52:07,239
No.

1806
01:52:10,075 --> 01:52:11,702
Unfortunately.

1807
01:52:21,837 --> 01:52:23,797
Have you got to go back soon?

1808
01:52:24,673 --> 01:52:27,593
Yeah. Got a few things to sort out.

1809
01:52:28,594 --> 01:52:30,804
I don't suppose your son will help you.

1810
01:52:30,888 --> 01:52:32,765
Nah.

1811
01:52:45,694 --> 01:52:49,031
I could come up and give you a hand,
if you like.

1812
01:52:50,074 --> 01:52:51,992
Have you got to move?

1813
01:52:52,076 --> 01:52:52,868
No.

1814
01:52:55,996 --> 01:52:58,165
I could take a few days off work.

1815
01:53:02,419 --> 01:53:04,046
Are you warm enough?

1816
01:53:06,215 --> 01:53:08,342
Oh, I'll be all right.

1817
01:53:08,425 --> 01:53:10,594
We'll just finish these.

1818
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:22,982
Oh, do you know Ken?

1819
01:53:23,065 --> 01:53:24,775
Ken?

1820
01:53:24,859 --> 01:53:26,360
Yeah.

1821
01:53:26,443 --> 01:53:28,529
Yeah. Did he go to the funeral?

1822
01:53:29,655 --> 01:53:31,073
No.

1823
01:53:32,074 --> 01:53:34,243
He's a bit weird, isn't he?

1824
01:53:35,244 --> 01:53:36,245
Is he?

1825
01:53:48,465 --> 01:53:50,092
I don't really smoke.

1826
01:53:54,555 --> 01:53:56,849
I had too much to drink last night.

1827
01:53:58,058 --> 01:54:00,394
I had a bit of a bad day.

1828
01:54:00,477 --> 01:54:03,689
My car broke down.
It had to be towed away.

1829
01:54:04,982 --> 01:54:08,360
They said it wasn't worth repairing.
They gave me 20 quid for it.

1830
01:54:08,444 --> 01:54:12,198
- That's not much.
- No. What can you do with 20 quid?

1831
01:54:14,742 --> 01:54:17,328
I bought myself a bottle of champagne.

1832
01:54:17,411 --> 01:54:18,495
Yeah?

1833
01:54:20,206 --> 01:54:21,832
Yeah.

1834
01:54:26,504 --> 01:54:28,088
Did you finish it?

1835
01:54:30,966 --> 01:54:32,259
Yeah, I did.

1836
01:54:32,343 --> 01:54:34,136
Huh.

1837
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,316
I might have to have a little bit of a lie down.

1838
01:54:54,865 --> 01:54:57,409
It's really lovely
to have someone to talk to.

1839
01:55:00,579 --> 01:55:01,956
Yeah.

1840
01:55:05,793 --> 01:55:07,753
It's peaceful here.

1841
01:55:14,927 --> 01:55:17,429
I might move away somewhere else.

1842
01:55:20,099 --> 01:55:22,059
Start again.

1843
01:55:25,271 --> 01:55:27,439
I used to work in Majorca.

1844
01:55:38,701 --> 01:55:40,286
They'll be back soon.

1845
01:55:43,497 --> 01:55:45,457
Oh, yeah.

1846
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,392
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1847
01:56:18,032 --> 01:56:19,992
- Hello, Ronnie.
- We're back.

1848
01:56:20,784 --> 01:56:22,077
Hi, Gerri.

1849
01:56:23,913 --> 01:56:25,873
- Hello, Mary.
- Bloody hell!

1850
01:56:25,956 --> 01:56:28,334
- Hi, Tom.
- What are you doing here?

1851
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,296
Well, I just thought I'd...

1852
01:56:36,509 --> 01:56:38,177
Just get my boots off.

1853
01:56:39,845 --> 01:56:42,848
- Where'd she spring from?
- Bloody nuisance, especially today.

1854
01:56:42,932 --> 01:56:44,892
You're not kidding.

1855
01:56:55,152 --> 01:56:58,489
- Are you all right, Gerri?
- Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

1856
01:57:03,327 --> 01:57:04,870
Did you drive?

1857
01:57:04,954 --> 01:57:06,914
Oh, no. I came on the tube.

1858
01:57:06,997 --> 01:57:08,541
Did you?

1859
01:57:10,543 --> 01:57:12,878
It might have been nice
if you'd phoned first, Mary.

1860
01:57:12,962 --> 01:57:14,922
Oh, I'm really sorry.

1861
01:57:22,972 --> 01:57:25,641
- Joe and Katie are coming.
- Yeah, Ronnie said.

1862
01:57:33,983 --> 01:57:35,943
All righty.

1863
01:57:37,444 --> 01:57:39,989
- Tea, Ronnie?
- Yeah.

1864
01:57:46,579 --> 01:57:50,291
Come and sit yourself down, Mary,
and have a cup of tea.

1865
01:58:18,027 --> 01:58:20,070
How's it going?

1866
01:58:20,154 --> 01:58:22,156
Inexorably.

1867
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:25,743
- I don't know what to do.
- Well, if you don't, I don't.

1868
01:58:25,826 --> 01:58:27,786
I can't just chuck her out.

1869
01:58:28,579 --> 01:58:30,497
- Can't you?
- No.

1870
01:58:30,581 --> 01:58:33,501
- Look at the state of her.
- I know. Poor woman.

1871
01:58:35,294 --> 01:58:37,630
Joe and Katie will be all right.
They can handle her.

1872
01:58:37,713 --> 01:58:40,299
I know. I've got enough food for her.

1873
01:58:40,382 --> 01:58:43,052
- That's all right, then.
- Oh, well, here goes.

1874
01:58:59,109 --> 01:59:02,112
- Do you want me to give you a hand?
- No, thank you, Mary.

1875
01:59:05,366 --> 01:59:07,284
Would you like to stay for a bite to eat?

1876
01:59:07,368 --> 01:59:09,286
No, it's OK. I don't want to be in the way.

1877
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:11,455
You won't be. We've got plenty of food.

1878
01:59:13,666 --> 01:59:15,626
Are you still angry with me?

1879
01:59:16,377 --> 01:59:20,381
Mary, I wasn't angry with you.
I just felt you'd let me down.

1880
01:59:20,464 --> 01:59:22,424
Oh, Gerri.

1881
01:59:23,676 --> 01:59:25,636
I'd never want to do that.

1882
01:59:27,888 --> 01:59:29,348
I'm really sorry.

1883
01:59:29,431 --> 01:59:31,392
Yes, and I know you apologised.

1884
01:59:38,732 --> 01:59:40,150
I miss you.

1885
01:59:41,986 --> 01:59:44,071
I mean, I know I see you at work,

1886
01:59:44,154 --> 01:59:46,824
but we don't seem to talk to each other
any more.

1887
01:59:49,451 --> 01:59:52,872
- I feel terrible.
- This is my family, Mary.

1888
01:59:52,955 --> 01:59:54,832
You've got to understand that.

1889
01:59:54,915 --> 01:59:56,876
I do.

1890
01:59:58,794 --> 02:00:01,589
Oh... Come here.

1891
02:00:21,942 --> 02:00:24,737
You have to take responsibility
for your actions.

1892
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:26,780
I know.

1893
02:00:32,411 --> 02:00:34,371
Now, listen, Mary.

1894
02:00:36,832 --> 02:00:39,168
You need to talk to somebody.

1895
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:41,212
Oh, no, I don't want to do that.

1896
02:00:42,379 --> 02:00:45,674
- Well, I think it would help you.
- I just want to talk to you.

1897
02:00:46,967 --> 02:00:49,428
Why don't I have a word
with one of my colleagues?

1898
02:00:49,512 --> 02:00:52,181
As long as we're friends,
then I'm all right.

1899
02:00:52,264 --> 02:00:56,352
Well, that's beside the point. You need
independent, professional help.

1900
02:00:56,435 --> 02:00:58,354
You'd be much happier.

1901
02:01:00,898 --> 02:01:02,650
Let's talk about it on Tuesday.

1902
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:04,693
- Yeah.
- And you have a think.

1903
02:01:05,528 --> 02:01:07,488
Yeah, we could have a drink.

1904
02:01:07,571 --> 02:01:09,532
Why don't you help me lay the table?

1905
02:01:17,456 --> 02:01:19,416
He's really nice Ronnie, isn't he?

1906
02:01:41,230 --> 02:01:43,023
Hello. I saw you through the window.

1907
02:01:43,107 --> 02:01:44,608
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

1908
02:01:44,692 --> 02:01:46,443
- I'm fine, how are you?
- I'm good.

1909
02:01:46,527 --> 02:01:49,446
- Katie, lovely to see you.
- Ahh, lovely to see you.

1910
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:51,031
- How are you?
- Fine.

1911
02:01:51,115 --> 02:01:53,075
Mary's here.

1912
02:01:53,158 --> 02:01:55,286
- Hello!
- Aha!

1913
02:01:55,953 --> 02:01:58,372
- We brought you some chocolates.
- Good. Ha-ha!

1914
02:01:58,455 --> 02:02:00,958
- Oh, no, give them back!
- You'll never see them again.

1915
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:03,169
- Can I take your things?
- Yeah, cheers.

1916
02:02:07,715 --> 02:02:09,425
Dear, dear.

1917
02:02:09,508 --> 02:02:12,219
I've got the longest scarf in the world.
Sorry.

1918
02:02:12,303 --> 02:02:14,889
- And a tea cosy on my head.
- Come and meet Ronnie.

1919
02:02:14,972 --> 02:02:16,807
- Oh, great.
- Mary's here.

1920
02:02:16,891 --> 02:02:17,892
Oh!

1921
02:02:18,934 --> 02:02:20,644
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

1922
02:02:20,728 --> 02:02:22,271
- Good, thanks.
- Excellent.

1923
02:02:22,354 --> 02:02:23,564
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

1924
02:02:23,647 --> 02:02:25,900
Hi, you must be Ronnie.
I've heard a lot about you.

1925
02:02:25,983 --> 02:02:27,902
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Hello.

1926
02:02:27,985 --> 02:02:29,528
- This is Katie.
- My big brother.

1927
02:02:29,612 --> 02:02:31,739
- Ah, brilliant.
- What are we having to drink?

1928
02:02:31,822 --> 02:02:34,491
- I'll have what everyone else is having.
- Red wine for me.

1929
02:02:34,533 --> 02:02:36,202
- We're having fish.
- I'll have white.

1930
02:02:36,285 --> 02:02:38,704
- I'll have white wine as well, please.
- Beer, Ronnie?

1931
02:02:38,787 --> 02:02:40,289
- Yeah.
- White wine, Mary?

1932
02:02:40,372 --> 02:02:43,083
- Yeah, please, if that's all right?
- I'll do that, Gez.

1933
02:02:43,167 --> 02:02:45,419
I'll get you a beer, Ronnie.

1934
02:02:45,503 --> 02:02:48,255
So, I hear you're a massive Derby fan, Ronnie.

1935
02:02:48,339 --> 02:02:50,257
- Er... yeah.
- Great club.

1936
02:02:50,341 --> 02:02:52,843
I'm a Palace supporter myself, for my sins.

1937
02:02:52,927 --> 02:02:56,680
I still hope we might crash back through
to the Premiership, at some point.

1938
02:02:56,764 --> 02:02:58,474
What do you reckon
to Derby's chances?

1939
02:02:58,557 --> 02:03:00,976
- I don't know, not so bad.
- Well, fingers crossed.

1940
02:03:11,028 --> 02:03:13,697
We met on our first day
at university in Manchester.

1941
02:03:13,781 --> 02:03:15,824
Oh, your first day!

1942
02:03:15,908 --> 02:03:17,785
We were in the same halls of residence.

1943
02:03:17,868 --> 02:03:19,537
- We met on the stairs.
- Yeah.

1944
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:21,664
I was falling down them,
she was going up them.

1945
02:03:21,747 --> 02:03:25,000
- I was falling up them.
- Things haven't changed, then.

1946
02:03:26,544 --> 02:03:31,674
And Tom's first job, when we left uni,
was abroad for two years.

1947
02:03:31,757 --> 02:03:34,343
Did you try not to take it personally?

1948
02:03:34,426 --> 02:03:36,971
We came down to London, didn't we?
For about nine months.

1949
02:03:37,054 --> 02:03:41,058
I got my first geologist's job
in Western Australia in the outback.

1950
02:03:41,141 --> 02:03:41,851
Right.

1951
02:03:41,934 --> 02:03:43,894
It was him
and a load of Australian cowboys.

1952
02:03:43,978 --> 02:03:48,148
- It was like the Wild West out there.
- Yeah, all cork hats and beers.

1953
02:03:48,232 --> 02:03:51,527
- You've worked in Australia, Katie.
- Yeah, I worked in Sydney for a year.

1954
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:55,322
I had a wonderful time. They know
how to enjoy themselves, the Aussies.

1955
02:03:55,406 --> 02:03:56,657
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

1956
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:59,869
And you came out and visited,
didn't you, my first Christmas holiday?

1957
02:03:59,952 --> 02:04:01,912
Yeah.
We spent Christmas on the beach.

1958
02:04:01,996 --> 02:04:03,664
- Barbie on the beach?
- Yeah.

1959
02:04:03,747 --> 02:04:07,668
And when Tom had finished after
two years, I joined him again and we...

1960
02:04:07,751 --> 02:04:10,421
- You went on your grand tour.
...we came back overland.

1961
02:04:10,504 --> 02:04:12,715
Yeah. It took us seven months, I think.

1962
02:04:12,798 --> 02:04:15,509
We got the boat
from Fremantle to Singapore

1963
02:04:15,593 --> 02:04:18,512
and then Singapore to Malaysia
and then onto Thailand.

1964
02:04:18,596 --> 02:04:20,806
- Thailand. Burma.
- And to India.

1965
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:23,309
- I'd love to go to India.
- We went trekking in Nepal.

1966
02:04:23,392 --> 02:04:26,604
Nepal, trekking in Nepal.
The beach at Goa.

1967
02:04:26,687 --> 02:04:29,815
- Wonderful, holiday of a lifetime.
- Pakistan.

1968
02:04:29,899 --> 02:04:32,651
- Afghanistan. Iran.
- Turkey.

1969
02:04:32,735 --> 02:04:35,321
- Over to the Greek Islands.
- Greek Islands.

1970
02:04:35,404 --> 02:04:38,866
The wonderful thing was, because
I'd been in... two years working in Australia,

1971
02:04:38,949 --> 02:04:42,620
and earning relatively good money,
and nothing to spend it on, really.

1972
02:04:42,703 --> 02:04:45,247
So, we didn't have to do it
on a really tight budget.

1973
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:49,210
Some people could just hitch,
but we could get buses and trains.

1974
02:04:49,293 --> 02:04:51,962
- Yeah, yeah.
- It must have made a difference.

1975
02:04:52,046 --> 02:04:55,216
You've been to the Greek Islands,
haven't you, Mary?

1976
02:04:55,299 --> 02:04:58,219
- Yeah.
- Which island was it?

1977
02:04:58,302 --> 02:05:00,137
- Corfu.
- Yeah.

1978
02:05:00,221 --> 02:05:04,058
- What were you doing on Corfu?
- Oh, I only ran a bar on the beach.

1979
02:05:04,141 --> 02:05:06,268
- You were a cocktail waitress?
- Yeah.

1980
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:11,065
- When are you going to Paris?
- Oh, a week on Friday.

1981
02:05:11,148 --> 02:05:12,191
Yeah.

1982
02:05:12,274 --> 02:05:15,569
- We've got an early start, 6:22 train.
- Oh, no.

1983
02:05:15,653 --> 02:05:17,613
- Yeah.
- We get in at Paris, what is it?

1984
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,657
- About quarter to ten?
- Yeah, 9:50.

1985
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:22,952
- Have breakfast by the Seine.
- Have you got your hotel booked?

1986
02:05:23,035 --> 02:05:25,704
- Yeah, we've got a lovely hotel.
- Very nice, yeah.

1987
02:05:25,788 --> 02:05:28,207
- Beautiful. In the Marais area.
- Oh, yeah?

1988
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:30,251
It will be brilliant for Christmas shopping.

1989
02:05:30,334 --> 02:05:33,003
- When are you coming back?
- On Sunday.

1990
02:05:33,045 --> 02:05:35,714
- Short weekend.
- Not enough time to do all the things.

1991
02:05:35,756 --> 02:05:37,716
- We'll cram it all in.
- We'll try.

1992
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,386
- You can walk everywhere.
- Yeah, yeah.
