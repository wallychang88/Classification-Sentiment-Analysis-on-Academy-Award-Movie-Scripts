1
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,391
<i>So where are you?
You're in some motel room.</i>

2
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:40,599
<i>You just wake up,
and you're in a motel room.</i>

3
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,016
<i>There's the key. It feels like maybe it's
just the first time you've been there...</i>

4
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,682
<i>...but... perhaps you've been
there for a week...</i>

5
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,308
<i>...three months.</i>

6
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,599
<i>It's kind of hard to say.
I don't know.</i>

7
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:56,141
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

8
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,308
This guy.

9
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,640
He's here already.

10
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,724
Lenny!

11
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,183
It's Leonard...

12
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,932
...like I told you before.

13
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:11,016
Did you? I must have forgot.

14
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,891
I guess I've already
told you about my condition.

15
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,057
Only every time I see you.

16
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,682
<i>- My car.
- This is your car.</i>

17
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,807
You're in a playful mood.

18
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,183
It's not good to make fun
of someone's handicap.

19
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:37,016
Just trying to have a little fun.

20
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,474
Roll up your window.

21
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,515
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

22
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,557
- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

23
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,557
What the hell you wanna go there for?

24
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,016
- You know it?
- Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.

25
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,390
- Why do you wanna go there?
- Don't remember.

26
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,224
- Looks like somebody's home.
- That thing's been here for years.

27
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,515
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

28
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,266
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

29
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:42,308
Come on!

30
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,141
Let's take a look inside.

31
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,266
"Teddy".

32
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:16,266
"Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him."

33
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,099
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?

34
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,141
Find anything?

35
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,348
Didn't think so.

36
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,807
Let's go.

37
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:29,724
Fuck this.

38
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,682
You're gonna pay for what you did.

39
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,807
- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
- Leonard.

40
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,932
You don't have a clue, you freak.

41
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:47,307
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

42
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,348
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

43
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,891
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

44
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,141
That's 'cause you read it
off a fucking picture.

45
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:58,515
You don't know who you are.

46
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,224
I'm Leonard Shelby.
I'm from San Francisco.

47
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:05,141
That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.

48
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,724
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?

49
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,099
Come on.

50
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,974
Come on.
Let's go down to the basement.

51
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,057
Let's go down, you and me, together.

52
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,141
Then you'll know who you really are.

53
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,640
No!

54
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,183
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

55
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,265
<i>There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.</i>

56
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:33,265
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I, of course, read religiously.</i>

57
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,849
<i>You know who you are,
and you know kind of all about yourself.</i>

58
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,515
<i>Butjust for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.</i>

59
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,307
<i>SammyJankis had the same problem...</i>

60
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,348
<i>...but he really had no system.</i>

61
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,807
<i>He wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes...</i>

62
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,807
<i>...but he'd get them all mixed up.</i>

63
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:59,141
<i>You really do need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i>

64
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,891
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,223
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

66
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:01,182
Burt.

67
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:04,599
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have
asked you to hold my calls.

68
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:05,517
You don't know?

69
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,515
I think I may have.
I'm not good on the phone.

70
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,265
Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.

71
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,766
Yeah.

72
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,474
You don't remember saying that?

73
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,807
- That's the thing. I have this condition.
- A condition?

74
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:19,265
- It's my memory.
- Amnesia?

75
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,140
No, no. It's different from that.
I have no short-term memory.

76
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:25,182
I know who I am.
I know all about myself.

77
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:29,724
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.

78
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,016
If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started.

79
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,807
Next time I see you,
I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

80
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,474
I don't even know if I've met you before.

81
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,640
So, if I seem a little strange
or rude or something...

82
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,682
...I've told you this before, haven't I?

83
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:49,849
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you,
but it's so weird.

84
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,140
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

85
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:55,057
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

86
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,182
What's the last thing you remember?

87
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:59,766
My wife.

88
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,640
What's it like?

89
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,807
It's like waking.
It's like you just woke up.

90
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:14,098
That must suck.

91
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,807
It's all backwards.

92
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,742
Maybe you get an idea
what you want to do next...

93
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,140
...but you don't remember
what you just did.

94
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:26,056
- I'm exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?

95
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:28,182
- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?

96
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,974
- Like you said.
- Okay, but this guy's an exception.

97
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:35,932
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?

98
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,098
What makes you think he's my friend?

99
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,140
- I just saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

100
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:44,056
- Okay.
- If he calls or if he shows up here...

101
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,932
...give me a call in my room, okay?

102
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,599
His name's Teddy?

103
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,640
- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.

104
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:53,891
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

105
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,223
No, not as long as
you remember to pay the bill.

106
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,432
Yeah. Okay.

107
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,307
- Forty.
- Forty.

108
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:03,557
This guy...

109
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,348
He's here already.

110
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,474
Lenny!

111
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,724
<i>You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i>

112
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:17,849
<i>You kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting.</i>

113
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,974
<i>That becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes.</i>

114
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:24,390
<i>Where you put your notes...
That also becomes important.</i>

115
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,056
<i>You need a jacket that's got
like six pockets in it.</i>

116
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:29,348
<i>Particular pockets for particular things.</i>

117
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:33,265
<i>You just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works.</i>

118
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,793
<i>And you have to be wary...</i>

119
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,474
<i>...of other people writing stuff for you
that is not gonna make sense...</i>

120
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,432
<i>...or is gonna lead you astray.</i>

121
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:42,807
<i>I don't know. I guess people try and take
advantage of somebody with this condition.</i>

122
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:48,973
<i>If you have a piece
of information which is vital...</i>

123
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:52,474
<i>...writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i>

124
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,849
<i>It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.</i>

125
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,807
Who is this?

126
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,474
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

127
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:45,390
Excuse me, sir.
You left these at your table.

128
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:47,182
Thanks.

129
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,015
- Lincoln Street?
- Yeah.

130
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,223
Go straight out on Sixth Street.
Go east all the way...

131
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,515
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.
- It's easy. Just go...

132
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,557
Trust me. I need to write this down.

133
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,557
"The Discount Inn."

134
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,307
Discount Inn.

135
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,140
Natalie.

136
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:37,515
My car.

137
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,307
Teddy.

138
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:56,140
"John Edward Gammell."

139
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:00,807
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

140
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,682
"Don't believe his lies."

141
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,098
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr. Gammell?</i>

142
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,056
<i>- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?</i>

143
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,557
<i>Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there.
I'll be right over.</i>

144
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,557
Okay. I'll be waiting.

145
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:31,890
"White. Male."

146
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,474
"First name John."

147
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,474
"Last name: G" for Gammell.

148
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,140
"Drugs. License plate."

149
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,640
"SG 13...

150
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,557
7IU."

151
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,640
It's him.

152
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,806
I found you, you fuck.

153
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:13,140
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

154
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,723
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.
I remember everything up until my injury.

155
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,515
I just can't make new memories.
So I can't remember talking to you.

156
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,557
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

157
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,973
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

158
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,806
Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.

159
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:33,015
Sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

160
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,474
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

161
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:42,265
I'm disciplined and organized.

162
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,890
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

163
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,307
Sammy had no drive,
no reason to make it work.

164
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,973
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

165
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,223
"Today, 1:00 p.m.
Meet Natalie for info."

166
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,890
"She has also lost someone."

167
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:21,390
"She will help you out of pity."

168
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,098
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

169
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm sorry. I should have explained.
I have this...

170
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,098
You did explain, Lenny.

171
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,556
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

172
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,225
Yeah, I know. You told me.

173
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,223
Then I probably told you
how much I hated it.

174
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:51,723
Yeah.

175
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:55,223
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

176
00:17:56,807 --> 00:18:00,265
Thanks.
So you have information for me?

177
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:03,098
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,056
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

179
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:07,931
You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list...

180
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:10,182
...and you'll end up eating
your underwear for breakfast.

181
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,015
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

182
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,265
Yeah, it's tough.
It's almost impossible.

183
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,307
I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

184
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,556
I do have information for you.

185
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:29,223
You gave me a license plate number.

186
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,514
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

187
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:35,056
Guess what name came up.

188
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,639
John Edward Gammell. John G.

189
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,348
- Do you know him?
- No.

190
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,514
But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.

191
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,598
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

192
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:50,681
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

193
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,265
Are you sure you want this?

194
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,140
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,973
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

196
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:00,765
But even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

197
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,931
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

198
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,348
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make
any difference whether I know about it.

199
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,683
Just because there are things
I don't remember...

200
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,681
...doesn't make my actions meaningless.

201
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,723
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?

202
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:18,432
Anyway, maybe I'll take
a photograph to remind myself...

203
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,681
...get another freaky tattoo.

204
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,056
Tell me about her again.

205
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:29,639
Why?

206
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,639
Because you like to remember her.

207
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:36,307
She was beautiful.

208
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:42,931
- To me, she was perfect.
- No. Don't just recite the words.

209
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,973
Close your eyes... and remember her.

210
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:01,639
You can just feel the details.

211
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:06,348
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

212
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,848
And you can feel these extreme moments...

213
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,848
<i>...even if you don't want to.</i>

214
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:21,514
<i>You put these together,
and you get the feel of a person.</i>

215
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,015
Enough to know how much you miss them...

216
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,514
<i>...and how much you hate
the person who took them away.</i>

217
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,514
I added an address in here.

218
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,056
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

219
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:55,056
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

220
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,182
It's isolated.

221
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,182
Sounds perfect.

222
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:07,140
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

223
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,431
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

224
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:11,639
See, you have this condition.

225
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,639
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn,
room 304? You left it at my place.

226
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,639
Yeah.

227
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:29,307
- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.

228
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,182
You know what we have in common?

229
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:38,639
We are both survivors.

230
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:43,056
You take care, Leonard.

231
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,639
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

232
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,514
I met Sammy through work.
Insurance. I was an investigator.

233
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,473
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

234
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,639
I had to see through people's bullshit.

235
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,514
It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.

236
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,431
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

237
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,431
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

238
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:35,806
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk...</i>

239
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,264
<i>...and watch the eyes and the body language.</i>

240
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:40,732
<i>If someone scratches their nose
while they're talking...</i>

241
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,985
<i>...experts tell you
it means they're lying.</i>

242
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:45,514
<i>It really means they're nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

243
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,806
<i>It's all about context.</i>

244
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,765
Yeah, I was good.

245
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,848
Sammy was my first real challenge.

246
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:00,890
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you split for good.

247
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:04,264
- Things change.
- So I see.

248
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,431
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

249
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:11,514
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

250
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,389
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Yeah.

251
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:24,015
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G.? You think he's still here?

252
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,347
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

253
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,615
That's why you haven't
left town, am I right?

254
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,015
Maybe.

255
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:31,890
Leonard, look.
You have to be very careful.

256
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:32,464
Why?

257
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:35,890
The other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up...

258
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:37,723
...get you to kill the wrong guy.

259
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,890
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

260
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:44,015
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

261
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,890
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

262
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,639
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please!

263
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:51,056
No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It's not even that good.

264
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:54,681
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

265
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,723
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

266
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,598
They collect facts, they make notes,
and they draw conclusions.

267
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,723
Facts, not memories.

268
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,264
That's how you investigate.
I know. It's what I used to do.

269
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:09,556
Memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.

270
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,723
And memories can be distorted.

271
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:13,973
They're just an interpretation.
They're not a record.

272
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,140
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

273
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,931
You really want to get this guy,
don't you?

274
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:21,806
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

275
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,723
He destroyed my ability to live.

276
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,639
You're living.

277
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:35,431
Only for revenge.

278
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,347
Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?

279
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,890
The Discount Inn.

280
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,431
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

281
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:48,347
Probably left it in your room.

282
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,890
Hi. I'm checked in here,
but I think I've misplaced my key.

283
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,222
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

284
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:30,473
- Don't see my key anywhere.
- Shit.

285
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:32,639
This is the wrong room.
You're in 304 now.

286
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:34,723
- I'm sorry. I fucked up.
- This is not my room?

287
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:36,306
No. Let's go.

288
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:39,389
Why is this my handwriting?

289
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,347
This was your room,
but now you're in 304.

290
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:48,681
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

291
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:51,222
But then I rented you
another room on top of it.

292
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,431
- Why?
- Business is slow.

293
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:56,389
I told my boss
about your condition and stuff...

294
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,681
...and he said;
"Try and rent him another room."

295
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,806
How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?

296
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,347
Just two, so far.

297
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:07,097
At least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

298
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,723
You're not gonna remember anyway.

299
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,723
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

300
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:15,431
Leonard, always get a receipt.

301
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,723
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

302
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,264
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 1:00.

303
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,014
Your room's...

304
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,848
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

305
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:45,097
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

306
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:48,890
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis.
Strangest case ever.

307
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,765
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old
semiretired accountant.

308
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,514
He and his wife had been in this
car accident. Nothing too serious.

309
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,806
<i>But he's acting funny.
He can't get a handle on what's going on.</i>

310
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:02,055
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus.</i>

311
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,681
<i>Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

312
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:09,514
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.</i>

313
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,306
<i>His wife calls the insurance company,
and I get sent in.</i>

314
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:17,264
<i>Now, this is my first big claims
investigation, so I really check into it.</i>

315
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:22,556
<i>Sammy can think just fine,
but he can't make any new memories.</i>

316
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,972
<i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i>

317
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,765
<i>- This is Mr. Shelby.
- He'd watch TV...</i>

318
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,181
<i>...but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing.</i>

319
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:33,097
<i>He couldn't remember how it began.
He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

320
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:35,264
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

321
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:38,222
<i>The crazy part was that this guy...</i>

322
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:41,514
<i>...who couldn't even follow the plot
of Green Acres anymore...</i>

323
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,681
<i>...could do the most complicated things...</i>

324
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:47,139
<i>...as long as he learned them
before the accident...</i>

325
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,723
<i>...and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.</i>

326
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:52,556
Be gentle.

327
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,930
<i>The doctors assure me there's a real
condition called anterograde memory loss...</i>

328
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,972
<i>...or short-term memory loss.</i>

329
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:01,055
<i>It's rare, but legit.</i>

330
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,806
<i>But every time I see him...</i>

331
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,556
<i>...I catch this look...</i>

332
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,222
<i>...this slight look of recognition.</i>

333
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,139
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.</i>

334
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:16,347
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

335
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,264
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

336
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:23,306
<i>I can read people,
and I'm thinking: bad actor.</i>

337
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:26,889
So now I'm suspicious,
and I order more tests.

338
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:31,473
Awake.

339
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,181
Where am I?

340
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,806
Somebody's bedroom.

341
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:44,473
It must be her room.

342
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,598
But who is she?

343
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,806
It's only me.

344
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:03,014
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

345
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:08,473
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

346
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,972
- It's pretty weird.
- It's useful.

347
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,972
You never write a phone number on your hand?

348
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,514
I should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate.

349
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,431
- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G.'s license plate.

350
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,556
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

351
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,389
"Natalie."

352
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:57,972
"She has also lost someone."

353
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,972
"She will help you out of pity."

354
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,139
If it's registered in this state...

355
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,222
...it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

356
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,097
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

357
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:14,383
Do you think we could just
arrange a meeting now?

358
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:16,181
I'm not too good on the phone.

359
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:26,765
It's great that you...

360
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:32,347
...that you're helping me like this.

361
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:35,930
I'm helping you because you helped me.

362
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,889
So next time you see me,
will you remember me?

363
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,889
I think you will.

364
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,347
I'm sorry.

365
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:20,306
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

366
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,514
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you split for good.

367
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,972
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

368
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:46,389
But I find something
in my research: conditioning.

369
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:49,473
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

370
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:52,972
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.

371
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,556
It's a completely different part of
the brain from the short-term memory.

372
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,722
So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.

373
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:00,972
Just pick up any three objects.

374
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:03,222
That's a test?

375
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:05,889
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

376
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,139
Sorry.

377
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,930
Ow! What the fuck?

378
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,222
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

379
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:20,722
<i>Some of the objects were electrified.</i>

380
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,181
<i>They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test...</i>

381
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:25,222
...always with the same objects electrified.

382
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:28,889
The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects...

383
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:30,972
...not by memory, but by instinct.

384
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,638
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?

385
00:32:58,265 --> 00:32:59,948
Guess I don't have to worry
about him anymore.

386
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:01,347
What the fuck have you got me into?

387
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:02,930
Come inside.

388
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,097
- Who is he?
- Calm down. Okay?

389
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:12,680
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

390
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:14,264
How did you get me into this?

391
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:16,389
You offered to help when you saw
what he did to my face.

392
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,557
How do I know he did that to your face?

393
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,055
Because I came straight
to you after he did it.

394
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,389
I showed you what he did,
and I asked you to help me.

395
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:24,431
- And I just take your word?
- Yeah.

396
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,805
Something doesn't feel right.

397
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,431
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

398
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:31,930
- Did you?
- What?

399
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:34,431
- Kill him?
- Of course not!

400
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,556
Hey.

401
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,473
Sit down, okay? Sit.

402
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,389
This has nothing to do with you.

403
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:43,847
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

404
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,638
You have to burn them.

405
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,222
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.

406
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,306
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.

407
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:58,139
- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.

408
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,347
Such as?

409
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:03,638
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

410
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:06,722
I know what that's gonna
feel like when I pick it up.

411
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:10,473
See? Certainties. It's the kind
of memory you take for granted.

412
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:14,473
You know, I can remember so much.

413
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:19,764
The feel of the world... and her.

414
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,181
She's gone.

415
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:32,222
And the present is trivia,
which I scribble down as fucking notes!

416
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:35,222
Hey. Come on.
Try and relax. Come on.

417
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,638
It's not easy for me to relax,
you know?

418
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,389
Come on. Take your jacket off.

419
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,014
Now. Come on.

420
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:46,555
Hey.

421
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:50,431
Didn't think you were the type.

422
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,473
It's backwards.

423
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,222
Come here.

424
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:03,972
Come here.

425
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,889
What about here?

426
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,638
Maybe it's for when I find him.

427
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,805
I've lost somebody too.

428
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,222
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,513
His name was Jimmy.

430
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,638
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

431
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,680
He never came back.

432
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:51,431
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

433
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,722
What do the police think?

434
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:57,680
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

435
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:03,306
When you find this guy, this John G...

436
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,347
...what are you gonna do?

437
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:10,014
I'm gonna kill him.

438
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,597
Maybe I can help you find him.

439
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:21,097
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

440
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:28,472
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

441
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:33,347
...because she's gone to
the bathroom or something.

442
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,389
But somehow I just...

443
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,430
...I just know she's never
gonna come back to bed.

444
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:55,472
If I could just reach over
and touch her side of the bed...

445
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,264
...I would know that it was cold.

446
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:04,388
But I can't.

447
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,306
I know I can't have her back.

448
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:16,014
But I don't want to wake up
in the morning thinking she's still here.

449
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:21,930
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

450
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:32,764
How can I heal?

451
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:40,306
How am I supposed to heal
if I can't... feel time?

452
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,555
"She has also lost someone."

453
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,097
"She will help you out of pity."

454
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:25,346
They kept testing Sammy for months...

455
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:28,222
...always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

456
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:31,055
Ow! What the fuck?

457
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,555
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

458
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,346
Even with total short-term memory loss...

459
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:39,181
<i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively
stop picking up the wrong objects.</i>

460
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,305
<i>All the previous cases responded to
conditioning. Sammy didn't respond at all.</i>

461
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:46,972
<i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.</i>

462
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:50,513
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

463
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,305
His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.

464
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:59,680
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

465
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,680
But it works for me.

466
00:40:02,222 --> 00:40:04,139
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

467
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:06,638
Habit and routine make my life possible.

468
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:09,638
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

469
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,638
Awake.

470
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,889
Where am I?

471
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,097
Motel room.

472
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,221
Some anonymous motel room.

473
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:42,139
Nothing in the drawers,
but I'll take a look anyway.

474
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,680
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

475
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:01,889
Lenny! Open up!

476
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,680
Just a minute.

477
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,305
Open the door.

478
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:10,638
Lenny.

479
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,388
Open the door.

480
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:20,388
Come on!

481
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:23,972
Hi, Teddy.

482
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:26,305
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

483
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:40,555
I get it.

484
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,096
Amorous neighbors.

485
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:43,638
What are you doing here?

486
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:47,430
You called me.
You said you needed my help.

487
00:41:47,514 --> 00:41:51,055
I've had more rewarding
friendships than this one.

488
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:54,472
Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.

489
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,221
What the fuck is that?

490
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:04,722
- Who the fuck is that?
- You don't know him?

491
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:06,430
No! Should I?

492
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,138
Wait a minute.

493
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:10,680
- Is that John G.?
- I don't think so.

494
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:12,656
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

495
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,055
I might've fallen asleep before I did.

496
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,138
For Christ's sakes!

497
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:18,972
Ask him.

498
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:24,597
What's your name?

499
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:25,680
Your name.

500
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:28,096
- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?

501
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:30,764
- What?
- Who did this to you?

502
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,346
You did.

503
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:38,847
- I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.
- No, just let me think for a minute.

504
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,054
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

505
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:48,597
- Natalie who?
- Why?

506
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,764
- Maybe I know her.
- Look. We gotta get him out of here.

507
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:54,305
All right, all right.

508
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:57,388
He's gotta have a car, right?

509
00:42:57,473 --> 00:43:01,054
We take him down to his car, tell him to get
the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

510
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:03,221
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

511
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:05,764
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know.

512
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:07,805
You don't know.

513
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,889
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

514
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,764
It must be his room.
Great! Let's go.

515
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,805
- No, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

516
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,430
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

517
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:24,138
Okay. We untie him...

518
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:27,096
...we clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.

519
00:43:27,181 --> 00:43:29,138
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

520
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,972
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

521
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:36,805
Fucking hope not.

522
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:45,638
Which one?

523
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,180
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

524
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,221
Shut up.

525
00:43:52,306 --> 00:43:54,722
That's all right for you to say.
You're the one with the Jag.

526
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:57,680
Get in.
I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

527
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,680
Give me your keys.

528
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:01,971
Take your own car.

529
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,231
So was he scared?

530
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:32,929
Yeah. I think it was
your sinister mustache.

531
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:35,722
Fuck you.
You should have stolen his car.

532
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,847
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

533
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,263
So what do you do now?

534
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,805
I'm going to find out
what the fuck that was all about.

535
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,805
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?

536
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:02,472
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him...

537
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:04,638
...and fighting the company's decision.

538
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,805
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

539
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:11,888
<i>- I never said that Sammy was faking.
- Listen. I have an idea.</i>

540
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:13,597
Sammy, I have an idea.

541
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,346
<i>Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.</i>

542
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:19,680
I want you to have a pen
in your pocket, okay?

543
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:22,305
<i>- But she couldn't understand.
- You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.</i>

544
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,388
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

545
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,597
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try harder.

546
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,805
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person.</i>

547
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:33,013
<i>If it's not a physical problem,
he should just snap out of it.</i>

548
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,805
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?

549
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:39,513
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!

550
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:42,722
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!

551
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:50,597
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt...

552
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,305
...just like he gave it to the doctors.

553
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:56,805
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.

554
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,513
I don't feel drunk.

555
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,138
- Hello?
- Shit.

556
00:47:19,222 --> 00:47:20,638
Housekeeping.

557
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:22,804
- Not right now.
- I'm sorry.

558
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:46,971
Okay.

559
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:55,804
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie."

560
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:02,971
Dodd.

561
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:11,513
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

562
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:15,013
Teddy, Teddy.

563
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:28,680
<i>Leave your number.
You know what to do.</i>

564
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:30,929
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

565
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:33,054
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn
of Fifth Street, room six.

566
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:36,138
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

567
00:48:36,222 --> 00:48:38,472
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

568
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:44,263
Fuck.

569
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,305
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that
you can't bully someone into remembering.

570
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,388
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

571
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,138
Then call me back?

572
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:27,846
Okay. What am I doing?

573
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:31,804
I'm chasing this guy.

574
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:37,054
No. He's chasing me.

575
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:01,472
Fuck.

576
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,180
"Dodd. White guy."

577
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:09,221
"Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

578
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:12,846
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

579
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,804
Fuck.

580
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:54,804
Sorry.

581
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:30,305
I need a weapon.

582
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:34,721
This'll do.

583
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,846
I don't feel drunk.

584
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:44,471
Do I know this guy?

585
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,471
He seems to know me.

586
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:53,721
What the fuck?

587
00:53:07,306 --> 00:53:09,471
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

588
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:11,554
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

589
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:14,096
I haven't made a strong enough
impression on you?

590
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:16,180
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

591
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:28,804
Okay. What am I doing?

592
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:41,180
Who is this?

593
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:01,637
Ouch. Cut it out.

594
00:55:33,388 --> 00:55:36,554
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

595
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,679
Yeah, but you've read it,
like, a thousand times.

596
00:55:39,764 --> 00:55:41,345
I enjoy it.

597
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,345
I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.

598
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,138
Don't be a prick.

599
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:49,804
I'm not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.

600
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,429
Just let me read, please.

601
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:06,637
Probably tried this before.

602
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:11,596
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

603
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,138
Can't remember to forget you.

604
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:35,512
Yeah.

605
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:37,304
Uh-huh.

606
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:42,262
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

607
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:46,220
I was hoping for a little more on
the drugs angle. Can you hang on a sec?

608
00:56:54,805 --> 00:56:58,054
The police report mentioned
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

609
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:00,220
The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.

610
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:03,013
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.

611
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:05,387
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

612
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:09,554
With my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

613
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,888
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.

614
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:15,138
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

615
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:17,471
I don't know why these are crossed out.

616
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:19,471
But they weren't even looking for John G.

617
00:57:19,555 --> 00:57:22,304
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened...

618
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:24,304
...so they didn't chase any of it up.

619
00:58:00,388 --> 00:58:01,471
Honey.

620
00:58:03,972 --> 00:58:05,763
Honey, it's late.

621
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,888
Everything okay?

622
00:58:47,513 --> 00:58:48,971
You okay in there?

623
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:54,179
Was it good for you?

624
00:58:56,388 --> 00:58:59,304
What?
Was I supposed to lock the door?

625
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:01,304
No.

626
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:05,637
I'd like you to leave now.

627
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:29,679
There's something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

628
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:32,262
Because the police claim
the guy was an addict...

629
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:34,345
...needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit...

630
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,679
...'cause he's not gonna go breaking into
places while he's still got a stash that big.

631
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:41,304
I think John G. left it there
or planted it there.

632
00:59:43,138 --> 00:59:45,137
How do you know that?

633
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:48,596
Shit. That's true. It fits.

634
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:51,262
So he's a dealer.

635
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,846
Hang on a sec.

636
01:00:03,972 --> 01:00:05,971
Now we're getting somewhere.

637
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:07,637
"Discount Inn."

638
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:03,763
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

639
01:01:06,138 --> 01:01:08,262
That's what they say.

640
01:01:08,346 --> 01:01:10,471
The Discount Inn. 304.

641
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:12,512
Leonard.

642
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:15,345
What then?

643
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:18,637
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

644
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:20,804
You go into the bathroom
and you slam the door.

645
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,429
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

646
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,471
- And that's it?
- That's it.

647
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:31,304
First I just need you to put
these things around the room.

648
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:37,471
Just pretend they're your things
and that this is your bedroom.

649
01:01:49,263 --> 01:01:54,137
- Should I wear it?
- No. Just like you took it off or something.

650
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:59,512
I don't want you to use it.
I'm sorry.

651
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,304
I just mean put them
around the room...

652
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:05,970
...as if they were your things.

653
01:02:10,472 --> 01:02:12,471
Whatever gets you off.

654
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:38,970
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

655
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:41,387
This is a difficult condition
for people to understand.

656
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:44,721
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

657
01:02:44,805 --> 01:02:47,345
I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.

658
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,763
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

659
01:02:51,263 --> 01:02:53,721
<i>She told me about life with Sammy,
how she treated him.</i>

660
01:02:53,805 --> 01:02:55,262
Thank you for seeing me.

661
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:58,095
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy
to hide food all around the house.

662
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,928
Then she'd stop feeding him
to see if his hunger...

663
01:03:00,013 --> 01:03:01,970
...would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.

664
01:03:04,305 --> 01:03:06,928
<i>She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.</i>

665
01:03:07,013 --> 01:03:10,803
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.

666
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,512
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position
isn't that Sammy is faking anything...

667
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:15,512
...just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

668
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:19,053
...I just want to know what your
honest opinion about Sammy is.

669
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:22,053
We shouldn't even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

670
01:03:22,138 --> 01:03:25,387
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

671
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,928
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy...

672
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:31,471
I don't see some... vegetable.

673
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:33,637
I see my same old Sammy.

674
01:03:35,804 --> 01:03:37,423
What do you think that's like for me...

675
01:03:37,424 --> 01:03:40,220
...to suspect he might be
imagining this whole problem...

676
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:42,387
...and that if I just could
say the right thing...

677
01:03:42,472 --> 01:03:45,262
...he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal?

678
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:54,596
If I knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone...

679
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,803
...then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.

680
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:03,637
As long as I have doubt,
I can't say good-bye and move on.

681
01:04:03,722 --> 01:04:05,471
What do you want from me?

682
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:08,721
I want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds...

683
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:12,471
...and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

684
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:17,721
I need to know...
what you honestly believe.

685
01:04:23,054 --> 01:04:26,637
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

686
01:04:34,555 --> 01:04:35,637
Thank you.

687
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:41,220
I thought I helped her. I thought
she just needed some kind of answer.

688
01:04:41,305 --> 01:04:43,304
I didn't think it was important
what the answer was...

689
01:04:44,138 --> 01:04:46,137
...just that she had one to believe.

690
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:04,053
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

691
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:06,471
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it.

692
01:05:06,555 --> 01:05:10,179
Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

693
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,220
Geez!

694
01:05:13,305 --> 01:05:15,220
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

695
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:17,429
What, your sense of humor
went with the memory?

696
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,471
- Do you even know why you're here?
- Unfinished business.

697
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:22,928
Lenny, let me inform you.

698
01:05:23,013 --> 01:05:25,387
Your business here is very much finished.

699
01:05:25,472 --> 01:05:28,471
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

700
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:31,678
Schmuck, whose house do you think
you just walked out of?

701
01:05:34,054 --> 01:05:37,471
That's right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

702
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,678
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

703
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:45,512
You'll wanna make a note.
You can't trust her.

704
01:05:45,597 --> 01:05:46,970
Yeah? Why's that?

705
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:50,304
Because by now she's taken
a look at this suit and the car...

706
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:54,762
...and she's starting to figure out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

707
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:58,179
She's already got you staying
with her, for Christ's sakes.

708
01:05:58,263 --> 01:06:01,845
You can't go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.

709
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,804
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

710
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:05,878
What do you mean, "bad news"?

711
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:08,179
She's involved with drugs.

712
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:10,554
Look. These. You see these?

713
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:12,596
This is the bar where she works.

714
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,720
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

715
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,429
She takes orders for him,
arranges meets.

716
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:20,387
He writes messages on the back of these.

717
01:06:20,472 --> 01:06:23,012
Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

718
01:06:23,096 --> 01:06:27,179
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...

719
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:29,429
...she's gonna use you to protect herself.

720
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:30,720
From who?

721
01:06:30,804 --> 01:06:33,554
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

722
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:37,179
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

723
01:06:37,263 --> 01:06:40,304
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.

724
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:43,887
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

725
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:45,887
You worried that she's gonna use me
against you?

726
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:47,970
- No.
- Why not?

727
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,304
Because she doesn't know who I am.

728
01:06:52,305 --> 01:06:54,845
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

729
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,845
She doesn't know anything about
your investigation, okay, Einstein?

730
01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:01,595
So write this down.

731
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:06,345
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

732
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:11,220
I'm not lying.
Take my pen. Write this down.

733
01:07:11,305 --> 01:07:13,471
Do not trust her.

734
01:07:20,888 --> 01:07:24,387
- There. You happy now?
- I won't be happy until you leave town.

735
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:26,387
Why not?

736
01:07:26,472 --> 01:07:29,970
You ever wonder how long you can hang around
here before people start asking questions?

737
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:31,137
What sort of questions?

738
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:33,345
The same sort of questions
you should be asking yourself.

739
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,970
- Like what?
- Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

740
01:07:36,054 --> 01:07:37,678
- I have money.
- From what?

741
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:41,137
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.

742
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:46,970
So in your grief you wandered
into a Jaguar dealership.

743
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:51,471
You don't have a clue, do you?

744
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:54,095
- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes, I do.

745
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,928
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

746
01:07:58,013 --> 01:07:59,803
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco...

747
01:07:59,888 --> 01:08:04,511
That's who you were.
You do not know who you are...

748
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:08,511
...what you've become since...
the incident.

749
01:08:08,596 --> 01:08:11,137
You wander around playing detective.

750
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:13,803
You don't even know how long ago it was.

751
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:19,595
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

752
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,471
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
- Right. You're an investigator.

753
01:08:24,388 --> 01:08:27,414
Maybe you should start
investigating yourself.

754
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,012
Thank you for the advice.

755
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:33,803
Look, do me a favor.
Don't go back in there.

756
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:36,595
Will you take the motel out of town?

757
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,137
It's been fun, Lenny.

758
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:51,095
"Do not trust her."

759
01:08:52,888 --> 01:08:54,887
"Don't believe his lies."

760
01:09:07,804 --> 01:09:10,012
Fuck it. I need my own place.

761
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:20,887
No. She shouldn't have
given me that responsibility.

762
01:09:20,971 --> 01:09:23,636
I'm a claims investigator,
not a doctor.

763
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:27,262
Yeah. I guess.

764
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:29,720
But I've got all sorts
of other considerations.

765
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:33,012
Legal responsibility, large financial...

766
01:09:37,804 --> 01:09:39,470
Who is this?

767
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,928
Write this down.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

768
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:56,345
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

769
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:04,095
What happened?

770
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,220
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

771
01:10:06,305 --> 01:10:07,678
Who?

772
01:10:07,763 --> 01:10:09,511
Who?

773
01:10:09,596 --> 01:10:11,636
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

774
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,636
- Why?
- Why? Because of you.

775
01:10:13,721 --> 01:10:16,428
Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!

776
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:20,053
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Take it easy.

777
01:10:20,138 --> 01:10:21,970
You're safe. It's okay.

778
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,845
Come on. Just sit down.

779
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:27,845
Sit down.

780
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:29,845
Here. Sit down.

781
01:10:30,804 --> 01:10:32,762
Okay. You're okay.

782
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:35,137
I'll just get some ice for your face.

783
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:44,053
Here.

784
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,887
I did exactly what you told me to do.

785
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:56,137
I went to Dodd...

786
01:10:57,263 --> 01:11:00,636
...and I told him that I didn't have
any of Jimmy's money...

787
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:03,179
...or the drugs...

788
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:07,970
...and that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

789
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:09,678
And what did he say?

790
01:11:10,763 --> 01:11:12,678
He didn't believe me.

791
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:18,262
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

792
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,803
Then he just started hitting me.

793
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,428
Where is he?

794
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:28,428
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

795
01:11:28,512 --> 01:11:29,511
And?

796
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:32,803
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

797
01:11:33,596 --> 01:11:35,303
He'll kill you, Lenny.

798
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:39,220
My wife used to call me Lenny.

799
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:40,720
Yeah?

800
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:44,386
Yeah. I hated it.

801
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,970
This guy is so dangerous.

802
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:51,595
- Let's just think of something else, okay?
- No, no.

803
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,720
You just tell me what he looks like...
and where I can find him.

804
01:11:55,804 --> 01:11:59,344
- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.

805
01:12:09,512 --> 01:12:11,262
He'll probably find you.

806
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:14,678
- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.

807
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,470
Why?

808
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:21,803
He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.

809
01:12:22,888 --> 01:12:24,636
Just write it all down.

810
01:12:39,763 --> 01:12:41,012
Be careful.

811
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,012
I'll be fine.

812
01:12:51,096 --> 01:12:54,137
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

813
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:11,470
Front desk?

814
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,137
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

815
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:17,303
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't want any calls.

816
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:19,470
Nope. None at all.

817
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:32,344
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

818
01:13:32,429 --> 01:13:34,386
- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.

819
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:35,887
What does he want?

820
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:38,928
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

821
01:13:39,013 --> 01:13:40,137
Did you?

822
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,511
No.

823
01:13:46,387 --> 01:13:48,470
- What's this all about?
- Fuck!

824
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:52,428
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

825
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,855
I have this condition.

826
01:13:53,856 --> 01:13:56,053
I know all about your
fucking condition, Leonard!

827
01:13:56,138 --> 01:13:57,855
Probably know more about it than you do.

828
01:13:57,856 --> 01:13:59,553
You don't have a fucking clue
about anything else.

829
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:00,720
What happened?

830
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,636
What happened is that Jimmy
went to meet some guy named Teddy.

831
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:06,428
He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.

832
01:14:06,512 --> 01:14:08,396
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.

833
01:14:08,397 --> 01:14:10,095
I don't know if you know
this Teddy, or how well.

834
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,845
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!

835
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:12,970
- I'm not.
- Help me.

836
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:14,303
How?

837
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,553
Get rid of Dodd for me.

838
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:18,678
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

839
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:21,803
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

840
01:14:21,888 --> 01:14:23,928
What then? Love?

841
01:14:24,013 --> 01:14:25,720
What would you kill for?

842
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:28,386
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

843
01:14:28,471 --> 01:14:31,970
- Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

844
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,303
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

845
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,845
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember.

846
01:14:36,929 --> 01:14:39,053
I could call your wife a fucking whore
and we could still be friends.

847
01:14:39,137 --> 01:14:41,344
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

848
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:43,213
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

849
01:14:43,214 --> 01:14:45,012
Take it easy.
This has nothing to do with me.

850
01:14:45,096 --> 01:14:48,595
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

851
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,013
You can't get scared,
but can you get angry?

852
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:53,012
Yes.

853
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:55,428
You pathetic piece of shit.

854
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:57,595
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

855
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,261
and you won't have a fucking clue,
you fucking retard!

856
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:02,845
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.

857
01:15:02,929 --> 01:15:05,428
I'm telling you now,
because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

858
01:15:05,512 --> 01:15:09,053
...if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

859
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,928
Did you lose your pen?

860
01:15:11,013 --> 01:15:14,428
That's too bad, freak. Otherwise,
you could write yourself a little note...

861
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:16,596
...about how much Natalie
hates your retarded guts...

862
01:15:16,597 --> 01:15:18,094
...and that I called your wife
a fuckin' whore.

863
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,887
- Don't say another fuckin' word.
- About your whore of a wife?

864
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,720
I read about your condition, Leonard.

865
01:15:26,804 --> 01:15:31,386
You know what one of the causes of short-term
memory loss is? Venereal disease.

866
01:15:31,471 --> 01:15:36,344
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks...

867
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:38,136
...and turned you into a fucking retard!

868
01:15:39,429 --> 01:15:43,636
You sad, sad freak.

869
01:15:45,095 --> 01:15:47,803
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

870
01:15:47,888 --> 01:15:50,303
...and you won't remember.

871
01:15:51,137 --> 01:15:53,178
We'll still be best friends...

872
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:56,803
...or maybe even lovers.

873
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:00,219
Fuck.

874
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,219
I'll see you soon.

875
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:17,928
Stay focused. Find a pen.

876
01:16:18,429 --> 01:16:21,136
Gotta write this down.
Gotta write it down.

877
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:25,178
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

878
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:28,845
Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

879
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:34,219
Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.

880
01:16:34,304 --> 01:16:38,261
Write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.

881
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:40,219
Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.

882
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,636
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.

883
01:16:43,387 --> 01:16:45,136
Keep focused. Keep focused.

884
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:48,678
Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.

885
01:16:48,763 --> 01:16:50,595
Write this note.
Write down what happened.

886
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:53,970
Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.

887
01:17:02,637 --> 01:17:03,762
What happened?

888
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:05,928
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

889
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:07,261
Who?

890
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,052
Who?

891
01:17:09,137 --> 01:17:11,470
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

892
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,178
Hello?

893
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:28,011
It's Burt, from the front desk.

894
01:17:30,304 --> 01:17:32,678
- Yeah?
- I know you said you didn't want any calls.

895
01:17:32,763 --> 01:17:35,303
But this guy called.
He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

896
01:17:35,387 --> 01:17:36,845
- A cop?
- Yeah.

897
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:40,470
He says you're really gonna wanna
know what he has to say.

898
01:17:40,554 --> 01:17:44,136
I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look
people in the eye when I talk to them.

899
01:17:50,888 --> 01:17:54,094
You can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.

900
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:55,969
Just have a seat.

901
01:17:56,053 --> 01:17:57,511
Thanks.

902
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:04,470
How long do you think it's gonna take you?

903
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:09,219
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?

904
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,927
That depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on.

905
01:18:14,012 --> 01:18:17,136
I have my file here.

906
01:18:19,471 --> 01:18:23,261
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information...

907
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:25,720
...then why haven't the police
found him for you?

908
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:29,136
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

909
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,136
They don't think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.

910
01:18:34,846 --> 01:18:36,344
I was asleep.

911
01:18:37,637 --> 01:18:39,553
Something woke me up.

912
01:18:43,763 --> 01:18:47,470
<i>Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.</i>

913
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,969
There had to be a second man.

914
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:50,636
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

915
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:52,636
It's about the last thing
that I do remember.

916
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,470
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police...

917
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:59,344
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.

918
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:04,595
John G. was clever.

919
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,178
He was clever.

920
01:20:06,262 --> 01:20:08,272
See, he took the dead man's gun...

921
01:20:08,273 --> 01:20:10,969
...he replaced it with the sap
that he hit me with.

922
01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:15,636
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

923
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:19,470
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

924
01:20:20,512 --> 01:20:22,470
And they only found my gun.

925
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:25,178
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

926
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:29,844
I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts, and I had brain damage.

927
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:32,553
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

928
01:20:32,637 --> 01:20:36,720
Leonard, you can stay here
for a couple of days if it'll help you.

929
01:20:39,137 --> 01:20:40,303
Thanks.

930
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:42,844
I have to go back to work.

931
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:45,178
So, just make yourself at home.

932
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:49,094
You can watch TV or you can have some food,
whatever you want, okay?

933
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,844
- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.

934
01:20:54,928 --> 01:20:58,678
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

935
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:03,052
"Natalie."

936
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:37,386
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

937
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:28,636
- On the house.
- Thanks.

938
01:22:34,137 --> 01:22:36,136
You really do have a problem.

939
01:22:36,803 --> 01:22:38,635
Just like that cop said.

940
01:22:40,137 --> 01:22:41,386
Your condition.

941
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:43,969
Nobody's perfect.

942
01:22:45,554 --> 01:22:48,969
What's the last thing that you do remember?

943
01:22:52,095 --> 01:22:54,219
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

944
01:22:54,304 --> 01:22:55,178
Dying.

945
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,553
I remember my wife dying.

946
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,219
Let me get you another one.

947
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:08,136
I think this one's dusty.

948
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:14,635
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

949
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:18,178
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

950
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,219
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

951
01:23:23,803 --> 01:23:25,779
Why are you asking me?
I can't remember what I've done.

952
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,677
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

953
01:23:27,762 --> 01:23:28,979
Because of my condition.

954
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,677
You don't believe someone
with this condition.

955
01:23:30,762 --> 01:23:33,719
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

956
01:23:34,304 --> 01:23:36,052
"Ferdy's Bar."

957
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:41,011
"Come by after. Natalie."

958
01:23:55,179 --> 01:23:56,886
I'll have a beer, please.

959
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:58,969
- What do you want?
- A beer, please.

960
01:23:59,053 --> 01:24:01,470
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

961
01:24:01,553 --> 01:24:03,886
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

962
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:06,927
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- That's me.

963
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:09,219
Yeah. We met before, right?

964
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:12,844
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

965
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,386
I don't remember. I have no
short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

966
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:18,136
- You're the memory guy.
- How do you know about me?

967
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,677
My boyfriend told me about you.

968
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:24,677
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

969
01:24:25,845 --> 01:24:27,303
No.

970
01:24:27,387 --> 01:24:30,844
He knows you. He told me about you.

971
01:24:30,928 --> 01:24:33,011
He said you were staying at the Discount.

972
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:36,136
In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.

973
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,386
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...

974
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:40,802
...wouldn't know how he got here
or what he'd done.

975
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:43,428
Said I get a lot of guys
around here like that.

976
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,969
Chronic alcoholism is one cause
of short-term memory loss.

977
01:24:49,053 --> 01:24:51,761
- Are you Teddy?
- No. My name's Leonard.

978
01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:53,969
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

979
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:58,219
- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.

980
01:24:58,304 --> 01:25:00,677
- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

981
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,094
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done.

982
01:25:04,179 --> 01:25:07,802
No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

983
01:25:07,887 --> 01:25:10,594
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

984
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:15,386
<i>Your pocket.</i>

985
01:25:40,012 --> 01:25:43,136
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

986
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,552
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

987
01:25:46,137 --> 01:25:49,094
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

988
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:02,635
Thank you.

989
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,136
- On the house.
- Thanks.

990
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:29,303
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

991
01:26:30,511 --> 01:26:33,761
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

992
01:26:33,845 --> 01:26:36,635
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

993
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,886
You know the truth
about my condition, Officer?

994
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,719
You don't know anything.

995
01:26:41,803 --> 01:26:43,969
You feel angry, you don't know why.

996
01:26:44,053 --> 01:26:46,802
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

997
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,261
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

998
01:26:50,345 --> 01:26:52,719
Like Sammy.
What if I've done something like Sammy?

999
01:26:53,428 --> 01:26:56,677
I didn't tell you what happened
to Sammy and his wife?

1000
01:26:58,428 --> 01:27:01,594
She came to see me at my office. I thought
she was trying to catch me off guard...

1001
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:04,594
<i>...so I didn't tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking...</i>

1002
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:06,594
<i>...just that his condition was mental,
not physical.</i>

1003
01:27:06,678 --> 01:27:09,635
<i>I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.</i>

1004
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:14,303
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1005
01:27:30,262 --> 01:27:32,261
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.</i>

1006
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:35,385
<i>So she found a way to test him.</i>

1007
01:27:48,095 --> 01:27:51,677
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

1008
01:28:01,636 --> 01:28:03,677
<i>She really thought she'd call his bluff.</i>

1009
01:28:03,762 --> 01:28:05,261
There you go.

1010
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:09,677
<i>Or she just didn't wanna live
with the things she'd put him through.</i>

1011
01:28:19,636 --> 01:28:20,635
Sammy.

1012
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,927
It's time for my shot.

1013
01:28:30,386 --> 01:28:32,178
It won't hurt.

1014
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:18,302
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.</i>

1015
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:22,552
<i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.</i>

1016
01:29:24,845 --> 01:29:26,761
He's been in a home ever since.

1017
01:29:26,845 --> 01:29:29,260
<i>He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.</i>

1018
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,719
I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.

1019
01:29:32,803 --> 01:29:34,719
She wasn't interested in the money.

1020
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:36,969
She just needed to understand his problem.

1021
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:40,469
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con man.</i>

1022
01:29:40,553 --> 01:29:43,969
<i>When she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.</i>

1023
01:29:44,053 --> 01:29:46,427
<i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.</i>

1024
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:48,635
Now I know. You fake it.

1025
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,552
If you think you're supposed to
recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1026
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,302
<i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.</i>

1027
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:57,178
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1028
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:02,510
What drug dealer?

1029
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:31,011
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

1030
01:30:31,095 --> 01:30:34,094
- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

1031
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:36,177
The Jag's out front.
Should have put it around back.

1032
01:30:36,261 --> 01:30:39,761
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1033
01:30:39,845 --> 01:30:42,343
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1034
01:30:42,428 --> 01:30:44,886
- Give me the keys. I'll move it.
- It'll be all right for a minute.

1035
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,469
Wait out there.

1036
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:49,886
Give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.

1037
01:30:53,636 --> 01:30:57,677
Fact six: Car license SG137IU.

1038
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,969
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1039
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:11,510
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1040
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:14,886
Man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1041
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,944
It's not safe for you
to hang around here anymore.

1042
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:19,343
- Why not?
- Because that cop's looking for you.

1043
01:31:19,428 --> 01:31:22,011
I gotta get you a new identity,
some new clothes.

1044
01:31:22,095 --> 01:31:24,719
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.

1045
01:31:24,803 --> 01:31:26,177
What cop?

1046
01:31:27,386 --> 01:31:30,343
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1047
01:31:30,428 --> 01:31:32,662
He's been calling you for days,
telling you shit...

1048
01:31:32,663 --> 01:31:34,328
...slipping envelopes under your door.
Shit like that.

1049
01:31:34,344 --> 01:31:37,052
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He thinks it's funny.

1050
01:31:37,136 --> 01:31:39,135
- He's been laughing at you.
- You're full of shit.

1051
01:31:39,219 --> 01:31:42,052
I'm not. He knows you're no good
on the phone, so he's been calling you.

1052
01:31:42,136 --> 01:31:44,135
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1053
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:47,011
...so he slips shit under your door to scare
you into answering the phone again...

1054
01:31:47,094 --> 01:31:49,761
...giving you a line of crap about
John G. being some local drug dealer.

1055
01:31:49,845 --> 01:31:53,093
- Jimmy Grants.
- Who's Jimmy Grants?

1056
01:31:53,178 --> 01:31:55,135
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1057
01:31:55,219 --> 01:31:57,510
The cop wants to know
how his operation's run.

1058
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,594
He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.

1059
01:31:59,678 --> 01:32:01,343
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

1060
01:32:02,428 --> 01:32:07,135
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1061
01:32:07,219 --> 01:32:09,552
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1062
01:32:09,636 --> 01:32:13,427
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1063
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:16,135
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1064
01:32:36,762 --> 01:32:38,719
You are full of shit.

1065
01:32:40,428 --> 01:32:42,594
"Come by after. Natalie."

1066
01:32:42,678 --> 01:32:44,177
"Ferdy's Bar."

1067
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,302
Hey, Jimmy.

1068
01:33:31,344 --> 01:33:34,135
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1069
01:33:34,803 --> 01:33:36,135
Sorry.

1070
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,218
That's okay.

1071
01:33:52,386 --> 01:33:55,635
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of
the bar where his girlfriend works?

1072
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,968
But he's not gonna bring her along.
He'll come by himself, right?

1073
01:34:00,303 --> 01:34:03,260
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1074
01:34:04,303 --> 01:34:07,469
No, Officer.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1075
01:34:08,178 --> 01:34:10,719
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1076
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:13,968
I'll be right there.

1077
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:56,968
Lenny.

1078
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:01,302
Officer Gammell.

1079
01:35:03,845 --> 01:35:06,552
Yeah. Come on.

1080
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:25,510
- Smile.
- Not here.

1081
01:35:26,845 --> 01:35:28,135
Over here.

1082
01:35:33,803 --> 01:35:36,802
- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?

1083
01:35:36,886 --> 01:35:39,093
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1084
01:35:39,762 --> 01:35:41,802
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1085
01:35:44,636 --> 01:35:47,051
This is the directions where he's going.

1086
01:35:47,136 --> 01:35:50,177
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?

1087
01:35:50,261 --> 01:35:52,177
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1088
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,802
Nice picture. I look thin.

1089
01:36:03,511 --> 01:36:04,802
Hey, Lenny.

1090
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:06,885
Make him beg.

1091
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,135
Teddy!

1092
01:37:34,344 --> 01:37:35,843
Hey, Teddy!

1093
01:37:42,802 --> 01:37:43,968
Jimmy.

1094
01:37:45,761 --> 01:37:48,343
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1095
01:37:48,428 --> 01:37:50,427
Expecting any other Jimmys out here,
Memory Man?

1096
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:54,760
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1097
01:37:54,844 --> 01:37:57,260
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1098
01:37:57,344 --> 01:37:58,051
Well?

1099
01:38:02,178 --> 01:38:04,968
Motherfuck... Fuckin' retard!

1100
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:10,135
- Strip.
- You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1101
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:11,510
Strip!

1102
01:38:13,595 --> 01:38:16,177
My associates are not
the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1103
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:17,843
Don't say anything else.

1104
01:38:17,927 --> 01:38:20,343
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1105
01:38:22,969 --> 01:38:24,510
Cocksucker.

1106
01:38:25,595 --> 01:38:27,385
Your pants too.

1107
01:38:28,344 --> 01:38:30,302
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1108
01:38:32,386 --> 01:38:34,385
Wait.
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1109
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:38,385
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!

1110
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:41,177
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1111
01:38:41,261 --> 01:38:43,635
- Take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.

1112
01:38:44,677 --> 01:38:46,135
Then what?

1113
01:38:46,677 --> 01:38:50,343
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!

1114
01:40:20,844 --> 01:40:22,051
Sammy.

1115
01:40:28,844 --> 01:40:30,885
He said "Sammy".
How does he know about Sammy?

1116
01:40:30,969 --> 01:40:32,343
Oh, fuck.

1117
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:54,926
What have I done?

1118
01:40:56,802 --> 01:40:59,510
Mister, I need help.
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1119
01:40:59,594 --> 01:41:01,843
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.

1120
01:41:03,635 --> 01:41:05,926
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1121
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:08,218
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1122
01:41:09,052 --> 01:41:11,843
- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1123
01:41:11,927 --> 01:41:14,469
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

1124
01:41:16,011 --> 01:41:18,093
I don't remember.
I have this condition.

1125
01:41:18,178 --> 01:41:20,885
I hope it's not as serious as his,
'cause this guy's dead.

1126
01:41:20,969 --> 01:41:23,509
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

1127
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:27,135
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.

1128
01:41:27,219 --> 01:41:30,051
Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.

1129
01:41:30,136 --> 01:41:32,010
Get up. Get up.

1130
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:34,135
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1131
01:41:36,844 --> 01:41:38,885
Who is that? He knew me.

1132
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:41,593
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

1133
01:41:41,677 --> 01:41:43,718
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1134
01:41:43,802 --> 01:41:48,135
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.

1135
01:41:48,219 --> 01:41:50,634
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?

1136
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:55,010
- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1137
01:41:55,094 --> 01:41:58,551
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1138
01:41:58,635 --> 01:42:02,260
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy. I just
figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1139
01:42:02,344 --> 01:42:05,968
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1140
01:42:06,052 --> 01:42:09,343
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

1141
01:42:09,428 --> 01:42:11,968
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump.

1142
01:42:12,052 --> 01:42:14,427
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!

1143
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:17,135
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1144
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:20,593
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.

1145
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:22,801
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1146
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:25,801
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1147
01:42:26,761 --> 01:42:28,676
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1148
01:42:28,761 --> 01:42:30,801
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

1149
01:42:30,886 --> 01:42:34,010
Who cares if there's a few little details
you'd rather not remember?

1150
01:42:36,469 --> 01:42:38,801
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1151
01:42:39,594 --> 01:42:41,509
Your wife surviving the assault.

1152
01:42:42,303 --> 01:42:44,218
Her not believing your condition.

1153
01:42:44,303 --> 01:42:48,468
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1154
01:42:49,052 --> 01:42:50,343
The insulin.

1155
01:42:51,635 --> 01:42:54,343
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1156
01:42:54,427 --> 01:42:57,426
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1157
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,509
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1158
01:42:59,594 --> 01:43:02,177
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1159
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:07,302
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1160
01:43:07,386 --> 01:43:09,551
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1161
01:43:10,136 --> 01:43:12,593
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1162
01:43:12,677 --> 01:43:14,634
But I was wrong.
That's the whole point.

1163
01:43:16,303 --> 01:43:19,051
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1164
01:43:21,802 --> 01:43:24,135
<i>It was your wife who had diabetes.</i>

1165
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:31,509
Ouch.

1166
01:43:34,136 --> 01:43:35,801
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1167
01:43:36,802 --> 01:43:38,218
You sure?

1168
01:43:43,011 --> 01:43:46,135
- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.

1169
01:43:47,136 --> 01:43:50,926
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1170
01:43:51,011 --> 01:43:54,426
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.

1171
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:56,885
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1172
01:43:56,969 --> 01:43:59,135
He was to you.

1173
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:02,634
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1174
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,218
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1175
01:44:05,303 --> 01:44:07,926
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1176
01:44:08,011 --> 01:44:09,302
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1177
01:44:09,385 --> 01:44:10,843
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1178
01:44:10,927 --> 01:44:11,744
You won't remember!

1179
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,342
When it's done, I will know.
It'll be different.

1180
01:44:13,427 --> 01:44:17,342
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1181
01:44:20,136 --> 01:44:23,384
That's right. The real John G.

1182
01:44:23,469 --> 01:44:27,051
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.

1183
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,010
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.

1184
01:44:30,635 --> 01:44:33,509
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.

1185
01:44:33,594 --> 01:44:36,135
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1186
01:44:36,219 --> 01:44:39,509
I'm the one that helped you find the
other guy in your bathroom that night...

1187
01:44:39,594 --> 01:44:41,926
...the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1188
01:44:42,011 --> 01:44:44,468
We found him. You killed him.

1189
01:44:46,136 --> 01:44:51,468
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again...

1190
01:44:51,552 --> 01:44:53,801
...looking for the guy
you already killed.

1191
01:44:54,343 --> 01:44:56,093
Yeah? So who was he?

1192
01:44:56,178 --> 01:44:58,551
Just some guy.
Does it even matter who?

1193
01:44:59,302 --> 01:45:03,177
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.

1194
01:45:04,385 --> 01:45:08,135
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1195
01:45:09,302 --> 01:45:13,093
But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1196
01:45:13,677 --> 01:45:15,634
But it didn't stick.

1197
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:18,468
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.

1198
01:45:23,136 --> 01:45:27,760
I took that picture...
just when you did it.

1199
01:45:29,761 --> 01:45:31,676
Look how happy you are.

1200
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:34,760
I wanted to see that face again.

1201
01:45:34,844 --> 01:45:37,634
- Gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.

1202
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:41,468
I gave you a reason to live,
and you were more than happy to help.

1203
01:45:41,552 --> 01:45:45,718
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.

1204
01:45:45,802 --> 01:45:47,760
Like your police file.

1205
01:45:48,594 --> 01:45:51,593
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

1206
01:45:51,677 --> 01:45:54,218
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1207
01:45:54,302 --> 01:45:58,010
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1208
01:45:58,094 --> 01:46:00,010
You know how many towns?

1209
01:46:00,094 --> 01:46:02,259
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?

1210
01:46:02,343 --> 01:46:04,384
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

1211
01:46:04,469 --> 01:46:07,718
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1212
01:46:07,802 --> 01:46:10,676
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1213
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:11,801
Cheer up.

1214
01:46:11,886 --> 01:46:14,634
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.

1215
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:20,426
All you do is moan.

1216
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:22,843
I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.

1217
01:46:22,927 --> 01:46:24,634
I'm the one that put it all together.

1218
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,384
You wander around, you're playing detective.
You're living a dream, kid.

1219
01:46:29,469 --> 01:46:33,551
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

1220
01:46:33,635 --> 01:46:36,968
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1221
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:41,426
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1222
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:44,509
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1223
01:46:48,052 --> 01:46:50,801
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

1224
01:46:50,886 --> 01:46:52,968
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1225
01:46:54,969 --> 01:46:56,093
Fuck.

1226
01:47:06,177 --> 01:47:07,301
I'm not a killer.

1227
01:47:08,594 --> 01:47:11,135
I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.

1228
01:47:17,177 --> 01:47:19,551
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1229
01:47:36,761 --> 01:47:40,134
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1230
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,134
You think I just want
another puzzle to solve?

1231
01:47:56,969 --> 01:47:59,134
Another John G. to look for?

1232
01:48:00,343 --> 01:48:02,217
You're a John G.

1233
01:48:03,927 --> 01:48:06,010
So you can be my John G.

1234
01:48:14,469 --> 01:48:16,593
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1235
01:48:17,886 --> 01:48:19,634
In your case, Teddy...

1236
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:22,676
...yes, I will.

1237
01:48:35,802 --> 01:48:37,885
Hey, that's not your car!

1238
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:40,551
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1239
01:48:40,635 --> 01:48:43,551
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1240
01:48:43,635 --> 01:48:45,342
Somebody'll recognize it!

1241
01:48:46,802 --> 01:48:49,885
I think I'd rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

1242
01:48:50,844 --> 01:48:53,342
I might hang on to this for a while.

1243
01:48:54,177 --> 01:48:55,468
Lenny.

1244
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:00,010
Will you help me find the keys?

1245
01:49:00,093 --> 01:49:01,843
Help me find my keys.

1246
01:49:24,093 --> 01:49:27,384
I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1247
01:49:27,469 --> 01:49:29,634
I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning...

1248
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:31,676
...even if I can't remember them.

1249
01:49:33,844 --> 01:49:36,509
I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed...

1250
01:49:36,594 --> 01:49:38,676
...the world's still here.

1251
01:49:39,886 --> 01:49:42,301
Do I believe the world's still here?

1252
01:49:45,218 --> 01:49:46,801
Is it still out there?

1253
01:49:50,635 --> 01:49:51,634
Yeah.

1254
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,801
We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.

1255
01:49:59,135 --> 01:50:00,843
I'm no different.

1256
01:50:14,135 --> 01:50:15,925
Now, where was I?
