1
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,417
Wake Island is a tiny dot
in the midst of the Pacific,

2
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,504
4,254 air miles from San Francisco.

3
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,092
Until 1941, it was known only as a stepping
stone for the Pan American Clippers.

4
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,803
In June of that year,
the United States Marines landed.

5
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,930
Present arms!

6
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,524
By the end of October, 1941,
they had made progress.

7
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,819
Six five-inch naval guns like these
had been emplaced.

8
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,531
In addition, they had 12 mobile
three-inch antiaircraft guns.

9
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:22,494
A squadron of 12 Grumann F4F3's,
nicknamed "wildcats," were based at Wake.

10
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,708
And the 385 officers and men of the First
Defense Battalion, United States Marine Corps...

11
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,628
were constantly on the alert,
patrolling the skies daily.

12
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,394
Left shoulder arms!

13
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,106
Right shoulder arms! Late in 1941,
Headquarters Marine Corps...

14
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,401
assigned a new commanding officer
to this tiny garrison. To the rear, march!

15
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:59,029
Major Geoffirey Caton.
Long and active.

16
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,826
In Pearl Harbor on a November morning,
Major Caton makes his farewells.

17
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,413
With the compliments
of your daughter, sir.

18
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,416
Well! Say, this is something.

19
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,418
Open it.

20
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,005
"To Daddy from Cynthia,
November, 1941."

21
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,799
It cost me an awful lot
of money. I'll bet it did.

22
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,510
Practically all my savings.

23
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,931
You know, you are getting a little thin.
Better catch up on your ice cream sodas.

24
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,392
Thanks, Daddy.
I'll be gone a long time.

25
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,229
Thanks a lot!
Well, what goes with thanks?

26
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,192
Where is this old
Wake Island, anyhow?

27
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,404
Oh, it's just a little strip of sand
with a lot of water around it.

28
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,616
Good-byes are awful, aren't they?

29
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
Well, you let yourself in for a lot of them
when you married a marine.

30
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,912
I know.

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,416
What, again? I'd feel like this if
you were going away overnight.

32
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,211
Next time I leave,
I'm gonna bring a bucket.

33
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,797
Here's where I leave ya.
Good-bye.

34
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,925
Good-bye.
Thanks for showin' me the town.

35
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,802
Aloha nui kako.
Oh, save it till I come back.

36
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,805
Here. Thanks, Charlie.

37
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,421
Mr. McCloskey!

38
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,800
Mr. McCloskey!

39
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,595
Good morning.
Oh. Morning.

40
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,306
I don't suppose you got
a bar on this boat.

41
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,392
Can't even offer you
a cold shower.

42
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,603
Have we got there yet? No.
We won't be in for some time.

43
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,314
Would you like
to slick up a little?

44
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,192
Look, General, you're a soldier
and I'm a civilian.

45
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,529
I got a government contract
with a mighty important job to do,

46
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,490
but there's not one word in it
about takin' orders from brass hats.

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,409
That goes for suggestions
about shavin' too.

48
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,996
Call me when we get there.
That's all I want from you.

49
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,502
Let me take another look
at our future home.

50
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,019
Yes, sir, I can see 'em
in my mind's eye...

51
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,523
Big ones, little ones...
All guzzlin' and gruntin"...

52
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,525
and puttin 'on weight.

53
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,528
Yes, sir. Hundreds of 'em.
Hundreds of which?

54
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,698
Hogs.

55
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,700
Yes, sir.

56
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,120
That's what the ex-wrestling champ of
the Pacific Fleet has finally decided on.

57
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,122
Outta this outfit and into hogs.

58
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,208
That's me.
Last week it was turkeys.

59
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,628
Turks is out.
I just read a book.

60
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,090
Turks has got 249 pages
of diseases.

61
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,511
There she goes.
The old Clipper.

62
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,729
Ya great big beautiful
sweetheart, you.

63
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,814
A week, and I'll be aboard one of them.

64
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:25,110
Mr. Aloysius K. Randall,
United States citizen, tourist deluxe.

65
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,822
Monkeys like you
don't rate no Clippers.

66
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,824
Well, I got the dough,
and I got the old man's say-so.

67
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,118
Don't you worry, bub.
I'll be on it, all right.

68
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,207
Hey, look, Smacksie. Right here I got 10
bucks, and I'm gonna bet you the whole...

69
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,710
Where at did you ever get
10 bucks? I got it, all right.

70
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,296
And right now that 10 bucks
is sayin' that you don't leave.

71
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,091
'Cause why?
'Cause you'll ship over, that's why.

72
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,928
Ahhh. A float!

73
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,223
For me.

74
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh, boy! One of them
hammer and sickles!

75
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,821
Let me have a look at it!
Get your hands away.

76
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,197
I seen it first!
Yeah, well, I got it first!

77
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,701
Gimme that!
Let go!

78
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,329
Why, you baboon-faced, no-good...

79
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,999
You see, you left yourself
wide open for an arm lock.

80
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,186
I don't wanna hear any of that wrestling talk!
I just wanna punch you right in the nose!

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,628
Okay. There it is. Go ahead.
All right!

82
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,715
Chow.

83
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,093
Come on, Skipper! Come on!

84
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,518
Hey, you two. Just a minute.

85
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,729
What have you two guys been
up to? We were swimmin', Sarge.

86
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,108
Swimmin'? Yeah. You owe
me a medal. I just saved his life.

87
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,611
That bugler saved yours,
pal. All right, all right. Get in the line.

88
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,617
Here we go.
Good old stew.

89
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,122
What do you think I am?
A canary?

90
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,208
Move on, my friend.
All right, wise guy.

91
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,271
One of these days you're going to find out
what I got these two stripes for.

92
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,423
Heil!
Who said that?

93
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,427
Somebody around here's a wise guy.

94
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,928
Only one of these days
I'm going to catch up with him, see,

95
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,893
and he's going to find out that just because my
name is Goebbels, that doesn't make me a heinie.

96
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,105
My folks was Holland Dutch, and if anybody
doesn't think so, all he's got to do is speak up.

97
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,025
Do you understand?
But I didn't say anything, Corporal.

98
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,821
Maybe you did and maybe you didn't. Anyway,
I'm warning you.

99
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,492
Heil!
Who said that?

100
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,121
Heil!

101
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,501
Who said that?

102
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,421
Don't let 'em get you so hot, Corp.
You'll spoil your chow.

103
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,596
All right, Corporal.
Sit down and eat.

104
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,015
Sparks! Where have you been?

105
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,018
Just got off duty.
Oh, I got some hot news for you.

106
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,395
The new C. will be here in
an hour. What's his name?

107
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,524
Caton. Caton? Must
be Artillery Caton.

108
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,318
That guy eats 'em alive.
Tough, huh?

109
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,530
He had me in and outta the brig
so much, I wore it out.

110
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,408
Boys, the honeymoon's over.
From now on, you're marines.

111
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,196
Hello, Jeff. How are you,
Johnson? Glad to see you.

112
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,198
Have a good trip?
Fine, thank you.

113
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,324
Well, nice to see you again.
Thank you.

114
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,120
Our commanding officer,
Commander Roberts, Major Caton.

115
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,498
Reporting, sir. Major, we're glad
to have you share our exile with us.

116
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,792
Thank you, sir.
Nielson of Pan American.

117
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,919
How do you do, sir?
Parkman, our doctor.

118
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,004
Play bridge, Major?
I play at it, sir.

119
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,006
Certainly need new blood, sir.
Thanks.

120
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,008
Patrick, our squadron commander.
Happy to know you, sir.

121
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,010
And this is... I know the major.

122
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,513
Hello, Lewis. How are you? Captain Patrick, I
brought you a new man... Lieutenant Cameron.

123
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,515
Bruce Cameron?
Yes, sir.

124
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,836
Come along, Patrick. I'll
introduce you. I know his father.

125
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,812
Right, sir.
Excuse us.

126
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,024
Excuse us, Mr. Nielson. There's a
guard waiting for the major. Certainly.

127
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,194
Guard, front!

128
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,990
Guard, face front!

129
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,911
Present arms!

130
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,128
Lower arms!

131
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,131
Left face!

132
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,927
Right shoulder arms!

133
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,930
Forward march!

134
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,015
Mr. McCloskey?
Yeah.

135
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,893
I'm Hogan. Pete Hogan.
Your foreman. How are ya?

136
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:11,022
I'm glad there's somebody here to meet me,
although I know I don't rate no fancy parade.

137
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,608
Well, if I'd thought of it, I'd have had some
of our boys lined up for you... with shovels.

138
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,904
How you been making out? Oh,
fair to middlin', Mr. McCloskey.

139
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,615
Built quarters for the men and
spotted some of the ground work.

140
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,117
Maybe not as much as you'd expect, but
we've sorta been waitin' around for you.

141
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:29,206
I'll take a look at what you've done, then I'd like
to meet the crew and get acquainted. All right.

142
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,292
And you've gotta get
that excavating finished.

143
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,711
You better work three shifts.
I wanna start pouring concrete by Thursday.

144
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,090
Oh, that'll be tough.
Maybe so. Do it anyway.

145
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,009
I've never been late with a contract yet,
not even a government one,

146
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,512
and I'm not gonna start in
on this bird sanctuary.

147
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,722
Mr. McCloskey.
Yes?

148
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,602
So the major wants me
to have dinner with him.

149
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,397
Tell him I'm too busy.
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,899
That's another thing.
You guys have probably noticed...

151
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,318
this sand pile is stiff with brass hats
trying to play soldier.

152
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,198
If any of 'em get in your hair,
tell 'em to come see me. That's all.

153
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,303
Good morning, dear.

154
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,892
The next time I get a furlough, I'm gonna
hire a bugler to blow reveille for me.

155
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,895
Why? 'Cause when he sounds off,
I'm gonna get up,

156
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,314
beat his brains out,
then go back to sleep.

157
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,608
Buglers ain't got no brains.

158
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,819
Comin' from you,
that's somethin'.

159
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,823
I'm glad I don't have to take
that guff from you much longer.

160
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,326
Seven more days, and all
you'll see is my tail feathers.

161
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,620
I still got that 10 bucks,
and it still says you don't leave.

162
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,790
Do you really
wanna lose 10 bucks?

163
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,626
Put up or shut up.
Okay.

164
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,715
There.

165
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,593
It's a bet. Wait a minute.
Where's your dough?

166
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,595
I got it, all right.
Don't worry.

167
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,431
Let me see it. It's very dangerous
to leave money lyin' around here.

168
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,600
The captain's holding it for me.

169
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,604
Oh, so you don't trust me, huh?

170
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,905
Well, look what we have here.

171
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,323
Well, bless their
sleepy little heads.

172
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,994
Maybe we been talking too loud.
Yeah. Shh.

173
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,713
I hope they can swim.

174
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,800
Attention!

175
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,514
What's this, Sergeant?
That's no way to camouflage a gun.

176
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,226
Whose is it?
Mine, sir.

177
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,312
How long have you been in the marines,
son? Six months, sir.

178
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,898
That's long enough to know better.

179
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,194
That's Artillery Caton, all right.
Snoopin' around this early, huh?

180
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,530
Things used to be so nice here.

181
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,410
Attention!

182
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,626
This is it.

183
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,629
All of it?
All of it.

184
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,425
You could hardly call it
Gibraltar, could you?

185
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,720
Twenty-one feet
at its highest elevation.

186
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,225
And in any sort of a breeze,
my friend, it all shakes.

187
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,395
Well, sir, if the navy has survived,
I guess the marines can.

188
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,729
You know, commander,

189
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,192
my outfit's supposed to be
a defense battalion.

190
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,697
I don't see much to defend here. As a
matter of fact, not much to defend it with.

191
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,407
Only marines.

192
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,828
Well, now that you've landed,
you'd better get the situation in hand.

193
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,707
We will, sir. Starting straightaway.
I have an inspection in 10 minutes.

194
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,001
All right. Let's shove off.
Right.

195
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,591
You look better than Joe, Skipper.

196
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,390
Inspection, 10 minutes.

197
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,519
Listen, slap-happy, you'd better cut out
the spring song and stand by for inspection.

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,898
Why, that ain't spring, Sarge.
That's love.

199
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:26,027
Trouble with that guy, he ain't got no finer
instincts. That's how you get to be a sergeant.

200
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,698
The dumber them guys are,
the more stripes they give 'em.

201
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,824
You oughta look like a zebra.

202
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,912
Always got an answer, ain't ya?

203
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,122
Hey, hey! What's that thing?

204
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,708
That ain't no thing.
It's a dame.

205
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,919
Could be.

206
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,213
You got it upside-down. There.

207
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:49,007
I like it better this way. Listen, soldier.
When you act disrespectful about her,

208
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,304
you're actin' disrespectful about the dame
what's practically Mrs. Aloysius K. Randall.

209
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,807
And I don't like it, see.
Why, you thick-headed clunk.

210
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,602
You mean to tell me you're thinkin'
about gettin' married?

211
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,317
You mean to tell me you've found
a dame that would marry you?

212
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,820
The nuptials is bein' performed
New Year's mornin'.

213
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,406
Besides, dumber lookin' clunks
than me get married.

214
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,493
Name one.
Well...

215
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,619
Why, you... Get your...

216
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,915
Hey, come on, you guys! Inspection.

217
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,209
Saved by the bugle again.
Saved from what?

218
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,420
From this.

219
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,797
Oh, there they go again.
Aw, fellas, look!

220
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,092
Come on. Cut it out!
You're gonna get us in a jam again.

221
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,593
Act your age, will ya?
You'll get us in more trouble!

222
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,721
Get away!

223
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,900
Attention!
Straighten up here.

224
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,113
- Who's responsible for this?
- Me, sir.

225
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,491
Who are these men, Sergeant?
Privates Randall and Doyle, sir.

226
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,203
Haven't we met before?
Yes, sir. China Station, sir.

227
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,623
I suppose you've already discovered,
Randall, that we have no brig here.

228
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,625
Yes, sir.

229
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,211
You know, I haven't got much
faith in brigs, anyway. No, sir.

230
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,796
Putting a marine in the brig
is a waste of good manpower.

231
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,717
That's right, sir. I'll see these
men in the morning, Sergeant.

232
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,219
In the meantime,
I'll try and think of some way...

233
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:19,390
of diverting your surplus energy
into more useful and constructive channels.

234
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,018
Yes, sir.

235
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,605
I don't like the sound of that
"constructive channels" stuff.

236
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,609
No, sir. Aw, what am I sayin'?

237
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:46,292
Hey, if this is a sample of Caton's
constructive channels, give me the brig.

238
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,794
What are we diggin' here, anyway?
A slit trench.

239
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,006
Huh?
Bomb shelter for air raids.

240
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,300
What bombs and which air raids?

241
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,311
- What's on your mind, pal?
- Oh, nothing.

242
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,023
I was just wondering what would happen
if marines had to do a good day's work.

243
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,320
What do you suppose they give you
for bustin' a civilian?

244
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,614
In self-defense?
Naw, just bustin' him.

245
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,200
With or without provocation?
Both.

246
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,620
For bustin' a guy like that, I guess
they'd give you the Medal of Honor.

247
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,497
Come on. Back to nature.

248
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,510
Hey, what's happened here?

249
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,719
Pete just passed out.
Too much sun.

250
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,307
Get him over to the hospital. I'll take charge
while you get another man for the tractor.

251
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,309
Okay, Mac.

252
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,118
Hey, what is this? Hogan!

253
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,790
Hey, Hogan!

254
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,292
What goes on?
Orders, Mr. McCloskey.

255
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,504
Whose orders? For what?
Civilian air raid drill. Here. Here it is.

256
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,217
<i>"Approach of enemy aircraft will be
signaled by long blast on claxon horn.</i>

257
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,011
All civilian workers
will thereupon take cover."”

258
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,597
Where'd you get that?
Major Caton's office.

259
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,394
Major Caton! Well, I might as well
shake that guy out of my hair right now.

260
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,022
It's my job to keep those men out there
working and the machinery rolling.

261
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:36,526
If they're gonna run in the bushes every time a brass hat
toots a horn, I'm gonna wind up behind the eight ball.

262
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,029
The responsibility for the life of every
man on this island is invested in us.

263
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,908
In times like these,
air raid drill is necessary.

264
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,620
In times like these, it's necessary
for you guys to let me get my job finished.

265
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,998
We're just as anxious as you are
for you to finish your job.

266
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,711
Right. Then quit stampedin' my men with
that peewee auto horn and let me get to it!

267
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,214
Everybody must participate
in the air raid drill.

268
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,301
There will be no exceptions.
So it's a must, is it?

269
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,303
Exactly.

270
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,307
Well, General, the first man of mine that
ducks in the bushes when the horn blows...

271
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,810
is gonna get a two-by-four
over his head.

272
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,229
Mr. McCloskey!

273
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,694
Sir, I'm going to give you
a bit of advice.

274
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,406
Orders from the United States
Navy Department will be obeyed!

275
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,723
In trouble?

276
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,018
Yes, and I want you guys
to push me out.

277
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,603
Did I hear right?

278
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,191
- Yeah. But it ain't right.
- Come on. Get up outta there.

279
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,110
On your way, bubble puss,
or I'll pat ya with me shovel.

280
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,196
Are you gonna come out peacefully,
or do I have to drag you out?

281
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,117
You start swingin' right now, bud.
I'll be with you in a second.

282
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,411
No, no,
no. This one's mine. I'll flip you for it.

283
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,206
- Well, okay.
- Hurry up. Make up your mind. I got work to do.

284
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,625
Call it.
Heads.

285
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:19,213
Tails. Candy from a baby.

286
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,928
You ain't doin' so good,
Joey boy.

287
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,889
Well, the sun got in my eyes.
Yeah, I heard it hit.

288
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,400
Time was, Joe,
when you hit a guy, he stayed hit.

289
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,113
That's it, Joe. Attaboy.
Break his legs off!

290
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,204
What are you wavin' at him for?
Grab a hold of him!

291
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,920
Watch it, Joe. The old man.

292
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,392
What's that truck doing here?

293
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,103
Well, sir, uh,
just passing through, sir.

294
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,230
Whose is it?

295
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,190
It's mine.

296
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,696
Oh, Mr. McCloskey.
Had an accident?

297
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:31,493
Yes, I had an accident, all right.
I tripped. Why?

298
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,413
Well,
can I be of any assistance? No.

299
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,417
Carry on.

300
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,803
From Commander Roberts, sir.

301
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,019
"Special Japanese envoy
will arrive on the Clipper.”

302
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:04,692
Gentlemen,
it is my great privilege...

303
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:09,198
to propose a toast
to that great executive...

304
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,908
of your great democracy...

305
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,829
whose lasting peace
it is my country's...

306
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,916
greatest wish to preserve.

307
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,627
Gentlemen, I give you...

308
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,090
the president of the United States,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

309
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,092
Hear, hear!
Thank you.

310
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,304
Gentlemen, I give you
His Imperial Majesty,

311
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,890
Emperor Hirohito of Japan.

312
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,693
As you all know,
I am on my way to Washington.

313
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,406
With me I carry
a message from my emperor...

314
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,326
to the president of your country.

315
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,330
Gentlemen,
it is a message of peace.

316
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,795
I regret very much to say...

317
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,590
that between my people
and your people...

318
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,011
there have been some
small misunderstandings.

319
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,306
But it is, therefore,
my emperor's desire...

320
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,520
that I show to your president
the heart of the Japanese people.

321
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,814
And I do solemnly swear...

322
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:29,820
that in that heart he will find
no thought of war...

323
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,324
but, rather, a yearning
for lasting peace.

324
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,827
Therefore, gentlemen,

325
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:42,124
I ask that you wish me Godspeed.

326
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:17,200
On this clear and peaceful
Sunday morning, December ♪, 1941,

327
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,496
as countless thousands of you
are enjoying the security of your homes,

328
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,792
a great drama of U.S. Japanese relations
is moving swiftly to a climax.

329
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,710
In the State Department,
at this precise moment,

330
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,588
Mr. Cordell Hull is receiving
for a final interview...

331
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,802
Ambassador Nomura and
Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu of Japan.

332
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,304
It is understood that
Special Envoy Kurusu...

333
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,306
has brought with him
Emperor Hirohito's reply...

334
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,602
to President Roosevelt's note protesting
Japan's aggression in the Far East.

335
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,023
This morning Envoy Kurusu stated
that his emperor's message would,

336
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,692
he was confident,
solve the Pacific problem.

337
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,612
So today, for the first time
in many anxious months,

338
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:58,407
a new note of optimism and hope
marks the tempo of the Washington scene.

339
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,412
Why don't you quit listenin' to
that guff? Get somethin' romantic.

340
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,208
Myrtle, honey, I'm on my way.

341
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,002
So you're really gonna go, huh?
Yep.

342
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh, and by the way,
you owe me 10 bucks.

343
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,926
You haven't left yet. I ain't dressed
up for no Sunday morning inspection.

344
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,929
One look at you in that outfit,
and the old man'll throw the book at you.

345
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,390
Well, I got his permission,
see, Mr. Smart Guy.

346
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,519
Mr. Randall Caton says,
"You are now a gentleman of leisure.

347
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,523
And if you wish to travel in formal
attire," he says, "it's okay by me."

348
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,402
Mr. Aloysius K. Randall, Esquire,
back in circulation.

349
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,696
How do you like that?

350
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,121
Hey, what's your hurry?

351
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,206
The Clipper doesn't leave
just this minute.

352
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:51,295
Well, I'm gonna have Sparks radio Myrtle
to lay in a supply of orange blossoms.

353
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,512
World, here I come!

354
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:13,400
Any of you guys don't like this hat, you
can come out here and try to knock it off.

355
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,320
That includes you.
I think you're beautiful.

356
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,614
Go on. On your way, civilian.

357
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,700
Hey, Smacksie.

358
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,788
Hey, Sparks.
Yeah?

359
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,501
How do you spell "nuptials"?
Nuptials? ♪♪-U-P-♪...

360
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,216
N-U-P-T. Yeah.
What else? Shut up!

361
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,928
Well,
you don't have to eat my head off. Shut up!

362
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,014
What's the matter with you?
Your wife havin' triplets or somethin'?

363
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,226
The Japs just attacked Honolulu.
Bombed Pearl Harbor.

364
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,312
Holy smokes!

365
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,895
Everything all set, Probenzki?

366
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,525
You know, Lieutenant, airplanes,
they are for sure like women...

367
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,611
Sometimes good, sometimes bad,
sometimes you... you can't tell.

368
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,116
Well, I'll take a chance on this one.
You're the best mechanic I've ever met.

369
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,118
Thank you.
You're Russian, aren't you?

370
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,703
No, Lieutenant. Polish.

371
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,916
A Pole, huh? What on earth
got you into the Marine Corps?

372
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,920
Well, I had my wife
and two children.

373
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,089
They were in Warsaw.

374
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,217
Ready on number five.
Number five all set.

375
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,594
You must be glad, Lieutenant,
you are not married.

376
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,515
Probenzki,
my wife's at Pearl Harbor.

377
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,119
Everything in order, gentlemen? I
was just hearing the doctor's plans, sir.

378
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,123
Emergency stations have been set up at all key
positions, sir. Very good. How about you, Patrick?

379
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,792
Four planes in the air, sir.
The other eight in reserve.

380
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,211
There'll always be four
aloft? That's right, sir.

381
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,714
What have you been able
to do about the civilians?

382
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,217
I've ordered them to take cover in the
slit trenches wherever possible. Good.

383
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,928
I'd like to see those stations,
Doctor. Aye, aye, sir.

384
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,807
That blasted air raid alarm again! It's
got my men running around like gophers!

385
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,519
The major will take care of you,
McCloskey. That's the man I want to see!

386
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,315
You got a piece of paper?

387
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,610
You can have my resignation.
You wanna run my job? Well, run it.

388
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:06,114
I'm afraid that won't be quite practical at
the moment for either one of us, McCloskey.

389
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,993
<i>Why not? The laps have
just bombed Pearl Harbor.</i>

390
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,624
Say that again. The Japs
have just bombed Pearl Harbor.

391
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,628
The Pan American Clipper will take off as
soon as Commander Roberts deems it advisable,

392
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,797
and there'll be
a place on it for you.

393
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:25,217
In the meantime, find yourself
some shelter and stay out of the way.

394
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,720
All right, Patrick. I'll take a
look at your situation. Yes, sir.

395
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,818
Hiya, guys.

396
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,196
Hey, Johnny, don't look now,
but I think we got a fifth columnist.

397
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,617
Naw, he ain't no fifth columnist.
Not with that hat, he ain't.

398
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,912
Run along, sonny. No tramps,
agents or peddlers allowed.

399
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,916
Aw, lay off me, will ya, fellas? I was
just passin' time till the Clipper leaves.

400
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,626
I was wonderin' how your new
partner was makin' out, Joey.

401
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,712
Don't worry about me.
I'm doin' all right.

402
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,799
Yeah? Well, pick up that ammunition chest,
then. Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

403
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,428
All right, Randall.
On your way. On your way.

404
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,306
Are you speakin' to me? Yeah,
I'm speakin' to you. On your way.

405
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,601
Beat it, gyrene, before I take a poke
at that thing you call a face!

406
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,313
You're talkin' to a civilian, see!
Well, that's just it, buddy.

407
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,524
Civilians in the slit trenches.
Major Caton's orders.

408
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,818
On your way.

409
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,028
Take good care of that
civilian, Sarge.

410
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,116
And don't let nothin' happen
to that elegant hat!

411
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,202
Enemy planes!

412
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,626
Enemy planes sighted!
Enemy planes bearing southwest!

413
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,524
So you stopped playin' soldier.
Yeah, and look what it got me.

414
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,693
Into the trench there!

415
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,416
I have Lieutenant Cameron now, sir.

416
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,090
Enemy fight attack with force.
Twenty-four planes.

417
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,925
Twenty-four planes.
Attack as you see fit.

418
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,302
Roger. Wilco.

419
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,304
Four against 24.

420
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,101
Just our luck they'd be
on the south leg of the patrol.

421
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:25,897
3-5-0.

422
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,692
25,000.

423
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,206
We need that mortar.
Come on. Let's get it! Okay.

424
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,292
Sprint!

425
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,023
Get to Caton! See if he
can spare a fire detail!

426
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,026
Aye, sir.

427
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,326
Stretcher bearers!
Stretcher bearers!

428
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,796
What are you laughin' at?

429
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,924
Smacksie's hat.
Here he comes!

430
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,914
Prepare to engage.
Prepare to engage.

431
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,418
Prepare to engage. Roger.

432
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,189
All right, boys.
This is where we get off.

433
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,693
- Back home now.
- Starboard 1-8-0.

434
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,790
- Parker?
- Everything's all right, Major.

435
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,428
Reporting, sir.

436
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:57,020
This is the room where we entertained
those peace boys, isn't it?

437
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,022
Yes, sir.

438
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,901
Seems like a long time ago.

439
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:07,113
Doesn't it?
Yes, sir.

440
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:14,120
I take back that toast I gave
to His Imperial Majesty.

441
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,002
Major.

442
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,427
Squadron communication.
Squadron communication.

443
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,512
Go ahead.

444
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,598
Reporting from Peel, sir.

445
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,809
Lots of near misses, but
the Clipper wasn't damaged, sir.

446
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,811
That's some help, anyhow.

447
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,111
Orderly!
Yes, sir?

448
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,991
Advise Dr. Parkman it'll be necessary to evacuate
his emergency hospital as soon as possible.

449
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,495
Aye, aye, sir.
Hello, Lewis, Patrick.

450
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,413
We've got to get Dr. Parkman
and his people underground.

451
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,210
This has been a checkerboard bombing, and that
sort of stuff is no respecter of hospitals.

452
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,713
Lewis, suppose you pick a good
spot and detail a work party.

453
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,800
Aye, sir. Patrick,
how'd you make out with your outfit?

454
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,302
Twenty-three wounded,
seven Killed, sir.

455
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,515
Seven planes out of commission. All the
oil and gasoline on the field destroyed.

456
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,517
Even the big tanks?
That's right, sir.

457
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,603
That's not so good. How did the
defense battalion make out, sir?

458
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,897
Not bad, considering
the strafing we got.

459
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,525
You'll have to admit they did
a pretty thorough job of it.

460
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,695
With mathematical precision,
square yard by square yard.

461
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,490
When they attack again, I have the feeling
they won't bomb the same square twice.

462
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,911
So it's up to us to move our guns, equipment
and supplies to the areas already bombed.

463
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,206
I suggest you follow the same
procedure with your planes. Aye, aye, sir.

464
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,293
Patrick! You and your lads have
done a fine job. We're proud of you.

465
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,420
Thank you, sir.
Keep pitching.

466
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,923
Aye,
sir. Captain Gordon of the Clipper, sir.

467
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,718
Oh, come in, Captain. My
name's Caton. How do you do, sir?

468
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,512
Sorry we had to meet under
such unpleasant circumstances.

469
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,755
You about ready to take off?
With your permission, sir.

470
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:01,227
I don't see anything to hold you, unless our Japanese
friends pay us another visit before you get away.

471
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,105
All your passengers aboard? They should be
by now, sir. They were boarding when I left.

472
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,026
Well, good luck and happy
landings. Thank you, sir.

473
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,320
Here, Skipper.

474
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,116
Here, Skip.

475
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,410
Come on, girl.

476
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,912
Skipper, where are you?

477
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,122
Here, Skip.

478
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,709
Skipper. Skipper, you in there?

479
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,919
Come on. Come on.
Get on the Clipper.

480
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,423
You ain't seen that dog
around anyplace, have you?

481
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,009
Never mind the dog. Get going. That's
funny. I ain't seen her since the attack.

482
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,572
Listen, you big dope! The Clipper's
waiting. You're holding up the parade.

483
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,889
Don't crowd me, will ya!

484
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,570
Get on that Clipper and get on it fast. That's
an order. I'll get on when I'm good and ready.

485
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,104
And don't you give me no orders.
I'm a civilian, see!

486
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,316
Bill, Joe, come here.

487
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,696
Take this civilian
and toss him aboard the Clipper.

488
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,200
Go on, get going.

489
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,328
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Come on, boys.

490
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,998
Come and get it.
Come on.

491
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,001
According to facts given me
by Corporal Goebbels, sir,

492
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,272
the accused refused to get aboard the Clipper,
spoke disrespectful to Corporal Goebbels...

493
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,092
and assaulted First Class Privates Bennett and
Richmond, causing them grievous bodily harm.

494
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:17,428
To say nothing of what he did to me,
sir. Silence, Corporal.

495
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,889
Well, Randall, what have you
got to say for yourself?

496
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,519
Well, sir... It's these clothes,
sir. What?

497
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,897
Well, since I've been wearing them,
I don't seem to have no control.

498
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,899
Control?
Over my emotions.

499
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,488
Randall, if my memory
serves me correctly,

500
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,698
weren't you before me on
a similar charge back in Shanghai?

501
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,827
- - No, sir.
- No?

502
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,122
No, sir. That time it was the captain
of that Italian gunboat.

503
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,417
Remember, the... the one
with the long whiskers?

504
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,713
Oh, yes, I remember now.

505
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,716
- You did a pretty good job on him.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

506
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:03,724
Uh, sir, if it's all the same to you, I'd
like to make the same request I made then.

507
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,893
To ship over?
Yes, sir.

508
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,105
Randall, as man to man,
I congratulate you on your decision.

509
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,107
But as your commanding officer,
I can tell you now...

510
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,902
Since the beginning of hostilities,
you've never been out.

511
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,029
You're a marine
for the duration.

512
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,699
If you'd gotten aboard the Clipper,
they would have told you.

513
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,826
Now I have a request to make.
Yes, sir?

514
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,495
Burn that dogcatcher's outfit
and get back into your uniform!

515
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,789
Sergeant, post him for duty.
That's all.

516
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,293
Left face. Left face!
Forward march!

517
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,422
That's all, Corporal.

518
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,304
Mr. Hogan, sir.
Oh, hello, Hogan.

519
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,805
Hello, Major.
I've brought my report.

520
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,891
Not so good.

521
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,727
Any further instructions?

522
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,312
No.

523
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,691
Just tell the rest of your men
to stay under cover, what's left of it.

524
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,902
We'll get it again.
How soon? I don't know.

525
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,614
Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, did your
Mr. McCloskey get off on the Clipper?

526
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,908
As far as I know.

527
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,994
Oh, so you didn't leave after all?
Thought I was gonna run out on you?

528
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,289
Well... Well, I was,
but I changed my mind.

529
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,793
McCloskey,

530
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,588
I'm glad you're staying.
Why?

531
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,715
We need a man like you.
Good.

532
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,219
Give me a gun.
No.

533
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:24,222
You can be more valuable than that.
What do I do?

534
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,600
Dig. Dig holes, lots of them,

535
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,728
revetments for our planes,
shelter trenches.

536
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,522
You'd better start
by digging a big one...

537
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,114
One big enough to hold all the
casualties in our emergency hospital.

538
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,408
Consider it done.

539
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:14,021
Hard at it? Running out of spare parts,
sir, so we're rolling our own.

540
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:18,192
Just thought I'd drop in,
see how you were doing.

541
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,902
Oh, Major Caton.
Orderly brought a signal over for you.

542
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,905
Thank you.

543
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,703
How's the rest of the world doing?

544
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,788
Not so good.

545
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,419
Cameron.
Yes, sir?

546
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,804
Sit down.

547
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:53,519
Cameron, I've got some bad news.
Yeah, I heard about it, sir.

548
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:57,315
What? You mean about Commander Roberts.
I've heard he's in pretty bad shape.

549
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:02,194
It's not the commander. It's your wife. She
was Killed in the bombing at Pearl Harbor.

550
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,591
I know there's nothing I can say
that will comfort you.

551
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,805
You know, Cameron,
memories are funny things.

552
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,807
They mold a man.

553
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,727
From the time a man
can remember,

554
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:39,190
his main memories are
those given to him by women...

555
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,902
His mother, his sisters,

556
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,030
his first sweetheart,

557
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,324
his wife.

558
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,618
Even those women
he might like to forget,

559
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,121
even they give him memories
that might help sometime.

560
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,294
No, there's nothing I can say
that will comfort you.

561
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,716
You're like me now...
A man with a memory,

562
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,927
But we're not alone.

563
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:12,223
In this war, in any part of the world
wherever they've dropped a stick of bombs,

564
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,600
they've made thousands like us...

565
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,396
Men without wives,
without children,

566
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,191
without a single thing
they've ever loved or held dear.

567
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,612
And for those men,
there's a job to do... to fight,

568
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,989
fight with guns and bayonets
and tanks...

569
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,825
and ships and planes.

570
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,996
Fight to destroy... destruction.

571
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,126
We've got to destroy destruction.

572
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,711
That's our job, Bruce.

573
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,613
Enemy fleet approaching.
Some destroyers, light cruisers.

574
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:14,118
Troop ships. Possible submarines.

575
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,707
1-3-0 true.

576
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,921
<i>1-♪-0-0-0.</i>

577
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,926
<i>1-♪-0-0-0.</i>

578
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,222
About 10 miles. Looks like they
have no intention of stopping.

579
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,725
That's our job.
Sir?

580
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,609
I'm going to try and pull
an old Chinese trick.

581
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,612
Talker.
Yes, sir?

582
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:05,294
Observation reports
smoke screen.

583
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,463
Smoke screen.

584
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,509
Smoke screen, smoke screen.

585
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,928
Two.

586
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:19,725
1-8-0 true.

587
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:26,607
1-5-0-0-0.

588
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,613
Operator.
Yes, sir?

589
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,324
Get me the observation tower.
Yes, sir.

590
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,121
Observation Tower, sir.

591
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,916
Major Caton here.
Vacate the tower immediately.

592
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,627
Take up your secondary
battle posts. Right.

593
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,800
1-4-0-0-0.

594
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,811
Orders have been executed, sir.

595
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,689
All guns well concealed?
Yes, sir.

596
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,316
Planes?
As much as possible, sir.

597
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,402
All men under cover
and standing by?

598
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,528
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

599
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,991
Single enemy plane
approaching, sir.

600
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,326
Reconnaissance, probably.

601
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,251
I'm beginning to understand
the major's idea now.

602
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,588
Warn our men again that they
must stay under cover. Yes, sir.

603
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,715
Enemy changing formation.
Changing formation.

604
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,428
Preparing to attack.
That's what they came for.

605
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,520
They're certainly closing in.

606
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:31,899
Looks like my Chinese trick
might have some success after all.

607
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,026
They've fallen for it hook,
line and sinker.

608
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:44,328
9-0-5-0.

609
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:04,098
Awful lot of money being wasted
around here. What do you mean?

610
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:08,519
The price of one of them shells would set
me and Myrtle up pretty on a chicken ranch.

611
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,522
I thought you were all set for hogs.
Nah, hogs is out.

612
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:14,650
Why?
They stink!

613
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:23,700
8-0-5-0.

614
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,829
8-0...

615
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,123
5-0.

616
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,921
What's the big idea?
Why do we have to leave our gun?

617
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,924
Don't ask me. I don't know.

618
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,889
7-0-5-0.

619
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,444
Check the phone
and see if it's still working.

620
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,321
Number three gun checking.
Number three gun checking.

621
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,324
Yes, Number Three,
I can hear you.

622
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,993
Communications are okay.
Trouble?

623
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,996
Number three checking
communications, sir.

624
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,498
It's working, all right.

625
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,626
I hope they know
what they're doing.

626
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,299
6-0...

627
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,342
5-0.

628
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,412
The major must want 'em to get
close enough to throw rocks at us.

629
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,521
Those ain't no rocks
they're throwin', brother.

630
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:40,819
Give me the range every hundred yards. Aye,
aye, sir. Every hundred yards.

631
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,496
International code pennant...
Two hoists.

632
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,499
Roger, Negat, George...

633
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:01,215
5-4-0-0.

634
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,759
<i>Signal from the laps, sir.
What is it?</i>

635
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,011
Will you surrender?

636
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,223
We'll give them their answer
in a few moments. Thank you.

637
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:15,020
5-3-0-0.

638
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,534
5-2...

639
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,828
0-0.

640
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:35,415
Lewis, did you ever hear
of Colonel William Prescott?

641
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,209
No, sir.

642
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,546
Well, he was the gentleman
at the Battle of Bunker Hill who said,

643
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,715
"Don't fire till you can see
the whites of their eyes.”

644
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,300
You know,
I've always remembered that.

645
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,428
I'll certainly remember it
from now on.

646
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:53,100
5-1-0-0.

647
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,399
Might as well take a crack
at them right now.

648
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,610
Wait a minute. You heard the
orders. We're to hold our fire.

649
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,904
I don't know what for.

650
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,699
We'll never have
a better chance than now.

651
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,869
If they get any closer,
they'll blow this island to bits.

652
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,622
What do you care?
It ain't your island, is it?

653
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:26,758
5-0-0-0.

654
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,803
5-0...

655
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,222
0-0.

656
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:43,025
4-9-0-0.

657
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,451
Number four gun.

658
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:58,497
4-8-0-0.

659
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Range...

660
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:06,214
4-8-0-0.

661
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:20,020
<i>4-7-0-0.</i>

662
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,692
<i>4-7-0-0.</i>

663
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:34,826
To all batteries.
To all batteries.

664
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,538
Open fire.
Open fire! Yahoo!

665
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,208
To your stations!

666
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,088
Fire!

667
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,490
We seem to have cut down their firepower.
Bruce, suppose you go up and take a look.

668
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,203
With the greatest of pleasure, Bill.
Probenzki, roll her out and wind her up!

669
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,760
Boy, what a shellacking.

670
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,063
Talker.
Yes, sir?

671
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,732
To all batteries.
To all batteries.

672
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,817
Cease firing.
Cease firing.

673
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,029
Cease firing!
Cease firing!

674
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,325
Plane number five reports.
That's Cameron.

675
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,953
Plane number five reports.
What is it?

676
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,956
Enemy eight-inch
gun cruiser sighted.

677
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,419
2-3-0 true.

678
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,507
About 15 miles.

679
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:56,968
Fifteen miles.
Not so good.

680
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:01,056
That's way beyond our range. They
can lay out there and smear us at will.

681
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,956
Strip off everything you can and
drain out all but 15 gallons of gas.

682
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:30,502
But, Lieutenant, with only that much gas, it
will be impossible to... You heard me. Get at it.

683
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,719
Oh, hello, gentlemen. Lieutenant
Cameron has a request to make, sir.

684
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,722
Yes?
I think I can get that cruiser, sir.

685
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,143
What?
Yes, sir.

686
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,855
How do you propose to do it? If I strip my
plane to the bone and limit the gas load,

687
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:54,192
I can make a takeoff with a double
load of bombs, enough to do the job, sir.

688
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:58,029
If you get two direct hits.
I think I can, sir.

689
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,618
Request granted.
Thank you, sir.

690
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,745
I, uh...

691
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,014
Good hunting, Bruce.

692
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,057
Thank you, sir.

693
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,610
Bombs all set, Probenzki?
Yes, Lieutenant.

694
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:41,615
Two little Christmas presents.
One from you and one from me, huh?

695
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,034
Here goes the mail.

696
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,930
Glad he made it.
And a sweet job it was too, sir.

697
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:15,352
What did you do to the arm? Oh, trying to
salvage another engine. It was a little hot.

698
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:19,064
Where's your first aid pouch?
Uh, it's empty, sir.

699
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,941
Well, we've been using 'em plenty
around here. Here, let me have it.

700
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:39,626
Excuse me, sir. I want to be the
first to shake the big lug's hand.

701
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:51,304
Captain.
You better don't go there.

702
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:54,391
Huh?
You better don't go.

703
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,518
He's dead.

704
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,147
Patrick!
Carry on, Sergeant.

705
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,946
The sergeant's right.
It's better that you don't see him.

706
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,365
Let's have that arm.

707
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,344
This one isn't ready yet.

708
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:09,924
"Man that is born of a woman hath but
a short time to live and is full of misery.

709
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,052
He cometh up and is
cut down like a flower."

710
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,728
Here, son, you finish it.

711
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,816
"He fleeth as it were a shadow..."

712
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,611
"And never continueth in one stay."

713
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,615
"In the midst of life,
we are in death."

714
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:37,911
"Of whom may we look
for succor but of thee, Lord,"

715
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,709
"who for our sins are justly displeased.

716
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,504
"Yet, Lord, God mostly holy,

717
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:52,926
"Lord most mighty,
holy and most merciful savior,

718
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:57,055
"deliver us not unto
the bitter pains of eternal death.

719
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:01,100
"Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

720
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:04,395
"Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers,

721
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,607
"but spare us, Lord most holy,

722
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:12,153
"God most mighty,
holy and merciful savior.

723
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,697
"Thou most worthy judge eternal,

724
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,700
"suffer us not at our last hour...

725
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:21,788
for any pains of death
that fall upon thee.”

726
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,545
Lower away.

727
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,992
You sent for me, sir?

728
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,245
Yes, Lewis, I did.
Have a cigarette.

729
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,668
You know,

730
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:35,546
we've been getting it
pretty steady for some time now.

731
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,341
I've got a hunch we're in
for a few hours breather.

732
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,469
Your hunches are usually right, sir.

733
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,430
I contacted a navy patrol plane.

734
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,724
They're gonna take a chance
and come in.

735
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:50,812
I hope they make it.
Yeah.

736
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,110
How'd you like to be home
for Christmas?

737
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:05,701
Christmas dinner in Honolulu
with your missus and the youngsters.

738
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,663
How's it sound to you? You
know good and well how it sounds.

739
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:12,542
All right, get your gear together
and stand by.

740
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,712
Not this marine, sir.
Thought you'd say that.

741
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,091
For two weeks now,
we've engaged the enemy daily.

742
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,593
We've learned a lot about his tactics.

743
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,887
That's information the Navy Department
needs firsthand.

744
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,558
Well, there's Patrick.
Why don't you send him?

745
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,145
He's the only pilot I've got left.

746
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,731
I'm sorry, sir. I'm staying.

747
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,026
Captain Lewis, this is an order!

748
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,201
Aye, aye, sir.

749
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,789
Lewis. Here's my official report.

750
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,752
I'm not very good at this sort of thing,
but I guess with what you can tell them,

751
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,920
it'll give them a pretty good idea
of what's going on here.

752
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:02,091
Yes, sir.
One more thing.

753
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,802
I...

754
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,764
Pete, will you do me
a personal favor?

755
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,352
For my daughter.

756
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,106
I'll see that she gets it.

757
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,567
Well, so long, Pete.

758
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,105
Patrick, sit down.

759
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,901
Well, you look pretty solemn.

760
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,362
Enemy again, sir,
approaching in force.

761
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,114
Transports screened
by a strong escort.

762
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,826
Position and bearing.

763
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:14,747
Well, looks like our holiday's over.

764
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,751
Ordnance reports.
Ordnance reports.

765
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,631
Fifty-caliber ammunition
is nearly exhausted.

766
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,299
Talker.
Yes, sir?

767
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,635
Machine gun officer.
Yes, sir.

768
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,764
Machine gun officer.

769
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,850
Machine gun officer.

770
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,855
Major Caton here.

771
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,898
Replace the 50s
with the 30 calibers.

772
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,901
Follow plan "D."
Split the gun crews.

773
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:48,531
Spare men to take up positions in number
one beach head lines. Repeat, please.

774
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,867
Plan "D," Wilco.
Right.

775
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,910
If possible, relieve some of your men
and see that they get a square meal.

776
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,664
They'll need it soon. Right.

777
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,982
Hey, how'd you guys like to wrap yourself
around some real chow right now?

778
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:08,009
What do you mean? I work
hard... No hard feelings, cookie.

779
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:12,762
I only meant that if I was back
in the States, out with a dame,

780
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:16,350
sitting in some little café,
you know what I'd order?

781
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,729
A great big juicy steak about
that wide and about that thick.

782
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,648
With onions?

783
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:27,028
Oh, yeah, with lots of onions. I'd
settle just to be back in the States.

784
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,155
I'd settle just to be with a dame.

785
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,450
With a dame.

786
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,203
Aw, what are we
talking about it for?

787
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,247
That's all we can do.

788
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,291
Hey, Smacksie.

789
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,926
What's the matter?
I got a surprise for you.

790
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:53,846
Yeah, but my chow's gettin' cold. Look,
this is better than chow. Come on.

791
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,098
What could be better than chow?
Lots of things.

792
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,268
On this island? All right,
so0 maybe it came from heaven.

793
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,646
What are you talkin' about?
Never mind. Come around here.

794
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,524
All right.
Now, close your eyes.

795
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,944
Aw! Come here. Come
here. This is serious.

796
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,363
Now, close your eyes.

797
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:16,202
Well... Now, if you had three wishes,
what would you wish for?

798
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:19,705
Myrtle. Aw, no,
something better than Myrtle.

799
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,124
What could be better than Myrtle?
Lots of things.

800
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,002
Yeah, how do you know? All right,
I was stationed at Mare Island too.

801
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,254
Come on. Close your eyes.

802
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,759
Now, wish.

803
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,261
No, it's still Myrtle.
One-track mind.

804
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:38,015
Look, half right, close your eyes
and kneel down. Come on.

805
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,396
Now, open 'em.
Skipper!

806
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,024
Yeah, and she's got
the fleet with her too.

807
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,860
- How do you suppose that happened?
- I don't know.

808
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,321
Hey, Joe!
Joe, come on over here.

809
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,865
Look what Skipper went and done.

810
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,661
Ain't nature wonderful?

811
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,248
Hey, triplets, huh?
Quadruplets.

812
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,750
Good old Skipper.
I got dibs on this one.

813
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,128
No, no, they're all ours.
Yeah, it's our dog, ain't it?

814
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,213
Yeah, but I found 'em, didn't I?
Well, we got 'em.

815
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:13,217
Oh, not this one, you ain't.
Who do they look like?

816
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:16,762
Well, this one... Skipper's the only
dog that's ever been on the island.

817
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,848
Hey, that's right.

818
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,642
Skipper!

819
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,437
Where have you been?

820
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,855
She ain't been able to be no place.

821
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:31,318
Hey, fellas, you remember
that tanker that pulled in here?

822
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,741
Never mind, Skipper.
We still love you.

823
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,036
General quarters! Take it easy,
bub. I'll be back.

824
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:43,831
Now, don't you worry about a thing,
Skipper. We'll watch 'em, Skipper.

825
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,043
Oh, gee, I feel good.

826
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,045
Me too.
Let's go.

827
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,118
Betsy.
There she goes is right.

828
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,330
- The last one we've got.

829
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,062
Contact the beach head line.

830
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,466
Tell them to stand by to pick
up Captain Patrick. Yes, sir.

831
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,341
- The dirty...

832
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,864
Try and get some stretcher bearers.

833
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,837
Battery commander reports.

834
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:22,591
Battery commander reports
direct hit on number two gun.

835
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,642
How's the ammunition
holding out?

836
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,728
Well, I guess we've got enough to
get a couple of 'em. Swell. Good luck!

837
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:38,440
Heil.
Who said that?

838
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:41,150
Us. It was always us.

839
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:44,446
You're not such a bad guy, Gus.
We figured we'd let you in on it.

840
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,955
You still wish us that good luck?

841
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,040
You betcha. Good luck.

842
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,731
It won't be long now.
They're laying down a barrage.

843
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,735
What are you doing,
praying or something?

844
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,950
Yes, Corporal, I guess I was praying.

845
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:35,247
That's all right, Tommy.
There's nothing wrong with praying here.

846
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,333
- There are no atheists in foxholes.

847
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:48,260
Ordnance reports. Ordnance reports.
Direct hit on ammunition dump, sir.

848
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:52,556
Another signal from the the enemy, sir.
They demand immediate surrender.

849
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,727
Any answer, sir?
Yes.

850
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,354
Tell them to come and get us.
Aye, aye, sir.

851
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,357
Fire!

852
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,823
Cease firing!

853
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,330
Number one gun reports.

854
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:20,667
Number one gun reports
breech mechanism failed.

855
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,255
That's our last five-inch, sir.

856
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,350
They've got the Pan American Inn straddled,
sir. Thank you.

857
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,567
Come on. Get out!
This place has been evacuated.

858
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,528
Who says so?
I do.

859
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:51,448
I'm stayin' right here, brother. Me too.
It's as safe as any spot on the island.

860
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,451
Get him out!

861
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,055
To all posts.

862
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,811
To all posts.
To all posts.

863
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:24,063
Stand by to repel landing parties.
Follow plan "G."

864
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:27,901
Fire independently.
Stand by to repel landing parties.

865
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,531
Follow plan "G." Fire
independently. Fire independently.

866
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:06,064
The enemy has landed on two points,
sir, and gaining ground.

867
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,734
I tried to get you on the
phone but couldn't. Thank you.

868
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,952
Emergency radio.
Can't raise anyone, sir.

869
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,663
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.

870
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,667
Emergency radio.
Emergency radio.

871
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,923
- Any luck?
- The lines are all dead, sir.

872
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,925
- Talker.
- Yes, sir?

873
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:37,137
Will you try and get through to radio
with this? I'll do the best I can, sir.

874
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,932
Good luck, Tex.
Thank you, sir.

875
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,987
Well, McCloskey,
how are things with you?

876
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:59,243
I figure I've done everything I
could in my line. I'd still like that gun.

877
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,959
You know, I've been thinking along
those same lines myself.

878
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,547
Suppose we go out
and find one together.

879
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,949
Grenade!

880
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,713
Cease firing!
Cease firing!

881
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:56,842
Well, that does it.
For a minute, I guess.

882
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:02,431
You know, this is a pretty good
trench you guys dug. Thanks.

883
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,939
Cigarette?
Thanks.

884
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,364
That's a pretty good arm
you've got too.

885
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:22,241
It's been bended long enough.

886
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:27,247
From the way you threw that,
I'd almost think you played football.

887
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,958
Notre Dame, '28.

888
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,628
V.M.I., '28.

889
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,048
Twenty-eight.

890
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,763
To your very good health, sir.

891
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,933
Hey, Joe.
Huh?

892
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,937
How many blondes do you suppose
there are that we didn't get around to?

893
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,231
Must be an awful lot of them.

894
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:57,361
I sort of feel sorry for them.
Don't you?

895
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:01,447
Oh, I don't know.
Only half of 'em are missing anything.

896
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,659
Aw, cut it out, will ya?

897
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:18,465
Come on, Smacksie!

898
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,750
Hey, Smacksie.
Hey, Smacksie!

899
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,853
Be with you in a minute.

900
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,335
These marines fought a great fight.

901
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,463
- They wrote history.
- But this is not the end.

902
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,341
There are other leathernecks,
other fighting Americans...

903
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,427
A hundred and forty million of them,

904
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:50,932
whose blood and sweat and fury
will exact a just and terrible vengeance.
