00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:42,559

potent solution of liquid morphine,

and it's a little bottle.
It has an eyedropper.

338
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,523
It's easy to get into his
mouth and drop on his tongue,

339
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:52,193
and it will certainly
diminish the pain that he's in.

340
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,449
But you need to realize that,
uh, once you give it to him

341

there really is no going back.

342
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:04,664
It will certainly cure his pain, but he
will drift in and out of consciousness
