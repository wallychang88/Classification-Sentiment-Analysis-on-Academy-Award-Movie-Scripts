1624

01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:51,005

just ten feet away from it!

1637
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:11,055

Now, move!

1638
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:13,327

Always your back!

1639
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:17,931

1640

1641

1642
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,100
Where is it?

1643
01:47:23,102 --> 01:47:24,635

- Where did you take it?

1644

1646
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,045
Where is it?

1647
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,183
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1648
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:46,724
I'm sorry, sir.

1649
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:49,162
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1650
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,770
That story about Samson.

1651
01:47:56,735 --> 01:47:58,870
I never told you how it ends.

1652
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:03,444
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1653
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:08,082
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1654
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:12,884
And at the last minute,
he is spared.

1655
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:17,656
And the Lord gives him
his strength back...

1656
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,026
one last time.

1657
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,198
And he holds...

1658
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,433
the columns of the temple...

1659
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,901
with his powerful arms.

1660
01:48:29,903 --> 01:48:32,807
And he crushes them.

1661
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,177
(bones crunching)

(panting)

1664
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:45,983
And he brings
the whole building

1665
01:48:45,985 --> 01:48:48,087
down on the Philistines.

1666
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:55,026
He dies...

1667
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:59,333
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1668
01:48:59,932 --> 01:49:01,301
That is his will!

1669
01:49:05,271 --> 01:49:10,043
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1670
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,478
for us, Delilah?

1671
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,947
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

1672
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,916
you're gonna tell me

1673
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:22,019
either before or after

1674
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,425

this particular temple...

1675
01:49:25,758 --> 01:49:29,460
down upon our heads.

1679

on the phone about it.
