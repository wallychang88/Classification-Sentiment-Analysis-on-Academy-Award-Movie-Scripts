1
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,170
<i>NO) In the wake of
the Nicaraguan Revolution...</i>

2
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,214
<i>...chaos has descended on El Salvador...</i>

3
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,715
<i>...in Central America.</i>

4
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:16,345
<i>Today 18 people were killed
and 36 wounded in a fierce gun battle...</i>

5
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>...between anti-government
demonstrators and the police.</i>

6
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,894
<i>It started when students, workers,
and peasants linked to the guerrillas...</i>

7
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>...occupied foreign embassies
and took over the cathedral in the capital.</i>

8
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,525
(knock at door)

9
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,528
<i>NO) In two months, more than
3,000 people have disappeared.</i>

10
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,490
<i>Government spokesmen attribute this
to left-wing Marxist terrorists...</i>

11
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,077
<i>...while left-wing spokesmen
point to right-wing death squads.</i>

12
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:44,665
- (woman) You cannot walk in like this!
- (man) You got some money for me? No?

13
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,711
- I have no money!
- I want you outta here. You understand?

14
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:53,424
- No, we cannot move out.
- Lady, I put up with this shit every month.

15
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:58,429
I want you, your crumb-snatcher and your
war hero - or whatever the fuck he is -

16
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,806
...I want him outta here.

17
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,603
Fuck your husband! You got no bucks.
Look, no bucks, no Buck Rogers, Boyle!

18
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,273
Just wait till I've had my coffee.
You're disturbing my kid.

19
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,235
- You gotta fix your bitch, Boyle.
- Shit on your paper!

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,238
(swearing)

21
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,245
(Sobs)

22
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,456
(Boyle) Good morning.

23
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,583
I've had it!

24
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,920
I cannot live like this no more!

25
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,131
- Hey, Nancy, hi. It's Richard. Listen...
- Richard who?

26
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:38,969
Boyle. Richard Boyle. Yeah. Listen, I think
it's gonna blow in El Salvador real soon.

27
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,806
If you could get me a new press card and
two grand, I could get some good stuff.

28
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,435
- No Way.
- OK. Well, how about a new press card?

29
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,813
- Forget it.
- Come on, Nancy. Please, man.

30
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:54,485
<i>We've had it with you. We gave you $2500
on that Lebanon gig and you ended up...</i>

31
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,654
I can't take Muslim nightlife, OK?

32
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,074
<i>- Hey, Alice. How you c:loin'?
- You lose tickets, passports.</i>

33
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,494
<i>You drink too much
and you're a genera! embarrassment, Boyle.</i>

34
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:08,082
I get you the piece. How about that thing
on the IRA tortured by the Brits in Belfast?

35
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,876
And how about Cambodia?
The last man out, you know.

36
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,547
Sidney Schanberg was having cocktails
at the Plaza. I was gettin' my ass kicked.

37
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,176
How about freezin' my fuckin' nuts off
for you guys in the Khyber Pass?

38
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,388
I got giardia. I was staple-gunned
to the toilet for a week.

39
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,976
- <i>How about El Salvador?</i>
- <i>How about</i> El <i>Salvador? How about it?</i>

40
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,020
- Didn't I call that one?
- <i>Boyle...</i>

41
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,357
- Hey, come on.
- Come on what? Get the fuck outta here.

42
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,361
Not you. Nancy? Nancy, I'm sorry.
Nancy? Nice work, you piece of...

43
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,863
Thanks for my camera,
but I need another favour.

44
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,242
I gotta be at the airport
in an hour for Beirut.

45
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,120
Look, this is serious.
I need one for old times' sake.

46
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,248
You gotta give me 500 bucks
to go to El Salvador. 400 if...

47
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,584
- <i>They'll kill you if you go back.</i>
- I need <i>the money, not</i> a <i>lecture.</i>

48
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,504
OK. 300 bucks.
I'll meet you at Pan Am in 40 minutes.

49
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,924
Great! Here, take the quarter.
In such a fuckin' hurry.

50
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,058
(Siren)

51
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,561
Shit!

52
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,647
Mr Boyle, your license has been revoked.

53
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,526
You're driving without a license,
registration or insurance.

54
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,447
You've got four outstanding
speeding tickets all gone to warrant.

55
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,200
- You've got 43 unpaid parking tickets.
- Jesus!

56
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,911
Nothing is legal about your oar.

57
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:32,082
- And even your press card is out of date.
- Out of date? Goddamnit.

58
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,419
- I'm taking you in.
- No. I'm not that Richard Boyle.

59
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,506
This... happens all the time.
There's another Richard Boyle.

60
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,969
- Give me your other hand.
- Have some humanity, will you? I just...

61
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,565
- Doc, man, thanks for gettin' me out.
- Come on, get your car.

62
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,278
Look, man, they got Bagel. The Nazis
busted Bagel. He's in dog Dachau.

63
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:05,407
- Get your car.
- I don't have it. I need 75 bucks to get it.

64
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,744
Shit! I just paid 125 to get you out.

65
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,164
- Stop whining.
- Here. This is all I got.

66
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,458
Now come on before they drop the pellet.

67
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,960
- It's a fuckin' dog.
- It's my dog.

68
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,468
- Faster, Richie.
- I can't, man. I don't even have a license.

69
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,096
They'll throw the key away.
How long's he been there?

70
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,849
I don't know. I left him with some friends.
Yeah, shit friends.

71
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,477
It's not like they're gonna
gas the poor dog, OK?

72
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,980
Man, everything's turned to shit.
Miriam's thrown me out, man.

73
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,317
She says I'm too old to be
a rock'n'roll disc jockey.

74
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,862
She wants me to sell computers
in Silicon Valley. Can you believe it?

75
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,492
I can't take these yuppie women. With
the Walkmans and the running shoes...

76
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,496
...and the 'rather go to the aerobics jazz
class than fuck'. Forget about it.

77
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,333
- They got those pussy exercises, too.
- Latin women, they're different.

78
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,671
They're kind, understanding.
Look at Claudia. She's the greatest.

79
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,465
She doesn't give a shit what I do. Primo.

80
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,552
Best thing about Latin women
is they don't speak English.

81
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,179
Listen, can I crash at your place tonight?

82
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:13,684
I got no place to go, man. I'll sleep
in your shower. I need a home, man.

83
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,187
You better light up another joint, Doc,
cos I got some bad news for ya.

84
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,026
(Boyle) I don't got a place. We're evicted.
We were gonna stay with you and Bosco.

85
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,614
You mean I gave you my last
200 bucks and I got no place to stay?

86
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,701
That's great. Now what am I
supposed to do, man?

87
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,371
(Doc) I'm in deep shit, you know that?
I should've just left you in jail.

88
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,416
- (Boyle) I'd have stayed in jail.
- (Doc) Move over, move over!

89
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,252
(Boyle) Another yuppie
in a fuckin' Oldsmobile.

90
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,713
(Doc) This town is full of goddamn yuppies!

91
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,257
(Doc) Yuppie town!

92
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,265
Bagel! Bagel?

93
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,478
- Where's my dog?
- What's he look like?

94
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,941
- Oh. Yeah. I know this dog.
- Where is he?

95
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,154
- Bagel?
- Excuse me. Sir! Excuse me!

96
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,240
- Bagel, come here, boy.
- No, that's not your dog. Excuse me.

97
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:14,161
We had to put your dog to sleep.
We keep the dogs around 14 days.

98
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,080
- We kept him more than 14 days, but...
- You put him to sleep?

99
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,292
- Yeah.
- When's he gonna wake up?

100
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,546
- You killed him. You gassed him.
- No. We gave him an injection.

101
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,258
- It's much more humane, so you don't...
- What kind of humanity is that?

102
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,970
You're a murderer, you know that?
I can't believe it.

103
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,307
That was my only relationship.
My best friend. Seven years.

104
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,684
My marriage only lasted five.

105
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,479
- It's just not just!
- I'm really sorry.

106
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,190
Would you like some puppies?
We got a lot of puppies.

107
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,485
- My dog's leash.
- I'm sorry.

108
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,114
Doc, man, she can't do anything.
Come on. OK? All right?

109
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,580
- (Doc) What's it say?
- (Boyle) "Fuck you" in Italian.

110
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,420
Shit! She's gone back to Italy
to her parents. Goddamnit!

111
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,138
That's too bad, Richie.
Well, at least she left the TV.

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,357
It was a marriage made in hell.

113
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,611
I'm sure gonna miss my boy.

114
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,406
Maybe she'll be back.

115
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,117
(Doc) Sure. Who could leave all this?

116
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,167
- (Doc) Where are we goin' now?
- (Boyle) Guatemala.

117
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,671
- Why?
- Why not?

118
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,592
No cops, no laws, sun.

119
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,094
It's cheap. No yuppies.

120
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,472
Great dope.

121
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,396
(Boyle) Look at you. You are like
a walking museum of the '60s.

122
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,897
(Doc) What the fuck are you?

123
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,774
(Boyle) I am a forward-thinking human being.

124
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,820
(Boyle) I know about life. I explore things.
In journalism, you're in touch with reality.

125
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,490
(Doc) You come off with this
journalist bullshit all the goddamn time.

126
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,533
You know that?

127
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,536
(Doc) I haven't seen one goddamn article
that you've written.

128
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,705
(Boyle) I wrote a book,
"Flower of the Dragon".

129
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,457
(Doc) That was ten years ago, Boyle!

130
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,293
- (Boyle) Expose'. It was a big exposé.
- (Doc) Ten years ago.

131
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,463
- (Doc) What have you written since?
- (Boyle) I've written articles.

132
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,300
- (Doc) What articles?
- (Boyle) One in a newspaper in El Salvador.

133
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:38,096
(Doc) The one in El Salvador? Oh, yeah,
I read that. My whole family read that!

134
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,390
(Doc) Everyone saw that article, Boyle!

135
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,479
(Doc) You said Guatemala, man.
You didn't say anything about El Salvador.

136
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,981
I've never been out of the country.

137
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,943
- They kill people here.
- You believe everything in the papers?

138
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,905
You're gonna love it here.
Give me the joint.

139
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,074
Look, Doc, this is my last chance.

140
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,244
If I can get some good combat shots,
I can make some money.

141
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,415
- So I can pay you back.
- You better pay me back.

142
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,585
Then we'll go to La Libertad,
the best surfing beach in the world.

143
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,880
Kick back for a few months. Be fantastic.

144
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,966
You could live in this country
for 300 bucks a year.

145
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,427
- What the fuck is this?
- Mace.

146
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,596
- Mace for what?
- Wild dogs.

147
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,432
Wild dogs. That's bullshit, Boyle!

148
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,894
- You've lied to me straight through.
- Want me to be honest with you?

149
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,272
No. What the hell you doin' with all these?

150
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,233
Here you could have
a semblance of a life.

151
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,194
- What are all these?
- Give me one. They come in handy.

152
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,156
- You're gonna love it here, Doc.
- I'm goin' home, man.

153
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,201
You can drive drunk,
get anybody killed for 50 bucks.

154
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:46,373
- I don't wanna kill anyone for 5O bucks.
- The best pussy in the world.

155
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,252
Where else can you get a virgin
to sit on your face for seven bucks?

156
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
Seven bucks.

157
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,135
Better be the best pussy in the world,
or I'm goin' home.

158
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,472
- Two virgins for 12.
- You're just lucky I'm fucked up, Boyle.

159
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:07,185
Drugs, no prescriptions. They got stuff
that keeps you hard all night long.

160
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,355
- All these people wanna do is fuck.
- 12 bucks?

161
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,526
- I think we can get 'em down, don't you?
- Now you're talkin'.

162
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,653
You're such an asshole, Boyle.

163
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,156
You're gonna love this place. Ha!

164
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,577
You're gonna be in pig heaven, man.

165
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,371
(Doc) Why are they blockin' the road?

166
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,665
(Boyle) Stop asking why.
This ain't gringo-land.

167
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,418
Take this. Be dumb, act cool, all right?

168
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,589
- What is this? A tranquilliser?
- A permanent one: cyanide.

169
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,258
- I'm not taking that shit.
- You're gonna be sorry...

170
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,386
...when they out off your balls
and stuff one in each ear.

171
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,349
You're so fuckin' dramatic, man. Jesus!

172
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
(Doc) Who are these clowns?

173
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,483
- (Doc) What the fuck...?
- (Boyle) Traffic accident.

174
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,526
(Doc) Jesus, Boyle!

175
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,113
(Doc) Oh, God, man!

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,616
(Boyle) Would you relax? It's just some guy.

177
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,619
<i>(Boyle) Shit. Hola, amigo. como va?</i>

178
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,163
(In Spanish) The road to Santa Ana is closed.

179
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,040
(In Spanish) I understand...

180
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:14,002
...but Colonel Figueroa told me
to give a present to you boys.

181
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,005
(English) Because the road's closed.

182
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,298
They're journalists.

183
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,342
(Boyle) No.

184
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,845
No. Get out of the car.

185
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,889
Si, si, si, se-or.

186
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:35,023
Whatever you do, Doc, whatever you do,
OK, don't get on the ground.

187
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,400
Jesus Christ. This is fuckin' scary.

188
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,237
<i>- Que' trae?
- No, trae nada.</i>

189
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,988
What?

190
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,740
(In Spanish) You! What's happening?

191
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,576
- They're journalists.
- Bring them to me.

192
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,418
Journalists?

193
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,546
<i>Yo estoy...</i>

194
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,589
<i>- ...esta bien?
- Si.</i>

195
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,134
(In Spanish)
I'm a friend of Colonel Figueroa...

196
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,345
I wrote an article.

197
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,306
- Friends of Figueroa's.
- I'm a friend of Figueroa's.

198
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:09,641
(In Spanish) Take them.

199
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,726
Is that bad?

200
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,608
(In Spanish) Let's go.

201
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,861
He's a friend of Figueroa's. I was...

202
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,280
$hut up!

203
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,801
(Talking in Spanish)

204
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,226
(Doc) What's goin' on here, man?

205
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,522
- I think they're checking cedulas.
- What's a cedula?

206
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,611
Birth certificates, voting papers. If you
don't have a cedula, you're in deep shit.

207
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,866
(Calls soldier)

208
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,868
(Speaks in Spanish)

209
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,039
(He asks soldier to take prisoners)

210
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,255
Doc, put your hands on your head.

211
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,597
(In Spanish) What's going on?

212
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,184
(In Spanish) We've stopped a truckload
of suspicious campesinos.

213
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,527
(Prisoner) Pleading in Spanish

214
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,074
He's probably a student.
That's the worst thing you can be.

215
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,167
(In Spanish) - Where are your papers?
- At home. I can take you there. Please Sir.

216
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,503
- Let's go. Fast.

217
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,380
(Shouts in Spanish)

218
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,050
(Boyle, Spanish) Look, I'm a friend
of Colonel Figueroa's.

219
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:13,348
Where the fuck are they takin' us?
I should've never have bailed you out.

220
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,184
- Who are your friends? Communists!
- No, I'm alone.

221
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,353
Take off your glasses.

222
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,069
Shit!

223
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,908
Holy shit! They're gonna
fuckin' kill us now, Boyle.

224
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:36,663
Goddamnit! I thought you knew your way
around here. They're gonna fuckin' kill us!

225
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,459
- They're gonna fuckin' kill us!
- Stop it! Shut the fuck up! Just be cool!

226
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,753
I don't know what the fuck
they're gonna do!

227
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,595
This is it.

228
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,140
This is it.

229
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,769
You got any of those tranquillisers left?

230
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,735
(soldiers chanting)

231
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,758
He)', Boyle!

232
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,010
How the hell did you get in here?

233
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:19,557
- No fuckin' period/stars are allowed.
- I snuck in through Guatemala, Colonel.

234
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,561
You're a damn bastard! You're lucky
you've still got your huevos.

235
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,523
- But you look like shit!
- Grac/as.

236
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,528
Come with me. (Speaks Spanish).

237
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,824
You wash up. You wash up.
You have some drinks, some food.

238
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,046
My amigo here, he write me up
in the American newspaper...

239
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,465
...like the Patton of El Salvador.

240
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,718
You were, Julio. It was the last
great cavalry charge in history.

241
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,555
Your soccer war with Honduras, '69.

242
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,100
All the way to Tegucigalpa.

243
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:06,271
Not since Attila the Hun have there been
such amazing cavalry tactics.

244
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,815
And this one takes it up the cu/0 real nice.

245
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,943
How about this one?
Does she take it up the cu/0 too?

246
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,653
All right!

247
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,533
Libertad, Doc. End of the rainbow.

248
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,954
I'm sick. My asshole hurts. My dick burns.

249
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:29,460
(Doc) I don't know how to say this, it's
really been fun travelling with you.

250
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,754
(Doc) I need to catch a plane
out of this place.

251
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,550
(Boyle) You think you're gonna die?
I got the best doctor in town for you.

252
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,595
You have nothin' to worry about
once you meet the broad.

253
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,599
(Boyle in Spanish)
A little of this, too. And this?

254
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,641
We'll put that in, too.

255
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,436
<i>Esto? In el culo?</i>

256
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,774
- It's a joke.
- I'm sick. What the hell's she laughin' at?

257
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,321
Nothin'. She's puttin' everything in there.
It'll clean you out or it'll kill you.

258
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,283
- What about a subscription?
- All you need is an ass. See you later.

259
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,536
Don't pay her anything.
I got credit here. I gotta run.

260
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:08,208
That's the biggest fuckin' needle
I ever saw! Just give me a fuckin'...

261
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,793
Ow! Son of a bitch!

262
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,299
<i>Sigan, por favor.</i>

263
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,304
<i>Sigan.</i>

264
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,223
(In Spanish) I'm going over there.

265
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,683
<i>Siga.</i>

266
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,311
(orders in Spanish)

267
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,815
I'm going over there.

268
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,737
Ricardo! Ricardo!

269
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,784
(Boyle greets in Spanish)

270
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,663
Did you miss me? Did you miss me, huh?

271
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,184
Very pretty girl.

272
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,687
They said you were dead.

273
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,524
Where's her father?

274
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,609
Disappeared.

275
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,864
Shall we go to your house?

276
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,367
You still drunk? You still crazy?

277
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:31,374
No. For you I stopped. No more alcohol.

278
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,057
Shall we go to your house?

279
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,316
(In Spanish) It's a magic car.

280
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,401
And this is for you.

281
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,486
Monster!

282
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,786
Do you like this? A television.

283
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,749
OK, Duglas. Come on.
I'll see you at the <i>casa,</i> huh? OK.

284
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,335
At the casa we see the television

285
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,173
(In Spanish) I know you have
another woman in the north.

286
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,550
Another woman? No.

287
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,429
That's over. The other woman.

288
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,598
You're the only one.

289
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,601
<i>Come on. Venga. Por Favor.</i>

290
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,168
(Toad croaks)

291
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,128
(Boyle) Are you, Major Max?

292
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,714
(Speaks Spanish)

293
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,802
(Both speaking Spanish)

294
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,852
Ricardo, back from the dead!

295
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,729
<i>Come estas, eh?</i>

296
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,066
- I like your friend. Dr Rock.
- (Boyle) Dr Rock, e/ medico.

297
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,824
- How bad is it here, huh?
- If I had one of those I'd be better off.

298
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,327
You gotta be goodlookin' and rich.

299
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,913
Yeah, well, my ass hurts.

300
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,714
- Hey, Ricardo, can I have some?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

301
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,808
- Guatemala, no?
- Yeah, yeah. Guatemala gold.

302
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,441
<i>(Doc) Buena caca.</i>

303
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,192
(Boyle) So, Doc,

304
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,028
(Boyle cont.) you wanna be back
in San Francisco?

305
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,867
(Doc) I'm tellin' you, man, everywhere
I turn, just dogs screwing other dogs.

306
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,537
(Doc) Pigs in the street. It's like Baltimore
or somethin', for Christ's sake.

307
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,207
- (Doc) How are we for cash?
- (Boyle) You hungry? Wanna get a hamburger?

308
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,461
(Doc) Maybe just one
before you take me to the airport.

309
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,338
(Doc) I got a life there,
even without Miriam.

310
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,009
I bailed you out of jail. You've owed me
a lot of money over the years.

311
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,888
I wish you'd pay me so we can,
like, part company, you know?

312
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,732
- John. I thought I'd find you here.
- I thought you were dead.

313
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,902
- Dead? Why, do I look that bad?
- Yes.

314
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,906
I heard stories from Guatemala.
They were pullin' your toenails out.

315
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,618
Fuckin' Guatemala. Jesus.
How was Beirut?

316
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,204
- Fuckin' awful.
- Really?

317
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,416
- You gonna eat those fries?
- No, no. Dr Rock, John Cassady.

318
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,422
- That was a great cover for Newsweek.
- Thanks.

319
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,425
So what happened?
How come you split so fast?

320
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,094
From here? I had a little beef
with Major Max's boys.

321
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,932
They weren't too happy about
that torture-chamber story. Waiter!

322
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,769
Major Max? Who's Major Max?

323
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,980
This guy is after you, too,
on top of everything else?

324
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,359
That was a year ago. They don't have
yuppie computers down here.

325
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:30,696
I'm gettin' outta here. First plane,
I'm outta here. I'm not kiddin' this time.

326
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,033
I've had enough of this shit.
I want my money, Boyle.

327
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,119
- What money?
- The money you owe me. I'm serious.

328
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,248
- No bullshit.
- You've been on valiums too long.

329
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,793
There is no money. The transmission
in Guatemala, gas, whores.

330
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,629
How about the border rip-off?
We had 7O colones.

331
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,799
You know how many we got left?
12. 12 colones, all right?

332
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,928
- How much is 12 colones?
- Four bucks. Three bucks.

333
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,347
- Three American dollars?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,142
You're tellin' me that's all we got left?
My dog is dead, Boyle!

335
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,479
You know why... Stop doing that!
You know why he's doing that?

336
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:07,942
This is why. Cos he drinks Tic Tac.
It's 17 cents a bottle, OK?

337
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:12,029
You can't get rid of the guy. He'll follow
you anywhere. Wanna go to Beirut?

338
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:16,826
- Tell me what it has to do with me.
- It's your liberal, yuppie bullshit.

339
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,579
It's nothin' to fuckin' do with me, man!

340
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,999
I'm stuck in this country,
I can't speak the language...

341
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,043
...I got the shakes,
and I only got three fuckin' dollars!

342
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:30,089

I picked up in Guatemala.

- Look, John, I'm really sorry.
- It's on Newsweek.

347
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,316
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

348
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:53,404
I got fired by PNS.
I could use a string down here real bad.

349
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,198
- Could you help me out?
- There's no work here for you.

350
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,076
- Nobody cares about the stinkin' war.
- I care.

351

They're not just shootin' the Indians.

352

blown away by their paramilitary groups.

353
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,795
They're shootin' at us.

354
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,259
- Why don't you try Angola?
- There's no nightlife.

355
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:20,056
I can get you out with Figueroa, John.
I got carte blanche with his elite unit.

356
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,392
- You still got the deathmobile.
- Come on, Boyle.

357

in a while, have you, Rich?

362
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,704
Come on, take some pictures.
There's fresh bodies up there.

363
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,838
John, have you got a 24
or a 28 I could use?

364
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:32,336
You know what made photographers
like Robert Capa great, Rich?

365
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,964
They weren't after money.

366
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:39,427
They captured the nobility
of human suffering.

367
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,973
That was a great shot in Spain.
The one flying through the air.

368
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,017
Yeah, but it was
more than the bodies, Richie.

369
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,855
He got... why they died.

370
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,902
That's what Capa caught.
He caught that moment of death.

371
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,826
You're right up there with him, John.
You're in his league. You're the best.

372
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,789
You gotta get close, Rich, to get the truth.

373
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,753
You get too close, you die.

374
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,425

375
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,431

382

- Tom Kelly from Cambodia?
- You should check him out.

383

This year Castro's got 'em organised.

This is all Warsaw bloc stuff now.

Yeah, well, you're not gonna think it's
all one big joke when they take this place.

483

Nicaragua was just the beginning.
Guatemala and Honduras are next.

In five years you'll be seeing
Cuban tanks on the Rio Grande.

485
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,899
Give me a break. I'm more worried
about Major Max on the Rio Grande.

486
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:18,737
Major Max may be running things here
pretty soon, so you better watch yourself.

487

- What?

488
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,661
- 5O bucks.
- Tom. Tom Kelly, Richard Boyle.

489
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:30,415
Ambassador Kelly, hi. I'm Richard Boyle.
PNS. I was the last man outta Cambodia.

490
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,503

Dragon". I'm a friend of Cathy Moore's.

- Nice meeting you.
- Let me just ask you one thing.

492
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,220
Does this Reagan thing pose a problem
for you? I'll just grab a couple of shots.

493

General, have you met Mr Boyle?

494
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,893
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Boyle. Hi. Thanks.

495

Well, you could say "With Reagan in the
saddle, the guerrillas are in deep shit."

500
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,508
That's lovely, Peter, but have you seen
the Journal today, by any chance?

501
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,928
It's real rah-rah democracy,
free elections.

502
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,389
I think that's what the networks
are gonna want tonight.

503
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,100
So what's your sign?

504
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,396
- Stop.
- That's really cute.

505
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,231

You and your friend are so full of shit.

508
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:49,202

- I resent what we saw in Santa Ana.

509
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,288
What was that?

510
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:55,042
A kid shot in the head and hung from
a tank because he didn't have his cedula.

511
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,586
- Know what a cedula is?
- Yeah.

512
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,797
If you're gonna analyse the situation,
analyse it right.

513
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,468
You don't have a cedula
on election day stamped, you're dead.

514
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:08,430
Democracy. What kind of democracy is it
when you have to vote...

515
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,850
...and if you don't vote
you're branded a Commie subversivo?

516
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:16,271
People would vote for Donald Duck
or whoever the local cop tells them to...

517
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,857
...because if they don't,
this is what happens.

can't last two weeks with the network.

00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,745
<i>Buenas noches. Buenas noches, senor.
Coma esta usted?</i>

641
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,247
<i>El Capitain? Es para usted, Senor.</i>

642
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,878
- No, no, no, it's OK.
- Senor, it's OK?

643
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,553
<i>- Buenas noches.
- Es para usted.</i>

644
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,766
- (Doc) Boyle, get me the fuck outta here!
- If you wanna live, Doc, shut up.

645
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,559
<i>Que pasa?</i>

646
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:42,230
(In Spanish) They're marijuanos. Subversives.

647
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,399
<i>Esto?</i>

648
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,283
<i>Es bueno. Si, es verdad.</i>

649
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,995
<i>Guapo. Es verdad.</i>

650
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,915
<i>Mira. Mira.</i>

651
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,421
- <i>Que? Es para mi?</i>
<i>- La television de Dr Rock.</i>

652
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,548
<i>Si. Es para usted.</i>

653
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:13,428
<i>Es Iibro? Si? El gringo?</i>

654
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,764
Doc, just get outta here. Go, man. Go.

655
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,394
(In Spanish) And this one?

656
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,272
No, he's a bad kid. No respect.

657
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,942
He stays here. Or you stay as well.

658
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,995
<i>Es para mi!</i>

659
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,539
<i>El otro no?</i>

660
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,544
Carlos, just say cool, man.
I'll get you out, OK?

661
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,060
- Hello, Cathy. How are you?
- Fine.

662
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,270
- You look a little tired.
- No, I'm fine.

663
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,398
- Ambassador Kelly. Richard Boyle.
- Good to see you again.

664
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,151
- You remember me from the party?
- I do.

665
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:15,114
I'm sorry. I had actually written
two articles about you in Cambodia...

666
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,241
...just before the fall of Phnom Penh.

667
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:21,788
I was the last American journalist out.
Schanberg was chasing his Pulitzer prize.

668
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:26,667
I was almost getting cholera but we saved
1100 refugees from the Khmer Rouge.

669
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,256
- Terrible what they did to that country.
- Yes, sir, it was.

670
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,053
Were you one of the people writin'
'em up as the good guys for a while?

671
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,681
Yes, sir. I'm afraid I was wrong on
that one. But a lot of people were.

672
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:44,352
If these guys in the hills took power...

673
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,854
...the Pol Pot incident
would look like a picnic.

674
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,440
Are they as bad as Major Max
and the Mano Blanca?

675
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:53,152
I don't know. We got
a pathological killer on the Right...

676
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,322
...God knows what on the Left,
and a gutless middle.

677
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,701
Anyway, Boyle, about your problem here.

678
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,831
Carol checked with the National Guard,
the police, the regular army.

679
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:08,209
Nobody seems to know
anything about this boy. We think...

680
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,671
With respect, Ambassador, they're lying.

681
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:16,551
He didn't just disappear. Nobody just
disappears in El Salvador. They got him.

682
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:20,555
- Have you checked with Human Rights?
- The Human Rights Office?!

683
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,225
They rearranged this kid's molecules
and they took their time!

684
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:28,146
He is dying out there while
we're talking. He's just a kid!

685
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,231
- He's just a kid!
- Richard...

686
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,067
- Richard, please calm down.
- I'm sorry.

687
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:38,948
Ambassador, look. His sister is
my girlfriend. She's on the shit list.

688
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:43,911
I gotta get a cedula for her. They could
come tonight, take her away and kill her!

689
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:47,832
Richard, Richard!
That doesn't have anything to do with us.

690
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:52,628
You know the laws of this country.
She's gonna have to go back to her home town.

691
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,840
- Where's she from?
- Morazon. She can't get near there.

692
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,260
If she does, the guards'll kill her
as a suspected G. Fuck!

693
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,889
All right. I'll do the best
I can, but it's very tough.

694
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:07,852
There are thousands of people in this
predicament. Everybody wants a cedula.

695
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,937
Let me ask you this.

696
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:15,026
- What if I married her?
- Richard, you're already married.

697
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,404
Sir, I know you're very busy.
Thank you very much.

698
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,449
But that's in the States.
Suppose I just married her?

699
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:24,076
- I'll do whatever I can.
- Thank you, sir.

700
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:29,874
- Maybe you could talk to immigration?
- Just let me see what I can do.

701
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,126
We want to see you
at the Christmas party.

702
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,672
Maybe I could keep in touch with you
and we could talk over some ideas?

703
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,514
- I give up on you.
- What do you mean, you give up?

704
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,476
- Every time I get...
- He liked me, this guy.

705
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,103
- What's goin' on?
- I gotta get a cedula for Maria.

706
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,231
Maria.

707
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:58,152
Maria, they can't find Carlos yet,
but the American ambassador is involved.

708
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,822
The thing is, though,
you are in great danger.

709
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,243
Without a cedula, they can grab
you at any time, comprende?

710
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:09,747
So I've been thinking about something,
and what I think we should do...

711
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:12,833
Marry me.

712
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,669
What?

713
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,089
We could have a family together.
Duglas, Reina, you and me...

714
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:23,469
- And Carlos, what about him?
- And Carlos too, when we find him. Si?

715
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:27,348
- You already have a wife.
- No, no. That's been over for six months.

716
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,350
I got a divorce. I never told you.

717
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,852
- Hi, Boyle!
- Just a second.

718
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:34,355
- Hey, Peter.
- Atlanta's gonna give you a shot!

719
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,857
- No!
- If you fuck up this time...

720
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,777
Not a chance. That's great, Peter. Thanks.

721
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,196
Right. Well, I want
some real stuff on the Gs.

722
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,699
- Sure you're set with Alvarez?
- We're like this.

723
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,828
OK. You got a camera, the crew and
the Arena press conference tomorrow.

724
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,831
- Right. Major Max.
- He's gonna declare for president.

725
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,792
I'm going to Venezuela,
so you'll have to cover for me.

726
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:59,213
That's great! Listen, could you
lend me 50 bucks, man? I'm a little low.

727
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,841
You don't change, do you, Boyle?

728
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,385
Let's see what we've got here...
Get out of it!

729
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,054
- 200 of them. You owe me.
- 200 colones.

730
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,390
- Out of my own pocket...
- Right.

731
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,642
- ...so no whores.
- OK.

732
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,604
- Do a good job, Boyle. See ya.
- You're a mensch. You're great.

733
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,273
<i>- Entonces, si or no?
- No.</i>

734
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,483
<i>Por que no, mi amor?</i>

735
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,236
<i>- Soy una mujer Chato/ica.</i>
- <i>So</i> what?

736
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,905
- I can't marry a divorced man.
- Oh, God!

737
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,867
And you, Richard,
are a bad Catholic in all ways.

738
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,161
How am I a bad Catholic?

739
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,205
- You're living in sin.
- No, no, no, I'm not.

740
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,374
- You drink.
- OK, once in a while I drink.

741
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,418
You sleep with many women.

742
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:41,172
- You smoke marijuana.
- That was Rock's.

743
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,717
And you lie. You scheme and scam.

744
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:48,095
What is good or decent about you?

745
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,681
What redemption can you expect?

746
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,768
Well, none, I guess, but look...
OK, you got a point.

747
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,146
I am a fuckin' weasel, there's no doubt.
But think about this.

748
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:02,151
If I went to church - I haven't been in 3O
years - but if I went and took confession...

749
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,613
If we took Communion together...
redemption. That would be great.

750
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,949
We could go to Archbishop Romero.
He likes me very much.

751
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:13,120
I could become a lay Catholic worker.
It'd be wonderful. I could get a basket...

752
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:18,292
I feel good about this. This redemption
thing is good. I feel cleansed already.

753
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,003
- You want some of this?
- No. No more marijuana.

754
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,965
I'm gonna talk to Archbishop Romero.

755
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,343
Maybe he could annul
my marriage to Claudia.

756
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,179
She was a Commie atheist anyway.

757
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,890
I'm gonna talk to him about this seriously.

758
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,477
Very good man. He's a man of the people.
He's a man of God.

759
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,397
They say he's gonna win
the Nobel peace prize.

760
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,775
Hey, what's this?
Another demonstration, Boyle?

761
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,212
Calm down. Take it easy.

762
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,673
Stop! Stop, please!

763
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,718
I have orders to evacuate the plaza
in five minutes. Do you understand me?

764
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,804
I have permission.

765
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:17,601
- Why don't you stop the repression?
- No matter. Five minutes or violence.

766
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,355
Why don't you do something
about the disappeared?

767
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,941
Violence! You understand me?

768
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,652
Stop the repression!

769
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,091
Do you follow in the way of Christ?

770
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,346
Not exactly. I mean, in my heart, yes...

771
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,016
...but I've done a lot of, you know...

772
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:05,399
...cardinal sins and I've drunk a lot
of alcohol and done some drugs.

773
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,736
I've weaselled around a lot in my life,
trying to get the edge...

774
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:12,281
...but basically I would say
that I'm a good-hearted person.

775
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,659
I haven't really done anything
malicious in my life.

776
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:18,704
I haven't done anything
very great in my life either.

777
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,540
I tried to do some things,
tried to find some truths.

778
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,752
And I do love this woman.
For her, I could...

779
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,047
- Are you willing to change for her?
- For her, yes.

780
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:30,382
I mean, not just... I would...

781
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,511
If God gave me this woman...

782
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,639
...then there must be a God.

783
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,937
So, if he knows what's right,
then I would do what's right by him.

784
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,439
Just repent. Change your ways.

785
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,942
That's gonna be a little tough.

786
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,072
You love this woman,
you will be willing to change.

787
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:58,410
OK. I can still drink and take a few hits
of a joint once in a while? That's OK?

788
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:04,416
Twelve Our Fathers, ten Hail Marys,
an act of contrition.

789
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,793
That's it?

790
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:08,796
Ask the Lord for forgiveness...

791
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,631
...from your heart.

792
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,675
From my heart?

793
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,889
If I'd known this, I would have
come earlier, before 33 years.

794
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,350
- You should have come earlier.
- I'll come back.

795
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,602
Next time, don't wait so long.

796
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:30,401
(In Spanish)
The governing junta has good intentions

797
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,486
with their promises of land reform...

798
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:37,575
...and their desire to control the so-called
paramilitary forces in the army.

799
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,536
But, sadly, it is a failure...

800
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,455
...because the power
within the junta is the army...

801
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:48,085
...and the army itself is an
obstacle to the reign of God.

802
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:50,963
They know only
how to repress the people...

803
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,340
...and defend the interests
of the rich oligarchy.

804
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,681
I have called upon
the United States, repeatedly...

805
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,392
...to stop military aid to this army...

806
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:07,855
...until it satisfactorily resolves
the problems of the Disappeared...

807
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,357
...and submits itself to civilian control.

808
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:14,695
When a dictatorship seriously
violates human rights...

809
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,239
...and attacks the common good
of the nation...

810
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:23,329
When it becomes unbearable
and closes all channels of dialogue...

811
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,290
When this happens, the Church speaks...

812
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:30,044
...for the rights of the victims
of the violence!

813
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,715
We are poor.

814
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,719
The people in Washington are so rich.

815
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,931
Why are they so blind?

816
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,770
My children.

817
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,274
You must look to yourselves...

818
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,736
...in this sad time for Salvador.

819
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:01,825
I wish to close with an appeal
to the men of the army...

820
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,748
...and in particular, the National Guard.

821
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:15,255
Brothers, you are a part of your people.

822
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:21,303
Yet you kill your own
brothers and sisters.

823
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:27,518
But before a man may kill,
the law of God must prevail.

824
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,771
And that law says "Thou shalt not kill".

825
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:35,526
No soldier is obliged to obey
an order against the law of God.

826
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:39,321
Violence on all sides is wrong.

827
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,782
Violence is wrong.

828
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:46,036
In the name of God, and in the name
of this suffering people...

829
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:50,290
...whose laments rise to heaven
each day more tumultuous...

830
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:54,086
...I beg you, I ask you...

831
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,964
...I order you in the name of God...

832
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,258
...stop the repression!

833
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:00,926
(murmuring)

834
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,935
(Organ music)

835
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,815
(priest gives blessing)

836
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,775
<i>(curses 'm Sparflsh) Pisado! Hijo de Puta!</i>

837
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,860

838
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,208

839
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,249
<i>Esta muerto.</i>

840
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:02,631
(In Spanish) Arrest him for the murder
of Archbishop Romero!

841
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,013
(through microphone) You W/// note
I <i>did</i> not agree with <i>the</i> bishop.

842
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,891
<i>He sometimes got carried away
with his politics.</i>

843
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,645
<i>He did not understand
that with the Left in power...</i>

844
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:03,734
<i>...there will be no Church in this country,
and he will be out of a job.</i>

845
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,492
<i>But in my book, it was the subversives
that killed him. No question!</i>

846
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,829
<i>To provoke this atmosphere, this chaos.</i>

847
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,294
(Boyle) It is rumoured that you
are the head of the death squads...

848
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:25,422
...terrorising the country.
Would you care to comment?

849
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,674
<i>Los escuadrones de Ia muerte.</i>

850
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,761
- I think you're pressing your luck, Boyle.
- Nice goin'.

851
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,180
<i>I really resent that question.</i>

852
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,307
Fuck off.

853
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,477
<i>Why do you never ask
the communists this?</i>

854
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:42,773
<i>They are not the only victims.
We have victims, too.</i>

855
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,487
<i>Senor, there are
no death squads in El Salvador.</i>

856
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,450
<i>The outrage of the people
against the Communist threat...</i>

857
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:57,037
<i>...cannot be stopped
or organised by anyone.</i>

858
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,961
(Pauline) Sir! Sir, the polls show you
trailing the Christian Democrats.

859
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:08,215
Are you sure you can still capture
both the Catholic and the woman's vote?

860
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,883
That's bullshit.

861
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:20,477
Do you mind? I'm gonna buy it
for my sister. That's great, huh?

862
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,396
Here he comes.

863
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,856
Mr Gomez! A question, please!

864
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,652
(In Spanish)
Get that piece of shit out of here!

865
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,494
(Gomez curses in Spanish)

866
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,080
Come on! What are you
gonna do about it?

867
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,875
- Gomez!
- Think about your image.

868
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:48,046
I'm gonna cut your balls off, Boyle!

869
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,424
Do it yourself!

870
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,140
Hi, are you guys from Washington? Huh?

871
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,860
You're a real pro, Boyle.

872
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,327
Doc! Where's Maria?

873
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,538
Boyle! Boyle!

874
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,874
- They found Carlos, man.
- Where?

875
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:27,794
He's fucked up. Over there, man.
He's really fucked up bad.

876
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,126
- Maria, please.
- Don't touch me!

877
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,712
- It's not my fault! He was acting stupid.
- Because of you he changed!

878
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:55,632
(In Spanish) Since you arrived
I have nothing but problems!

879
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,717
(Boyle) It wasn't my fault!

880
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,055
Great goin', Boyle. Have a drink.

881
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,644
Damn it.

882
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,941
I really love her, man.

883
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:17,737
She and the kids are the only decent thing
I ever fuckin' had in my whole life.

884
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,867
I don't know why I'm livin' any more.

885
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,960
Come on.

886
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,225
(Boyle belches)

887
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,570
- All I got is ten.
- 15.

888
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:02,574
Come on! I was only in there for five
minutes. The guy kept interrupting me.

889
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:06,620
I would have been outta there faster
if he didn't interrupt me. All I got is ten.

890
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,663
OK, ten.

891
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,544
Aie!

892
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:18,048
- (Cathy, assuring girl in Spanish)
- Si.

893
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,134
Aie!

894
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,519
<i>Un mas, pero Tic Tac, por favor.</i>

01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:35,607
<i>No, no. Yo page en dos menses.

896
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:40,612
- You asshole.
- Interest 50%. 50% interest.

897
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:45,158
You know what you just said? You said
you'd pay her in two menstrual cycles.

898
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:48,328
<i>Mama Monch, este reloj, eh?</i>

899
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:50,997
<i>2,000 dolares Americanos, eh?</i>

900
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,500
<i>Por un Tic Tac y dos cervezas eh?</i>

901
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,543
<i>Dos Cervezas!</i>

902
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,671
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

903
01:10:57,796 --> 01:10:59,756
Carmen.

904
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:03,176
José.

905
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:15,355
I'm sure you don't need it,
and I can't say I approve...

906
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,817
...but Merry Christmas, Richard.

907
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,578
Oh! Get over here. Get over here.

908
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,999
Get over here!

909
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,251
Oh, Richard.

910
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,920
Cathy, talk to Maria.

911
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:44,342
I gotta get Maria back.
Talk to Father Paul. She'll listen to him.

912
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,263
Richard, you're 42 years old. You're old
enough to be her father. Forget her.

913
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,349
- I'm in love with her!
- I love you, Richie.

914
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:57,188
Father Paul has to follow
the papal orders. There's...

915
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:58,815
Agh!

916
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,485
I hate that. I hate when you do that.
So much. I...

917
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:07,866
- What about your other wife and kid?
- She left me. She took my kid.

918
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,036
So what are you gonna do?
Bring Maria back to the States?

919
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:15,623
What's she gonna do up there, Richard?
Sell snow cones on Fisherman's Wharf?

920
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:18,418
Down here, she has a purpose,
she has a reason.

921
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:21,921
- In gringo-land, she's a fish out of water.
- I know...

922
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:25,925
And besides, asshole, you don't have
enough money to support her or your kid.

923
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:31,264
I need to talk to you about my whole life.
It's such a mess. I'm disgusting!

924
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,683
Richard, what are you doing here?

925
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:38,605
- You're not making it as a journalist.
- I'll make it again.

926
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:41,149
I will make it... again.

927
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,618
The white hand has been
painted on the parish-house wall.

928
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,413
The altar boy is dead.

929
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,459
And the fuckin' Peace Corps
has moved out.

930
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,589
I love it here.

931
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,426
I just can't go back.

932
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,805
I know. I love it here, too.

933
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:18,395
- Will you have dinner with me?
- No.

934
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,563
- Tomorrow night?
- No. I really can't.

935
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,607
Besides, you smell.

936
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:26,778
I gotta go to the airport tomorrow.
Two of the nuns are in from Nicaragua.

937
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,864
- Sometime?
- Maybe.

938
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:34,202
OK, you... you be careful
on that road to the airport, OK?

939
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,329
Yeah.

940
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:52,262
Wait a minute. I'll walk you to your car.

941
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,608
Merry Christmas, Richard.

942
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,069
- You be good.
- I will.

943
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,196
I don't trust you.

944
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,034
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

945
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,548
Oops.

946
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:32,927
Gringo.

947
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,724
What do you say you and I take
a walk down by the beach, gringo?

948
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,186
I'm not going to the beach with you.

949
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:46,733
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm not only a fuckin' Irishman, I'm a...

950
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,737
I'm a fuckin' Viking.

951
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,867
I'll take as many of these creeps
to fuckin' Valhalla as I can!

952
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,994
(In Spanish) Stop. I want this asshole alive.

953
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:02,916
You got a big mouth, Boyle. Major Max
is the person for you. Come to the beach.

954
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:09,214
Come on, cocksucker! You're gonna have
to kill me. You ain't takin' me alive!

955
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:11,216
Agh!

956
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,428
(Shouts in Spanish)

957
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:30,193
You wanna play a fuckin' game, Boyle?

958
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,612
Yeah.

959
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,281
OK. First I'll take your arms.

960
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,825
Then I'll take your legs.

961
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:40,411
Then I'll take your balls.
Sounds like a fun game?

962
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,455
<i>Deialo! Dejalo!</i>

963
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,086
OK, Cocksuckers.

964
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,463
How do you like these odds, huh?

965
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,466
<i>Por favor.</i>

966
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,386
(In Spanish) He's worthless.

967
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,308
You are an important man.

968
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:07,981
A photograph for me, please?

969
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,570
OK.

970
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,490
<i>Gracias.</i>

971
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,164
<i>Bueno.</i>

972
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:29,335
Enough!

973
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,214
Let's go. We'll take care of him later.

974
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,300
<i>Gracias.</i>

975
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:37,594
Boyle, I'll be back for you.

976
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:48,521
<i>P/nch/ gringo, marijuana cabron!
(laughs)</i>

977
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:51,065
Up yours, too, Jack.

978
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,212
There we go.

979
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:18,760
- How was Nicaragua?
- Oh, bad. There's no gasoline.

980
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,888
People have to line up
for hours to get their food.

981
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,973
The war has been very destructive.

982
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:28,728
But on the other hand, there's been no
political execution of the Somazastias.

983
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:32,690
I can't believe this. Looks like police.
Get your passports ready, sisters.

984
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:34,734
(Siren)

985
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,996
We have done nothing.

986
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,212
I am a very good friend
of Ambassador Kelly.

987
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,256
You're going to be in a lot of trouble
when he hears about this.

988
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:02,428
The fiesta is just beginning, hey?

989
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,557
<i>Vamos!</i>

990
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,344
(Pauline) The bodies of four American women,
missing since Tuesday...

991
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,264
...were found here today
in a roadside grave...

992
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:33,227
...25 miles east of San Salvador.
The victims were identified as...

993
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,537
I just heard that five guards did it for
15 colones and a bottle of Tic Tac each.

994
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:55,416
They got this clown, the mayor,
to sign the death certificates.

995
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,753
- Will he talk?
- Not if we can't keep him alive.

996
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:02,882
- What are the chances of that?
- Slim to none, and he knows it.

997
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,928
He had no business signing
death certificates without an autopsy.

998
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:10,723
I want one now, and I wanna know if
those bullets are rebel or government!

999
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,893
You knew Cathy pretty well, didn't you?

1000
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:18,189
What do you think? Rumour has it
they may have run the roadblock...

1001
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,858
...and there was an exchange of gunfire.

1002
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:33,788
- The doctors won't do it because they...
- They don't have the surgical mask.

1003
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,749
OK, pal. OK. All right!

1004
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,877
(In Spanish) Why don't they
have their surgical masks?

1005
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,214
I'm recommending we cut off all aid.

1006
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,426
Sir, they were coming in from Managua.
They were Communist-oriented.

1007
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:50,304
Maybe they got spooked at the roadblock.

1008
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,557
Maybe they were packing,
and it got out of control.

1009
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:55,726
Pistol-packing nuns, my ass!

1010
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:58,521
I knew Cathy Moore.
You can't sell me that shit.

1011
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:02,108
Sir, General Garcia has assured me
of a complete investigation.

1012
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:05,111
That's great. We'll let the fox
investigate the chicken coop.

1013
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,446
You must think I'm pretty stupid.

1014
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:11,951
I know all about you. Reagan's little
transition team came here last month...

1015
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:16,372
...to talk to Major Max without checking
in with me. It's all going in my report.

1016
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:21,127
Whatever you did, you gave a clear signal
to the Arana people, and it resulted in this.

1017
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:21,956
(Spanish) We want to do a real in-depth
and sympathetic portrait...

1018
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,378
For the first time,
our four armies are united.

1019
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,716
We now control the northern third
of Chalatenango province in the west...

1020
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:34,593
...and Morazon province in the east.

1021
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:40,266
We're asking government troops to join
our offensive, and the people to rise up.

1022
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:45,438
We will take all major cities:
Santa Ana, San Vicente, San Miguel.

1023
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,024
Then San Salvador will fall.

1024
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:52,111
- When, Captain?
- Before Reagan.

1025
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:57,241
Then you think you're ready?
With 4,000 troops, take all of El Salvador?

1026
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,243
The odds are the Pentagon
won't let that happen, sir.

1027
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:04,582
The will of the people and the march
of history cannot be changed.

1028
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,209
Not even by the North Americanos.

1029
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:13,966
- (In Spanish) What does it say?
- Leticia cleans her gun.

1030
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,836
- Be careful on your way out of here.
- Don't worry. I've been doing this a while.

1031
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,839
- Thanks, huh?
- OK. Bye-bye.

1032
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:14,401
This doesn't show much.
I really stuck my neck out for you, Boyle.

1033
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:18,447
You're not too popular around here.
Where were these taken?

1034
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:21,033
I can't tell you that.
But it's mostly old stuff:

1035
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:24,537
...shotguns, bolt-action rifles,
captured Belgian FLNs...

1036
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:27,456
...120 Mike-Mikes ripped off
government troops.

1037
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,876
- Any anti aircraft stuff? Any SAMs?
- Nothing.

1038
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,921
<i>- Buenos dias, Guillermo.
- Buenos dias, Jorge.</i>

1039
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,551
OK, so what about it? How about
a cedula for my woman and her two kids?

1040
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:44,056
There's not much here,
or you're not telling us everything.

1041
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:48,686
- What about recoilless rifles, RPGs?
- They're in shit shape. They get nothing.

1042
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,313
When are you gonna
believe what you see...

1043
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:53,858
...and not what military intelligence
tells you to think?

1044
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:59,029
We got AWACS, infrared, statements
from a detecting FRAN commandant...

1045
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:01,740
...and enough military intel to prove...

1046
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:04,952
...that this ain't civil war,
but outright Commie aggression.

1047
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,454
You guys have lied about
that from the beginning.

1048
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:11,458
You have not presented one shred
of proof to the American public...

1049
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,628
...that this is anything but
a legitimate peasant revolution.

1050
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,423
So don't preach to me
about military intelligence.

1051
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:20,134
Not after Chile and Vietnam.
I was there, remember?

1052
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:24,597
- I personally resent that kind of shit.
- Then resent it, OK?

1053
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:29,852
You lied about the number of advisors
here, about the trainers here on TTY...

1054
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,771
...about switching
"humanitarian" assistance money...

1055
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:34,690
...to Salvadoran military coffers.

1056
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,401
You said this war can be
won militarily. It can't.

1057
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:41,614
- Of course it can!
- Calm down, Boyle. I'm sorry.

1058
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:45,159
I'm not listening to this wino
journalist's left-wing Commie crap.

1059
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:48,996
We know where his sympathies lie.
I don't even see why we're talking to him.

1060
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:53,125
Look, Richard. You saw Marti.

1061
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:55,794
- We know they're starting an offensive...
- Hey!

1062
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:58,047
I'm not a fuckin' spy for you guys.

1063
01:26:58,172 --> 01:27:01,342
Left wing, Colonel? Well, maybe.
But I'm not a Communist.

1064
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:05,137
You guys never ever seem
to be able to tell the difference.

1065
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:07,640
I love my country as much as you do.

1066
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:12,102
You are the ones who trained Major Max
in the Police Academy in Washington.

1067
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:15,940
You trained Jose Medrano and
Rene Chacon. You trained them...

1068
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:19,610
...how to torture and kill. You sent them
here, and what did Chacon give us?

1069
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,862
He gave us the Mano Blanco.

1070
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:25,157
What are the death squads
but the brainchild of the CIA?

1071
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:28,702
- You run with them, they're anti-Moscow.
- Bullshit!

1072
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:32,122
You let them close the universities,
wipe out the best minds here...

1073
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:35,251
- Bullshit!
- ..wipe out the Catholic Church.

1074
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:38,003
You let them do it
all because they aren't Commies.

1075
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,339
And that, Colonel, is bullshit.

1076
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,386
You've created Major Frankenstein.

1077
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:48,722
- We can control him.
- Like you control the Major Maxes...

1078
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:52,810
- Well, look who's here.
- ..in Chile and Guatemala and Argentina?

1079
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,063
What about Pol Pot and Castro?
Are they any better?

1080
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,066
Pol Pot and Castro?
I don't know if they're better.

1081
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:02,528
All I know is that some campes/no
who can't read or write...

1082
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:06,365
...or feed his own family,
has to watch his kid die of malnutrition.

1083
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,868
Do you think he gives a shit
about Marxism or capitalism?

1084
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:13,372
It was that kind of thinking
that lost us Vietnam, this guilt shit.

1085
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:17,293
You liberal assholes! What the hell
do you think the KGB's doing?

1086
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:19,086
Is that why you're here?

1087
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:22,298
A post-Vietnam experience -
you need a rerun or something?

1088
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:24,675
You pour 120 million bucks
into this place...

1089
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,387
...turn it into a military zone,
so you can have chopper parades?

1090
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:32,141
- You're blowin' it out your ass.
- You just bring misery to these people.

1091
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:36,937
I don't wanna see another Vietnam. I don't
wanna see America get another bad rap.

1092
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:40,107
I lost my hearing in this ear over there.
What did I do that for?

1093
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,943
$15 a photo from Pacific News Service?

1094
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,323
I did it because I believe in America.

1095
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,576
I believe that we stand for something.

1096
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,954
For a constitution.

1097
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:59,084
For human rights - not just for a few
people, but for everybody on this planet.

1098
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,006
Jack“.

1099
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:08,010
...you gotta think of the people first.

1100
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:13,098
In the name of human decency, which we
Americans are supposed to believe in...

1101
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:16,518
...you gotta at least try
and make a just society here.

1102
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:20,439
Look, Richard,
it's all part of our national plan.

1103
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,109
We do do a lot of good down here.

1104
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:27,946
I'm often asked by people like yourself
to examine my conscience.

1105
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:31,241
- Every now and then, I do examine it.
- What do you find, Jack?

1106
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:35,204
That whatever mistakes
we make down here...

1107
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:38,290
...the alternative would be ten times worse.

1108
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:46,173
Maybe I'll just forge
a cedula for my girlfriend.

1109
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:52,137
They're on the house.

1110
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,641
Boyle!

1111
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,311
Boyle!

1112
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,982
There's something that you should know.

1113
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,985
My Salvo counterparts
are mighty pissed...

1114
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:10,280
...about muy ma/o per/od/stas
going out with the terrorists.

1115
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:13,575
If they can catch one of 'em,
they'll make a lesson out of him.

1116
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:18,747
I'll get out of your hair, OK? Just get me
a cedula for my girlfriend and her two kids.

1117
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,626
Getting a cedula for your whore
is the least of your problems.

1118
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,504
Personally, I don't give a shit
if they kill you or not.

1119
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:28,507
I happen to hate the species
you belong to.

1120
01:30:28,966 --> 01:30:31,552
But I'm telling you, they're serious.

1121
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:36,557
If I were you, I'd get my rubber shoes on
and get to the airport.

1122
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:40,477
You're gonna fit in here really well,
you know that?

1123
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,563
You sound just like another gangster.

1124
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,899
Dumb fuck!

1125
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:49,528
A panning shot for the beginning
of the interview, OK?

1126
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,740
(Pauline) Could you tell me
your name, please?

1127
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,367
(Soldier) Sorry, we can't speak to the press.

1128
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,870
Thank you, Private. Appreciate it.

1129
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,206
- Can you tell me your name, please.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot.

1130
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:05,127
- How about saying where you're from?
- OK. Long Island, New York.

1131
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:08,046
Thanks. Welcome to El Salvador.
What do you think so far?

1132
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:11,091
It's not bad, but I'm anxious
to watch the Giants game.

1133
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,720
- Know where a TV is?
- I dunno. Maybe you'll get a hold of one.

1134
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:18,056
Excuse me, Colonel.
Hi. I'm from A&S News.

1135
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:22,352
Can you tell me if this signals a build-up
of US combat troops in El Salvador?

1136
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:24,813
Ma'am, these are not combat troops.

1137
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,776
They are trainers, officially authorised
by Congress. I have no further comment.

1138
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:33,697
Thank you, sir. This is Pauline Axelrod,
A&S News, San Salvador.

1139
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,742
Listen. You've got one thing going for you.

1140
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:40,496
Maria still cares about you. She does!

1141
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:45,167
If I were you, I'd straighten out my act
and go back to that woman on my knees.

1142
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:47,711
Doc, please.

1143
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,631
All right. Just trying to help you.

1144
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,466
DQC!

1145
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:55,636
- Wilma, hi! How are you?
- Fine.

1146
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:59,014
- Boyle, did you meet Wilma?
- Hola.

1147
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:02,684
- Wilma from the Panama Club?
- Yeah. She's straightened up her act.

1148
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:05,771
Hey, look at this. Bagel II.

1149
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:07,940
- Like the dog?
- That's great, Doc.

1150
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:11,318
- Come on...
- She wants to take me shopping.

1151
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:15,447
- Can you do something about the drinks?
- Yeah. A couple of bucks...

1152
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:18,534
- What's this?
- She had a long career.

1153
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:22,454
Thanks, Doc.

1154
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:30,337
- Hey, Rich! You still got your wheels?
- Yeah.

1155
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,465
The G's just hit Santa Ana.

1156
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:36,635
- Wait! John! I gotta stop in La Libertad.
- No.

1157
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,971
- I gotta see Maria.
- No.

1158
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:42,349
- Then go without me.
- All right. Come on.

1159
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,644
(honks horn)

1160
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:07,934
(Spanish) Can we take photos?

1161
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:12,814
Go ahead, yes.

1162
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:25,535
(gunfire)

1163
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:00,946
<i>Son periodistas!</i>

1164
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:05,200
<i>Periodistas!</i>

1165
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:12,499
<i>Periodistas! Don't harm us'.!</i>

1166
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:19,631
<i>Que pais?</i>

1167
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,721
<i>- Que pais?
- Periodistas! Estados Unidos!</i>

1168
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:50,996
John!

1169
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:55,125
Look.

1170
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:07,429
John. John, wait!

1171
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,891
Wait! John!

1172
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,352
John!

1173
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:20,108
- You fuckin' fool! You're not that magic.
- Today I am, Boyle.

1174
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:07,572
The Sandinistas have entered the war.
Major equipment is being unloaded.

1175
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,866
- Possibly troops, too.
- Any backup on this?

1176
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:14,329
There's no time. Santa Ana has fallen,
and the country's split in half.

1177
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:18,959
The situation is deteriorating faster than
expected. El Salvador will fall in 48 hours.

1178
01:37:19,084 --> 01:37:21,545
24. Their air force
has got no ammo, no gas.

1179
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:24,464
We either restore military aid now
or go to phase three.

1180
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:25,924
The 82nd Airborne is on alert...

1181
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:28,009
...and the Marines are in position
on the Ranger.

1182
01:37:28,552 --> 01:37:32,556
- What do you wanna do, sir?
- I won't get steamrollered into anything.

1183
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:37,143
- Now, substantiate this Nicaraguan stuff.
- Sir, we can't. That would take days.

1184
01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:40,230
Sir, if we don't give
the order to evacuate soon...

1185
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:44,234
...I can't be responsible for the safety
of the embassy or the American community.

1186
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:50,407
Tom, we all know you'll be leaving here
in a couple of days. That's not the issue.

1187
01:37:50,532 --> 01:37:53,994
The issue is do you want
to go down in the history books...

1188
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:56,580
...as the man who lost El Salvador?

1189
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:02,252
That's hardly the issue here.
We're talking about human lives here!

1190
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:04,504
We're not playing some computer game.

1191
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:06,840
Jesus, history books!

1192
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,551
GQd!

1193
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,752
The line is dead, sir.

1194
01:38:45,879 --> 01:38:47,756
Where the fuck are the Americans?

1195
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:07,359
Sir, you have a decision to make.

1196
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:13,865
All right.

1197
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,909
OK.

1198
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,621
I'll recommend that we restore
all military aid.

1199
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:24,250
Give the order to release
the fuel and armaments at Ilopango.

1200
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,504
Yes, sir.

1201
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:01,246
(Spanish) Figueroa's coming!

1202
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:07,585
Figueroa's broken through.

1203
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:11,006
They're coming! Tanks!

1204
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:16,261
Don't let Figueroa pass!
I'll hold the front.

1205
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:19,431
- What about the prisoners?
- I'll take care of them.

1206
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:25,520
- My 120's fucked up.
(engine approaching)

1207
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,565
Tanks?

1208
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:31,026
- Panhards.
- Shit.

1209
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,862
John, can you lay
two more rolls of Tri-X on me?

1210
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:35,947
(gunshot)

1211
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:42,162
(gunshot)

1212
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,087
(In Spanish) No pictures.

1213
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:56,301
This your sense of justice?

1214
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:58,261
(Spanish) It's necessary.
Get them out of here.

1215
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,806
You've become just like them!

1216
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:05,727
It's war! If you don't have
the stomach for it, get out!

1217
01:41:07,187 --> 01:41:09,230
(In Spanish) I never hurt anybody!

1218
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,484
Please, in the name of God...

1219
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,069
(gunshot)

1220
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:16,571
You've become just like them!

1221
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:33,625
Fuck!

1222
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:47,805
Can you believe this?

1223
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:59,817
John!John,no.

1224
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:05,406
John!

1225
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:09,118
John!John!

1226
01:44:23,633 --> 01:44:26,678
Oh, Jesus. God! Oh God, John.

1227
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,684
(machine-gun fire)

1228
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,857
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

1229
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:49,826
Breathe out. Breathe out.

1230
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,954
Can you breathe? Can you breathe?

1231
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,166
Can you breathe? OK.

1232
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,592
I got the... I got the shot, Boyle.

1233
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:09,095
You got the shot.

1234
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:13,224
- Take it to New York.
- I'll get it to New York.

1235
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:27,530
Got it.

1236
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:33,995
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. God.

1237
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:38,249
John, you got the magic shot.

1238
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,169
You got it. You're the best.

1239
01:45:49,052 --> 01:45:52,263
We did it, didn't We? We did it.

1240
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:15,119
Come on, man. Don't wipe it
on your thing. Clean it.

1241
01:46:16,496 --> 01:46:20,124
- Rich, you OK? You all right?
- Give me a valium, will ya? Anythin'.

1242
01:46:20,249 --> 01:46:23,503
- Here. I got somethin' for you.
- Papa, que <i>pasa?</i>

1243
01:46:23,628 --> 01:46:25,922
Here. There's two.

1244
01:46:26,047 --> 01:46:28,549
Goddamn, it looks horrible.

1245
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:32,637
Hey, where are you goin'?
Where are you goin'?

1246
01:46:32,804 --> 01:46:34,806
Oh, great. Is that OK?

1247
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:37,308
It's all right. It'll be all right.

1248
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:40,395
Look, I got some good news for you.
Look what I got.

1249
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:43,147
The bruja gave me some cedulas
for Maria and the kids.

1250
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:49,487
She did a pretty good job, man, really.
And look. I got your exit visa forged, too.

1251
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:54,283
She kind of fucked up on that, but I think
it's gonna be all right. I think it'll work.

1252
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,704
- Good.
- Look, you gotta get outta here, man.

1253
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:01,833
The police were at Roberto's
last night lookin' for you.

1254
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:04,127
They said you were
in the country illegally.

1255
01:47:04,252 --> 01:47:08,339
Roberto said he thinks you're dead.
So you got to get outta here.

1256
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,182
OK.

1257
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:22,645
When we get there, hang back.

1258
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:27,400
If there's any trouble, call Kelly.
If Kelly's gone, Morgan'll help.

1259
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:30,027
- Got it?
- OK. I heard you the first time.

1260
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:34,282
Doc, I'm tellin' you, take care of yourself,
man. Don't stay here too long.

1261
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:37,160
- Hey, come on.
- They kill people here.

1262
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:39,162
What? You believe everything
you read in the papers?

1263
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:44,208
- I'll miss you, Doc.
- Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:47,336
Shit. Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

1265
01:47:52,925 --> 01:47:55,887
Is that my watch? Give it to me.
I'll need it at the border.

1266
01:47:57,889 --> 01:47:59,307
You cheap son of a bitch.

1267
01:48:00,183 --> 01:48:02,393
You say hi to gringo-land for me.

1268
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:06,397
<i>Adios, hasta Iuego. Via con... dos.</i>

1269
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:08,691
<i>- Vaya con Dios.
- (Doc) Vaya con Dios.</i>

1270
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:10,818
You guys be careful.

1271
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,891
Jefe!

1272
01:48:44,936 --> 01:48:46,395
- <i>Que pasa?</i>
<i>- Cheque esto, jefe.</i>

1273
01:49:06,749 --> 01:49:07,583
It's fake.

1274
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:15,383
All right. Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
It was a rush job.

1275
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:18,761
I have to get back to America.
I'm a very important journalist.

1276
01:49:18,844 --> 01:49:22,014
Newsweek. Understand? Newsweek.

1277
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:25,142
Time. CBS. Big shots.

1278
01:49:26,686 --> 01:49:28,187
<i>Importante.</i>

1279
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:33,317
<i>Per/od/sta importante Americana.</i>

1280
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:37,989
(Maria pleads in Spanish)

1281
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:40,032
Maria, Maria.

1282
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:43,786
- Where's he going?
- Te/efono.

1283
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:47,081
Capital.

1284
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:50,293
God. I have an important
appointment in the capital...

1285
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:54,505
...with Ambassador Kelly
and Mr Jose Duarte.

1286
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:57,383
Why don't you hold that? And, um...

1287
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:10,187
<i>A donde vas?
(Continues in Spanish)</i>

1288
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:22,116
(Spanish) Check this bastard's cases.

1289
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:27,663
I'm a big fan of the Raiders, actually.

1290
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:33,169
- He's got loads in here.
- Check the cameras.

1291
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:39,634
The ambassador. You know,
United States embassy. Hello? Hello?

1292
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:43,137
<i>(Boyle) Mira. Am/go de Major Max.</i>

1293
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:46,766
(In Spanish) I like the White Hand a lot.

1294
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:50,269
(Sings) Tremble, tremble, Communists.

1295
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:53,189
With the instincts of animals.

1296
01:50:56,192 --> 01:51:00,571
The Mano Blanco doesn't hate you.
But you make trouble for Mr Gomez.

1297
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:04,909
- Gomez is a friend of mine.
- That's why he wants you dead.

1298
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:07,453
(In Spanish) Shut up asshole!

1299
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,538
What's in your boots?

1300
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:19,256
Do not move bastard!

1301
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:23,260
Oh, God. Not that film!
That's the best war film of the year!

1302
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:25,388
Shut up asshole!

1303
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:30,976
Cassady died getting it,
you motherfucker!

1304
01:51:31,102 --> 01:51:34,772
Fuck you! He died getting that film!

1305
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:38,234
Fuck you! Fuck you, Cocksuckers!

1306
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:43,280
Boyle is about to fuckin' die.
And if he does, man, if he does...

1307
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:47,159
...your next job'll be in Redonda
counting fuckin' spears! Understand?

1308
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:49,453
Get the fuckin' ambassador
on the phone now!

1309
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:14,019
<i>A qui. A den fro.</i>

1310
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:29,160
<i>Me gustan Ios huevos rancheros.</i>

1311
01:52:32,872 --> 01:52:34,999
OK, I'm not kidding.

1312
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:39,754
I got $50,000 in traveller's cheques.

1313
01:52:39,879 --> 01:52:43,841
They're hidden, like,
two kilometres from here.

1314
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:46,343
You lie, stupid gringo.

1315
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:48,763
(In Spanish) Do not fuck with me.

1316
01:52:48,846 --> 01:52:51,849
Don't castrate him in here.
You'll make a mess.

1317
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:56,020
(Guards arguing in Spanish)

1318
01:53:01,192 --> 01:53:06,614
Yeah, well, you tell General Martinez that
I am still the ambassador for another day.

1319
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,699
I want those people outta there now

1320
01:53:08,824 --> 01:53:12,578
or I'll make it the worst day
of his fuckin' life.

1321
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,877
Fuck it. Let's get it over with.

1322
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,213
(cocks gun)

1323
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:28,219
(Clicks)

1324
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:31,222
Chinga to madre, que pasa con este

1325
01:53:31,347 --> 01:53:32,223
Are you kidding?

1326
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:34,725
(In Spanish) It's not working.
Why didn't you clean it?

1327
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:37,728
- It's not my fault boss.
- It is not my rifle.

1328
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:41,148
(cocks gun)

1329
01:53:43,526 --> 01:53:44,902
<i>Chinga tu madre.</i>

1330
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:48,906
<i>Pedro! Cometiste un error.
No ha hecho nada.</i>

1331
01:53:49,073 --> 01:53:51,826
(In Spanish, explaining)
Hap/do!

1332
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:07,591
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1333
01:54:09,802 --> 01:54:12,179
A little American trick here.

1334
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:21,272
You know what that means?
It means you're all stupid Cocksuckers.

1335
01:54:21,397 --> 01:54:24,108
<i>Vamos a brindar
por los huevos rancheros.</i>

1336
01:54:26,402 --> 01:54:28,487
I hope you get anal herpes.

1337
01:54:30,614 --> 01:54:31,740
Next.

1338
01:54:32,658 --> 01:54:36,495
- Where have you been, sir?
- Just to Nogales for the afternoon.

1339
01:54:37,413 --> 01:54:41,542
- Did you take the roast out of the oven?
- Yes, honey. I took care of it.

1340
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:47,631
- When are we going to Disneyland?
- Disneyland. I don't know. Next month.

1341
01:54:47,756 --> 01:54:51,135
- This kid is spoiled, I'm tellin' ya.
- OK. Next.

1342
01:54:55,306 --> 01:54:58,100
- Come on.
- Where have you been, ma'am?

1343
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:02,479
<i>- (Boyle) Todo es muy b/en mi amor?
- (Maria) Yes.</i>

1344
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:07,151
(Maria) I always dreamed
to come to California.

1345
01:55:07,276 --> 01:55:11,238
(Boyle) It's a wacko joint.
Not like El Salvador.

1346
01:55:12,323 --> 01:55:14,909
You can be what you want here.
You can do what you want.

1347
01:55:15,451 --> 01:55:18,120
Long as you got the money.

1348
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:24,001
I'll get some of my Salvador stories
published. I could write a story on John.

1349
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:27,129
I think we're gonna be OK. Yeah.

1350
01:55:28,005 --> 01:55:30,382
I think we're gonna be OK.

1351
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:36,096
Why are we stopping here?

1352
01:55:45,522 --> 01:55:49,026
Ladies and gentlemen, don't be alarmed.
Just a routine immigration check.

1353
01:55:53,197 --> 01:55:57,451
- May I see your ID, sir?
- Yeah, sure. Will a driver's license do?

1354
01:55:57,993 --> 01:56:00,537
Just took the wife and the kids
to Nogales for the day.

1355
01:56:01,622 --> 01:56:05,125
- Is that right? Are you his wife?
- What is he saying?

1356
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:09,129
- Of course she is. Is there a problem?
- May I see some sort of identification?

1357
01:56:09,296 --> 01:56:11,256
What is he saying?

1358
01:56:11,382 --> 01:56:16,053
<i>- Papeles. Passaporte. Carta Verde.
- No tengo nada!</i>

1359
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:23,102
What is the problem here? She's with me.
She's been through hell in El Salvador.

1360
01:56:23,227 --> 01:56:25,479
I'm a journalist. She's my researcher.

1361
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,023
So I don't understand
what the problem is here.

1362
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:30,734
Will you come with me, please?
Bring the children.

1363
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:33,779
<i>Venga con migo
y traiga Ios ni-as, por favor.</i>

1364
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:36,865
Please.

1365
01:56:38,826 --> 01:56:41,412
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

1366
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:43,998
- Sit down, sir. Please.
- Officer, wait a minute.

1367
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:47,209
- Sit down.
- OK, but I just wanna tell you she's...

1368
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:49,878
Richard, OK, stop it. I go.

1369
01:56:50,004 --> 01:56:53,257
- I go. Take care.
- Maria, wait.

1370
01:56:53,424 --> 01:56:56,885
I go. I'll be all right, OK?
Just take care of yourself.

1371
01:56:57,011 --> 01:57:00,931
<i>Vamos, Duglas. Nos tenemos
que ir a casa. Vamos rapido.</i>

1372
01:57:01,098 --> 01:57:04,518
Maria! If you send her back,
they will kill her.

1373
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:08,814
They will rape her and they will mutilate
her if you send her back there. Maria!

1374
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:11,233
If you send the kids back,
they'll kill 'em too!

1375
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:15,029
- You don't know what it's like there!
- You're under arrest.

1376
01:57:15,154 --> 01:57:18,449
- You have no idea what it's like there!
- Move it!

1377
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,576
You have no idea!

1378
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:23,245
Maria!

1379
01:57:25,956 --> 01:57:27,916
Maria!

1380
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:35,758
Checkpoint. Three illegals:
one female Latino and two children.

1381
01:57:35,883 --> 01:57:37,843
Bringing 'em in.

1382
01:57:41,263 --> 01:57:44,391
One WMA. One Boyle, Richard.

1383
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:47,311
Birth date: 2-26-43.

1384
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:50,397
Check. Ten-four.

1385
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:58,363
Get him in.
