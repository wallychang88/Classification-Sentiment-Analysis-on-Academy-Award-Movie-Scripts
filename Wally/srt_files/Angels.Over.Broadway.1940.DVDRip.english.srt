1
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,683
<i>Go on, soak them.</i>

2
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,562
<i>The wetter they get, the better I like it.</i>

3
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,260
<i>There´s no money under those umbrellas.</i>
<i>Lot of goops crawling around in the rain.</i>

4
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,731
<i>That´s a laugh.</i>
<i>I ain´t even got an umbrella.</i>

5
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,434
<i>Seven bucks...</i>

6
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:12,370
...The Last of the Mohicans.

7
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,878
<i>Looks like I gotta promote something.</i>

8
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,147
<i>Look at her gol</i>

9
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:20,153
<i>Come on, baby, roll them outl</i>
<i>That´s what this town is...</i>

10
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,382
<i>...a dice game.</i>

11
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,915
<i>Come on, you seven. Rain me a seven.</i>

12
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:31,327
<i>Don´t get any sevens holding out a tin cup.</i>

13
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,799
<i>There must be a seven</i>
<i>rolling for me somewhere.</i>

14
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,321
You found out.

15
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,250
Yes, we found out.

16
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,293
$3,000 stolen by my friend.

17
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,188
My old friend...

18
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:40,564
...a man l took off the streets
when he didn<i>´</i>t have a job.

19
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,535
What are you going to do?

20
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:45,967
Go on, call the police.

21
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:50,841
Remember when you came to me and said,
<i>´´</i>Hopper, she loves me.

22
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,574
<i>´´</i>This beautiful woman loves me...

23
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:55,476
<i>´´...</i>and we<i>´</i>re gonna get married<i>.´´</i>

24
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,778
Shut up.

25
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,311
Don<i>´</i>t talk about her.

26
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:02,885
Did you ever ask me up to your house
after you got married?

27
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,387
No, not once.

28
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,818
You were ashamed of me in front of her.

29
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,989
l wasn<i>´</i>t good enough for her.

30
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,529
Then comes the laugh.

31
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,499
You weren<i>´</i>t good enough, either.

32
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,432
But Hopper<i>´</i>s money,
that was plenty good enough.

33
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:23,238
The money that the fat man made
by working hard, night and day.

34
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,236
That was fine for her.

35
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:27,975
She didn<i>´</i>t mind stealing this money, huh?

36
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,246
She didn<i>´</i>t steal anything, it was me.

37
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,811
Look at him, he still loves her.
Answer me, you still love her?

38
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,016
She gave the money to Mr. Morgan,
didn<i>´</i>t she?

39
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,853
That<i>´</i>s what you stole money for,
so she should give it to the man she loves.

40
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,929
Here<i>´</i>s his announcement.

41
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,925
<i>´´</i>We are pleased to announce the opening
of Dan Morgan<i>´</i>s beauty parlor...

42
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,366
<i>´´...</i>March 30<i>.´´</i>

43
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:53,338
You<i>´</i>re going to see her tonight again,
free this time, shouldn<i>´</i>t cost me anything.

44
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:57,340
You<i>´</i>re going to tell her
that Hopper wants his $3,000 back.

45
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,971
You<i>´</i>ll tell her
that if Hopper don<i>´</i>t get it back...

46
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:03,710
...he<i>´</i>ll call the police to send his partner
and his partner<i>´</i>s wife to jail.

47
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,809
Both together.

48
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:07,384
l got the right. l got the evidence.

49
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:08,714
That<i>´</i>s all.

50
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,826
Tomorrow morning at 6:00,
l<i>´</i>ll be sitting in my office...

51
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:22,402
...and you<i>´</i>ll bring me the money from her.
Tell her Hopper isn<i>´</i>t at her feet crying...

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,371
...but standing up
with a policeman beside him...

53
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,067
...waiting to arrest you and her together.

54
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,344
6:00 in my office.

55
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,679
$3,000.

56
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,415
-Where to, mister?
-Uptown.

57
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,540
-$5, got anything smaller?
-That<i>´</i>s all right, keep the change.

58
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,423
Check your things, sir?

59
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,827
Coat, please.

60
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,473
Excuse me.

61
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:46,179
Cigarettes?

62
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,653
-$20. Just a moment, l<i>´</i>ll get your change.
-Never mind, keep the change.

63
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,715
Gee, thanks.

64
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,487
-Have you any reservations?
-No.

65
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,455
Emil...

66
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,961
...find a good table for this gentleman.

67
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,561
Right this way, sir.

68
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,768
Have a good time, sir.

69
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,175
Wasn<i>´</i>t that the strangest thing?
$20, without even giving me a second look.

70
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,548
l thought he was some sort of a tramp.

71
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,252
Just goes to show
you can<i>´</i>t trust your eyes in this town.

72
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,855
-Do you know him, Vincent?
-No, l never saw him before.

73
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,729
But l knew he was somebody
the way he looked at me.

74
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,638
Hello. Sunset Hotel? Room 1007, please.
Bill O<i>´</i>Brien calling.

75
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,981
Hello, Dutch? Bill O<i>´</i>Brien.

76
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,555
l<i>´</i>m over at the Pigeon Club
taking in the sights...

77
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:09,562
...and l ran into something
that l thought might be of interest to us.

78
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:13,658
An out-of-town job
came snow-shoeing in here a while ago...

79
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,964
...and throwing money around
like birdseed.

80
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,799
Never saw him before, strictly a hick.

81
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:26,236
Say, l wouldn<i>´</i>t fool a pal like you, Dutch.
l tell you this is a blue plate special.

82
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:30,215
l thought l<i>´</i>d bring him over
for a little get together...

83
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:32,343
...on the same percentage as last time.

84
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,145
Bill O<i>´</i>Brien, what about him?

85
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,622
Nice guy, chief.
He<i>´</i>s got a room down the hall.

86
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,956
He used to be a bellhop at the St. Martin,
got a lot on the ball.

87
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,995
Okay, chief, 12:00 at the Sunset.

88
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,886
Excuse me, are you Mr. White?

89
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,320
No.

90
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,900
That<i>´</i>s very funny,
l could have sworn you were Mr. White.

91
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,835
-Do you mind if l sit down a moment?
-No.

92
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,735
l<i>´</i>m not intruding, l hope.

93
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:31,401
They have a nice show here.
Very artistic, isn<i>´</i>t it?

94
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:37,783
l<i>´</i>m not trying to pull anything, really.
l<i>´</i>ll be frank, l knew you weren<i>´</i>t Mr. White.

95
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,844
ln fact, there is no Mr. White.
lt<i>´</i>s just a name l made up.

96
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,421
l<i>´</i>m really looking for Mr. Hugo.

97
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,057
He puts on the show here,
engages all the talent.

98
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,119
l knew Mr. Hugo some time ago,
being in one of his units.

99
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,756
No use waiting in the lobby,
he never comes out.

100
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:55,199
As for hanging out, you know how they are
if you don<i>´</i>t have an escort.

101
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,000
They don<i>´</i>t care about your feelings.
My name is Nina Barona. l<i>´</i>m a Russian.

102
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:01,871
But this season everything is Latin,
completely Latin.

103
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,810
Hello, how are you? Glad to see you again.

104
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,413
Pardon me, won<i>´</i>t you?

105
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,442
Don<i>´</i>t tell me
you don<i>´</i>t remember me, Nina.

106
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,675
l think you have a slight advantage
over me.

107
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,221
lt<i>´</i>s Nina Barona, isn<i>´</i>t it? Russian?

108
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,158
l never forget a face
if it<i>´</i>s beautiful enough.

109
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:22,419
Bill O<i>´</i>Brien is the name,
in case your memory is playing tricks.

110
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,893
l hope you don<i>´</i>t mind
my barging in on you.

111
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,695
l<i>´</i>m on the town with nothing to do
but throw money away.

112
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:29,998
<i>´´</i>Have fun and make friends<i>.´´</i>
That<i>´</i>s my motto.

113
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,831
Waiter.

114
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,698
-Yes, sir?
-Check.

115
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,738
Honey, l can<i>´</i>t see,
please make him sit down.

116
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,871
-Sit down, old boy.
-Sit down, we can<i>´</i>t see.

117
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:45,180
One moment and l<i>´</i>ll leave you
to your tawdry revels.

118
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,188
Very sad.

119
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,883
Venus was never an epileptic.

120
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,890
l leave you heroes at your periscopes.

121
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:12,272
That was Eugene Gibbons, the playwright.

122
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,108
Really? Do you know him?

123
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,774
Sure, known him for years. Nice guy, too.

124
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:19,980
Too bad about his last show.

125
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,454
l read about it. No good was it?

126
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,184
Three years ago, the white hope
of the theater. Today, a mug.

127
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,520
That<i>´</i>s New York for you.

128
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:32,061
Put you on the Christmas tree
and then the alley.

129
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:33,958
Here we are.

130
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,770
How long are you gonna be in town?

131
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,329
Not very long.

132
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,906
Here<i>´</i>s hoping you enjoy your brief stay.

133
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,541
Gene! So good to see you.

134
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,254
My beautiful.

135
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,848
l<i>´</i>m so sorry l didn<i>´</i>t get to see your play.

136
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,984
l heard it was charming.

137
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,526
Do come around sometime, Gene.
l<i>´</i>m giving a little party Saturday--

138
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,793
Put your scissors away, Delilah,
my hair<i>´</i>s all cut.

139
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,263
ls this stylish fellow my successor?

140
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,777
-Gene, you<i>´</i>re drunk.
-Darling.

141
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:23,179
You understate the case by three bottles
and a thousand tears.

142
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,048
Avaunt.

143
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:37,353
What is the idea
of giving me a midget<i>´</i>s coat?

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,527
Or is the management
handing out straitjackets...

145
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:45,337
...as it should?

146
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:49,133
Sorry, Mr. Gibbons, we have a new boy.
Just a second, please.

147
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,575
Mr. Gibbons<i>´</i> coat, Frank, that brown one.

148
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,803
<i>´´</i>To whom it may concern<i>.´´</i>

149
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,949
l<i>´</i>m in receipt of a communication.

150
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:08,294
<i>´´</i>This is to inform the police
that l have ended my own life<i>.´´</i>

151
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,830
-Vincent!
-Yes, Mr. Gibbons?

152
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,938
-Whose mantle is this?
-l don<i>´</i>t know his name, sir.

153
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,975
He<i>´</i>s a stranger who came in a while ago.

154
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,572
A stranger out of the night.

155
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,508
Where is he roosting?

156
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:33,943
You can find anything you want
in New York...

157
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,313
...if you know where to look for it.

158
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,618
Romance. Adventure.

159
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,655
l know that goes on where you<i>´</i>re from.

160
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,885
But in New York,
it<i>´</i>s with an all-star cast and a fast show.

161
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,898
Seven million people all on one skyrocket,
that<i>´</i>s New York.

162
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,925
What do you say
we slip out and have a look?

163
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:49,991
Thanks.

164
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:53,168
Thanks very much,
but l have another engagement.

165
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,868
Come on, it<i>´</i>s early yet.
Your engagement will keep.

166
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:58,342
Let<i>´</i>s have a little fun first,
what do you say?

167
00:13:58,412 --> 00:14:00,346
Mr. Engle, l believe?

168
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,542
Yes.

169
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,249
How do you do?
My name is Gene Gibbons...

170
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,450
...the distinguished playwright.

171
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,649
l am glad to see you, Gene.
Won<i>´</i>t you join us?

172
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,381
With pleasure.

173
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,122
Do not misunderstand the word
<i>´´</i>distinguished,<i>´´</i> Mr. Engle.

174
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,564
lt refers to my misdeeds.

175
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,631
Allow me to present Miss Nina Barona
of the Russian ballet.

176
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,899
Miss Barona, you are enchanting.

177
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,532
What<i>´</i>s your name, son?

178
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,977
Come on now, Gene. l<i>´</i>m Bill O<i>´</i>Brien.

179
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,945
To be sure, one of the O<i>´</i>Briens.

180
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:37,542
Listen, Brien, will you do me a favor?

181
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,642
For old time<i>´</i>s sake.

182
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:44,355
l want to discuss a matter
of personal importance with Mr. Engle.

183
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:47,959
Always glad to do anything
to oblige my distinguished friends.

184
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,087
Come on, Nina.
We need a little privacy ourselves.

185
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:51,489
Let<i>´</i>s go.

186
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:00,268
-How did you know my name?
-This letter, sir.

187
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:02,607
Fine, fine.

188
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,474
l no longer have to order drinks.
l just attract them.

189
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,444
He shall have liquor wherever he goes.

190
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,948
As l understand
from your communication, Mr. Engle...

191
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,079
...you<i>´</i>re on the brink of self-destruction.

192
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,646
May l shake your hands, a brilliant idea.

193
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:21,626
l speak as one who has destroyed himself
a score of times.

194
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:23,959
l am, Mr. Engle...

195
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,961
...a veteran corpse.

196
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,097
We are all corpses here.

197
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:32,199
This rendezvous is one of the musical
graveyards of the town.

198
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:36,407
Caters to zombies
hopping around with dead hearts...

199
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,574
...and price tags for souls.

200
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:42,208
Will you join me, sir?

201
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,108
lt is the custom here
for the dead to drink...

202
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,508
...heavily.

203
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,987
Allow me to present my credentials, sir,
as a fellow cadaver.

204
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:58,060
l<i>´</i>m being divorced by my wife
whom l love dearly...

205
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,690
...in my own nasty way.

206
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,697
l was disemboweled by another woman.

207
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:06,729
l have written three bad plays in a row...

208
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,034
...and next year l<i>´</i>ll write a worse one.

209
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,601
l have neither a home, a single hope...

210
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,306
...nor a shred of curiosity left.

211
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,417
Bankrupt and broke.

212
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,754
l<i>´</i>ve destroyed myself in becoming famous.

213
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,646
l am no longer a man, Mr. Engle.

214
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,226
l<i>´</i>m an epitaph over an ash can.

215
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:30,790
And now, sir...

216
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,198
...what<i>´</i>s your story?

217
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:38,394
You appeal to me.
There<i>´</i>s something innocent about you.

218
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:40,302
No, l don<i>´</i>t mean really innocent.

219
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:44,240
-You mean a little dumb.
-Not dumb, just good-natured.

220
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:46,108
Yes, l<i>´</i>m very good-natured.

221
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,042
-No kidding, where you from?
-Brooklyn.

222
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:50,743
-Where are you from?
-Me?

223
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,119
l fell out of a policeman<i>´</i>s whistle
in Times Square.

224
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,119
Having fun?

225
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,315
Yes, it<i>´</i>s fun dancing with someone
who knows everybody.

226
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,621
Come on.

227
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:06,164
-Gee, it<i>´</i>s wonderful here.
-Sit down.

228
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,271
-You think l<i>´</i>m a big shot, don<i>´</i>t you?
-Not necessarily.

229
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,138
l could sell you a penthouse of mink coats,
then you<i>´</i>d never see me again.

230
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,267
Just another dream that never came true.

231
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:20,177
-You<i>´</i>d fall for that, wouldn<i>´</i>t you?
-Not necessarily.

232
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,480
l won<i>´</i>t keep you in suspense, Miss Barona.

233
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,709
l ain<i>´</i>t a millionaire.

234
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:28,720
-No penthouse?
-No penthouse...

235
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:30,588
...and no carfare.

236
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,423
This is a big disappointment to me,
Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

237
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,596
The sorrow is all mine, lady.

238
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,726
Millions, millions everywhere,
and not a cup of coffee.

239
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:47,333
Do you want to make some real dough?

240
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,600
lt depends.

241
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:53,740
Maybe l<i>´</i>m the sap,
but l<i>´</i>m going to let you in.

242
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,272
-Oil wells?
-No, no kidding.

243
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:01,179
There<i>´</i>s a seven rolling for me tonight,
and l could use a partner.

244
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,659
Here, sit here.

245
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,495
Did you ever hear of Dutch Enright?

246
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:18,732
The gangster?

247
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,534
What do you mean, <i>´´</i>gangster<i>´´</i>?

248
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,434
The gambler.
Don<i>´</i>t you ever read anything?

249
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,705
Runs the biggest poker game in town.

250
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,509
Didn<i>´</i>t you hear about the chump
who lost his hotel on four nines?

251
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,142
Got in all the columns.

252
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:33,208
So what?

253
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,185
l<i>´</i>m the guy who steered him up there
and got a grand for my cut.

254
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:40,920
Don<i>´</i>t get excited. That was five months
ago and all l got left is this suit.

255
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,664
-lt<i>´</i>s very becoming.
-Save the jokes, now, this is serious.

256
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,395
l<i>´</i>m thinking of taking Engle up there
tonight.

257
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:54,534
What<i>´</i>s the <i>´´</i>oh<i>´´</i> for?
He<i>´</i>s stuffed with dough, ain<i>´</i>t he?

258
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:55,438
ls he?

259
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:58,277
A money tramp. l happen to know.

260
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,346
Sorry.

261
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,189
What<i>´</i>s the difference
if he gets took for a little?

262
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,194
A guy like that can afford to lose...

263
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:18,629
...and besides, he gets a kick out of
meeting important people.

264
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,222
You want to help?

265
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,868
l don<i>´</i>t see what use l would be
in that direction.

266
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:25,234
All you got to do is play up to him a little.

267
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:29,002
When he starts to get personal,
you say you live at the Sunset Hotel.

268
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:32,609
We all go up there for a party,
then l take over.

269
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,414
All you gotta do is act sweet, that<i>´</i>s all.

270
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:37,477
Like a gun moll?

271
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,286
You<i>´</i>re scared, huh?

272
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,215
Who, me?

273
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,290
A tragic tale, brother.

274
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:48,258
A little confused and badly constructed.

275
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,858
l speak as one who eight years ago
won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.

276
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:57,360
Finish your drink,
while l examine this sad plot.

277
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,466
l disapprove of your death, Mr. Engle.

278
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:07,436
Nobody has any right
to kill himself for $3,000.

279
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,717
That<i>´</i>s being short-sighted.

280
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,946
My boy, that<i>´</i>s killing yourself for peanuts.

281
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,714
Not that you wouldn<i>´</i>t be better off dead,
you and l both.

282
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,791
lt<i>´</i>s a world anyone would be better out of.

283
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,732
lt<i>´</i>s a rotten world...

284
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,529
...dancing and murdering.

285
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,464
Were l a philosopher, l<i>´</i>d say:

286
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:38,306
<i>´´</i>An idiot with a gun in one hand
and a clarinet in the other<i>.´´</i>

287
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:44,509
ln fact, l did say it,
and the play closed Saturday.

288
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,551
l do not approve of your exit, Mr. Engle.

289
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,487
lf you will be patient
and have faith in a dramatist...

290
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:59,623
...who once was second to none,
l<i>´</i>ll rewrite your last act.

291
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:05,371
Our present plot problem is money.

292
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,338
$3,000.

293
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,806
A straw that destroys.

294
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,310
My boy...

295
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:25,017
...remove your cerements.

296
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,119
l found you a new godmother.

297
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,792
l refer to the lady
with the pneumatic shape.

298
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:36,466
That creature loved me madly
three months ago.

299
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:42,031
As you can see from the jewels
that festoon her battle front.

300
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,034
Mine, all mine.

301
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:48,877
Homage to love eternal.

302
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,480
Kindly notice that Kohinoor
at the left sector.

303
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,019
We<i>´</i>ll get that back, son,
in a flanked movement.

304
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,622
Wait here, pilgrim.

305
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,660
l<i>´</i>ll be back, Charlie, my lad,
with a bauble called Life.

306
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:16,498
lsn<i>´</i>t that Mr. Hugo over there by the wall?

307
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,139
Yeah.

308
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,472
-Would you mind introducing me, please?
-We ain<i>´</i>t got time for that?

309
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,606
Excuse me.

310
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:27,745
Mr. Hugo...

311
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,423
...l don<i>´</i>t know if you remember me...

312
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,654
...Nina Barona. At the Monkey Club?

313
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,891
l did a specialty,
the slave routine with the chains.

314
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,095
But l<i>´</i>m much better now,
if you<i>´</i>re remembering, l mean.

315
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,830
l know you<i>´</i>re busy,
but if you<i>´</i>d give me an audition...

316
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,702
...it would only take a few minutes.

317
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:50,436
l<i>´</i>ve still got the costume and the props.
The chains and everything.

318
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,774
What are you doing tonight?

319
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,869
Why, nothing.

320
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:58,577
Come on, kid,
we<i>´</i>ll go someplace and talk this thing--

321
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:00,414
There you are! Hello, madam.

322
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:03,479
l<i>´</i>ve been combing the joint,
your husband is trying to find you.

323
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,421
-What?
-Yeah, he<i>´</i>s breaking dishes.

324
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:08,222
Come and cool him off
before he starts smacking waiters.

325
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,019
Wait a minute, it<i>´</i>s a lie.

326
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,796
You<i>´</i>ve got a lot of nerve, wasting my time.

327
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,660
l know, Mr. Hugo.

328
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:22,071
Of all the dirty tricks l ever saw<i>....</i>
Just when l get a break.

329
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,667
This is the most contemptible thing
anybody ever did.

330
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,507
He would have given me a job!

331
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,148
-You fool!
-Maybe, but l figure it wasn<i>´</i>t worth it.

332
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:30,113
You figure?

333
00:23:30,183 --> 00:23:33,448
Listen, you know-it-all,
l don<i>´</i>t need you or anybody else to figure.

334
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,488
Take it easy, you<i>´</i>ll attract attention.

335
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:37,989
l<i>´</i>ve always taken care of myself,
understand?

336
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:40,253
l don<i>´</i>t need help from any amateur crooks.

337
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:42,085
Go on, l<i>´</i>ve had enough of you.

338
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,725
Please, beat it.

339
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:46,258
l<i>´</i>m no gun moll.

340
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,467
You ain<i>´</i>t no buzzard<i>´</i>s dish neither...

341
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,560
...not while l<i>´</i>m around.

342
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,108
May l say, those were
the five most wonderful weeks of my life.

343
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,210
l hope you haven<i>´</i>t forgotten them,
my sweet.

344
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:10,886
The little farmhouse in Maine...

345
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,488
...winter and the snow...

346
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:17,222
...and the little stove
burning in the room, as l recall.

347
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,762
And the light on the wall that night.

348
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,499
The only light in the world.

349
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:26,596
Lonely, and the wind blowing.

350
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:30,907
And outside, the snow like a white horse.

351
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,814
The little stove burning in the dark...

352
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,139
...like the eye of dreams.

353
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:41,278
Please, Gene, you<i>´</i>re drunk.
l don<i>´</i>t want to talk about that now.

354
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,981
Where is the little stove of yesteryear
and the white horse?

355
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,290
Gone, huh?

356
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,287
Burnt out and run away.

357
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,960
What are you doing?

358
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,594
Taking back one humble little gift of love.

359
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,603
Just one, for a good cause.

360
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:01,301
See?

361
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:03,938
Sylvia, do you want me to do anything?

362
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:06,607
Who wants to do something?

363
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,170
You, sir.

364
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:11,716
Control yourself, son.

365
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,745
Tell this madcap how hard l can hit.

366
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,757
Never mind, Stevie.

367
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,024
lt<i>´</i>s quite all right.

368
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,188
Thank you, beautiful.

369
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:28,692
He giveth and he taketh back...

370
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,659
...in a good cause.

371
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:32,602
Thank you.

372
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,736
Hello, Mr. Engle.

373
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,146
You can dismiss your hearse.

374
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,881
Manna!

375
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:46,311
This trinket was obtained from Cartier<i>´</i>s
for $12,000.

376
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:50,020
You can raise $3,000 on it
from any financier.

377
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,921
lt<i>´</i>s yours.

378
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,624
Live, little man, and suffer.

379
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,660
lt<i>´</i>s hard to understand.

380
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:04,093
A man you never met before comes along
and does a thing like this.

381
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,096
l didn<i>´</i>t think a thing like this
could ever happen.

382
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:09,835
Your drink, Mr. Engle.

383
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:12,275
-Here<i>´</i>s to tomorrow.
-Tomorrow!

384
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:16,109
Tomorrow.

385
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,147
Take it easy, Lazarus.

386
00:26:18,218 --> 00:26:19,742
l don<i>´</i>t know what to do.

387
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,617
You call on Mr. Hopper in the morning...

388
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:27,149
...and you hand that moth-eaten nemesis
the $3,000...

389
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,920
...and then you spit in his eye.

390
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,092
Applause.

391
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:34,223
But that<i>´</i>s not the question.

392
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,861
Allow me to explain, sir, the secret of life.

393
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:40,905
Yesterday<i>´</i>s pain...

394
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,198
...is tomorrow<i>´</i>s joke.

395
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,772
And you<i>´</i>ll always end up laughing...

396
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:49,679
...if you can manage
not to cut your throat first.

397
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,684
That<i>´</i>s the message of my last three flops.

398
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,450
You<i>´</i>re a wonderful man, Mr. Gibbons.

399
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,990
l don<i>´</i>t know how to explain it.

400
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:05,427
lt<i>´</i>s like when you meet somebody
on a dark street and he smiles at you.

401
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,294
You don<i>´</i>t feel frightened for a minute.
For a minute, you feel all right.

402
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:12,236
l<i>´</i>ll tell you what l<i>´</i>m going to do.

403
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,865
Yes, l<i>´</i>m going to do it.
l<i>´</i>m going to call her up.

404
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:16,543
We<i>´</i>ll sit here until his nibs goes back
to his table.

405
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,738
We<i>´</i>ll sit here until his nibs goes back
to his table.

406
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,971
Then you step in.

407
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,115
Really, l step in?

408
00:27:23,483 --> 00:27:24,711
That<i>´</i>s right.

409
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,046
What am l supposed to do, lasso him?

410
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,187
Do just what you did last time.

411
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,348
Last time? What last time?

412
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:34,222
The last time
you got some fellow to fall for you.

413
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:37,423
l don<i>´</i>t see why l<i>´</i>m wasting my time
to get insulted.

414
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:38,464
Cut it out.

415
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:43,067
This is business, so don<i>´</i>t hand me any line.
l know your type backwards.

416
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:44,194
You do?

417
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:47,239
lf you don<i>´</i>t care to talk to me
like a gentleman--

418
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,308
Nix, nix, let<i>´</i>s have none of that.

419
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,173
lf we go into partnership,
let<i>´</i>s go in with our eyes open.

420
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:55,840
All l<i>´</i>ve got on my mind is to grab
some dough and get in the money.

421
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:58,276
l don<i>´</i>t care how l get there.

422
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:00,819
As for you, baby,
l<i>´</i>ve known dozens like you...

423
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:04,218
...sappy kids with a heart like a cur-dog,
that answers whistles...

424
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,451
...and figures they<i>´</i>re having a good time.

425
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,222
l<i>´</i>m a little better than you think,
Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

426
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:10,922
That wouldn<i>´</i>t be hard.

427
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:14,057
l ain<i>´</i>t trying to insult you,
just analyzing things, see?

428
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,533
The trouble with you is
that you<i>´</i>re a born sucker.

429
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,499
All you know is
how to let people take advantage of you.

430
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,263
What do you think you<i>´</i>re doing?

431
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:25,437
Reform me into a gangster<i>´</i>s assistant
so l<i>´</i>ll end up shooting policemen?

432
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:29,443
-That<i>´</i>s very funny.
-lt is, huh?

433
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:34,376
l<i>´</i>m trying to show you something else than
nickels to grab and buzzards to run with.

434
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:37,981
l used to be like you: Two bits
and l<i>´</i>d start bowing like a Chinaman.

435
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:41,857
Baby, you<i>´</i>re worth more than two bits.
You don<i>´</i>t think so, but l do.

436
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:44,456
l<i>´</i>m getting a little confused.

437
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:47,230
You<i>´</i>re not trying to make love to me
by any chance?

438
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,566
Baby, when l start making love to you,
it won<i>´</i>t be any guessing game.

439
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:57,905
She was crying
as she answered the phone.

440
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:01,777
l didn<i>´</i>t have a chance to tell her.
She wants to see me in the morning.

441
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:04,817
Do you know what l think?
She<i>´</i>s through with him, this Morgan.

442
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:06,317
Why would she be crying?

443
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:08,877
Sure she<i>´</i>s through with him,
she hates him.

444
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:12,585
l<i>´</i>ll see her in the morning.
We can go away and start all over.

445
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,486
Not with Hopper. Some place else.

446
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,824
A fellow like me can always get a job.

447
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,355
l know how to do lots of things.

448
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,826
lt<i>´</i>s nice, isn<i>´</i>t it?

449
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,866
Quite a joke, Gene, isn<i>´</i>t it?

450
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,005
Hello, my dear.

451
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:34,846
Are you joining us?

452
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,948
New flagship.

453
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,941
Draw right up, Admiral.

454
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:42,479
You were always so witty,
such wonderful pranks.

455
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:45,380
Then so contrite the day after.

456
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:49,857
lf you are not going to sit down to chat,
pardon me.

457
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,593
l don<i>´</i>t want your conscience to bother you
in the morning when you sober up.

458
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,070
l don<i>´</i>t want you to feel badly
about being a thief and a swine.

459
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,099
You really didn<i>´</i>t steal anything.

460
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:04,376
That pin is only paste.

461
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,844
l paid $10 for it
while my other was being made over.

462
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:11,973
You know,
it was terribly funny, your taking it.

463
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:14,080
You<i>´</i>re quite welcome to it.

464
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,851
Please never mind calling me up
about giving it back...

465
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:19,652
...or about anything else.

466
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:21,860
You stupid, drunken fool.

467
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,928
You should give up drinking,
Gene old boy...

468
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,126
...if you want to turn into a Raffles.

469
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:30,991
Come.

470
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,107
My stupidity begins to amaze me.

471
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:44,679
Poor little Engle...

472
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,511
...in the hands of an idiotic drunk.

473
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,944
Well...

474
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:53,251
...we must find other means.

475
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:58,897
Hello, Mr. Engle.
Do you mind if l have my purse back?

476
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:02,099
-Thanks so much for guarding it.
-How are they coming, Gene?

477
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:06,934
My boy,
you wouldn<i>´</i>t happen to have $3,000...

478
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,135
...to spare?

479
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:10,409
Who, me?

480
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:13,002
That<i>´</i>s a laugh.

481
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:16,672
Say, what<i>´</i>s going on here?

482
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,511
Mr. Engle needs $3,000 very badly.

483
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,112
ln fact, desperately.

484
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,115
lt<i>´</i>s a matter of life and death.

485
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,487
-What? Why, l thought that he--
-ls that true, Mr. Engle?

486
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:34,466
-l mean, are you really broke?
-Face to face with disaster.

487
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:38,564
-Thanks for trying to help me.
-lt<i>´</i>s going to be all right.

488
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,401
Got to think awhile.

489
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,980
Excuse me for laughing,
but this is too funny.

490
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,242
Cut it out.

491
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:54,645
The phony. There<i>´</i>s nothing to laugh at.

492
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,711
-lt<i>´</i>s a funny joke, Mr. Gibbons--
-Shut up.

493
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,618
-Anybody<i>´</i>s liable to--
-Maybe you can put it in a play.

494
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:02,525
Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien thought
Mr. Engle was a millionaire.

495
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:04,153
That<i>´</i>s what he<i>´</i>s been telling me.

496
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,165
He was going to introduce Mr. Engle
to some crooked gamblers.

497
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,497
And he, Mr. Engle,
was going to be trimmed.

498
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:15,030
For $30,000 or $40,000, wasn<i>´</i>t it,
Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien, playing poker?

499
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,972
We were going to clean up,
l and Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien...

500
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,276
...on our cut for steering him up there.
Mr. Engle, the millionaire.

501
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,112
You fell out of a policeman<i>´</i>s whistle...

502
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,715
...you think.

503
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:31,784
What you fell out of was your cradle
and right onto your head.

504
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:33,252
Okay, copper.

505
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:36,058
Going to make a fortune for me...

506
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,791
...swindling a poor fellow without a dime.

507
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:41,522
Somebody give me a drink,
this is too funny.

508
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,125
l<i>´</i>ve got an idea.

509
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:47,630
You<i>´</i>ve given me the finest plot turn
since the Tower of Babel.

510
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,368
-Take it easy, Gene.
-Quiet!

511
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:52,138
As l understand it,
your crooked friends are waiting...

512
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:54,771
...for Mr. Engle with felonious intent.

513
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,414
Waiting to swindle him
in a poker game, right?

514
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:59,542
Forget it. She<i>´</i>s talking through her hat.

515
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,283
No lying, we haven<i>´</i>t time for it.
Your undivided attention, Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

516
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,584
This is perfect.

517
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:09,094
You<i>´</i>re taking our millionaire, Mr. Engle,
to your gamblers<i>´</i> den.

518
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:12,493
Your greedy friends will let him win at first
as a come on.

519
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:16,827
Let him win, shall we say, $3,000.

520
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:22,029
At that point, he will excuse himself
for a moment and vanish into the night...

521
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:24,668
...solvent and with a new lease on life.

522
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,103
Wait a minute. Let<i>´</i>s get out of here.

523
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,806
We<i>´</i>ve got another date.

524
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:31,139
Never mind your paltry dates.

525
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,077
l<i>´</i>m rewriting you, my Broadway scavenger.

526
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:39,156
You<i>´</i>ll become a hero, from Gyp the Blood
to Galahad in one lesson...

527
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:42,317
...and you, too, my little moth. Rise.

528
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:45,495
Heroine, l need you both.

529
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,091
Where is my little man Engle?

530
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,569
Hey, waiter, where did my little man go?

531
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,675
You haven<i>´</i>t seen
a rather sad-looking man...

532
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,844
...in an ill-fitting overcoat,
walking in the rain, have you?

533
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,578
-l ain<i>´</i>t seen anybody all night.
-That<i>´</i>s too bad.

534
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:14,592
You stay here while l reconnoiter.
That doorman couldn<i>´</i>t have been wrong.

535
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:18,857
l didn<i>´</i>t say it wasn<i>´</i>t interesting.

536
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,590
All l said was that
a guy committing suicide is no novelty.

537
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,602
Please, don<i>´</i>t talk to me.

538
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:31,671
l<i>´</i>m gonna pull a fast one
on Dutch Enright and the mob...

539
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:34,170
...for a total stranger.

540
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,550
No wonder he writes flops,
with ideas like that.

541
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:47,489
-Are you going to keep crying all night?
-l asked you not to talk to me.

542
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,151
For a nickel, l<i>´</i>d leave you flat.

543
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:51,253
Why don<i>´</i>t you?

544
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:54,422
l don<i>´</i>t happen to have any other dates.

545
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,825
Besides which, it<i>´</i>s raining.

546
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:01,337
l doubt if l could do much better
on a rainy night.

547
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,236
Cut it out, will you?
There<i>´</i>s nothing to cry about.

548
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:06,675
That poor man.

549
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,776
l never knew anyone who wanted to die.

550
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,341
Except myself.

551
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,945
-l guess a lot of people are like that.
-Like what?

552
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,921
With a pain inside them they can<i>´</i>t stand.

553
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,624
l<i>´</i>m getting one now.

554
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:23,486
-You<i>´</i>re cruel and mean.
-Yeah?

555
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,696
l stick to my own troubles to cry over.

556
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,393
You make me sick.

557
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:32,967
Throwing yourself away on any buzzard
that comes along.

558
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:34,832
Living like a floozy on a raft.

559
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,642
And now you<i>´</i>re crying
about somebody else.

560
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:40,235
-That<i>´</i>s laughable.
-Let me alone.

561
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,646
lf you don<i>´</i>t want to buy something,
what<i>´</i>s the idea of coming here to fight?

562
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:46,708
This is a store and not a theater.

563
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,309
All right, give me some gum.

564
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,945
-What kind you like?
-Don<i>´</i>t want any.

565
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,383
Okay, one package.

566
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:56,388
l don<i>´</i>t know why every nut in town
picks out this store every time it rains.

567
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:57,586
You said it.

568
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,722
-Did you find him?
-Not yet, come on.

569
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,529
-Have a heart, Gene, she<i>´</i>ll catch cold.
-l<i>´</i>ve got a cab outside.

570
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,537
l want you two to cruise up and down
and keep your eyes open.

571
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:08,766
l<i>´</i>ve got to find Engle before it<i>´</i>s too late.

572
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:11,275
-What about you?
-l<i>´</i>m at my best on foot.

573
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:14,278
Meet me at the 43rd St. Theater.
The doorman will let you in.

574
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:18,248
lf you find him, take him there and wait.
lf not, l<i>´</i>ll bring him there myself.

575
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,750
-Have you got that?
-Sure.

576
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:22,310
Very well. Come along and good luck.

577
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,327
-We really didn<i>´</i>t look enough.
-We looked plenty.

578
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,524
$3 worth.

579
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:37,226
You didn<i>´</i>t finish telling what happened
after you left the Monkey Club.

580
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:38,270
Why, nothing.

581
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,763
-You didn<i>´</i>t get another job?
-No.

582
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,001
Just been knocking around
ever since with<i>....</i>

583
00:36:44,343 --> 00:36:46,004
l<i>´</i>ve kept trying continually.

584
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,237
l mean, for a job.
That<i>´</i>s what l was doing tonight, trying.

585
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,975
Yeah. l know all about tonight<i>´</i>s try.

586
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,717
-Are you Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien?
-Yes.

587
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:58,552
Mr. Gibbons telephoned about you.

588
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,657
He said you should wait on stage.

589
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:04,890
This way.

590
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,266
l<i>´</i>ll go turn on a light.

591
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,863
Don<i>´</i>t move around
or you<i>´</i>ll bump into the mountain.

592
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,669
A mountain, what mountain?

593
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:20,802
lt<i>´</i>s called the Acracoronian Mountains,
although there<i>´</i>s only one of them.

594
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,440
l<i>´</i>ll put the light on
and you can see for yourself.

595
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:29,282
l<i>´</i>m beginning to understand
the whole thing.

596
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,050
lt<i>´</i>s the open season for cuckoos.

597
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,282
Really? Just who are you referring to,
Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien?

598
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:38,652
l<i>´</i>m referring to Mr. Engle, Mr. Gibbons,
this guy here with the mountain.

599
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:42,057
And last, but not least, you.

600
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:45,403
lt<i>´</i>s a bad sign if you start to think
everybody but you is crazy.

601
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,869
Don<i>´</i>t you think?

602
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,443
l wish he<i>´</i>d hurry up with the lights.

603
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,040
What are you nervous about?

604
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:57,746
Do you think l<i>´</i>m going to
make a grab at you?

605
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,808
Well, l ain<i>´</i>t. You can relax.

606
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,512
lt might be a kind of a novelty at that.

607
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,517
Alone with a guy for an hour
and no passes.

608
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,058
Don<i>´</i>t worry, Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

609
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,925
l<i>´</i>m getting a little used to it,
and to your insults, too.

610
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:14,329
l see. lt<i>´</i>s insulting
when somebody don<i>´</i>t make a grab at you.

611
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,560
l apologize.

612
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:17,932
l don<i>´</i>t know
why you want to make me feel bad.

613
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:21,769
You keep asking me about myself.
When l tell you the truth, you get mad.

614
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:24,672
-Don<i>´</i>t start crying again, will you?
-Why not?

615
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:27,143
You said it was all right to cry for yourself.

616
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,813
You make me feel
like the most horrible person in the world.

617
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,450
l<i>´</i>m sorry.

618
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,387
l must be nuts.

619
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,425
l tag after you like a puppy
and every time l look at you l get sore.

620
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,356
Tie that.

621
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:47,732
Okay.

622
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,059
We<i>´</i>re friends, huh?

623
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:52,595
Sure.

624
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,507
Let<i>´</i>s go see what<i>´</i>s happening.

625
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,774
What<i>´</i>s going on here?

626
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:02,436
Maybe you<i>´</i>re upset having to take
Mr. Engle up to the gambling den.

627
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:04,914
l know it<i>´</i>s going to come out all right.
Really.

628
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,748
l can just feel it.

629
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,079
Listen.

630
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,118
One thing l ain<i>´</i>t upset about
is taking Mr. Engle to the gambling den...

631
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:13,617
...or anywhere else.

632
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:16,185
Don<i>´</i>t get any false ideas in your head.

633
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:20,797
l ain<i>´</i>t here for Mr. Engle or Mr. Gibbons.
l<i>´</i>m here strictly on my own business.

634
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,594
Whatever that is.

635
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:25,136
l wish you wouldn<i>´</i>t talk that way,
it<i>´</i>ll be so easy.

636
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:28,605
-lt<i>´</i>s going to be easy. Forget it for now.
-No, l<i>´</i>m serious.

637
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:30,568
They<i>´</i>re bound to let him win.

638
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:34,773
Even l<i>´</i>ve read that crooked gamblers
let you win at first as a come on.

639
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,042
You<i>´</i>re reading the wrong books, baby.

640
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:41,212
To find out what happens to nice guys,
don<i>´</i>t read books, just read the headlines.

641
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:43,887
What happened to the Poles,
the Finns and the Dutch?

642
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,924
They were nice little guys. Did they win?

643
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:47,720
-They will sometime.
-Forget it.

644
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:50,227
<i>´´</i>Every guy for himself<i>.´´</i> That<i>´</i>s my motto.

645
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:57,465
Look, the old guy isn<i>´</i>t crazy at all.
There is a mountain.

646
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,000
Of course, this isn<i>´</i>t the regular lighting.

647
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:02,905
lt makes a pretty setting
when it<i>´</i>s rightly lit up.

648
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,506
A snow-capped mountain in Thessaly.

649
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,036
Thessaly was part of Greece.

650
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:11,014
-The old Greeks--
-We know all about them.

651
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,186
Hear that noise?

652
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:19,488
That<i>´</i>s the rats.

653
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,593
Always performing<i>....</i>

654
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:27,795
lf they left this scenery here,
they<i>´</i>d eat it up.

655
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,892
Eat the whole theater up,
if it wasn<i>´</i>t for the actors.

656
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,835
The hollering frightens them.

657
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:37,472
<i>´´</i>Had l but served my God
with half the zeal l served my King...

658
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:42,046
<i>´´...</i>he would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies<i>.´´</i>

659
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:43,875
Go, you!

660
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:45,581
Get out of there!

661
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:48,509
Go away! Go away!

662
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:53,516
Now they<i>´</i>re silent.

663
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,023
He ain<i>´</i>t crazy, you say.

664
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,191
Gee, it<i>´</i>s a beautiful theater.

665
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:17,882
lf l only had my slave costume
and my chains.

666
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,584
Hey, that ain<i>´</i>t safe.
You<i>´</i>ll break your neck.

667
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,589
lt<i>´</i>s wonderful up here.

668
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,824
Any objections?

669
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,867
Not particularly.

670
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,336
There<i>´</i>s something funny
about you and me.

671
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,104
Maybe it<i>´</i>s just me.

672
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:54,016
No kidding,
something just keeps me from kissing you.

673
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:57,613
You don<i>´</i>t have to keep harping on
the fact you don<i>´</i>t like me.

674
00:41:57,689 --> 00:42:00,556
Don<i>´</i>t play dumb.
l don<i>´</i>t like that side of you, that<i>´</i>s all.

675
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,218
What side do you mean?

676
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:04,720
l don<i>´</i>t understand, honestly.

677
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:07,891
Sure you don<i>´</i>t, because
l<i>´</i>m talking like a chump, that<i>´</i>s why.

678
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,026
l<i>´</i>m pretending
there<i>´</i>s something swell about you.

679
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,706
This delusion came over me
while we were dancing.

680
00:42:15,607 --> 00:42:18,576
You know,
when you look into a girl<i>´</i>s eyes...

681
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:21,579
...and you think you see something
that isn<i>´</i>t there?

682
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:23,615
Well, that<i>´</i>s what l saw.

683
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:27,717
Maybe it was there. Maybe--

684
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:30,778
This is just my night for seeing things.

685
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:34,215
First l see a millionaire
by the name of Engle...

686
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,951
...then l run into a dream girl.

687
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,257
-Come on, it<i>´</i>s all phony baloney.
-Bill.

688
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:42,568
There<i>´</i>s no seven rolling for me tonight.
Let<i>´</i>s go someplace sensible.

689
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,933
There<i>´</i>s no seven rolling for me tonight.
Let<i>´</i>s go someplace sensible.

690
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:45,731
Hello, there!

691
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:47,362
This way, Mr. Engle.

692
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,734
Joe, a couple of glasses with that bottle.

693
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:52,810
Enter our hero.

694
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:56,279
-You found him, l<i>´</i>m so glad.
-There you are, pilgrim.

695
00:42:56,715 --> 00:42:59,616
The snow-capped peaks of Thessaly...

696
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:03,711
...or rather, according to the critics,
a molehill.

697
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,715
Thank you.

698
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:08,921
What do you think of that set, Mr. Engle?

699
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:13,260
-lt looks like a real mountain.
-lt was, until the critics nibbled it away.

700
00:43:13,732 --> 00:43:16,360
The rodents! Here, my boy, drink that.

701
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,665
-lt will give you character.
-Thanks.

702
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:21,103
You know something?
lt<i>´</i>s going to be all right.

703
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:23,733
They think l<i>´</i>m rich and they<i>´</i>ll let me win.

704
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,077
-Okay, this is where l came in.
-Where are you going?

705
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:29,271
-Bye-bye.
-You<i>´</i>re not going to take me there?

706
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,975
He<i>´</i>s full of pipe dreams.

707
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:33,677
That<i>´</i>s how he makes his living,
making up pipe dreams.

708
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:37,252
You know what Enright would do to me
for playing a joke like this?

709
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:40,257
He<i>´</i>s got six killers on his payroll,
hopheads with ice picks.

710
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,751
An alarmist.

711
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,055
How will he find out?

712
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:46,689
Mr. Gibbons told you what to say to Dutch
after Mr. Engle gets away.

713
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:48,824
l sit in a chair while they slap me dizzy...

714
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,870
...reciting Gibbons<i>´</i> idea of dialogue
under such conditions.

715
00:43:51,937 --> 00:43:53,768
lt<i>´</i>s a lot better than you could make up.

716
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,974
These are the wings of the Angel Afriel...

717
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,200
...a very good actor.

718
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:03,904
-But you can<i>´</i>t run out, you got--
-l got to stick my neck out? For what?

719
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:06,917
Where<i>´</i>s my percentage?
Where do l come in?

720
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,385
lt<i>´</i>s giving somebody a chance to live.

721
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,226
lt<i>´</i>s giving them a chance to start over
and be happy.

722
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:19,390
Why should l give anybody a chance?
Who ever gave me a chance, or you either?

723
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,364
l know this town.

724
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:24,700
l used to work in hotels, all kinds.

725
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,270
Fleabags and flops with gold elevators.

726
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,808
l<i>´</i>ve heard them screaming
and crying behind doors...

727
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,878
...seen them kicked out
when they couldn<i>´</i>t pay...

728
00:44:33,946 --> 00:44:36,972
...seen them jump out of windows
when there was no place to go.

729
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,942
There<i>´</i>s nobody passing out any chances.

730
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:45,755
lf anybody wants to jump, let him.
l<i>´</i>m looking out for one guy only. Me.

731
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:50,486
-l didn<i>´</i>t think you were like that.
-l<i>´</i>m strictly a percentage player, that<i>´</i>s all.

732
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,095
For dough, anything. But for<i>....</i>

733
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,061
Wait a minute.

734
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,030
What is it?

735
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:02,731
l<i>´</i>m dumb.

736
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,869
l<i>´</i>m even dumber than you.

737
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,873
What if this hairpin should win
more than $3,000?

738
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:12,206
What if they let him win $6,000,
or even $10,000?

739
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:15,210
l get a split on everything over $3,000.

740
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:18,112
l<i>´</i>ll talk to Engle and try to make a deal.

741
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,488
-Hey, Mr. Engle?
-Time to be going, gentlemen.

742
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,017
-l got to talk to Engle first--
-You<i>´</i>ve been chatting long enough.

743
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,792
There<i>´</i>s a taxi waiting outside
with the meter running.

744
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:28,523
l<i>´</i>ve got something to say.

745
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,201
-Listen, Mr. Engle--
-You have nothing to say.

746
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,060
l haven<i>´</i>t?

747
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:35,567
Say, who do you think you are? God?

748
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:37,108
Exactly.

749
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,308
l<i>´</i>m glad you see through me, finally.

750
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:43,780
But you<i>´</i>re still a little short in your vision.

751
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,144
We<i>´</i>re all of us God, my boy.

752
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,448
All creatures full of light and miracles.

753
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:52,881
Come on.

754
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:54,923
Thank you.

755
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:58,853
Omnipotence often needs a little support.

756
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:20,080
They<i>´</i>re waiting for me
to give them the offers. Then they<i>´</i>ll come.

757
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,348
Who are they?

758
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:26,483
The big one<i>´</i>s Eddie Burns,
used to be a prize fighter.

759
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:29,425
l ain<i>´</i>t so scared of him, though.
But the other one<i>....</i>

760
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:32,955
He<i>´</i>s the brain trust for Dutch Enright.

761
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:34,357
Louie Artino.

762
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:40,460
Make up your mind. What do you want?
Shall l flag him?

763
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:41,528
One minute.

764
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,600
l<i>´</i>m ready, l<i>´</i>ve got it all down.

765
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:46,843
-Got what down?
-What l<i>´</i>m going to say.

766
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:50,279
A little more reserve, Mr. Engle.
You<i>´</i>re a very rich man.

767
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:53,076
You<i>´</i>re so rich you don<i>´</i>t have to talk.

768
00:46:53,885 --> 00:46:56,945
ln fact, you<i>´</i>re so rich,
you have nothing to talk about.

769
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:59,048
That<i>´</i>s your character.

770
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,856
l<i>´</i>m afraid l<i>´</i>m confusing you.

771
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,120
No, l can act like a rich man.

772
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,993
Don<i>´</i>t worry, Mr. Gibbons.

773
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,957
Won<i>´</i>t do.

774
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,967
l want you to act like a poor man.

775
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:16,500
Just remember all your troubles
and you<i>´</i>ll look exactly like a rich man.

776
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,672
-l see.
-Good.

777
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,009
All right, Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

778
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,871
Curtain.

779
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,422
-Hello, Bill.
-Louie, ain<i>´</i>t seen you in a long time.

780
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,489
Getting along.

781
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,933
Allow me.
Miss Barona, this is Mr. Artino...

782
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:47,669
...Mr. Engle, Mr. Gibbons. Eugene Gibbons.

783
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,306
How do you do? Yeah, the playwright.

784
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,672
l thought l recognized you.

785
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,344
Glad to meet you.
l<i>´</i>ve always been an admirer.

786
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,610
-And this is Eddie Burns.
-Pleased to meet you, l<i>´</i>m sure.

787
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:01,277
Join us, Louie. We<i>´</i>re having a drink
and trying to figure out where to go.

788
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:03,321
You look like a man of the world, sir.

789
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:08,223
Maybe you can help me persuade Mr. Engle
that show business needs men like him.

790
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:13,923
New money, new actors, new ideas.
That<i>´</i>s what the theater needs, Mr. Engle.

791
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,432
You smile, sir...

792
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:20,596
...because you think
l<i>´</i>m talking through my hat.

793
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,572
Nonsense.

794
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:25,404
Let me repeat, Mr. Engle.

795
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:29,477
For $30,000, you<i>´</i>ll get one half of the play.

796
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:33,575
For a paltry $30,000,
you can come backstage...

797
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:37,247
...whenever you like and see the men
pull the curtain up and down.

798
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:41,949
l<i>´</i>m not in the mood for business tonight.
l<i>´</i>m trying to have some fun, Mr. Gibbons.

799
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:45,485
Fine. Excellent.

800
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:48,730
Beautifully said.

801
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:53,027
That<i>´</i>s what we<i>´</i>re all trying to do,
Mr. Engle, have some fun.

802
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,969
-Am l right, Mr. Artino?
-Sure.

803
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,343
We ought to take care of your friend, Bill.

804
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:01,777
Yeah, l was telling him
about the club upstairs.

805
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:04,140
lt<i>´</i>s a sort of private little affair.

806
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:08,516
We happen to be having a meeting tonight.
Just a get together for a few friends.

807
00:49:09,087 --> 00:49:11,715
l was telling him we might drop in,
if it<i>´</i>s not too late.

808
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,621
Not at all. Come on up, Mr. Engle.

809
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:16,686
Always glad to entertain
any friend of Bill O<i>´</i>Brien.

810
00:49:16,761 --> 00:49:17,728
Thanks.

811
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:21,294
l<i>´</i>m glad to have met you, Mr. Gibbons,
and you, miss.

812
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,401
l hope you put your deal over.

813
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,632
See you later.

814
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,538
You were wonderful. l knew you would be.

815
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,205
Never mind about me,
l<i>´</i>m playing a percentage.

816
00:49:36,448 --> 00:49:38,780
lt<i>´</i>s all right, Mr. Gibbons, they<i>´</i>ve gone.

817
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:41,710
What do you mean, <i>´´</i>it<i>´</i>s all right<i>´´</i>?

818
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:45,148
He ain<i>´</i>t acting. He<i>´</i>s out cold.

819
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:47,815
Come on, Engle, give me a lift.

820
00:49:49,694 --> 00:49:51,457
l<i>´</i>m all right, thanks.

821
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,829
Ain<i>´</i>t Grand Central Station,
but it<i>´</i>s big enough for me.

822
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:59,093
Everything is going to be all right.

823
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:01,629
-Where<i>´</i>s that Engle?
-Here.

824
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,732
-Now, you understand your part, my boy?
-Yes.

825
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:08,738
Little man against the fates.

826
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:13,776
They will deal you hope off the bottom
and let you win at first...

827
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,278
...then you get up and slither off.

828
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:20,248
Tell them you<i>´</i>re coming back.
You<i>´</i>ve got to see me.

829
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:23,817
Your friend is very drunk, dangerous,
might set fire to the hotel.

830
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,154
Who knows?

831
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:29,396
They<i>´</i>ll think, as they watch you go,
<i>´´</i>He<i>´</i>ll come back<i>´´...</i>

832
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:30,832
...but you flee.

833
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:33,429
You<i>´</i>ll live happily ever after...

834
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:36,069
...as l ordered it.

835
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:40,475
-Mr. Gibbons?
-He<i>´</i>s really out this time.

836
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:43,639
-The mastermind folds in the stretch.
-Please, he<i>´</i>ll hear you.

837
00:50:43,715 --> 00:50:47,173
He ain<i>´</i>t going to be hearing anything
but pink elephants for some time.

838
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,312
You got a fine pal, Engle.
Passes out on you in the finish.

839
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:53,323
That<i>´</i>s his trouble as a playwright,
according to the critics.

840
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:55,518
Starts off fine, then loses track.

841
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:59,092
l can see what they mean.
Sure lost track of this production.

842
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:02,292
-Hurry, they<i>´</i>re waiting.
-They<i>´</i>re waiting. l know all about that.

843
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:06,093
But first, l wanna have a little talk to you.

844
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:08,867
-You<i>´</i>re going to back out?
-Nobody<i>´</i>s backing out.

845
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,301
l<i>´</i>m willing to help...

846
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:13,708
...but not on account of the fates
or any of that gabble he pulled.

847
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:15,905
l write the finish different to him.

848
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,541
l write it over for Bill O<i>´</i>Brien.

849
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,385
l<i>´</i>m in this, but l want a cut.

850
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,178
-A cut?
-Yeah.

851
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:26,316
Everything you take over $3,000 is mine.

852
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:27,891
But how can l get any more?

853
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,219
How do you know
how much they<i>´</i>ll throw at you?

854
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,559
l<i>´</i>ve seen as much as $15,000 in one pot.

855
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,727
That hotel owner, they let him win
more than $8,000 before they<i>....</i>

856
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:38,926
Say, even if it<i>´</i>s only $5,000...

857
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:41,762
...l take all over $3,000.

858
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,935
Okay?

859
00:51:43,174 --> 00:51:46,143
Sure, that<i>´</i>s all right with me.
All l want is $3,000.

860
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:48,805
Fine, now there<i>´</i>s some sense
to the whole thing.

861
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,872
Me, sticking my neck out for nothing
and for no reason.

862
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,418
-Are you ready for the lion<i>´</i>s den?
-Yes.

863
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:57,921
Wait a minute.

864
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,649
lf you only had a fur collar or something.

865
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,422
You sure can<i>´</i>t go in there
with those five-and-ten-cent cuff links.

866
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,760
Take them off.

867
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:11,258
A fine millionaire you<i>´</i>d look like
with that tin on you.

868
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,601
l didn<i>´</i>t notice
but there<i>´</i>s some guys smarter than me.

869
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,600
Here, put these on. They<i>´</i>re rubies.

870
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,768
lt<i>´</i>s just wasting time.

871
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:21,311
l<i>´</i>m handling this from now on.
l know what l<i>´</i>m doing.

872
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:23,847
Those guys got eyes like sharpshooters.

873
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,476
And take off that pushcart tie, partner.

874
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:32,219
Carvet, $5 a throw.

875
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,684
-Here<i>´</i>s some more props.
-His suit isn<i>´</i>t pressed.

876
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,458
That<i>´</i>s nothing.
They<i>´</i>ll think he<i>´</i>s an eccentric.

877
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:45,828
Cato<i>´</i>s. Handmade. lt<i>´</i>s a honey, ain<i>´</i>t it?

878
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:47,429
Here.

879
00:52:48,006 --> 00:52:49,303
Here<i>´</i>s the clincher.

880
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:51,901
Class, eh?

881
00:52:52,944 --> 00:52:58,348
<i>´´</i>To Gene, my first, last and only.
Harriet, June, 1924<i>.´´</i>

882
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:02,582
lt<i>´</i>s his wife. She<i>´</i>s suing him
for divorce now, isn<i>´</i>t she?

883
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:06,418
Hurry, we<i>´</i>re losing time.

884
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,220
<i>´´</i>My first, last and only<i>.´´</i>

885
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:12,521
lmagine a dame writing that
and meaning it.

886
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:14,392
No, l suppose you can<i>´</i>t.

887
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:17,632
Wouldn<i>´</i>t look so hot on a rain check,
would it? Come on.

888
00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:18,669
-Bill.
-What?

889
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:21,898
-Don<i>´</i>t hate me.
-You<i>´</i>re all right.

890
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:23,668
l mean, if anything goes wrong.

891
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,336
You just take a powder
and kindly omit flowers.

892
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,742
You<i>´</i>ll be back?

893
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:30,939
Those are my plans.

894
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:35,681
-l<i>´</i>m jumping inside.
-Come on, buck up.

895
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,958
lt would be funny, wouldn<i>´</i>t it,
if it turned out like l told you.

896
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:45,589
We make just as much money
saving a guy<i>´</i>s life...

897
00:53:45,663 --> 00:53:47,858
...as we would have had for trimming him.

898
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:55,397
Come on.

899
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,648
There<i>´</i>s the stairs.

900
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,413
Keep right on going, all the way down.
Don<i>´</i>t stop for a taxi in front of the hotel.

901
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:15,025
-lf there ain<i>´</i>t one there, keep on going.
-Yes.

902
00:54:37,882 --> 00:54:39,509
Well, here it is.

903
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:42,679
Are you ready, <i>diablo</i>?

904
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,428
Hello, Tony. lt<i>´</i>s okay. Come on.

905
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,394
-Hello, Jack. Hello, Eddie.
-Hello, Billy.

906
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,994
Tell Dutch l<i>´</i>m here with Mr. Engle,
will you?

907
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:02,732
Okay, come on in.

908
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,465
After you, Mr. Engle.

909
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:21,152
-Mr. Enright, this is my friend Mr. Engle.
-l<i>´</i>m glad to meet you, Mr. Enright.

910
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:23,155
l<i>´</i>m glad to see you again.

911
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:24,793
You two know each other?

912
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,127
This is the gentleman
l was telling you about.

913
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,901
-Looking for a little fun?
-l don<i>´</i>t mind.

914
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:33,338
We got a little club like this back home.

915
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:35,499
We got a little club like this back home.

916
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,902
-ls that so? Where<i>´</i>s that?
-ln Cleveland.

917
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:39,443
Fine town.

918
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,411
-Have a chair.
-Thanks.

919
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,988
lt<i>´</i>s getting kind of late for me.
What time have you got?

920
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:53,788
1:30, that<i>´</i>s all.

921
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,827
l see you<i>´</i>ve changed your tie.

922
00:55:57,195 --> 00:56:00,596
Yes, you might as well dress up
for a party.

923
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:05,800
We don<i>´</i>t usually let strangers
into the club...

924
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:08,165
...but we<i>´</i>re a little shorthanded tonight.

925
00:56:08,439 --> 00:56:12,136
As long as our friend Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien
brought you, it<i>´</i>s okay if you take a hand.

926
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:15,810
Mr. Engle was worried downstairs
he didn<i>´</i>t have any cash.

927
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,508
l told him that the members
usually play for cash.

928
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,743
No cash?

929
00:56:19,884 --> 00:56:22,785
No, but l got my checkbook with me.

930
00:56:23,488 --> 00:56:25,115
l<i>´</i>ve only used up half of it.

931
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:28,784
You know the story about the guy
whose bank told him he was overdrawn?

932
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,988
He called up the bank and said,
<i>´´</i>How can that be?

933
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:34,793
<i>´´</i>l haven<i>´</i>t used up all the checks
in my checkbook yet<i>.´´</i>

934
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:41,762
You see, he thought he was still rich.

935
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,434
l get it.

936
00:56:44,075 --> 00:56:45,804
-Cleveland, eh?
-Yes.

937
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:47,771
Cleveland Bank.

938
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:49,907
No, it<i>´</i>s the New York Bank.

939
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:54,918
l have money in the New York Bank
and in Cleveland and Chicago.

940
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:57,716
lt makes it easier
when l<i>´</i>m traveling around.

941
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:01,685
-All right with you boys?
-Sure, Mr. Engle<i>´</i>s all right.

942
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:03,817
l guess we<i>´</i>ll take your check.

943
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:05,757
How much do you want, $5,000?

944
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:08,623
That<i>´</i>s a little bit steep for a starter.

945
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:12,002
l mean, l<i>´</i>d rather have...

946
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:16,803
...$3,000 to begin with.
That ought to be enough to have fun with.

947
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,098
Okay. Here you are.

948
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,945
-You start it, Mac.
-What limit do we play?

949
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,914
Table stakes, Mr. Engle,
and all the fun you want.

950
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,042
That suits me all right.

951
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,517
l got Gibbons into my room finally.

952
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:33,022
He was out on his feet
when he was talking to you.

953
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:36,117
Lucky l didn<i>´</i>t bring him.
He was crashing around like a goat.

954
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:37,684
-Who<i>´</i>s that?
-Mr. Gibbons.

955
00:57:37,762 --> 00:57:40,128
The writer l was telling you about.

956
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:45,961
Pass.

957
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,266
l open for $100.

958
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:49,562
l<i>´</i>m in.

959
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,600
Mr. Engle?

960
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:54,941
-No. Pass.
-ln.

961
00:57:57,215 --> 00:57:59,012
-How many?
-Give me three.

962
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:00,915
One.

963
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:02,608
Three.

964
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,081
l bet $500.

965
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:07,913
Up $500.

966
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,754
l call.

967
00:58:11,629 --> 00:58:12,857
l<i>´</i>m out.

968
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,859
Three queens.

969
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,964
Always beats two pair.
A little action, huh?

970
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:19,826
Short and sweet.

971
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:56,773
Regent 4-6-0-7-1.

972
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,704
Hello, who is this?

973
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:02,374
Hello, Anna.

974
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:06,012
l want to speak to Mrs. Gibbons, please.

975
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,676
Her husband, tell her.

976
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,356
Hello, sweet. How are you?

977
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:25,602
Harriet, l<i>´</i>ll tell you, not so good.

978
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:28,862
l<i>´</i>m drunk, as usual.

979
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,372
At least l think l am. lt<i>´</i>s all mixed up.

980
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,843
l thought l had an idea for a new play...

981
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,308
...but l don<i>´</i>t seem to remember
what it was.

982
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,812
Please, darling, don<i>´</i>t get sore.

983
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:51,157
l want to talk to you.

984
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:53,923
l want to come home.

985
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:58,725
l don<i>´</i>t know, sweet.

986
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,698
Some fish trap as usual.

987
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,006
lt<i>´</i>s a hotel, l guess.

988
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:10,769
Listen, sweet, l need you.
l want to come home.

989
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,275
l don<i>´</i>t seem to be able to write
anywhere else.

990
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,984
You are sweet.

991
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,762
That<i>´</i>s very kind of you.

992
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:29,426
No, it<i>´</i>s nothing, dear.
Just a little cold, l guess.

993
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:31,767
Listen, darling...

994
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:37,331
...the only warm place l have ever been
is in your heart.

995
01:00:38,376 --> 01:00:40,708
You<i>´</i>re the only light
that didn<i>´</i>t go out on me.

996
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:42,473
All the others went out.

997
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,007
But not you.

998
01:00:47,218 --> 01:00:48,310
Thank you.

999
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:54,151
l can find my way home.

1000
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:56,383
l know the way.

1001
01:00:57,495 --> 01:00:58,860
Thank you, sweet.

1002
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:19,145
l might have known l wasn<i>´</i>t alone.

1003
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:22,442
You must pardon my bad manners.

1004
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:27,019
l don<i>´</i>t usually run out on a lady,
but l have business in the night.

1005
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:30,726
You remind me of something.

1006
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,354
l don<i>´</i>t seem to remember what it was.

1007
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:38,325
This is all very confusing.

1008
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,830
l haven<i>´</i>t done anything wrong, have l?

1009
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:42,965
No.

1010
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,204
Well, l can find my way home all right.
Thank you.

1011
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:50,778
Goodnight...

1012
01:01:51,215 --> 01:01:52,739
...Snow White.

1013
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,495
-Where<i>´</i>s he going?
-Home.

1014
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:09,556
He<i>´</i>s walking out? He<i>´</i>s picked a fine time.

1015
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,394
No, don<i>´</i>t! lt won<i>´</i>t do any good.
Let him go.

1016
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,203
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1017
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,866
He doesn<i>´</i>t remember anything.
He<i>´</i>s forgotten.

1018
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,841
He didn<i>´</i>t know who l was.

1019
01:02:21,245 --> 01:02:22,769
What<i>´</i>s happened in there?

1020
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:25,213
-Everything<i>´</i>s going all right.
-Tell me.

1021
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:28,443
He<i>´</i>s laying back, as per instructions,
waiting for the come-on.

1022
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,249
-There<i>´</i>s something wrong?
-No. Nothing<i>´</i>s wrong.

1023
01:02:36,427 --> 01:02:38,190
l suppose it<i>´</i>s worth it.

1024
01:02:40,564 --> 01:02:43,032
lt<i>´</i>s certainly making money the hard way.

1025
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:46,302
lt<i>´</i>s like being shot out of a cannon.

1026
01:03:00,618 --> 01:03:03,086
-Have you ever been to Miami?
-No.

1027
01:03:04,488 --> 01:03:06,956
You ought to go swell down there...

1028
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:10,493
...with the celebrities, in a bathing suit.

1029
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:15,159
Who knows?
You may end up with a real tycoon.

1030
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,327
Be my luck, just as l<i>´</i>m getting used to you.

1031
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:22,862
Somebody would wave a diamond collar at
you and l<i>´</i>m left alone in the cabana.

1032
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,936
What<i>´</i>s that for?

1033
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,610
For a nickel, l<i>´</i>d flatten you.

1034
01:03:32,116 --> 01:03:34,584
You make me sick
with that phony look in your eyes.

1035
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:36,620
You and Gibbons both grandstanding!

1036
01:03:37,488 --> 01:03:38,955
Don<i>´</i>t you try it!

1037
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:42,924
You just be yourself and l<i>´</i>ll be myself, see?

1038
01:03:43,894 --> 01:03:44,918
l<i>´</i>m in this for a split.

1039
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:48,863
You<i>´</i>re what you<i>´</i>ve always been,
only this time it ain<i>´</i>t for dimes.

1040
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:52,902
lf you don<i>´</i>t like it, go look for
that last buzzard of yours, Mr. Hugo!

1041
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:59,538
Listen, l<i>´</i>ve got things on my mind.
Cut it out, will you?

1042
01:03:59,643 --> 01:04:00,541
Pass.

1043
01:04:01,178 --> 01:04:03,510
You<i>´</i>re not getting much of a play,
Mr. Engle.

1044
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:05,572
l guess the deck<i>´</i>s a little cold yet.

1045
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:09,312
-Who<i>´</i>s got a cigarette?
-l<i>´</i>ve got one. Right here.

1046
01:04:12,323 --> 01:04:13,312
Thanks.

1047
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,552
-Your name ain<i>´</i>t Gene, is it?
-No.

1048
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,995
That<i>´</i>s what l thought.

1049
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,465
That belongs to Gibbons, don<i>´</i>t it?
Gene Gibbons?

1050
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:25,195
Yes.

1051
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:27,169
Yes, he let me have it.

1052
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:31,575
l guess he wanted to make me feel good,
so l<i>´</i>d put money up on his play.

1053
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:34,202
Deal them already.
Let<i>´</i>s have a little action.

1054
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,679
Of course, he was pretty drunk.

1055
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:45,287
ln fact, l<i>´</i>m kind of worried about him.
He looked pretty sick to me.

1056
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,183
That play might be...

1057
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,718
...a good idea, though, you know?

1058
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:53,553
l understand you only<i>....</i>

1059
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:59,730
l understand you put up only $30,000
for a show...

1060
01:05:00,337 --> 01:05:02,532
...and sometimes you make a fortune.

1061
01:05:07,678 --> 01:05:08,610
Pass.

1062
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:12,073
Open for $500.

1063
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,439
l<i>´</i>m in.

1064
01:05:14,552 --> 01:05:15,519
l stay.

1065
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,277
Out.

1066
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:20,448
l<i>´</i>ll play.

1067
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,951
Pass. How many?

1068
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,153
Give me three.

1069
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:29,590
One.

1070
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:31,328
One.

1071
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:33,366
l didn<i>´</i>t hear you. How many?

1072
01:05:34,004 --> 01:05:36,472
-One card, please.
-There you are.

1073
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:39,441
Check.

1074
01:05:39,743 --> 01:05:40,971
Check.

1075
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:42,745
lt<i>´</i>s up to you, Mr. Engle.

1076
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,973
Well, l<i>´</i>ll bet all l<i>´</i>ve got.

1077
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,685
There<i>´</i>s $2,500 there, l think.

1078
01:05:50,054 --> 01:05:50,782
Pass.

1079
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,483
-l<i>´</i>m out.
-That<i>´</i>s a pretty good bet.

1080
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:56,185
l thought we could bet
as much as we wanted.

1081
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,591
Sure. That<i>´</i>s right.

1082
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:00,257
$2,500, eh?

1083
01:06:01,398 --> 01:06:03,127
Your call, Mr. Engle.

1084
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:07,534
-What have you got?
-l have three aces and a pair of sevens.

1085
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,166
Beats a flush, your pot.

1086
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:13,037
That deck<i>´</i>s not so cold now, eh?

1087
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,670
No, it looks like
they<i>´</i>re beginning to run for me.

1088
01:06:15,779 --> 01:06:18,612
l pulled in that extra seven,
or you would have beaten me.

1089
01:06:18,682 --> 01:06:20,741
-Like a drink?
-Thanks.

1090
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:24,587
Looks like we<i>´</i>re beginning
to have some real action.

1091
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,761
-Pass.
-Pass.

1092
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:42,797
Mr. Engle.

1093
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:51,043
Pass.

1094
01:06:51,115 --> 01:06:53,208
-Open for $200.
-l<i>´</i>ll play.

1095
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,378
l<i>´</i>m passing.

1096
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,851
-Play.
-Pass.

1097
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:01,185
-Cards?
-l<i>´</i>ll play these.

1098
01:07:05,162 --> 01:07:06,720
Dealer takes one.

1099
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:08,629
Go ahead and bet them.

1100
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,762
Bet $2,000.

1101
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:17,201
-What you got?
-A straight, queen high.

1102
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:19,872
Good pot.

1103
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,544
You<i>´</i>re right, Mr. Engle,
they<i>´</i>re beginning to run.

1104
01:07:22,613 --> 01:07:24,604
l<i>´</i>ll keep my winnings separate.

1105
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:29,152
lt looks like l<i>´</i>m going to be here
for quite a while, so...

1106
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:32,313
...if you don<i>´</i>t mind,
l<i>´</i>d like to take a look at my friend...

1107
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:34,357
...Mr. Gibbons, before l settle down.

1108
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,323
Where is he?

1109
01:07:35,392 --> 01:07:38,384
He<i>´</i>s just down the hall,
in Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien<i>´</i>s room.

1110
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:42,291
l<i>´</i>m kind of worried
about how he<i>´</i>s getting along.

1111
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:46,432
He looked a little bit sick to me. So...

1112
01:07:47,638 --> 01:07:50,664
...l wonder if you<i>´</i>d mind
dealing me out a couple of hands.

1113
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:53,608
Sure, it<i>´</i>s all right
if you want to go take a look.

1114
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:56,569
Yes, it<i>´</i>s sort of on my mind.

1115
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,184
-lt<i>´</i>s all right if l leave this here, l suppose.
-Sure.

1116
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:09,525
l<i>´</i>m probably losing a lot of money
by stepping out, even for a few minutes...

1117
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:12,653
...but l<i>´</i>ll show you some real playing
when l get back.

1118
01:08:50,868 --> 01:08:52,893
What<i>´</i>s the matter? You lost?

1119
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,605
l forgot the number of the room.

1120
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,506
lt<i>´</i>s 1020. That<i>´</i>s it, right there.

1121
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,575
Yes, that<i>´</i>s right.

1122
01:09:06,817 --> 01:09:08,717
-Get out of here quick, you sap.
-l can<i>´</i>t.

1123
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:09,718
-Got the money?
-Yes.

1124
01:09:09,787 --> 01:09:11,914
-Get down the steps!
-The big one<i>´</i>s there.

1125
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:13,456
-Eddie?
-Yeah.

1126
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,957
-So he tailed you, huh?
-Yeah.

1127
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,591
He was right behind me.

1128
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,891
l didn<i>´</i>t notice him at first,
l couldn<i>´</i>t get rid of him.

1129
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,493
-How much you got?
-$3,000.

1130
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,731
-No more?
-No, that<i>´</i>s all.

1131
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:27,600
l had to leave the rest on the table,
l couldn<i>´</i>t take it.

1132
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:28,899
That<i>´</i>s swell.

1133
01:09:29,573 --> 01:09:30,733
That<i>´</i>s fine.

1134
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:34,540
Grabbed it all for yourself, huh?
A lot of good you<i>´</i>ll get out of it.

1135
01:09:34,778 --> 01:09:36,507
-Will he go away?
-Not him.

1136
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,241
What can l do?

1137
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:40,943
Wait a minute.
l got to figure this out, see where l stand.

1138
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:42,212
l got the money.

1139
01:09:42,286 --> 01:09:44,754
-l got the money here.
-Shut up, will you?

1140
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:52,018
-You<i>´</i>ve got to go back into that game.
-No.

1141
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:55,629
That guy out there is a killer.
He<i>´</i>ll beat your brains out if you lam.

1142
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:58,293
-l<i>´</i>ve got to take a chance--
-What about me?

1143
01:09:58,368 --> 01:09:59,835
-You know what they<i>´</i>ll do?
-Let me go!

1144
01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:00,301
Go where?

1145
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:02,836
They<i>´</i>ll murder you and me.
What<i>´</i>s in it for me?

1146
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:05,932
-They<i>´</i>ll punch me silly--
-There<i>´</i>s a fire escape l can get down.

1147
01:10:06,009 --> 01:10:08,341
You<i>´</i>re not going to get out
and leave me behind.

1148
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,243
-l<i>´</i>m going out and call Eddie.
-No.

1149
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:12,748
l<i>´</i>ll tell him you<i>´</i>re a phony
and l took a tumble.

1150
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:15,683
You tried to get out and l stopped you.
lt<i>´</i>s my only chance.

1151
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,050
-No!
-What do you mean, <i>´´</i>no<i>´´</i>?

1152
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:18,720
-You<i>´</i>re not gonna do it.
-Why not?

1153
01:10:18,789 --> 01:10:20,689
-You don<i>´</i>t want to.
-l don<i>´</i>t want to?

1154
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,851
l wanna get my insides kicked out?

1155
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:24,860
-Where<i>´</i>s Mr. Gibbons?
-He went away.

1156
01:10:24,928 --> 01:10:26,054
-Bill.
-He<i>´</i>s gone?

1157
01:10:26,296 --> 01:10:28,491
-Please, listen.
-Never mind. He did his best.

1158
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,466
-l guess l<i>´</i>m just not lucky.
-You give up quick, don<i>´</i>t you?

1159
01:10:31,535 --> 01:10:34,333
l don<i>´</i>t give up. But what can l do?
Nothing.

1160
01:10:35,305 --> 01:10:36,966
Look, just listen to me.

1161
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,341
There<i>´</i>s only one way to play it.

1162
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,810
-Cut out that Gibbons stuff, will you?
-lt<i>´</i>s not Gibbons, it<i>´</i>s me.

1163
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:47,311
l can tell you don<i>´</i>t want to give him away.
l know what you want to do.

1164
01:10:47,384 --> 01:10:48,544
Why don<i>´</i>t you do it?

1165
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:52,881
You<i>´</i>ve been calling me names all night.
l didn<i>´</i>t answer because it<i>´</i>s too easy.

1166
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,281
Anyway, the names are all true.

1167
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:58,654
Yes, they<i>´</i>re all true.

1168
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:03,299
l<i>´</i>m just somebody you picked up in a cafe,
that<i>´</i>s all l<i>´</i>ve ever been.

1169
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:07,062
You<i>´</i>re the same kind of nobody.

1170
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:10,831
We<i>´</i>re all nickels and dimes,
you, me and Engle.

1171
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:15,674
l knew it wouldn<i>´</i>t turn out right.
l mean, when we were dancing.

1172
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:20,339
l knew, because there are some people
that never make money or get anywhere.

1173
01:11:20,684 --> 01:11:21,776
That<i>´</i>s us.

1174
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,947
But, Bill...

1175
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:28,348
...l don<i>´</i>t know how to say it.

1176
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,889
There<i>´</i>s other ways of making good.

1177
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:35,396
Bill, why can<i>´</i>t we just once
pretend we<i>´</i>re big shots?

1178
01:11:37,434 --> 01:11:38,458
Come on.

1179
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:41,728
Let<i>´</i>s play it like big shots.

1180
01:11:42,406 --> 01:11:43,100
Just once.

1181
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,967
Go on, open the window.

1182
01:11:48,946 --> 01:11:50,880
-lt<i>´</i>s stuck.
-l<i>´</i>ll get it open.

1183
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:54,473
-lt<i>´</i>s too late.
-Hurry up!

1184
01:11:57,621 --> 01:11:58,781
Who<i>´</i>s there?

1185
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:00,081
Me, Eddie.

1186
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,382
Bill, keep him out there a minute.

1187
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,066
Hello, Eddie.

1188
01:12:16,406 --> 01:12:17,839
They<i>´</i>re waiting for him.

1189
01:12:17,908 --> 01:12:20,604
Who, Engle? He<i>´</i>s all right.
He<i>´</i>ll be coming right out.

1190
01:12:20,744 --> 01:12:23,872
Boss said l should hang onto him.
Thought he was copping a sneak.

1191
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:25,141
No, he<i>´</i>s all right.

1192
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:28,510
He told me he<i>´</i>s going back there
and clean up $100,000.

1193
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:29,913
You salted him good.

1194
01:12:29,987 --> 01:12:32,615
He said he<i>´</i>s just been sitting back
watching the play.

1195
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:36,151
Boss said to get him and bring him back.

1196
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:39,521
Before you go in, l want to talk to you
about something, personally.

1197
01:12:39,763 --> 01:12:40,730
What about?

1198
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:43,561
You know this guy Gibbons in there.

1199
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:46,059
The fellow with the D.T<i>.´</i>s.

1200
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,166
He writes shows.

1201
01:12:48,705 --> 01:12:51,139
-You<i>´</i>ve heard of him, ain<i>´</i>t you?
-What about him?

1202
01:12:52,476 --> 01:12:56,207
He<i>´</i>s writing this show about prize fighters.
That<i>´</i>s why l brought him over.

1203
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,411
l figured to introduce him to you,
and you could give him some material.

1204
01:13:00,484 --> 01:13:04,682
Now, what l want to know is,
will you split with me if l introduce you?

1205
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,744
Nothing doing.

1206
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:13,726
You can tell him about when you killed
the guy in the ring, remember?

1207
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,696
Ace Johnson.

1208
01:13:14,831 --> 01:13:17,231
That<i>´</i>s the time.
That<i>´</i>s the stuff he likes, dramatic.

1209
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:20,459
You<i>´</i>ve got a lot of stuff like that.
You can tell him about--

1210
01:13:20,537 --> 01:13:21,697
So, that<i>´</i>s what?

1211
01:13:47,497 --> 01:13:50,227
Engle went down the fire escape.
Go downstairs, cut him off.

1212
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,128
l<i>´</i>ll take care of this guy.

1213
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:27,297
Next time l see you, it<i>´</i>ll be the Tombs.

1214
01:14:27,537 --> 01:14:29,266
Twenty days. Take him away.

1215
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,505
Next case.

1216
01:14:32,242 --> 01:14:33,573
Charles Engle.

1217
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,212
This man was picked up in a gunfight,
Your Honor.

1218
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:43,809
We found $3,000 on him.

1219
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:45,821
-Who was shooting?
-The other fellow.

1220
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:47,880
-Got away, huh?
-We<i>´</i>re after him.

1221
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:52,287
What are you doing carrying $3,000?
Don<i>´</i>t you know this is New York?

1222
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:55,521
Your Honor, you see,
the money doesn<i>´</i>t belong to me.

1223
01:14:55,599 --> 01:14:57,965
lt belongs to Mr. Hopper. Joseph Hopper.

1224
01:14:59,336 --> 01:15:01,201
-You can call him up.
-What<i>´</i>s his number?

1225
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,972
Union 2-3-1-2.

1226
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,904
Hello.

1227
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,279
Yeah, this is Mr. Hopper.

1228
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:16,683
Who?

1229
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:21,016
l want to ask you a few questions,
and l want straight answers.

1230
01:15:21,091 --> 01:15:23,355
l wanna know
if you know a fellow named Engle.

1231
01:15:23,693 --> 01:15:24,660
ls that so?

1232
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,830
Now just a minute. Yeah, we got him.

1233
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,263
l want to ask you this:

1234
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:32,301
He<i>´</i>s got a little money on him,
he says belongs to you.

1235
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,303
lt does, eh?
How much would you say it was?

1236
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:36,862
$3,000.

1237
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,908
lt<i>´</i>s mine. Ask him, he<i>´</i>ll admit.

1238
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:42,570
l<i>´</i>m waiting for it. lt<i>´</i>s from the business.
lt<i>´</i>s mine, every penny.

1239
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:45,909
That<i>´</i>s fine.

1240
01:15:46,616 --> 01:15:48,379
Yeah, l<i>´</i>ll wait here.

1241
01:15:49,853 --> 01:15:51,377
Tell him from me, l<i>´</i>m glad.

1242
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:57,227
lt stopped raining for a change.

1243
01:15:57,227 --> 01:15:59,718
lt stopped raining for a change.

1244
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,097
A lot of good rain does.

1245
01:16:02,165 --> 01:16:05,760
$3, all night in the rain.
l ask you, what<i>´</i>s a guy living for?

1246
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:09,332
Here, keep the change, buddy.
lt<i>´</i>s your turn to get rich.

1247
01:16:10,674 --> 01:16:12,665
You feel better now, don<i>´</i>t you?

1248
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:15,841
-Yeah, l feel fine.
-lt doesn<i>´</i>t hurt so much anymore...

1249
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:17,702
...does it?

1250
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,612
l guess l<i>´</i>ll go then.

1251
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,386
l guess you don<i>´</i>t need me anymore.

1252
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,819
For what?

1253
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,220
One beating a night is plenty for me.

1254
01:16:32,295 --> 01:16:35,628
-lf you want my phone number, l--
-l don<i>´</i>t want anything.

1255
01:16:35,866 --> 01:16:37,800
l<i>´</i>m sorry you feel this way.

1256
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:40,030
Really, l am.

1257
01:16:40,737 --> 01:16:42,329
l<i>´</i>m sorry for only one thing:

1258
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,999
l butted into your romance with Mr. Hugo.

1259
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:48,901
Otherwise we<i>´</i>d have both been
where we belong.

1260
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,037
And better off.

1261
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:51,944
You can<i>´</i>t be nice, can you?

1262
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:54,779
Even if you want to.

1263
01:16:54,885 --> 01:16:58,184
You<i>´</i>re afraid you won<i>´</i>t seem
like a wise guy if you<i>´</i>re nice.

1264
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:02,015
Okay, Mr. O<i>´</i>Brien.

1265
01:17:04,427 --> 01:17:08,796
Something wonderful happened tonight.
l<i>´</i>ll remember it for a long time.

1266
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:16,335
When things don<i>´</i>t seem so wonderful...

1267
01:17:17,107 --> 01:17:20,770
...l<i>´</i>ll remember Mr. Gibbons
and Mr. Engle...

1268
01:17:23,046 --> 01:17:24,673
...and you.

1269
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:27,478
And that people aren<i>´</i>t really mean.

1270
01:17:27,717 --> 01:17:30,686
They can be better than they are
if they want.

1271
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,278
lf they<i>´</i>ll let themselves.

1272
01:17:32,722 --> 01:17:34,155
Even if it doesn<i>´</i>t last.

1273
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:36,917
They can be better than they are.

1274
01:17:40,363 --> 01:17:41,387
So long.

1275
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:09,789
-That will be $35 out of $50.
-Keep the change.

1276
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,936
Hey, you seven!
