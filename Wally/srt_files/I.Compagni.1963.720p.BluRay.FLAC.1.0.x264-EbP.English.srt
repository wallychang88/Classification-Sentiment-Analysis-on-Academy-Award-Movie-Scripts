1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:45,044
THE ORGANIZER

2
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:40,868
TURIN - THE LATE 1800s

3
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,507
Omero.

4
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,511
Wake up. It's 5:30.

5
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,433
Wash well, you hear?
Your neck and ears too.

6
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,579
Come on, lazybones.
The milk needs heating.

7
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,748
You haven't got
the coal burning yet.

8
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,876
The coal's wet.
It's so damp in here.

9
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,795
The coalman's dog
pisses on the coal!

10
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,422
Watch your mouth!

11
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,686
Hey, wake up!

12
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,108
Leave him alone.
His stomach hurt last night.

13
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,403
- He just hates schoolwork.
- That's not true!

14
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,491
Oh, yeah? Maybe I can't read,
but I know my numbers,

15
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,410
and this is a big fat zero.

16
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,124
Omero, leave money
for groceries.

17
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,753
Again? The week
isn't even half over.

18
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,221
This is the last of it,
so go easy.

19
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,475
"Go easy."
Easy for you to say.

20
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,560
Your lunch.

21
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,988
Did you wash?

22
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,596
Morning.

23
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,261
Wake up, dummy!

24
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,514
Take it easy!

25
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,394
- Same spot today?
- I'm coming. Hold your horses.

26
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,107
Don't ever call me "dummy" again,
you hear?

27
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,613
I'll call you anything I want
as long as I'm bigger than you.

28
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,618
So much for talking things over.

29
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,172
Rice and turnips again.

30
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,049
It's good for you.

31
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,177
Nusetta, here I am!

32
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,224
Some idea,
bringing the baby here in this cold!

33
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,435
He's asleep when I leave
and when I get home.

34
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,979
I've got a right to see him.

35
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,899
Hey, small-fry!

36
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,697
Look at Papa.

37
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,244
See that?
He doesn't even know me.

38
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,851
That'll teach you, you pig!

39
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,909
Nice manners.

40
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,995
They don't even give you time to eat.
Here, take this.

41
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,752
Come on, Pautasso.
You're always the last.

42
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,673
Did you have enough time to eat?

43
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,927
These cannibals wolf it down
without even chewing.

44
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,139
Come on, get moving!

45
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,559
The bastards treat us
like animals!

46
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,818
It's worse than prison.

47
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,404
To hell with all of 'em.

48
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,563
My arm!

49
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,401
Stop the machines!

50
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,486
Stop the wheel!

51
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,948
Stand back!
Let me through!

52
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,646
How is he?

53
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,317
How do you think?
Hands don't grow back.

54
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
We're taking up
a collection for Mondino.

55
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,703
Another collection.
Ls that all we can do?

56
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,663
Raoul's right.

57
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,168
Can't you even do that for the poor man?
What kind of animals are you?

58
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,170
I'll tell you!

59
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,173
We work a 14-hour shift
with half an hour to eat.

60
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,802
Then something like this happens.
Do we ask for more reasonable shifts?

61
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,890
No, we can't take any risks!
We take up a collection!

62
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,768
Right, Pautasso?
Cenerone?

63
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,395
Sheep - that's what we are!

64
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,483
What do you mean, asking me?
I'm always ready.

65
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,654
Don't believe it? Maybe
a knuckle sandwich will convince you.

66
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,407
Papa, calm down.
Words don't put food on the table.

67
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,995
Will Mondino get by on our collection?
What a laugh!

68
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,748
We don't even have
accident insurance.

69
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,209
And I'm the one
talking nonsense?

70
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,504
Martinetti, you didn't answer.
I said I'm ready.

71
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,715
- To do what?
- To give the boss an earful.

72
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,884
About what?

73
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,057
I don't know.
Anything you want.

74
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,892
I'll raise a stink!

75
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,896
To tell him 14 hours a day
is too much.

76
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,401
Right! They have to cut
the hours, or -

77
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,611
We'll form a committee
to decide who'll speak to them.

78
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,780
Good. I'll be the leader.

79
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,242
- No, we're all equal. You, him -
- And me!

80
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,495
Women too now?
Look, this is serious.

81
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,499
Oh, so we can work
and contribute to collections,

82
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,960
but not stand up for our rights?

83
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,009
Quiet!

84
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,720
Go home now. It's late.

85
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,014
Forgive us, Sister.

86
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,182
Home to bed now,

87
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,519
or tomorrow you won't even get
your drawers on straight.

88
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,819
Your father's quite a guy, eh?

89
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,614
He produced
a juicy tidbit like you.

90
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
Animal!

91
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,880
Dinner's ready for Ward 3.

92
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,008
Soup with meat and potatoes.

93
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,170
Hey, the umbrella!
Wait for me!

94
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,799
- We should turn back for you?
- What cavaliers!

95
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,635
To hell with your cavaliers.

96
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,434
- Who's gonna do the talking?
- All of us.

97
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,605
- Like an opera chorus?
- I'm no talker. Martinetti.

98
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,898
Scram!

99
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,359
All right, I'll do it.

100
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,301
- Where are you going?
- We wanted to speak to the manager.

101
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,887
Good-bye, Mr. Baudet.

102
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,225
The manager?
What do you want with him?

103
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,437
- We want to tell him something.
- Tell me.

104
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,605
It's just that -

105
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,736
- ls it a secret?
- On the contrary.

106
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,576
We speak for everyone.
It's about the accident yesterday.

107
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,080
Fourteen hours a day is too much.

108
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,670
You're really lucky, you know?

109
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:13,675
If you'd said that to the boss,
you'd all be finished.

110
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,345
Everybody in Turin
works the same hours.

111
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,974
That's why
these accidents happen.

112
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:27,105
My good man,
accidents are accidental.

113
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,941
You have to be careful
and hope they don't happen.

114
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,819
You're not going to blame
the manager, are you?

115
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,946
See you later, Baudet.

116
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,907
Enjoy your lunch, sir.

117
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,622
Listen.

118
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm on salary, just like you.

119
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm on your side.

120
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,087
I mean this sincerely:

121
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,966
Come back down to earth
and forget this nonsense.

122
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,137
Where did you ever get
such crazy ideas?

123
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,224
Go on. Speak up.

124
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,313
They're not crazy ideas.

125
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,149
What's crazy is exploiting people.

126
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,152
- Right.
- That's it.

127
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,154
Am I wrong?

128
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,430
Here.

129
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,810
Write your name
and fold it up tight.

130
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,715
Hold your horses.

131
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,677
I'll be back.

132
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,014
He's in there.

133
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,147
Another collection?

134
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,190
- You putting your name in?
- For what?

135
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,318
We're quitting early tonight.

136
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,613
- The manager agreed?
- Yeah, and pigs fly too.

137
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,034
No, we're taking matters
into our own hands.

138
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,078
We're demonstrating,
like the British.

139
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,914
Bend over.

140
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
What are the names for?

141
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,210
Just stay there.

142
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,923
To decide who'll blow
the whistle an hour early

143
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,092
so we all stop
at the same time.

144
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,761
Are you in?

145
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,139
Yeah, but the whistle-blower's
taking a big chance.

146
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,353
As soon as you hear the whistle,
shut off the steam.

147
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,189
The machines will stop,
and everyone will have to quit.

148
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,609
- Don't worry.
- Let's have the names.

149
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,822
I can't read.

150
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,993
Just great.

151
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,787
Here, you read it.

152
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,334
This guy can't write.
Who put an X?

153
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,544
Me too.

154
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,511
Forget all this. I'll do it.

155
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,347
Watch out!

156
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,726
What's going on here?
Back to work, all of you!

157
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,312
We stop at 7:30.

158
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,815
Spread the word.

159
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,526
When the machines stop,
we all leave.

160
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,550
Foreman!

161
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,681
I gotta go.

162
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,464
Go away! Beat it, mutt!

163
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,814
- Hey!
- Ready!

164
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,234
Hey, you!

165
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,403
Yeah, I'm ready!

166
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,742
Hey, you lucky devils!

167
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:37,957
You're nice and warm in here
when it's freezing outside!

168
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,920
And you'd still rather
go home earlier?

169
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,886
What's going on?

170
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,806
You sure that's our whistle?

171
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,935
Don't shut the steam off!
Don't stop the machines!

172
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,951
- Come on.
- No one's moving!

173
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,454
Didn't you hear the whistle?
Let's go!

174
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,465
Keep working!

175
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,594
There's still an hour to go.
- Something went wrong.

176
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,561
Hey!

177
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,729
Why have you got your coat on?

178
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,857
I'm cold.

179
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,989
We really came through
for Pautasso.

180
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,879
Who sounded the whistle?

181
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,506
What kind of joke is this?

182
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,192
What are you doing here?

183
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,194
Playing with the dog.

184
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,950
He's been in there
an hour and a half.

185
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,952
Here he comes!

186
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,460
Did they give him
the third degree?

187
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:20,245
Let me shake your hand
for being the only one -

188
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,666
Stop it!

189
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,419
Stop the brute!

190
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,090
Damned fool!

191
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,717
Stop it!

192
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,850
That's enough!
Pautasso, listen!

193
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,436
You're right, but let us talk!

194
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,189
No, I'll do the talking now!

195
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,233
Some friends you are!

196
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,529
You left me high and dry.
I had to pretend I was drunk.

197
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,698
"Pautasso,
have you been drinking?"

198
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:01,327
"Afraid so, sir. For my rheumatism."
You make me sick!

199
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,454
We'll get better organized.

200
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,623
We'll form a committee,
and you'll be on it.

201
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,792
Tomorrow we'll decide.

202
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,837
They've already done
the deciding!

203
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,048
Two weeks' suspension for me,
and a fine for everybody.

204
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,800
The crooks!

205
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,844
Now let me go!

206
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:21,806
Let him go on three.
One, two, three!

207
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,824
Listen carefully, all of you.

208
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,620
Forget Domenico Pautasso exists.
Cross my name off your list!

209
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,303
We'll make up your lost pay.

210
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,807
But we must remain united!

211
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,101
Sure, like my balls!

212
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,188
Foul-mouthed pig!

213
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,690
Learn some manners!

214
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,193
Papa, stop it!

215
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,113
You old walrus, let's go!

216
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,014
Take that, bastard!

217
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,149
Let me go!

218
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,530
Bastards! Murderers!

219
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:07,245
You animal!
Hit me and I'll kill you!

220
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,416
Excuse me.
What town is this?

221
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,876
A shithole of a town!

222
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,212
That's how you answer a stranger?

223
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:20,716
This is the Porta Susa district of Turin.
- Porta Susa? Thank you.

224
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:04,719
In "The rose smells sweet,"
the subject is "the rose."

225
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,723
In "The butterfly is graceful,"
the subject is -

226
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,810
The butterfly!

227
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,772
"The nightingale -"

228
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,735
The others have been here
half an hour!

229
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,112
Sorry, sir. We're late.

230
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,156
I hadn't noticed!

231
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,992
I could have been home
snug in bed by now!

232
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,703
I'm here for your good,

233
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,246
not mine!

234
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,833
Let's get this straight right now.

235
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,169
To vote
you must be able to write.

236
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,422
That's the law laid down
by our beloved government.

237
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,134
On these crude benches
is where you earn the right

238
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,595
to make your voice
heard in parliament.

239
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:51,182
This classroom
is where your brains will find

240
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,226
new power and strength

241
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:57,522
to nourish the flame of a faith
that will shine ever brighter

242
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,565
and with which we must -

243
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,115
Anyway...
forget I said anything.

244
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,619
Mr. Di Meo, sir,

245
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:15,540
we demonstrated
to leave work an hour early.

246
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,544
- But you're an hour late.
- Lt didn't go so well.

247
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,882
Barbero...

248
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,759
go to the blackboard.

249
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,814
What am I supposed to do?

250
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,401
Write anything,
whatever comes to mind.

251
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,570
Go ahead.

252
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:09,468
I'll be right back.
Copy down what Barbero writes.

253
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,394
I came along
with my father, sir.

254
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,688
Fine, go in.
We never close.

255
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,275
We live so far away.
How's he doing?

256
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,776
What can I say?

257
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,821
Not very well.
He won't apply himself.

258
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,449
But he's no trouble.
He just sleeps.

259
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,285
Don't get me wrong.
He's very smart.

260
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,624
- Yes?
- Good evening.

261
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,751
I'm Professor Giuseppe Sinigaglia.

262
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,712
Attorney Pancani
in Genoa sent me.

263
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,131
- Attorney Pancani?
- Yes, sir.

264
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,675
This letter's for you.

265
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,318
- So there's trouble there too.
- At least for me.

266
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,739
- You'll be staying here a few days.
- Exactly.

267
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,121
After class
I'll see about putting you up.

268
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,583
Nothing deluxe.
- Very kind of you.

269
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,636
DEATH TO THE KING

270
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,014
Barbero, what's that you wrote?

271
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,850
This is what you came up with?

272
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,020
Look, boys,
I share your sentiments,

273
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:48,109
but you must realize
that becoming educated

274
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,529
is also about acquiring
discipline and self-control!

275
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,085
Let's keep the racket down.

276
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,051
Quiet!

277
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:23,102
Bardella Carlini here is taking
Pautasso's place on the committee.

278
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,730
Pautasso didn't show up.

279
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,566
Go ahead.

280
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,819
Anyone want to say something?
Go ahead.

281
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,164
Shit, I didn't get
a damned word of that.

282
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,624
Such language!

283
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,587
It's Bergamo dialect.
My poor father was from there too.

284
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,549
He suggests that
instead of quitting an hour early,

285
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:58,012
we all agree to start
an hour later tomorrow morning.

286
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,094
Hey, easy!

287
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,016
Hurray for Pautasso!

288
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,356
All right, that's enough.

289
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,276
Raoul Bertone has the floor.

290
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,406
I wonder if you learned
from yesterday's fiasco.

291
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,994
Think carefully before you try
anything stupid again.

292
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,162
That's enough!

293
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,832
I've got the floor now.
- Why?

294
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,168
Because I'm on the committee,
and you're a dope. End of discussion.

295
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,337
Excuse me.

296
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,841
There's some truth
to what the young man said.

297
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,053
- Who's this guy?
- I don't know.

298
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,431
I am Professor Sinigaglia,
a guest of Mr. Di Meo.

299
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,725
May I speak?

300
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,937
Let's hear what you have to say.

301
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,068
Thank you,
and please forgive the intrusion.

302
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,364
What I wanted to say

303
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,908
is just this:

304
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,538
One should indeed think twice
before inciting any action.

305
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,957
The young man was right
on this point.

306
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,668
Wait, you big ape!

307
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,587
Go on.

308
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,968
There's no doubt
you've accomplished

309
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,387
the most important thing:

310
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,681
Near total unanimity of intention.

311
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,769
And I know how difficult it is

312
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:14,356
to gather so many workers
outside the workplace.

313
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,028
That's why I thought

314
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:24,033
it would be a pity to let
such an occasion be wasted

315
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,785
in discussing
a mere hour of work.

316
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,579
Think about it.

317
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,916
I say not just an hour,

318
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,418
but a whole day,
a whole week,

319
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,171
until your bosses realize

320
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,423
they're dealing with men,

321
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,926
not pack animals!

322
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,183
But that would be a strike.

323
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,268
Would it? Perhaps.

324
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,104
That's a strike, all right.

325
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,318
Friends, let's go on strike!

326
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,737
Whoever doesn't join us
is a bastard!

327
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,870
Just a moment, please.

328
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,623
There must be freedom of choice.

329
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,628
If the young man is afraid,
he needn't join.

330
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,214
No one's afraid here, see?

331
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:25,469
Afraid you'll all shit your pants
when it comes down to it, maybe!

332
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,138
Who is this guy anyway?

333
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,726
I have years of experience in these matters.
It was just a suggestion.

334
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,563
Show of hands for a full strike!

335
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,444
Approved "humanimously,"

336
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,989
except for Raoul Bertone.

337
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,325
I'm with you.

338
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,160
Speak up!

339
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,498
- He said he's with us.
- That's more like it.

340
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,668
Just a moment, please!

341
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:04,466
May I further suggest
you act with discretion

342
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,844
and not let word get out

343
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:11,348
until you've laid in
groceries, coal,

344
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,267
as many provisions as possible -

345
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,728
on credit!

346
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,022
Don't pay for any of it!

347
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,066
Just a moment.

348
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,864
Because you must be able
to hold out as long as possible.

349
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,660
Tomorrow, when people
find out you're on strike,

350
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:36,665
all credit will stop.
They'll slam the door in your face.

351
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,378
You should know that right now.

352
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,341
Today's Sunday,

353
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,719
and the stores close at noon!

354
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,892
Don't breathe a word of this

355
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,396
Or you'll weaken, my blond beauty

356
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,776
I'll take you for a holiday

357
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,945
By the lake or by the sea

358
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,491
Tighten your belt
and don't give an inch

359
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,578
Tighten your belt
and wave our banner high

360
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,248
Tighten your belt
We'll march by the hundreds

361
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,419
Whoever backs down now
is a traitor

362
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,784
Excuse me, Professor.

363
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,619
I forgot my -

364
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,854
Please.

365
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,002
Adele, how about coming to my place
and cooking us a big dinner?

366
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,336
Take a hike!

367
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,381
You've got me wrong, as usual.
I live alone.

368
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,551
Really? You can always find
that type of girl.

369
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,345
Ask Maria over there.

370
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,848
I see. You're jealous.

371
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,100
I'll tell Maria what you said.

372
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,186
You do that!

373
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,439
Hey, baby doll,
give me a hand.

374
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,110
- What a haul!
- I racked up five lire in credit!

375
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,863
Coming through!

376
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,075
I'll pay you tomorrow.
My hands are full.

377
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,038
Hey, is it true that tomorrow
you're all going on -

378
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,082
Watch it!
Is it true that tomorrow -

379
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,627
Right in my face!
- Outside!

380
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,878
Excuse me.

381
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,016
Evening.

382
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,355
She didn't see me, did she?

383
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,525
I don't want anyone thinking
I'm a streetwalker.

384
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,904
Quick, then.
Come inside and you'll be safe.

385
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,533
To help Italy get better

386
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,246
Italy is ailing

387
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,415
And full of woes

388
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,585
To help Italy get better

389
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,005
Give her all you've got

390
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,010
Scoundrel! Let me out!

391
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,346
- Are you crazy?
- Go to hell!

392
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,724
Who do you think I am?
You and the bearded man are pigs!

393
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,478
- What bearded man?
- Pig!

394
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,855
Damn it all!

395
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,612
Good evening.

396
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,953
- What are you doing here?
- Drying my feet.

397
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:47,040
Ls this your place? The committee
assigned me to this apartment.

398
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,501
They've kindly
appointed me their adviser,

399
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,713
so I'll have to stay
in town a few days.

400
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,799
You think this is a hotel?

401
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,051
Get your shoes on and scram!

402
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,637
Easy, fruitcake.

403
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,973
It's been decided
and that's that, see?

404
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,475
Not unless
you're paying the rent!

405
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,563
Nice way to talk!
We have to stick together, don't we?

406
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:13,066
You're the only single person
with a double bed.

407
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:16,695
- Cesarina here is single too.
- Some gentleman!

408
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,365
- A man like him would do you good!
- Selfish bastard!

409
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,496
Stop this nonsense,
for God's sake!

410
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,709
Professor, I've put your things
here in this hat,

411
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,670
because your basket
fell out in the street.

412
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,839
My toiletry kit!

413
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:41,470
Everything fell out,
but I picked it all up.

414
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,723
A darning egg, soap -

415
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,434
ls this your soap?
- Yes, thanks.

416
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,853
A sock.

417
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,688
A brush.

418
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,857
Ls this yours too?

419
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,943
- These little tubes.
- That's my piccolo.

420
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,862
What's a piccolo?

421
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,739
A musical instrument
of the early 18th century.

422
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,366
Really?

423
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,703
Imagine that.

424
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,332
And here's your horseshoe,
Professor.

425
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,126
Ls this yours?
- No, not that.

426
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,255
I told you to leave it on the ground.
I carried it all this way!

427
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:21,093
Wait, we have
to ward off bad luck.

428
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,055
And make sure we get our rights!

429
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,433
And make sure
the manager drops dead!

430
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,855
Now toss it out the window!

431
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,233
You hit someone.

432
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,820
Right on my head,
you shitheads!

433
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,405
Who's this Mustafa!

434
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:46,243
With all due respect,
I'm reporting for work tomorrow.

435
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,412
Who are you?

436
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,288
A desperate man.

437
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,082
I'm new in town.

438
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,918
I can't get credit,
and I've got a family.

439
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,254
We've all got families.

440
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,092
You northerners don't think much
of us Sicilians, I know.

441
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,594
- You would defy the committee?
- No, sir.

442
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,181
I came for your authorization.

443
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,517
That way
I won't be defying anyone.

444
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,727
What's he ranting about?

445
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,440
If you work,
you'll undermine our solidarity!

446
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,568
Idiot, we all voted!

447
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,071
Then vote again.
But think it over,

448
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,868
because I'm going to work
in any case.

449
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,620
My respects, Professor.

450
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,291
Stop!

451
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,919
Didn't you hear?

452
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,048
This is crazy!

453
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,468
Some people!

454
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,892
If that Ethiopian
goes to work tomorrow,

455
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,228
one by one they'll all go back,
with yours truly first in line!

456
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,982
Stop yammering.
We need concrete suggestions.

457
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,777
If you're serious, you'll give
that Sicilian a good thrashing.

458
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,238
Teach him a lesson.

459
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,494
If you're serious.

460
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,546
Heaven help us.
What a sad world this is.

461
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:28,845
A poor devil leaves his native village
with his starving family

462
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,931
in search of work.

463
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,724
He finds it.

464
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,893
And what do we do?

465
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,020
We snatch it from him

466
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,856
and leave him
in the darkest despair.

467
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,528
Does that seem right to you?

468
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,910
Let's give him his lesson.

469
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,703
How?

470
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,542
Friends,
unfortunately Raoul is right.

471
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,796
If we indulge in false sentiment now,
it's all over.

472
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,215
You want that, Pautasso?
- I'm Cesarina!

473
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,760
I'm Pautasso, and any scabs
will have to fight me first!

474
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,428
No mercy!

475
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,556
We can't afford mercy.

476
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,824
This is where you live?

477
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:34,160
Did you expect a royal palace?

478
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,625
Salvatore, what do they want?

479
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,589
Have you come to give me
what I asked for?

480
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:55,348
Swear you won't work
if we don't authorize it.

481
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,726
Are you gonna authorize it?

482
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,728
Swear first.

483
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,273
I swear, Mr. Pautasso.

484
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
All right. Go ahead.

485
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,642
If 13 hours

486
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,979
Don't seem much to you

487
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:47,817
You try working them

488
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,320
They seem serious, eh?

489
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,864
This is the end of the world.

490
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,033
I've been here 12 years,

491
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,994
and I never expected this
from them.

492
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,830
I'll reduce their hours all right!

493
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:06,419
What do you plan to do?
- If they don't block entry, nothing.

494
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,880
Some protection you are!

495
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,174
One of them's coming this way.

496
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:23,687
Hey, you!
Don't you know there's a strike on?

497
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,647
I've got the committee's permission.

498
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,315
Hey, Bedouin!

499
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,693
Stop him!

500
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,744
They're quarreling
amongst themselves.

501
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,582
Good. if one comes to work,
it's a good sign.

502
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,380
- Why's he get special treatment?
- Are we dumber than that Arab?

503
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,800
Let's all go in.
We'll call the others.

504
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,102
Salvatore Arrò
reporting for work, sir.

505
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:10,024
They can start the machines.
I'm ready.

506
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:13,903
To work all alone?
What do the others plan to do?

507
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,240
That's secret information
that I don't have.

508
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,617
You're defending those carrion?

509
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,037
They can't be that bad
if they gave me permission

510
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,581
to come to work.

511
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,667
Ah, so they gave you permission?

512
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,294
Yes, sir.

513
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,379
Then you can leave too.

514
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,923
I'm reporting for work,
and I'm not leaving.

515
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,550
Beat it!

516
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,137
Didn't you hear the gentleman?

517
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,140
Don't you dare touch me!

518
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,934
I told you why I'm here, didn't I?
Filthy procurer!

519
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,855
Damned be the blood of Judas
and your kind!

520
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,232
Help! He's got a knife!

521
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,026
He's gonna kill us!

522
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,780
Have you lost your mind?

523
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,949
You'll be sorry for this!

524
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,868
Get him!

525
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,247
- Careful, now!
- Stop him!

526
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,709
- Does the Arrò family live here?
- Yes. Why?

527
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,799
- What's making all that smoke?
- Wet paper.

528
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,927
What is it?
- I'm from the factory.

529
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,846
We took up a collection.

530
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,056
It's not much,
'cause we're on strike.

531
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,810
- Mama!
- What is it?

532
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,979
- They brought money!
- Who?

533
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,023
A boy from the factory.

534
00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:00,236
May the blessed Mother of God
protect your father, the poor sinner!

535
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,861
Greetings, everyone.

536
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,280
Hello.

537
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,040
Carry on, gentlemen.

538
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,750
Be seated.

539
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,090
- I was saying, Uncle -
- Speak up!

540
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,262
We can assume the workers

541
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,808
won't be able
to hold out much longer -

542
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:18,648
Meanwhile our losses
from unfilled orders are piling up.

543
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,193
Did I say you could smoke?

544
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:27,949
Everyone helps them: the troops,
social service societies.

545
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,617
But that's charity.

546
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,495
You've been living off
my charity for 20 years!

547
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,081
Wake up, all of you!

548
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:39,168
If they have friends, so do we -
and ours are more powerful.

549
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,296
We'll cut off their supplies,
block the streets,

550
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,216
until they know
who's calling the tune.

551
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,012
Then they'll be ready to talk.
Now go learn your business,

552
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:50,805
blockheads!

553
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,310
Enough. Today's a holiday,
and we've talked shop long enough.

554
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,980
Let's join the young people
and enjoy ourselves.

555
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,984
Would you like to come along?
- Very kind of you.

556
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,694
Stop.

557
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,946
No, you're not properly dressed.

558
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,073
Giovanni will see you out.

559
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,908
Good-bye now.

560
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,384
Where's this free coal
you mentioned?

561
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,637
It's my little secret.
Don't worry.

562
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,061
- Is it far?
- Just follow me.

563
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,023
What was your name again?

564
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,735
- Gesummina.
- What kind of name is that?

565
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:49,197
- It's Jesus's name.
- Jesus was a man.

566
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:53,367
He wasn't a man or a woman, dummy.
He was above everyone.

567
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,370
You're from those dark lands.

568
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,415
Talk about dark.
The sun never shines here.

569
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,919
There everything is
green, white, and red.

570
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,671
Out of the way, Omero!

571
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,841
Why'd you come up here?

572
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,929
All our troubles here in Piedmont
started when you Sicilians came.

573
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:17,183
My father says they started in Sicily
when you Piedmontese arrived.

574
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,812
Coal coming over!

575
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,079
Some secret.
Look at all these people.

576
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,707
Ls my old man on the other side?

577
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,167
I don't know.

578
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,130
- Watch out over there!
- Make way!

579
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:54,137
That's my pop!
That's our stuff, you hear?

580
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,973
I'll give him a hand.

581
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,975
Help me up.

582
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,144
Push!
- You're heavy!

583
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,856
Come on!

584
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,415
Good girl!
Give us a hand!

585
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,843
Want some help?

586
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,647
That wall's high.
You might land on something hard.

587
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,566
Stupid idiot!

588
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,068
Raoul!

589
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,909
Let go.

590
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,123
You're nuts!

591
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,585
You insult me, then call me over,
and then slap me!

592
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,712
You can get lost!

593
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,757
What are you doing over there?

594
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,592
Give me a hand.

595
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,395
Come on, baby doll.
Step lively!

596
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,567
Isn't there a watchman around?

597
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,820
Don't worry.
The professor's chatting with him.

598
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,031
Railway tie coming over!

599
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,408
Watch your noggins!

600
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,246
Why don't you do the same?

601
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:46,374
You railway employees
are a strong group.

602
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,752
Show your solidarity
with the strikers

603
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,837
and go out on strike yourselves!

604
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,845
You never let
that tongue of yours cool down.

605
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,139
Railway employees can't budge.

606
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:06,978
If we strike, they send in troops,
and we're jailed as deserters.

607
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,021
So you just sit back and watch.

608
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,440
No one's watching anything.

609
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,361
Your friends are stealing coal,
but I don't see a thing.

610
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,632
Some of you
are getting in line twice.

611
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,635
You better watch out.
I know all your faces.

612
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,308
Next.

613
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,481
What is this, a restaurant?

614
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,859
That's enough, Corporal!

615
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,569
Captain's orders!

616
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,623
The sergeant's a bastard!

617
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,167
Go fuck yourselves!

618
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,045
To hell with soldiers!

619
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,631
I hope you choke
on your god-damned soup!

620
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,622
Miss!

621
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,798
The corporal sent me.
This soup is for you.

622
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,050
Your bowl's inside.

623
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,510
Thank God.

624
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,470
And some bread too.

625
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,811
No, that one's mine.
I already took a bite, see?

626
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,231
How come you're all so skinny?

627
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,442
This strike will be
the death of us.

628
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,321
Typhus killed five people
in my hometown last summer.

629
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,740
A strike isn't a disease!

630
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,328
There's even some left for tomorrow.
Thanks again.

631
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,082
Careful. It's hot.

632
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,084
Good soup!

633
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,003
Thank God for our soldiers.

634
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,090
The professor
would let us all starve.

635
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,051
The professor's a great man.
He gives us advice.

636
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,471
I think he's a swindler -
and a stupid one.

637
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,807
You're the stupid one.

638
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:56,021
The soup tastes better here
than at the barracks.

639
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,526
Maybe it's the dishes...
or this house.

640
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:08,451
My house is just like this.
- Imagine that.

641
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,079
The window's open.

642
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,249
The smell will bring them
around like flies.

643
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,004
Too late.

644
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,884
So much for leftovers.

645
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,136
Oh, you're eating.

646
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,762
Pardon me.

647
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,147
Must be hot where you come from.

648
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,818
You're from Naples, right?

649
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,155
No, Abruzzo.

650
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,243
We get snow six feet high.
And wolves too.

651
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,497
- "Wolves" - what's that?
- Plural of "wolf."

652
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,292
That's mine!
Always in other people's pockets!

653
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:02,505
Who paid for it, and everything else
since you went on strike?

654
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:06,133
To think we farmers always say

655
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,762
that you factory workers
are the lucky ones.

656
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,098
Got a match?
- Never use 'em.

657
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,684
Like my grandfather.
He chews his cigars.

658
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,395
If you spit, you'll clean it up.

659
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,524
- Got anything to drink?
- Water and vinegar.

660
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,359
Better than nothing.

661
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,656
Nice soft doublets
they give you now.

662
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,325
In my time they felt like nettles.

663
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,118
Very nice.
- You like it?

664
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:37,623
I'll see if the quartermaster
can get you one.

665
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,917
He's a friend of mine.

666
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,045
I wear a size 12 shoe.

667
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,506
That fellow from Bergamo!

668
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,384
Pautasso!

669
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,641
What the hell are you saying?
Who wants to talk?

670
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,435
The bosses called the committee!

671
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,729
They're giving in!

672
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,023
My regards!

673
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,737
"First: A 13-hour shift,
with an hour for lunch."

674
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,614
Write that down.

675
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,409
"Second:

676
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,579
Repeal the disciplinary action
against Pautasso.

677
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:21,667
Third: Repeal the fines imposed
on the workers at large, etc.

678
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,586
Fourth, fifth and sixth:

679
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,213
Five minutes' grace time
in the morning, strike pay,

680
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,091
and accident insurance.

681
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,802
Seventh -"

682
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,932
ls something wrong?

683
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,311
How about
coffee and pastries too?

684
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,938
Aren't we going a bit far?

685
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,275
What do you mean?

686
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,902
You think it's too much?

687
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,322
It's not small change.

688
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,449
For God's sake!

689
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,784
Are the bosses
surrendering or not?

690
01:05:56,202 --> 01:06:00,623
It's absolutely unprecedented
in this stronghold of conservatism!

691
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,833
Woe to the vanquished!

692
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:07,129
Like Brenno, whom history
has deemed an oppressor and yet -

693
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,682
Fine.
You talk and I'll write.

694
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:21,352
Workers injured on the job -

695
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,064
What?
I should come here in secret

696
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,109
to avoid upsetting
my blockhead of a father?

697
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,694
Don't shout!

698
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,656
I'm shouting so he'll hear me!

699
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:38,285
For the last time, don't ever
set foot in my house again!

700
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,167
Who do you think you are?

701
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,629
You can croak for all I care.

702
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:51,298
I came to see Mama, you hear?

703
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:55,344
Since you're so ashamed of me
in front of these imbeciles.

704
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,430
Yes, I take any man who pays,

705
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,308
and anyone
who's interested can find me

706
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,811
at the Caffè Corsini
on the piazza.

707
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,067
Get out of here!

708
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,861
- Giulio!
- Forget about him!

709
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,885
The bosses are probably waiting.

710
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,141
Excuse my saying this -

711
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,601
No, Cesarina,
family matters are private.

712
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:49,314
It's just good manners.
- Good manners say ladies go first.

713
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,900
Easy, friends. Don't hurry.

714
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,069
Let the bosses wait.

715
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,090
Come in.

716
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,677
About time.
It's been an hour.

717
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,764
Who's going in first?

718
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,601
Excuse us.

719
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,657
Well?

720
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,368
Come in!

721
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,038
Don't be shy.

722
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,883
Sorry for the short delay.
I was busy.

723
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,844
So...

724
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:04,264
these are our agitators.

725
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,144
You don't have bombs
in your pockets, do you?

726
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,235
Let's introduce
this distinguished delegation.

727
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,487
This is Martinetti,

728
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:22,950
and the others are
Porro, Camerone, and -

729
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,620
No need to introduce her!
This is the lovely Cesarina!

730
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,123
Remember when you first came
to the factory in '71?

731
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:33,627
I'd have liked
to give you a good pinch.

732
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,256
We saw to that ourselves, sir.

733
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:44,888
And aren't you
the one who likes

734
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,182
the bottle?

735
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,728
Now I see
why they call you people "Reds."

736
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,524
Mind you:
I like that kind of red too.

737
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,069
We're not Reds, sir.

738
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,865
I know.
You're all hard workers.

739
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,077
Doing work that has its compensations,
even if it's a bit hard.

740
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,830
"Man is the only animal
that has to work,"

741
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:13,208
said that philosopher,
what's-his-name.

742
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,961
Well, I'm one
of those animals too.

743
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:23,176
But you feel
things would be better

744
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,637
if we were a bit more indulgent.

745
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:31,268
Gentlemen, shall we rescind
the fines on these rascals?

746
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,438
- If you think so.
- Let's rescind them.

747
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:39,359
As for our whistle-blower,

748
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,740
we abolish his suspension
and end the whole matter.

749
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,409
Satisfied?

750
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,838
Sir, allow me to speak to you
man-to-man.

751
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,132
We can't go back
to our colleagues

752
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,259
with a mere consolation prize.

753
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,929
Look here.

754
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,765
If you call my offer
a consolation prize,

755
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,309
this becomes
a whole other matter.

756
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,103
I know what's happened.

757
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,940
You've let that vagrant
get you stirred up.

758
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:22,361
He's a rabble-rouser
and a fugitive from justice!

759
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,615
That's not true, sir.

760
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,284
Look, you whiners,

761
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,120
you know how many
are unemployed around here?

762
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,039
Skilled workers like you,

763
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:37,501
willing to work this minute,
under worse conditions.

764
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,090
In Saluzzo, 200 factory workers
are out on the street.

765
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:50,681
I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones,

766
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,142
but I need an answer
by tomorrow.

767
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,480
Otherwise, I too have
interests to look out for.

768
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:03,819
And the unemployed from Saluzzo
will be on the next train here.

769
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,946
Pautasso!

770
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,784
Come on out here!

771
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:14,496
The bosses have called in the scabs!
- Scabs?

772
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:19,251
Where are they?
- They're coming from Saluzzo!

773
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,211
Goddamn it!

774
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:26,258
Where are you going
in your drawers, you lunkhead?

775
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:32,305
Fine results you got, you dopes!

776
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:37,436
He calls himself a leader!
Uncle, did you hear what Pop did?

777
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,479
You should be ashamed!

778
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,696
No!
Where are you going?

779
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,741
Leave that here, you idiot!

780
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:55,203
Pautasso, we'll stop 'em
at the freight yard!

781
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,998
Go get the professor!

782
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,292
Adele, my jacket!

783
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,803
Cesarina, climb up out of the way.

784
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,139
This could get dangerous.

785
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,475
Dangerous? Why?

786
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,020
We've got to talk to them
and convince them.

787
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,980
They're just like us.

788
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,067
What have you got here?
What's this?

789
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,902
For self-defense.

790
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:30,322
That hurt, damn it!

791
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,241
"Talk to them"!

792
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,619
We'll see if yakking
changes their minds.

793
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:38,413
We didn't ask you to come,
Mr. Doomsayer.

794
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,457
Fine. Pretend I'm not here.

795
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,250
Here they come.

796
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:20,622
Off the tracks!

797
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,582
Out of the way, you bums!

798
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,336
Are you crazy?

799
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,385
Out of the way!

800
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:43,645
Friends!
Fellow workers from Saluzzo!

801
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,856
We have nothing against you.

802
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,066
Listen to us.

803
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,569
We're the striking workers.
- Who's this lunatic?

804
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,821
Just a moment, please!

805
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,615
Hear me out!

806
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,580
We've been forced
to strike for our rights.

807
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,332
That's why these people
are sacrificing, starving -

808
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,336
We're starving too.
We haven't worked in a month.

809
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,463
I understand.

810
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,799
That's just what the bosses
seek to exploit.

811
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,843
Don't play their game!

812
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:19,181
So we all starve together?
Who gains from that?

813
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,474
Wait!

814
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:24,352
Start the train!
They're trying to keep us out!

815
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,188
Where are you going?

816
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,192
Beat it, preacher!

817
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,944
Friends!

818
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,239
Why are you doing this?

819
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:40,493
Gang up on one guy, will you?

820
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,547
Unhook it, quick!

821
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,971
Get down here, you bastard!

822
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,557
Come down off that train!

823
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,935
Get out of here, you bum!

824
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,079
Take that!

825
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,415
You rat!

826
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,969
Let's discuss this rationally!

827
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:40,929
Let's talk it over!

828
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,873
No, stop!

829
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:13,295
Where's the switch?

830
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,131
I'll divert it to the sidetrack.

831
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,175
The express is coming!

832
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,970
Come back, Pautasso!

833
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,764
Pautasso!

834
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,196
Just then,
the express was arriving -

835
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:24,115
We're from the gas works.
Who do we give this to?

836
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,534
Cesarina's handling the collection.

837
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:32,040
It's all we could manage.

838
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,833
Thanks all the same.

839
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,381
A drop in the ocean.

840
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,843
After all this, we at the munitions
works better tread cautiously.

841
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:47,764
I agree.
We probably should never have -

842
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,939
- He's right.
- Who?

843
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,357
Martinetti.

844
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:01,111
There's been nothing but trouble
since that professor showed up.

845
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:04,572
And now the workers from Saluzzo
have taken your jobs.

846
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,576
Idiot. You don't
understand anything.

847
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:12,914
We can hardly get by,
even with the soup from the barracks.

848
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:19,379
I'm thinking of cutting my hair
for a little money.

849
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,090
- Your hair?
- They pay well for it.

850
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:25,260
For those fake things
for women's heads.

851
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,470
The word's
on the tip of my tongue.

852
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,933
- And then what?
- What do you mean?

853
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:35,270
You'll be cute
with your head shaved.

854
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,522
What do you care?

855
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,649
Antonio didn't say anything.

856
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,360
What's he got to do with it?

857
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,779
It's just that...

858
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,949
we're engaged.

859
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,841
- He's not much to look at.
- You don't have to think so.

860
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:55,600
They're pinning it all on the strikers,
but it's not true.

861
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,436
Are you having a mass
said for him?

862
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,565
There's something
I've tried so often to tell you,

863
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,109
but I always chose
the wrong words...

864
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,905
and now I've chosen
the wrong moment.

865
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,075
Say it anyway.

866
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,661
Gentlemen!

867
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,009
Why all the long faces?

868
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,595
Haven't you seen the paper?

869
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:18,099
The bosses are taking
a beating over this. Listen.

870
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,561
"Factory manager being held."
- What's that mean?

871
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:26,274
The scabs are being sent back
to Saluzzo to prevent further incidents.

872
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,277
I told you something
would happen if we held out.

873
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:33,531
Sure, a man lost his life.
Happy now?

874
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,701
How many more do you want?

875
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,038
What are you doing?

876
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,807
Shove your paper in my face again
and I'll smash your snout in!

877
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,602
Sure, you've got
the muscle for it,

878
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,439
but you got any ideas
in that brain of yours?

879
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:10,068
That's all you care about -
your stupid ideas.

880
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,403
You're not here to help us.

881
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:17,742
We're dumb animals with no ideas, eh?
Why should you care about us?

882
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,829
You're being foolish and unfair.

883
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,211
Then tell me the truth.

884
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:32,090
Can we really pull this off?

885
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,718
Look at me, damn it!

886
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:40,556
There's only a handful of us.
We're divided and discouraged.

887
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,060
They're powerful, well-connected,
sure of themselves.

888
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,979
So I don't know.

889
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:50,441
It might even be impossible.

890
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:55,697
Then you're a lunatic and a scoundrel!
You want to destroy us all?

891
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,075
You expect to win the first time?
That doesn't happen!

892
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,620
That would be too easy.
And you're not the first, you know.

893
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:06,332
This fight began with Spartacus!
- Who's Spartacus?

894
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,251
I'll tell you some other time.

895
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,504
But you have to hold out
and make them pay

896
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,549
so they know that next time
it'll be even worse.

897
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:18,344
That in itself would be a victory!
And don't hog the covers!

898
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,639
But we take all the risks, right?

899
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,891
What do you care?

900
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,612
You're not one of us.

901
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,744
You'll vanish one day
just as suddenly as you appeared.

902
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,914
You're right.

903
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,041
I'm not like you.

904
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,213
I have no home, no family,

905
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,257
no friends.

906
01:24:57,468 --> 01:25:01,512
No one's interested in me
except the police.

907
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,443
Then why are you doing this?

908
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,195
Why?

909
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:21,783
Because I'm full of foolish ideas.

910
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:44,305
Good boy, Quinterio.
Fagiolini, my regards to your father.

911
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,641
No, Pierino, not you.

912
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:51,479
This is from grades 1, 2 and 3.

913
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,982
Miss Spirinbergo refused,
of course.

914
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,193
Thank you.

915
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,575
- Di Meo.
- Good morning, sir.

916
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:08,371
I spoke to you yesterday about
a complaint from the school board,

917
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,999
and I was very civil,
you must admit.

918
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,336
One can be decent
without being a socialist.

919
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:20,466
Yet despite my explicit order
to the contrary,

920
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,302
you organized
yet another collection.

921
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,640
I'm the assistant principal!

922
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,559
You're a spy!

923
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,980
What are you doing?
- Returning this to the children.

924
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,523
Hands off!

925
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,775
I said hands off!

926
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:42,446
Teach your pupils
good citizenship - period!

927
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:45,199
You weren't hired
to engage in subversive activity!

928
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,951
Subversive activity!

929
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,704
It's a simple act of compassion
for a deceased worker.

930
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,374
It's a wonderful lesson
for the children!

931
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,167
Don't shout at me!

932
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:59,589
We should just keep teaching them
about tyranny and servitude!

933
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,425
Enough!
I'm going to report you!

934
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,552
Fine!
I'll write the report myself,

935
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,263
so it's not full of stupid mistakes!

936
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:10,308
Pompous ass!

937
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,667
Good morning, sir.

938
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:41,130
Tell your friends there'll be
no more collections at school.

939
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,465
I'm sorry.

940
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:46,761
Sir, how's my little brother
here doing?

941
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,930
He's not stupid.

942
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,766
But he doesn't study,
so he's not doing well.

943
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,311
Tell your mother
to keep after him.

944
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,142
You have to study, you hear?

945
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,187
I don't like school!

946
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,982
I want to work
in the factory like you!

947
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,276
You're gonna graduate,
you hear me?

948
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:54,078
I'll kill you
before I let you do like I did!

949
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,143
Blow.

950
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:42,251
Lazy bums!
Good-for-nothings!

951
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:56,599
- What's your excuse?
- Mr. Luigi!

952
01:29:56,725 --> 01:30:00,311
Must I notify you when I'm coming
so you'll be on the job?

953
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:04,356
- But the strike -
- Am I paying you or not?

954
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,359
Then you have a duty here,
strike or no strike!

955
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:10,112
That goes for you too!

956
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,906
Go to hell!

957
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:20,539
Look at these figures.

958
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,417
I did more in half a day
than you do in a month!

959
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:26,087
In four weeks
we haven't billed a cent.

960
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,216
Our clients are ordering
their goods elsewhere.

961
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:33,511
Here, read!
The time's come for action!

962
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,387
No more excuses!

963
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,307
We've taken steps
in several directions.

964
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,644
Even the textile union voted to -

965
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,104
I don't care!

966
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,816
These people will stick it out
as long as that meddler's here.

967
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,360
You there - earn your salary.

968
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:53,322
Notify the police that
the public safety is threatened.

969
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,826
That bum of a professor has a record.
Why don't they arrest him?

970
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:58,702
Maybe you're right.

971
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:00,955
No maybes.

972
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,130
Otherwise we'll have to give them
everything they want!

973
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:10,798
Carlo.

974
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,934
Either we get rid of that professor
or we throw in the towel.

975
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,118
It's just the right temperature.

976
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:24,163
- Some chicken?
- No, I hate chicken.

977
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,873
But you like me, eh?

978
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,250
Come on. Just a bit.

979
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,563
- Who's that?
- I know that man.

980
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,739
That's not allowed here.

981
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,910
Give me something
for that man.

982
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,996
Two lire!
Who is he - Verdi?

983
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:08,791
Please leave.

984
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,640
Hey, wait!

985
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:29,603
Here.

986
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:34,733
Do you work at the factory?
- No, I'm a professor.

987
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:38,654
- Professor of -
- No, a high-school professor.

988
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:44,076
- Then excuse me for giving you -
- Charity?

989
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,453
That's what I was playing for.

990
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:50,874
Then you're not like
that starving crusader.

991
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:52,751
Who? I know so many.

992
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,462
He's ashamed of my money.

993
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,550
Says he earns his by honest work.
- Who?

994
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,051
My father.

995
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:05,472
He says I should work in the spinning mill,
my hands in water 16 hours a day,

996
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,018
and end up in the hospital
like all those other idiots.

997
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:10,978
So I changed jobs.

998
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:14,398
Did I harm anyone? Did I?

999
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,860
You did just fine.

1000
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,616
You mean it?

1001
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:26,243
Of course.

1002
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,747
As you see,
I changed jobs too.

1003
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,001
How'd you get messed up
in all this?

1004
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:37,004
- Out of selfishness.
- I don't understand.

1005
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:38,839
Because I like it,

1006
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:42,176
and when you like something,
it's not a sacrifice.

1007
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:46,680
And to ensure that someday
a girl like you...

1008
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:51,810
won't have to make
the choice you had to.

1009
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:23,050
Transferred to Cassino?

1010
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:27,179
I guess I was too much
for the principal.

1011
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:31,725
On the anniversary
of Garibaldi's death, for instance -

1012
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,568
Are any of our men there?

1013
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,530
I can leave you his address.

1014
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:47,074
Please do.
There's pen and paper there.

1015
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,755
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1016
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:19,106
Food for your journey.

1017
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:22,067
No, I'd be taking it
right out of your mouth.

1018
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,236
No, not out of mine.

1019
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,086
Why do we do all this?

1020
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,964
Maybe we're
out of our minds after all.

1021
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:45,859
Professor Sinigaglia?

1022
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,946
He's not in.
And who might you be?

1023
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:51,865
Who are you?

1024
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,993
Raoul Bertone.
The professor's my guest. Why?

1025
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,204
- When's he due back?
- I don't know.

1026
01:37:57,372 --> 01:37:59,540
Fine. We'll wait.

1027
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:05,045
- Police?
- Headquarters.

1028
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:08,048
Good Lord!
What's the professor done?

1029
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:18,016
Don't worry.
It's just my darning egg.

1030
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:21,144
Nippy, isn't it?

1031
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,975
- There's nothing on it.
- Why'd you throw it away?

1032
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,811
- I've got too many papers.
- Don't move!

1033
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:11,945
You there.

1034
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,410
Are you Professor Sinigaglia?
- What?

1035
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:24,207
I don't understand.
Who are you?

1036
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,127
We're from police headquarters.
Your papers.

1037
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,301
Stop!

1038
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,391
Good evening.

1039
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:08,270
Why are you dressed
like that in this cold?

1040
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:10,564
I left in a bit of a hurry.

1041
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:14,234
You'll catch bronchitis
in a hurry too.

1042
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,737
Please sit down.
- Sit down?

1043
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:18,363
Thank you.

1044
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,077
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:30,500
Please, another for the lady.
- Don't bother.

1046
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:32,753
No, please.
I'll have this one.

1047
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:35,881
You're very kind.

1048
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,594
Anyway,
bronchitis is better than jail.

1049
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,638
I'm innocent, mind you,

1050
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,434
but we drive them crazy,
so they hound us.

1051
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:06,703
- Where were you headed?
- Nowhere special.

1052
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,372
I didn't want to put
my friends at risk.

1053
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:17,547
Don't you have family?

1054
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:23,303
A wife and two children.

1055
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:29,976
But my wife and I didn't get along -
my fault, to be sure.

1056
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:33,063
I lead a rather chaotic life.

1057
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,484
They're better-off
with my father-in-law.

1058
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,946
The old owl's rich,
but he's a good type.

1059
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:47,494
And teaching
was a bore anyway.

1060
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:51,164
I should have a picture
of the little devils somewhere.

1061
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:56,127
Of course, they must be
young men by now.

1062
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:58,880
- And this?
- You like it? It's yours.

1063
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:00,757
Ah, here it is.

1064
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:03,802
I'm coming.

1065
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,513
I'm afraid...

1066
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:08,890
it's a bit tattered.

1067
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:16,690
- Handsome, aren't they?
- They're good boys.

1068
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:21,820
I'm coming!

1069
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:23,947
My glove.
- Sorry.

1070
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:32,080
Listen, Professor,
go sleep at my place tonight.

1071
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,457
Portici Cavour No. 4,
second floor.

1072
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,544
No, I couldn't take advantage
of your kindness.

1073
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,337
Don't worry about that.

1074
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,256
I'll see you later.

1075
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,842
Since you're so kind,

1076
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:46,636
would you deliver
a message for me?

1077
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:48,263
Certainly. To whom?

1078
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:51,892
Raoul Bertone.
Via Caval di Ferro No. 18.

1079
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:56,354
Tell him they must hold out,
that we're going to win.

1080
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,732
Thank you so much.

1081
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:03,236
Bruna, put it all on my bill.

1082
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:04,905
Very well.

1083
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,372
- Who's that?
- A most exceptional character.

1084
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:16,249
Really?

1085
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:26,885
With an exceptional appetite.

1086
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:05,632
Who's there?

1087
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:06,925
Excuse me.

1088
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,219
No, excuse me.

1089
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:12,138
Ah, you brought my things.
- I hope it's all there.

1090
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,015
I'm sure it is.

1091
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:18,061
A lovely girl named Adele
gave them to me.

1092
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:21,439
Ah, Raoul's girlfriend.

1093
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:24,985
- He's at her house.
- Her house? Why?

1094
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,988
They questioned him for hours.

1095
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:31,074
They did, huh? And then?

1096
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,785
When they released him,

1097
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,912
he decided to relocate too.

1098
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:39,082
Damn! I'm sorry.
The poor fellow.

1099
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,668
Did they rough him up?

1100
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,004
Not at all.

1101
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,756
As for you being hounded,
Professor,

1102
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:50,510
you're also wanted for wounding
a policeman in Genoa.

1103
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,303
I know.

1104
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:56,349
But they can't touch me.
It was self-defense.

1105
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,855
Just what were you up to?

1106
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,236
You asleep in there?

1107
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,449
I asked
what you were up to in Genoa.

1108
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:16,036
Sorry.

1109
01:46:16,162 --> 01:46:17,996
Genoa, you say?

1110
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:21,374
Nothing really.

1111
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:24,210
I was crossing the piazza
when the police stopped us.

1112
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:27,505
Stopped "us"?

1113
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,883
So you weren't alone.

1114
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:34,679
No, there were 300 of us.

1115
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:37,348
There were 300 of you?

1116
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:41,644
Why not just come out
and say it was a demonstration!

1117
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:43,438
Ls that against the law?

1118
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,982
All right, all right.

1119
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:52,906
Looks like you'll be
hiding out here a while.

1120
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:55,700
Are you kidding?
I have to set an example.

1121
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:59,913
If I show I'm afraid,
the strike will falter.

1122
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,874
It's the factory owners
who are faltering.

1123
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,626
Seriously?

1124
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:09,297
I've been told
they'll cave in before you do.

1125
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,049
How do you know?

1126
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:14,260
Mr. Baudet is
my girlfriend's client.

1127
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:20,391
Really? Please thank her
for this welcome news

1128
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:23,311
that confirms all my theories,
as I've tried to -

1129
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:25,480
We'll discuss all that tomorrow.

1130
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:27,941
It's late. Good night.

1131
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,784
Would you please close the window?

1132
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:48,962
Good night.

1133
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:08,898
If you'll clean up a bit first,
there's room for you here.

1134
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,984
I'm coming!

1135
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,701
Don't bother, Rosa.
I'll get it.

1136
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,752
Good old Martinetti.
How are you?

1137
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:34,966
I thought of having
the shop fix my old stove,

1138
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:39,512
but then I remembered
that you fixed it for me once.

1139
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,015
And you'll do
a better job anyway.

1140
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:43,850
Come on in.

1141
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:46,144
There's the old piece of junk.

1142
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:50,690
I'd appreciate it if the others
didn't hear about this, sir.

1143
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:54,444
Why should they care?
The strike is the bosses' affair.

1144
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,155
I'm on salary like you.

1145
01:48:57,323 --> 01:48:58,364
Go on.

1146
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:00,825
Rosa, two cups of coffee.

1147
01:49:21,513 --> 01:49:23,014
So...

1148
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:25,850
how are things going, Martinetti?

1149
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:32,315
You know,
after this long strike...

1150
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:38,529
maybe it's time
to take stock, eh?

1151
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:42,116
Let's not discuss that, please.

1152
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:46,788
I only came for the money,
for my wife's sake.

1153
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,916
- What's wrong with her?
- She's pregnant.

1154
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:53,711
She has kidney trouble,
a high fever, and other stuff.

1155
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:57,006
She should be in the hospital.
- Really?

1156
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,095
Much more of this
and we'll all end up there.

1157
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,104
Your stove is fine.

1158
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:16,734
Look, I know Professor Spaziani
at the gynecological clinic.

1159
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,237
I could talk to him.
- Thank you.

1160
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:21,948
I'm your friend.
You know that.

1161
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:30,206
Then couldn't you help us
with the bosses?

1162
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:35,461
Convince them
to give in just a little.

1163
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:38,089
Maybe I shouldn't say this,

1164
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,591
but we can't hold out much longer.

1165
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:44,971
Set that here.

1166
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:49,684
No, no, run along.

1167
01:50:58,444 --> 01:51:00,153
Make yourself comfortable.

1168
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:11,414
It's too bad,

1169
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:16,085
but the bosses
can hold out for years.

1170
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:20,089
Just last night the old man
told me he'll never give in.

1171
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:23,468
It's a matter of principle with him.

1172
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:27,472
Besides, you've shown
your strength now.

1173
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:30,475
So take a tip from me

1174
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:32,435
and play it smart.

1175
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:37,231
Give in first to show you're coming
from a position of strength.

1176
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:39,192
They'll show their appreciation.

1177
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,528
Striking for 31 days
is already something.

1178
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:45,615
We've shown the bosses
we have the upper hand.

1179
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,909
Now that they know that,

1180
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:52,538
we should play it smart
and make the first move,

1181
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:56,626
because it's a matter
of principle with them.

1182
01:51:57,169 --> 01:51:59,045
They can hold out for years.

1183
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:03,132
So you're saying
we should back down?

1184
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,051
Back down?

1185
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:07,595
I'm just saying that,
for better or worse...

1186
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,556
since we're still united,

1187
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:14,435
we can go back
with heads held high and -

1188
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:18,481
ls it true
there's a general meeting later?

1189
01:52:18,607 --> 01:52:20,566
That's what we decided.

1190
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:23,236
To decide whether
to go back to work.

1191
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,407
You didn't consult
with the professor?

1192
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:28,908
The professor!

1193
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:31,202
We're not married to the man.

1194
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:35,415
We've listened to him for weeks.

1195
01:52:41,255 --> 01:52:43,172
Friends, you know me.

1196
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:47,051
I was the first to act
while you were all still asleep,

1197
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:50,430
and now I say
let's go back to work.

1198
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,557
They're not monsters.

1199
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:56,144
They have families too.
They have wives and children.

1200
01:52:57,312 --> 01:53:01,816
Tell me: Did they pay you
to spout this crap?

1201
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:15,413
Raoul, no insults here.

1202
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,624
You can speak your piece
at the meeting.

1203
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:28,551
Omero!

1204
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,431
Professor!

1205
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:45,776
It's Omero!

1206
01:53:57,247 --> 01:53:58,331
What is it?

1207
01:53:58,499 --> 01:54:00,666
Raoul says to come quickly!

1208
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:02,919
They want to go back to work!

1209
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,174
Goddamn it!

1210
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,392
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1211
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,270
- I have to go.
- They'll arrest you!

1212
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:25,483
They'll arrest you!
- Probably. In fact, almost certainly.

1213
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:27,527
I have to go.

1214
01:54:29,613 --> 01:54:32,573
Just like that?
Without a word?

1215
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:35,159
Don't ever come back!

1216
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:37,578
Look at that oaf!

1217
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:41,082
I don't ever want to see him again,
dead or alive!

1218
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,209
Scoundrel!

1219
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:48,881
You'll end up
in the hospital, not jail!

1220
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:52,385
At least put this on,
you stubborn fool!

1221
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:14,282
Looks to me like the majority
want to go back to work.

1222
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,368
Let's take a count.

1223
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:19,704
- Can't you see?
- A count?

1224
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:21,914
What's to count?
Isn't it obvious?

1225
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:25,751
It's an important decision.
I want a count.

1226
01:55:25,877 --> 01:55:28,421
All right.
We'll do it the other way.

1227
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:30,047
Hands down.

1228
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:34,719
Those in favor of continuing
the strike, hands up.

1229
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:39,098
Satisfied?

1230
01:55:39,474 --> 01:55:40,933
Count them.

1231
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:58,451
Forgive me.

1232
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:03,998
In my rush I forgot my glasses.

1233
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:07,960
But even if
I can't see you clearly,

1234
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,213
I know all the same who voted

1235
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,633
to keep up the fight.

1236
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:15,968
Barbero?

1237
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:18,304
Yes, Professor.
Now and forever!

1238
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:21,223
Good. I knew it.

1239
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:22,475
Gallesio!

1240
01:56:22,643 --> 01:56:24,685
I won't back down!

1241
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:28,939
Bardella.

1242
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:31,817
Isn't Bardella here?

1243
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,654
I'm right here.

1244
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:38,741
So you've joined the others too.

1245
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:42,662
Bunch of lily-livers!

1246
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:48,334
Please, friends.

1247
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:54,382
No, they're not
a bunch of lily-livers.

1248
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:56,967
They're the majority,

1249
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:01,180
and the majority
is the voice of wisdom.

1250
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:04,308
You're the crazy ones -
you, Barbero, and you!

1251
01:57:04,476 --> 01:57:08,688
You who think 13 hours a day
on the job is enough.

1252
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,524
You who'd like
a few extra pennies.

1253
01:57:11,692 --> 01:57:14,527
You who'd like to avoid
the hospital or the poorhouse.

1254
01:57:14,695 --> 01:57:17,071
The majority are the wise ones.

1255
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:19,782
They feel their salary is enough.

1256
01:57:20,117 --> 01:57:23,994
The proof: No one has actually
died of starvation yet.

1257
01:57:24,705 --> 01:57:26,956
And statistics show

1258
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:30,376
that only 20%% of you
are maimed in accidents.

1259
01:57:30,544 --> 01:57:33,045
How many are here?
Five hundred?

1260
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:38,509
Then only 100 of you
will end up crippled.

1261
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:42,054
You, Baietto, or you, Occhipinti,
or your daughter Gasperina.

1262
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:45,224
Mondino, where are you?
- Right here.

1263
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:49,228
Show them!
That's what the majority wants!

1264
01:57:49,396 --> 01:57:53,733
No! We've starved for 30 days now.
We've lost! Can't you see?

1265
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,735
- Who says so?
- Everyone!

1266
01:57:55,861 --> 01:57:57,486
Friends, it's not true.

1267
01:57:57,612 --> 01:58:01,240
We haven't lost.
This is the crucial moment.

1268
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:04,577
The side holding out
just one hour longer wins!

1269
01:58:04,745 --> 01:58:08,748
The bosses are even worse-off!
- How do you know?

1270
01:58:08,915 --> 01:58:13,043
- I know! You must believe me!
- No more blind faith!

1271
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:16,881
- Our cupboards are empty!
- And our stomachs too!

1272
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:21,635
Your stomachs will stay empty,
and your children's too,

1273
01:58:21,762 --> 01:58:23,763
if you give up this fight now!

1274
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,681
The bosses will always win,

1275
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:29,810
and your misery
will continue to enrich them!

1276
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:31,896
It's not our factory!

1277
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:33,606
Not yours?

1278
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:37,109
Who works there
14 hours a day their whole life?

1279
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:39,153
Whose sweat keeps
the machines going?

1280
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:40,571
Ours!

1281
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:43,073
Then take it!

1282
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,451
The factory is yours!

1283
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:49,455
Show them it means more to you
than your own homes!

1284
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:52,166
Make the bosses, the city,
and the government see

1285
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:55,252
that it's your life and death!

1286
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:59,381
Go, my friends!

1287
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,664
Got it bad, eh?
Seeing her again?

1288
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,499
They're good people.

1289
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,836
Attention! Present arms!

1290
01:59:37,254 --> 01:59:40,464
All officers are to report immediately.
Sound the call.

1291
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:46,846
That's us!

1292
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:50,516
All leaves are canceled!
Fall in, quickly!

1293
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:55,229
Dress quickly! Look lively!

1294
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:57,857
All leaves are canceled!

1295
01:59:58,024 --> 02:00:02,027
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS!
WE WANT A 13-HOUR DAY!

1296
02:00:46,448 --> 02:00:49,241
Company halt!

1297
02:00:57,959 --> 02:01:00,085
Captain, what should we do?

1298
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:01,962
Clear the square.

1299
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:05,049
Line up
in front of the factory, men!

1300
02:01:05,926 --> 02:01:08,510
Company forward!

1301
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:20,022
Halt!

1302
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:35,704
Dismount!

1303
02:01:44,464 --> 02:01:47,633
In rank, forward march!

1304
02:02:10,365 --> 02:02:12,199
Give me a piece.

1305
02:02:16,287 --> 02:02:18,163
What are we doing here?

1306
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:20,958
I don't really know...

1307
02:02:21,876 --> 02:02:23,669
but I smell trouble.

1308
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,727
Here they come!

1309
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:43,897
Ready.

1310
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:46,567
Company, ready!

1311
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:05,836
Cowards!

1312
02:03:06,004 --> 02:03:07,755
Criminals!

1313
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:12,426
- Bastards!
- Exploiters of the people!

1314
02:03:13,094 --> 02:03:16,346
You're on the bosses' side!

1315
02:03:18,349 --> 02:03:22,436
Let us through!
We want to enter the factory!

1316
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:25,147
The factory is ours!

1317
02:03:33,073 --> 02:03:34,948
Come here, you!

1318
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:37,409
Raoul!

1319
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,834
Get ready, and stay calm.

1320
02:03:46,628 --> 02:03:49,630
They've got you
in their sights! Beat it!

1321
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:57,262
Disperse!

1322
02:03:58,139 --> 02:03:59,807
Stop!

1323
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:04,103
Murderers!

1324
02:04:06,815 --> 02:04:08,816
Captain, what do we do?

1325
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:12,361
Get back or we open fire!

1326
02:04:16,491 --> 02:04:20,661
Take aim and prepare to fire!

1327
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:22,121
Fire!

1328
02:04:56,156 --> 02:04:57,990
Omero!

1329
02:04:59,742 --> 02:05:02,119
Where are you going?
Are you crazy?

1330
02:05:02,704 --> 02:05:06,540
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

1331
02:05:09,919 --> 02:05:12,671
It's your fault! Goddamn you!

1332
02:05:12,797 --> 02:05:14,798
You killed him!

1333
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:17,885
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1334
02:05:19,721 --> 02:05:22,264
Let me go!

1335
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,800
Hello, Adele.

1336
02:06:41,636 --> 02:06:43,679
I couldn't go to your place.

1337
02:06:43,805 --> 02:06:45,931
The police are still standing guard.

1338
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:49,851
I collected a few things
from our friends.

1339
02:06:50,812 --> 02:06:53,188
- And the professor?
- Still in jail.

1340
02:06:53,356 --> 02:06:55,983
But we're making him
a candidate in upcoming elections.

1341
02:06:56,150 --> 02:06:58,902
If he's elected,
they'll have to let him go.

1342
02:06:59,237 --> 02:07:02,990
Cenerone and Cesarina
are going door-to-door for him.

1343
02:07:03,157 --> 02:07:04,741
Good idea.

1344
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:10,747
He sent you this.

1345
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:15,168
A friend's address in Lugano.

1346
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,337
Amazing.

1347
02:07:19,007 --> 02:07:20,716
He doesn't give up.

1348
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:23,719
Even in jail
he's thinking of others.

1349
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:25,637
The train.

1350
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:14,311
Write to me!

1351
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:16,521
What?

1352
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:19,232
Write to me!

1353
02:08:20,068 --> 02:08:22,444
But you can't read!

1354
02:08:23,821 --> 02:08:26,365
Write anyway!
