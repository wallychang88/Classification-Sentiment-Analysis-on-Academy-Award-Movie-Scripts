1
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,749
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:11,207
Right.

3
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:14,624
Come on through.

4
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,683
Another 20 minutes,
we were gonna start looking for you guys.

5
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,249
God, it's really something out there.

6
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,196
You look a mess, sir.

7
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,416
Yeah?
Your turn next, Ginsberg.

8
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,374
Okay, I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:35,207
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:41,225
What was that you were saying now?

11
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,541
Oh, so I used to hear her chant

12
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:47,291
all night long.

13
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,457
Over the plants?

14
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,304
Yeah, she'd cup her hands over those seeds

15
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,749
and she'd chant by the hour.

16
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,707
She grew the most
beautiful wandoos you ever saw, man.

17
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:56,749
Primo stuff. Resin city.

18
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,656
Stand clear.

19
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:14,933
Your mother's been
very worried about you guys.

20
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,166
The roads must be a bear, huh?

21
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,374
- What roads?
- Visibility.

22
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,957
Visibility? Bullshit.

23
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,291
You guys haven't been on
time for the last six months.

24
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,679
Well, I wrote you guys up in the log book.

25
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,311
Yeah, you're a prince, Bevan.

26
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:33,249
Good night, gentlemen.

27
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:43,964
So that was, like, sensimillia, right?

28
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,499
Sinsemilla.

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,916
This grass made Thai
stick taste like oregano.

30
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,457
Lay you out flat, man.

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,582
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

32
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,249
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

33
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,986
Give it a thump with your finger.

34
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,166
Alarm reset.

35
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,600
<i>Skybird, this is Dropkick</i>

36
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:26,082
<i>with a Red Dash Alpha
message in two parts.</i>

37
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,374
<i>Break, break.</i>

38
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,541
<i>Red Dash Alpha.</i>

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,142
- Stand by to copy message.
<i>- Red Dash Alpha.</i>

40
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,291
Standing by.

41
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,582
<i>Romeo, Oscar, November,</i>

42
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,582
<i>Charlie, Tango, Tango, Lima, Alpha.</i>

43
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:45,041
<i>Authentication, two, two, zero, zero,
four, zero, Delta, Lima.</i>

44
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:49,082
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

45
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:51,624
I agree with authentication also, sir.

46
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,749
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

47
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,791
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

48
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,332
Target selection complete.

49
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,791
Time on target sequence complete.

50
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,416
Yield selection complete.

51
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,863
<i>Begin countdown T-minus 60.</i>

52
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,999
All right, let's do it. Insert launch key.

53
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,166
Stand by.

54
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:39,082
Launch key inserted.

55
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,624
Roger.

56
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,999
On my mark, rotate launch key to set.

57
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:45,999
Three,

58
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,166
two,

59
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:48,457
one,

60
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,457
mark.

61
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:50,892
<i>T-minus 50.</i>

62
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,207
Roger, at set.

63
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:10,517
- Sir.
<i>- T-minus 40.</i>

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,999
Uh, enable missiles.

65
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,249
Number one enabled, two enabled,

66
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,332
three enabled, four, five...

67
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,339
Let's try to get
somebody on the goddamn phone!

68
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:24,041
Seven, eight...

69
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,832
...nine.

70
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:31,392
- Ten. All missiles enabled.
<i>- T-minus 30.</i>

71
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,176
Get me Wing Command
post on your direct line.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,475
That's not the correct procedure, Captain.

73
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,707
SAC. Try SAC headquarters on the HF.

74
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,475
That's not the correct procedure.

75
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,957
Screw the procedure.
I want somebody on the goddamn phone

76
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,791
before I kill 20 million people.

77
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,972
<i>T-minus 20.</i>

78
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,332
I got nothing here.

79
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,139
They might have been knocked out already.

80
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,916
All right.

81
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,874
On my mark, rotate launch keys to launch.

82
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,624
- Roger. Ready to go launch.
<i>- 15, 14...</i>

83
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,499
13, 12, 11.

84
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:11,041
<i>Seven, six, five...</i>

85
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,975
- Sir, we have a launch order.
<i>- ...four, three...</i>

86
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,332
Put your hand on the key, sir.

87
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,707
- I'm sorry.
<i>- ...two, one, launch.</i>

88
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,999
Sir, we are at launch. Turn your key!

89
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,124
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,999
Turn your key, sir!

91
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,156
They're cleared.
You can go ahead and open it up.

92
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,392
- Hello, I'm Pat Healy.
- How do you do?

93
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,975
- I'm Lyle Watson.
- Oh, we've met before.

94
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,249
This is Arthur Cabot.

95
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,725
Yes,
I'm Pat Healy, Dr. McKittrick's assistant.

96
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,017
- How do you do?
- We've got some passes

97
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,582
for you here.

98
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:34,916
We have scheduled
a meeting pending your arrival.

99
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,666
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask me.

100
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,999
I'd be happy to fill
you in, in any way I can.

101
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,041
I've read the briefing.

102
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,166
They're here.

103
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,041
Good.

104
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:40,707
Let's go.

105
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,499
Cabot and Watson came alone.

106
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,582
No senators. No congressmen.

107
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,392
I wish they had
brought a couple of senators.

108
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,624
What?

109
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,933
I'd like to tell them
what's going on around here.

110
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,207
Oh, John, please,
don't start that right away.

111
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:56,374
I've had them on
the phone and they're calmed down.

112
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,916
Well, look, now, are we positive

113
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:03,957
that these men had no way
of knowing this was only a test?

114
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,416
Lyle, for God's sakes,

115
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,302
how many times are
we gonna go through this?

116
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,267
It doesn't make any difference anymore.

117
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,611
I've spoken to each of these men,

118
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:12,707
they all believed it is the real deal.

119
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,951
Now, look, we gotta be on
a plane in less than an hour.

120
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,433
I'm the one that has
to explain to the President

121
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,916
why 22 percent of his missile commanders

122
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,832
failed to launch their missiles.

123
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,624
What am I supposed to tell him?
"22 percent isn't so bad"?

124
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,999
The President knows
that I am fully responsible

125
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,207
for the men in my command, sir.

126
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,374
I've ordered a complete re-evaluation

127
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,416
of our psychological screening procedure.

128
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,332
What? Wait a minute.
Excuse me, General.

129
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:38,374
We can't ask these men to go back

130
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,021
to the President of the United States

131
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,916
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!

132
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:44,582
Besides, you can't
screen out human response.

133
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,707
Those men in the silos
know what it means to turn the keys,

134
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,457
and some of them are just not up to it!

135
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,249
Now, it's as simple as that!

136
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,499
I think we ought to
take the men out of the loop.

137
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,124
Mr. McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.

138
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,433
- Why am I out of line?
- Wait a minute.

139
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:03,642
What are you talking about, out of line?

140
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,666
Excuse me.

141
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,332
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

142
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,142
What do you mean?
Take them out of the loop?

143
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,457
Gentlemen, we've had men in these silos

144
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:15,291
since before any of
you were watching <i>Howdy Doody</i>.

145
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:20,374
Now, for myself,
I sleep pretty well at night

146
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,291
knowing those boys are down there.

147
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,874
General, we all know they're fine men,

148
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,541
but in a nuclear war,
we can't afford to have our missiles

149
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,582
lying dormant in those silos

150
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,874
because those men refuse to turn the keys

151
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,582
when the computers tell them to!

152
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,041
You mean when
the President orders them to.

153
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,124
The President will
probably follow the computer war plan.

154
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,291
Now, that's a fact!

155
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:43,666
Well, I imagine
the Joint Chiefs will have some input.

156
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:44,916
You're damned tooting!

157
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,082
Well, hell, the Soviets
launch a surprise attack,

158
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,249
there's no time.

159
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,666
23 minutes from warning to impact.

160
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,916
Six minutes if it's sub-launched.

161
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:55,957
Six minutes. Six minutes.

162
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,124
That's barely enough time

163
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,791
for the President to make a decision.

164
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:00,291
Now, once he makes that decision,

165
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:01,791
the computer should take over.

166
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,916
Now, sir, I know
that you've got a plane waiting for you,

167
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,808
but if you could
indulge me for five minutes,

168
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:09,374
I'd like to show you something.

169
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,291
These computers give us instant access
to the state of the world.

170
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,374
Troop movements, Soviet missile tests,

171
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,791
shifting weather patterns.

172
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,416
It all flows into this room,

173
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:27,832
and then into what
we call the WOPR computer.

174
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,332
WOPR. What is that?

175
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,624
It's the War Operation Plan Response.

176
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,374
This is Mr. Richter.

177
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,058
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

178
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:39,624
Well,
the WOPR spends all its time

179
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,666
thinking about World War III.

180
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:46,499
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,

181
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,374
it plays an endless series of war games,

182
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,666
using all available
information on the state of the world.

183
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,082
The WOPR has already fought World War III

184
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,166
as a game time and time again.

185
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:02,499
It estimates Soviet
responses to our responses,

186
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,832
to their responses, and so on.

187
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:08,166
Estimates damage, counts the dead,

188
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,772
then it looks for ways to improve...

189
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,999
Well, but the point
is that the key decisions

190
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,624
of every conceivable
option in a nuclear crisis

191
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,291
have already been made by the WOPR.

192
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,304
So, what you're telling me
is that all this trillion-dollar hardware

193
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,767
is really at the mercy of those men

194
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,124
with the little brass keys?

195
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,666
That's exactly right.

196
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,582
Whose only problem is
that they're human beings.

197
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:27,999
But in, what, 30 days,

198
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,082
we could replace
them with electronic relays.

199
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,624
Get the men out of the loop.

200
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:36,332
Gentlemen, I wouldn't
trust this overgrown pile

201
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,707
of microchips any
further than I can throw it.

202
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,558
And I don't know if you wanna trust

203
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,499
the safety of
our country to some silicone diode.

204
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,291
General, nobody is
talking about entrusting

205
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:50,416
the safety of the nation
to a machine, for God's sake.

206
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:54,124
We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here
at the top, where it belongs.

207
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,791
All right, gentlemen,
I think I'm gonna recommend

208
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,582
McKittrick's idea to the President,

209
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,749
and I'll get back to you on this.

210
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,957
Thank you.
You won't... you won't regret this.

211
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,707
Okay, you had fries and a Coke, right?

212
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:50,332
Damn!

213
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,332
- Hi, David.
- Hey, Howie.

214
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,541
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

215
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:03,416
You wanna take this over?

216
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:04,749
- I gotta go.
- Sure.

217
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,957
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

218
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:12,666
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

219
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:26,291
All right, question number two.

220
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,124
Seeds that are germinated in water

221
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,999
before they are planted will...

222
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:34,832
What?

223
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,166
Rudwick.

224
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,332
- Sprout roots.
- Oh, David!

225
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,791
Nice of you to join us.

226
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,249
Oh, David, I have
a little present for you up here.

227
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,666
Question number four.

228
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,457
In the history of science,
novel and innovative concepts

229
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,832
occasionally arise from
sudden left-field inspiration.

230
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:04,832
Miss Mack.

231
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,624
Could you tell us
your answer to question number four?

232
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,707
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

233
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:13,916
Um...

234
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:16,457
Love?

235
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:19,582
Love.

236
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,332
Jennifer, what do you know

237
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,374
about nitrogen nodules that we don't?

238
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,374
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

239
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:31,249
- No.
- I see.

240
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:35,457
No, you didn't know
the correct answer, symbiosis,

241
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:40,041
because you don't pay attention in class.

242
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,832
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

243
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:47,097
Now, there seems to be a lot of confusion

244
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,457
on this next question.

245
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,666
Asexual reproduction.

246
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,916
Could someone tell me, please,

247
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:58,957
who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex?

248
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:08,916
Miss Mack?

249
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,517
- Yes?
- What is so amusing?

250
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,916
I...

251
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:16,041
Come on.

252
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,832
All right, Lightman.

253
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,767
Maybe you could tell
us who first suggested

254
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,374
the idea of reproduction without sex.

255
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:25,624
Um...

256
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:26,874
Your wife?

257
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,082
Get out, Lightman. Get out.

258
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,072
Mr. Liggett wants me to discuss

259
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,041
my attitude problem with Mr. Kessler.

260
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,106
I think Mr. Kessler is getting tired

261
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,832
of discussing your attitude problem.

262
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:50,582
Me, too.

263
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:25,124
Lightman. What a surprise.

264
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,832
- Won't you come in?
- Yes.

265
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:42,957
Hi.

266
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,244
Whoa!

267
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,291
Hi.

268
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,016
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble today.

269
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,457
I just couldn't stop laughing.

270
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:50,707
Oh, that's okay. You were perfect.

271
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:52,166
- I was?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,332
You want a ride home?

273
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,499
Yeah.

274
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Hop on.

275
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,207
Whoa!

276
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,791
So you got an F on
that test today, too, huh?

277
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:09,791
Yep.

278
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:12,082
I guess we're both gonna
be stuck in summer school.

279
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,332
- Not me.
- Oh, why not?

280
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:16,249
You have to make up Biology.

281
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,874
I don't think so.

282
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,041
Why not?

283
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,207
Why not? Come on, tell me!
Why not?

284
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:23,957
Make a left.

285
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,392
Why don't you come up to
my house and I'll show you?

286
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,142
What are you gonna show me?

287
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,874
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how to... How to do it.

288
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:34,707
Hi, Beau.

289
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,499
- Hey, Beau.
- Oh, hi, Beau.

290
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,541
- Hey, Beau. How you doing?
- Oh!

291
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,387
- Beau, Beau, Beau, Beau, Beau!
- Come here, little baby.

292
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,749
Beau! Beau!

293
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,541
Beau.

294
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,041
My room's upstairs.

295
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,127
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

296
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,582
Ooh.

297
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:16,749
Oh.

298
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,582
Oh.

299
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:20,332
Little mess.

300
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,791
That's okay. You should see my room.

301
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,416
You're really into computers, huh?

302
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:35,582
Yeah.

303
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,541
What are you doing?

304
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,332
Dialing into the school's computer.

305
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,267
They change
the password every couple of weeks,

306
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,791
but I know where they write it down.

307
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,957
Are those your grades?

308
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,124
Yep.

309
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,457
I don't think
that I deserved an F. Do you?

310
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:25,874
You can't do that!

311
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:27,499
Already done.

312
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,117
Do you have a middle initial?

313
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,749
K. Katherine.

314
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,291
Those are my grades.

315
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,624
How can anybody get a D in Home Ec?

316
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,951
That's none of your business.

317
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:47,249
- Can you erase this, please?
- No, it's too late.

318
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
What are you doing?

319
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:50,832
I'm changing your Biology grade.

320
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:53,100
No, I don't want you to do that.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

321
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:54,832
No, nobody can find out.

322
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:56,832
There, you just got a C.

323
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,225
Now you don't have to go to summer school.

324
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,207
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't possibly...

325
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:01,374
I said change it back.

326
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:03,457
Okay, okay.

327
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,041
I guess I better get going.

328
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:16,624
Thanks for the ride.

329
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,957
Yeah, okay. Bye.

330
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:24,124
Bye.

331
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,957
- Get down, get down. Come on.
- It's my favorite...

332
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,850
You've already had your dinner.
Now, just sit.

333
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:26,874
Sit. Stay.

334
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,642
Don't forget you have
to take out the garbage.

335
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,666
- Yeah.
- David, David, put that lid on real tight

336
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:33,267
so Beau doesn't dump over the trash.

337
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,499
- I know, Ma.
- Shh.

338
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,916
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

339
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,249
Sure, I think we can really work out

340
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,791
some creative financing.

341
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,082
Oh, but you've gotta see it.

342
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:48,124
There's a Jacuzzi in the master bedroom,

343
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,457
and, honey, you know what that means.

344
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:53,291
I mean, those jets, they really work.
You know?

345
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,124
You are so naughty.

346
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,457
Oh, sure.
We can work that out.

347
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:05,457
Well, now, that is true.

348
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,017
You're gonna have a balloon payment

349
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,082
at the end of five years,
but that's nothing.

350
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:11,124
The economy is gonna be great then.

351
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,392
Beau. Come here, Beau.

352
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,016
He who dances must pay the piper.

353
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,933
- See you, Dad.
- Well, that's wonderful.

354
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:18,207
I'll meet you tomorrow at 9:30. Bye.

355
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:23,666
You know, I worry about that kid.

356
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:24,832
Why?

357
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:29,707
I don't know. Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

358
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,832
This corn is raw!

359
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,916
I know, isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp!

360
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:40,082
Of course it's crisp.

361
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:41,767
- It's raw!
- No, it's terrific.

362
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,041
You can just taste
the vitamin A and D in here.

363
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:45,207
It's great.

364
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:48,332
Could we have pills and cook the corn?

365
00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:50,600
<i>What city, please?</i>

366
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,291
Yeah, for Sunnyvale, California.

367
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:57,582
- The number for Protovision.
<i>- Yes. That's 555-8632</i>.

368
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,582
Thank you, and could you also tell me

369
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,124
what other prefixes cover that area?

370
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:08,499
<i>There's 399, 437, 767, 936.</i>

371
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,124
Thanks.

372
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,957
Protovision, I have you now.

373
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,332
<i>Hello?</i>

374
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,791
<i>Saul's Fish Market.</i>

375
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,624
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

376
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:18,499
What?

377
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,791
Well, I've been thinking,
that thing with my grade,

378
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:22,541
can you still change it?

379
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,683
- Oh, I don't know.
- I can't believe I was so stupid.

380
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,249
I should have just let you do it.

381
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,666
I don't know.
It might be kind of rough.

382
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:30,999
- Why?
- Why?

383
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,392
"Cause they might've changed the password.

384
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,707
Well, maybe they didn't.
Can't we at least try?

385
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,476
Damn!

386
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:40,707
Please?

387
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

388
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,017
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on.

389
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,499
Sorry you lost your game.

390
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,582
What's it doing?

391
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,457
Oh, it's dialing numbers.

392
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:05,291
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

393
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:07,332
Excuse me.

394
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:09,874
This computer company is coming out

395
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,041
with these amazing new
games in a couple of months.

396
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,249
The programs for them are
probably still in their computer,

397
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:18,207
so I told my system to
search for other computers

398
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:19,999
in Sunnyvale, California.

399
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:27,166
They answer with a tone
that other computers can recognize.

400
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:28,457
Hear?

401
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,999
You're calling every number in Sunnyvale?

402
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:35,874
Isn't that expensive?

403
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:37,457
There's ways around that.

404
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:39,874
You can go to jail for that.

405
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,832
Only if you're over 18.

406
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,058
Is this gonna take a long time?

407
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,707
I'd like to get my grade changed.

408
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,624
That's funny, actually,

409
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,499
"cause I already changed it.

410
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,291
I told you not to do that.

411
00:27:57,832 --> 00:28:00,374
Yeah, I know, but
I figured you'd change your mind.

412
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:02,957
I didn't want you to flunk.

413
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,166
Well, what did I get?

414
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,707
You got a D.

415
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:08,499
You gave me a D?

416
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:09,749
No, you got an A.

417
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,082
I was kidding.

418
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,207
Oh, well, that's okay.

419
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:16,124
Here, let's see what we have so far.

420
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,082
Excuse me.

421
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,041
- Did you really give me an A?
- Yeah.

422
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:25,916
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

423
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:33,791
Oh, hey, you got a bank.

424
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:35,350
Gotta make a note of that one.

425
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,832
Might come in handy some day.

426
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,166
Pan Am.

427
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,457
Where should we go?

428
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,374
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

429
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:49,707
New York?

430
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:51,034
- New York, okay.
- No, Paris!

431
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,100
- Paris.
- Paris.

432
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:53,374
Okay.

433
00:28:57,624 --> 00:28:59,082
Will you be traveling alone?

434
00:28:59,582 --> 00:29:00,666
Yeah.

435
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,416
No. You wanna go with me?

436
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:03,582
Okay.

437
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,249
All right.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

438
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,832
- Nonsmoking.
- Nonsmoking.

439
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,249
All right, Miss Mack,

440
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,124
you're confirmed on Pan Am's flight 114,

441
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:20,791
leaving Chicago's O'Hare
airport at 8:15 AM on 18 August.

442
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:23,249
Do we need a rental car? No.

443
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,791
We really have tickets to Paris?

444
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:26,666
No. You have a reservation, though.

445
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:38,374
It doesn't identify itself. Huh.

446
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,541
Try anything.

447
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,874
"Connection terminated."
How rude.

448
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,931
- I'll ask it for help.
- Can you do that?

449
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,207
Yeah, on some systems.

450
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,767
See, the more complicated they are,

451
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,416
the more they have to help you out.

452
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:05,916
Now what?

453
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:08,791
Help games.

454
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,832
"Games refers to models,
simulations, and games, which have..."

455
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,267
- That must be them.
- "...tactical and strategic

456
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,058
- applications.” What does that mean?
- I don't know,

457
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,058
but that's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer, will you?

458
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,582
I wanna get a printout of this.

459
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:29,624
List games.

460
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,416
Oh, my God.

461
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,683
So, these guys can tell
you what that printout means?

462
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:09,166
Yeah, they probably
invented it in the first place.

463
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,791
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

464
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,999
"Cause these guys
can get a little nervous.

465
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:43,874
Jim.

466
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:46,416
Oh. Lightman.

467
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:51,832
Hi, Lightman.

468
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,582
I want you to take a look at this.

469
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,374
- Hey, what's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

470
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,541
Wow! Where'd you get this?

471
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,267
I was trying to break into Protovision.

472
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,267
I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

473
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,851
- Can I have this, please?
- Hey, wait, Jim. I'm not through yet.

474
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:19,100
Remember you told me to tell you when

475
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:20,832
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

476
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:21,999
Remember that?

477
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:23,291
You're doing it right now.

478
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,332
"Theater-wide
biotoxic and chemical warfare."

479
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:36,582
This didn't come from Protovision.

480
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,642
You bet it didn't!
Ask him where it did come from, Jim.

481
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,624
- Go ahead, ask him.
- I told you already.

482
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,707
Looks military to me. Definitely military.

483
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,249
Probably classified, too.

484
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,207
Yeah, but if it's military,

485
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:47,499
why does it have games
like checkers and backgammon?

486
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,106
Maybe because those are games
that teach basic strategy.

487
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,683
Jim, how do I get into that system?

488
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,332
I wanna play those games.

489
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:56,225
You're not supposed
to see any of that stuff.

490
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,832
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

491
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,039
You'll never get in there.

492
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,582
Hey, I don't believe
that any system is totally secure.

493
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,350
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- Yeah, I bet you he couldn't!

494
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,749
- I bet you he could.
- Well, you'll never get in

495
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,832
through the front-line security,
but you might look for a back door.

496
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:12,558
- What's that?
- I can't believe it, Jim.

497
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:13,767
That girl's standing over there listening,

498
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,392
and you're telling
him about our back doors?

499
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,832
Mr. Potato Head. Mr. Potato Head!

500
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,124
Back doors are not secrets!

501
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,451
Yeah, but, Jim, you're
giving away all our best tricks.

502
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:24,041
They're not tricks.

503
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:25,207
What's a back door?

504
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,933
Well, whenever I design a system,

505
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:29,791
I always put in a simple
password that only I know about.

506
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,624
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

507
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,832
I can bypass whatever
security they've added on.

508
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,207
That's basically what it is.

509
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,541
Yeah?

510
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:42,707
Okay. You really wanna get in,
find out as much as you can

511
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,394
about the guy who designed the system.

512
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,582
Oh, come on, I don't
even know the guy's name.

513
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,457
Boy, are you guys dumb!

514
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:49,624
You guys are so dumb.

515
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,457
I got this thing all figured out.
I figured it out all by myself.

516
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:54,582
Oh, yeah, Malvin?
How would you do it?

517
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:56,624
The first game in the list.

518
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,207
Go right through Falken's Maze.

519
00:35:57,874 --> 00:35:59,874
Oh, baby, hi.

520
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,874
Hi, I'm Jennifer. Is David here?

521
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,082
How do you do?

522
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:10,749
Yeah. He's up in his room.

523
00:36:13,332 --> 00:36:14,457
Thanks.

524
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:17,791
Have you ever heard of the word tumulus?

525
00:36:17,957 --> 00:36:20,457
Tumulus? No, I haven't, sorry.

526
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:22,041
Neither have I.

527
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:26,332
Yeah?

528
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,416
Hi.

529
00:36:29,457 --> 00:36:30,999
- Where have you been?
- What?

530
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:34,291
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

531
00:36:34,457 --> 00:36:35,457
Oh.

532
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:37,624
Oh, no, no.

533
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,791
I was, uh, I was doing things.

534
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:41,749
You wanna sit down?
How are you?

535
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,457
No, I'm gonna get some water, okay?

536
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:45,707
- Okay.
- What is all that stuff?

537
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:48,124
Oh, it's nothing.
I was just...

538
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,642
Well, I was trying to find out more

539
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,499
about the guy
who designed those game programs

540
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,416
so I could get his secret password.

541
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,791
- Why?
- Why? Because...

542
00:36:57,957 --> 00:37:00,832
What's so special about
playing games with some machine?

543
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,166
Oh, no.

544
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:03,916
No, it's not just some machine.

545
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,249
Here, look at this.

546
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:09,832
This is a tape
that I got from the library.

547
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,666
It's about this guy named Falken.

548
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,499
He was into games as well as computers.

549
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:19,100
He designed them so that they could play

550
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:21,749
checkers, or poker, chess.

551
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,058
What's so great about that?
Everybody's doing that now.

552
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:26,666
Oh, no, no, no. What he did was great.

553
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:28,707
He designed his computer

554
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:30,999
so that it could learn
from its own mistakes,

555
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,091
so they'd be better
the next time they played.

556
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,916
The system actually learned how to learn.

557
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,666
It could teach itself.

558
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:41,957
If I could just get that damn password,

559
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,416
I could play the computer.

560
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,124
That's him. That's Falken.

561
00:37:50,082 --> 00:37:51,082
That's him?

562
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:53,124
Wow.

563
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,416
He's amazing-looking.

564
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,332
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

565
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:00,916
No. He's dead.

566
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:02,624
He's dead?

567
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:03,957
Yeah.

568
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,957
Here, look. Here's his obituary.

569
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:08,957
He wasn't very old.

570
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,624
Well, he was pretty old. He was 41.

571
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,832
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

572
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:17,957
That's his little boy.

573
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:20,416
Oh, yeah?

574
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,416
This is really sad.

575
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,767
Did you know the child and his mother
were killed in a car crash?

576
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,666
- Yeah, I know.
- "In the years that followed

577
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:30,207
the tragic loss of his family,

578
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,624
Dr. Falken's health deteriorated.”

579
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:41,582
My dad is 45.

580
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:47,308
I remember once he was
really sick, and we thought...

581
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:48,541
What was his name?

582
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:50,457
My father?

583
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,082
No, no, no. No. Falken's kid.

584
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,207
Joshua.

585
00:38:58,374 --> 00:38:59,666
It can't be that simple.

586
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,957
- Wow.
- What?

587
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,082
We got something.

588
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:24,791
We're in!

589
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:28,499
It thinks I'm Falken.

590
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,291
Hello.

591
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,749
How can it ask you that?

592
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,332
It'll ask you whatever
it's programmed to ask you.

593
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,374
- You wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah.

594
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,457
I'll ask it how it feels.

595
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:46,999
I'm fine.

596
00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:50,457
How are you?

597
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,457
<i>Excellent. It's been a long time.</i>

598
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,707
<i>Can you explain
the removal of your user account</i>

599
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:02,416
<i>on June 23rd, 19737?</i>

600
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,291
They must have told it he died.

601
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:11,874
People sometimes make mistakes.

602
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:14,666
- <i>Yes, they do.</i>
- How can it talk?

603
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:16,666
It's not a real voice.

604
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,994
Uh, this box just interprets
signals from the computer

605
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,081
and turns them into sound.

606
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,541
<i>Shall we play a game?</i>

607
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,166
Oh.

608
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:26,791
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah.

609
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,166
Weird, isn't it?

610
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:29,332
Love to.

611
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:35,874
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

612
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,707
<i>Wouldn't you prefer a good game of chess?</i>

613
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,707
Later.

614
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:48,082
Let's play Global Thermonuclear War.

615
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:49,957
<i>Fine.</i>

616
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:51,791
All right!

617
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:54,916
Wow.

618
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,041
<i>Which side do you want?</i>

619
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,592
I'll be the Russians.

620
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,874
<i>Please list primary targets.</i>

621
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,332
Who should we nuke first?

622
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:14,707
Um. Oh, let's see.

623
00:41:14,874 --> 00:41:17,707
How about Las Vegas?

624
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:19,416
Las Vegas. Great.

625
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,666
What next?

626
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:24,874
- Seattle!
- Yeah!

627
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,041
Kill them.

628
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,109
I have seven... Correction, eight.

629
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,624
That's eight Redbirds,
two degrees past apogee.

630
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,332
Better get the old man down here.

631
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,017
<i>Cobra Dane,
we have Soviet missile warning.</i>

632
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,624
<i>Check for malfunction
and report confidence.</i>

633
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:55,207
Projected target areas.
NORAD regions 2-5, 2-6.

634
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:11,624
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

635
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:14,082
<i>Initiating emergency conference. Stand by.</i>

636
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:18,457
19 degrees past apogee.

637
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:20,600
<i>Possible 18 targets in track.</i>

638
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:23,957
Estimate re-entry at 19:23 Zulu.

639
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,749
What you got up here, Joe?

640
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,356
Sir, we have a radar tracking.

641
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:38,332
Eight inbound
Soviet ICBMs already over the Pole.

642
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:39,916
Estimated impact, 11 minutes.

643
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:42,249
Confirmed target area,
Western United States.

644
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,433
Why didn't we get a launch detection?

645
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,817
I'm not sure, sir. We're
checking for DSP malfunction.

646
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,791
BMEWS has continuous
radar tracking on inbounds.

647
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:54,624
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

648
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,392
- What is all that stuff?
- I don't know.

649
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,666
They're trajectory headings
for Multiple Impact Reentry Vehicles.

650
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:08,791
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, but it's great.

651
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:11,249
Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?

652
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:13,124
- Subs.
- Can you blow them up?

653
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,957
- Blow them out of the water.
- What's a "tra-jec-tory” heading?

654
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:17,364
- I have no idea.
- What's this?

655
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,392
The President's in his limousine.

656
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,517
They're diverting to Andrews.

657
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,166
The Vice President is out of position,

658
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,457
and the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs is on his way.

659
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:29,184
Missile warning reports no malfunction.

660
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,499
Confidence remains high.

661
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,416
Take us to DEFCON 3.

662
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:36,332
Get on the SAC.
Tell them to flush the bombers.

663
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:37,582
Yes, sir.

664
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:41,791
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.

665
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,624
CINCNORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

666
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,207
Scramble all alert aircraft.

667
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,146
<i>I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.</i>

668
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,517
<i>Inbounds presently MIRVing.</i>

669
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,749
<i>We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.</i>

670
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:57,666
Sir, new time to impact, eight minutes.

671
00:43:57,832 --> 00:43:59,374
Sir, SAC is launching the bombers.

672
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,207
General Powers is on the line.

673
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:02,374
Beringer.

674
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:04,082
God damn it!

675
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:06,624
We didn't get a launch
detection from our satellite.

676
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:10,166
No. No, radar picked them up
already out of the atmosphere.

677
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:11,916
That's the first we heard of it.

678
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:16,582
Get the ICBMs in
the bullpen warmed up and ready to fly.

679
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:19,374
Get me the President on the horn.

680
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,541
Yes, sir.

681
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:29,916
Mr. President, this is Beringer at NORAD.

682
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,082
Oh, attack!

683
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,319
I wonder if I should use my subs.

684
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,082
Yeah, sure. Give them the works.

685
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,624
David?

686
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,416
Excuse me.

687
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:43,374
David!

688
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,499
How many times have I told you

689
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,166
to fasten these lids on tight?

690
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:49,452
Would you look at this mess?

691
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:51,299
I'll be down in a few
minutes, all right, Dad?

692
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,957
Now! You'll come down now!

693
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,308
- I want this cleared up right away.
- Honey, you come down here

694
00:44:55,332 --> 00:44:57,142
- and do what your father asks you to.
- Beau, why would you do this?

695
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,249
Pronto, David.

696
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:00,874
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

697
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,832
You wanna invite your little friend?

698
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:04,416
Please!

699
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:05,624
David?

700
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:08,916
Shit.

701
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:17,416
"Little friend"?

702
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:21,999
Yes, sir.

703
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:28,541
Mr. President, something's happening.
We don't know exactly what it is, sir.

704
00:45:28,582 --> 00:45:29,850
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

705
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:31,034
<i>Reconfirm.</i>

706
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,416
What's happening, Joe?

707
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:34,892
General, BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

708
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,416
negative confirmation
on all the inbound tracking.

709
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:42,541
Get on to SAC, tell them to hold steady.

710
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,207
Sir, stop! It's a simulation!

711
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:48,416
There's an attack simulation running!

712
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:49,725
What the hell's he yelling about?

713
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:50,999
I didn't order any simulation.

714
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,791
We're not being attacked.

715
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,041
It's a simulation!

716
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,866
Whoa, now. Hold it!

717
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:58,267
You're not supposed to be running here.
Somebody could get hurt.

718
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,166
I'm sorry, sir.
We don't know how it happened.

719
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:01,499
But someone on the outside

720
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,975
fed an attack simulation to the...

721
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:04,332
It's a simulation!

722
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,832
Conley, take us off full alert.

723
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:10,624
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly

724
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:12,541
what in the hell's happening here!

725
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,017
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut the line?

726
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,457
You've cut the line!

727
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:20,207
Sir, they shut down before
we could complete our trace.

728
00:46:20,374 --> 00:46:21,999
We did manage to locate the general area

729
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,707
where the transmission originated.

730
00:46:23,874 --> 00:46:25,749
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

731
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,207
Shut it down!

732
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,374
Somebody's playing a game with us.

733
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,807
<i>The flames began
in a prophylactic recycling center...</i>

734
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:33,916
Hi, Dad!

735
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:38,166
David! David, come in here.

736
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:40,874
- What did I do?
- Plenty, mister. Plenty.

737
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:46,791
You have just passed all
of your classes this semester.

738
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:49,041
- Congratulations, dear!
- Oh.

739
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:50,666
Show this to your dad.

740
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:54,416
- Oh.
- Honey, David has something to show you.

741
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,416
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

742
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,582
Uh-oh.

743
00:46:58,332 --> 00:46:59,332
Oh!

744
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:04,124
- Hey, this is good.
- I'm so proud of you.

745
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:07,371
<i>...Forces of the United States
went on a full-scale nuclear alert,</i>

746
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:08,697
<i>believing that the Soviet Union</i>

747
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,999
<i>had launched a surprise missile attack.</i>

00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,834
Oh, that's your phone.

754
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,166
Yeah.

755
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,832
Seriously, David, congratulations.

756
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:32,041
- Thank you.
- This one will be a pleasure to sign.

757
00:47:38,582 --> 00:47:40,249
- Hello.
<i>- David?</i>

758
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,082
Are you watching the news?

759
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,999
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

760
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,082
<i>David, is that us on TV?</i>

761
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:49,291
<i>- Did we do that?</i>
- It could be.

762
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:50,791
Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

763
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:51,957
What am I gonna do?

764
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:53,164
They're gonna come get me.

765
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:54,499
I'm really screwed.

766
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,999
<i>- I'm screwed.</i>
- What? No, shh.

767
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:57,999
Calm down!

768
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,541
Calm down. Calm down.

769
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,749
No, listen.
If they were so smart,

770
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:03,476
<i>they would've found you already, right?</i>

771
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:04,832
Yeah.

772
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:07,957
Okay, so all you have to
do is throw the number away

773
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:09,249
and don't call it again.

774
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,916
<i>- That's all.</i>
- Yeah.

775
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,332
Maybe they didn't trace the call, huh?

776
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,706
<i>Right. Maybe they didn't trace the call.</i>

777
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:17,225
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.

778
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:20,291
And listen, all you have
to do is act normal, okay?

779
00:48:20,457 --> 00:48:22,832
We'll both act normal and
everything is gonna be fine.

780
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:24,207
<i>Okay?</i>

781
00:48:24,374 --> 00:48:25,374
Okay.

782
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:26,957
Okay.

783
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:29,249
Oh, God, this is so unbelievable.

784
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,874
Listen, do you think maybe
I can call Michelle and tell her?

785
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,457
No, Jennifer, don't call her!

786
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:35,916
Sorry. All right, I won't.

787
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:37,416
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

788
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:38,999
Okay.

789
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,291
Good night, Jennifer.

790
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,207
<i>Greetings, Professor Falken.</i>

791
00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:15,832
Oh, my God!

792
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:27,291
Incorrect identification.

793
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,416
I am not Falken.

794
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:33,457
Falken is dead.

795
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:37,582
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Professor.</i>

796
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:40,332
<i>Yesterday's game was interrupted.</i>

797
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:44,791
<i>Although primary goal
has not yet been achieved,</i>

798
00:49:44,957 --> 00:49:46,332
<i>solution is near.</i>

799
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:51,999
<i>Game time elapsed,
31 hours, 12 minutes, 50 seconds.</i>

800
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:59,041
<i>Estimated time remaining,
52 hours, 17 minutes, ten seconds.</i>

801
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:03,749
What is the primary goal?

802
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,707
<i>You should know, Professor.</i>

803
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,249
<i>You programmed me.</i>

804
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:09,624
Oh, come on.

805
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:14,666
What is the primary goal?

806
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:18,332
<i>To win the game.</i>

807
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:50,499
David Lightman,
hold it right there, please. FBI.

808
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,767
- What?
- I'm here to read you your rights.

809
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,100
Step over to the van, please.

810
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:54,600
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

811
00:51:54,624 --> 00:51:56,267
- For what?
- Hands on the van, please.

812
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,267
- What did I do?
- ...against you in a court of law.

813
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:59,475
- Step back.
- You have the right

814
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:00,624
to consult with an attorney

815
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,124
and to have an attorney
present during questioning.

816
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,433
If you cannot afford an attorney,

817
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:05,975
one will be appointed to you by the court.

818
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,541
- Left hand please.
- Do you understand

819
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,227
the rights I've just explained to you?

820
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,433
- Yeah.
- With these rights in mind,

821
00:52:10,457 --> 00:52:12,874
are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

822
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,699
All right, let's move.

823
00:52:28,707 --> 00:52:31,142
This rather large room here
is the command center for NORAD.

824
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,582
No picture taking.

825
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,999
The screens you see in front of you

826
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,582
are connected to our satellites

827
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:39,041
and missile tracking
stations throughout the country.

828
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:40,374
This is the commander's desk.

829
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:41,707
Colonel Conley's in charge.

830
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:44,354
Colonel Conley, would you mind
relinquishing your command, sir?

831
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:48,086
Miss Dealy, would you come forward
and sit in this rather important chair?

832
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,767
These buttons you see here, and switches,

833
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,350
are connected with
the Strategic Air Command,

834
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:53,725
missile launching stations, et cetera,

835
00:52:53,749 --> 00:52:55,229
and other things that are classified.

836
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:57,874
Miss Dealy, would
you press this button right here, please?

837
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,517
- The red one.
- The one in the middle?

838
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,600
Yes, ma'am, the one in the middle.

839
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:01,457
Oh, my God,

840
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:03,864
that's the wrong one, Miss Dealy!
That's a joke.

841
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:06,119
You didn't blow up anything.
But look what you did do.

842
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:09,832
Distinguished visitors from Birmingham.
You know...

843
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:41,791
Just last week,
I had the governor of New Jersey

844
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:43,225
right in this chair, and he asked me.

845
00:53:43,249 --> 00:53:45,874
He said, "Colonel Thomas,
why are we at DEFCON 4?"

846
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,082
As we are right now.

847
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:48,874
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

848
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,582
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble,
and so they went on alert.

849
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,249
We told them it was just an exercise,

850
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,808
but we're waiting for them to relax

851
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,291
their posture before we do.

852
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,666
Wait, wait.

853
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,409
- Give me that. Here.
- Oh, Christ, another tour group.

854
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,749
Just what we need today.

855
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:05,541
Why don't they go to
Disneyland where they belong?

856
00:54:05,707 --> 00:54:07,416
Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.

857
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:08,791
- Okay. All set?
- Yeah.

858
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:09,957
Oh, here.

859
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,044
Mr. Cabot, it was a one-in-a-million shot.

860
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:18,416
There was an open line in
our space division in Sunnyvale.

861
00:54:18,582 --> 00:54:20,041
The phone company screwed up!

862
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:21,207
John.

863
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,041
John McKittrick, George Wigan.

864
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:24,683
- How are you?
- George is with the FBI.

865
00:54:24,707 --> 00:54:26,142
He brought the kid in for questioning.

866
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,499
Well, it looks like we've got
a high school prank on our hands here.

867
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,586
- Paul, what happened?
- Well, the kid broke into

868
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:32,832
the war games subsystem,

869
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,332
all right, using a password
left by the original programmer.

870
00:54:36,499 --> 00:54:37,791
- Password?
- Yes, sir.

871
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:39,957
Now, none of my team
even knew it was in there.

872
00:54:40,124 --> 00:54:42,207
The kid claims he was
looking for a toy company.

873
00:54:42,457 --> 00:54:43,791
That's great.

874
00:54:44,332 --> 00:54:46,166
Anybody in here buy that one?

875
00:54:47,124 --> 00:54:48,999
Well, we can find
the password and take it out,

876
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,499
but it might help to beef
up security around the WOPR.

877
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,041
Oh, beef up, huh?

878
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,582
How about screwed up?

879
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:58,457
We did all that and he broke in again.

880
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:00,791
The kid says your computer called him.

881
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:03,374
What the hell is going on, John?

882
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,374
I woke up the President, I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

883
00:55:08,332 --> 00:55:10,725
You have any idea what kind of an idiot
that makes me look like?

884
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:12,124
Not to mention the General.

885
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:14,850
Wait. Wait a minute, gentlemen.
I think we're being a little naive here.

886
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:16,749
There's no way that a high school punk

887
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,999
can put a dime in
a telephone and break into our system.

888
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,447
He's got to be working with
somebody else. He's got to be!

889
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,141
Well, he does fit the profile perfectly.

890
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:26,499
He's intelligent but an underachiever.

891
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:29,541
Alienated from
his parents, has few friends.

892
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:32,041
A classic case for
recruitment by the Soviets.

893
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,791
Now, what does this say
about the state of our country, hmm?

894
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:36,816
I mean, have you gotten any insight

895
00:55:36,874 --> 00:55:39,416
as to why a bright boy like this

896
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:42,166
would jeopardize the lives of millions?

897
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:44,350
No, sir. He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

898
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,166
- What?
- Damn it, John,

899
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,374
I want some answers, and I want them now!

900
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,111
Let me talk to this little prick.

901
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,874
I don't wanna talk anymore. Just do it!

902
00:55:57,582 --> 00:55:58,582
Come on, Paul.

903
00:56:02,874 --> 00:56:04,474
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

904
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:05,707
No idea.

905
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:08,308
- Good morning, sir.
- Where's the Lightman kid?

906
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,541
In the infirmary, sir.

907
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:21,124
Hello, David. John McKittrick.

908
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,957
I run the computer facility here.

909
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:26,374
Sergeant, these aren't
necessary, the handcuffs?

910
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:27,541
- No, sir.
- Yeah.

911
00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:32,457
Well, David, we called your parents.

912
00:56:32,624 --> 00:56:34,416
You know, we told them everything's fine.

913
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:37,291
No charge has been filed, yet.

914
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:41,332
But I think we are
gonna need a little time

915
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:42,707
to sort things out here.

916
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:44,749
How mu... how much time?

917
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:47,916
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

918
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:49,832
Oh, of course.

919
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,124
I tell you what.

920
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,541
Sergeant, would you tell the OD

921
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:56,100
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

922
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,308
- Let's go down to my office.
- Yes, sir.

923
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,612
We'll be more comfortable there.

924
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,166
Go ahead.

925
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,767
<i>You used to work with
Stephen Falken, didn't you?</i>

926
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,183
Yeah, started out as his assistant.

927
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,207
How'd you know that?

928
00:57:11,499 --> 00:57:14,392
Oh, I read an article you wrote
with him on poker and nuclear war.

929
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:15,457
Bluffing.

930
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:17,082
Yeah, that shook a few people up.

931
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:19,082
He must have been pretty amazing, huh?

932
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,017
Well, he's a brilliant man.
A little flaky.

933
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:25,541
He never understood
the practical uses of his work.

934
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:28,874
This machine over here
runs his game programs.

935
00:57:29,374 --> 00:57:30,374
Joshua.

936
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:35,184
Come here a minute, David.

937
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:38,541
See the sign up here? Up here?

938
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,521
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

939
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,332
That indicates
our current defense condition.

940
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:47,166
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

941
00:57:47,332 --> 00:57:50,124
It's still on a four because of
that little stunt you pulled.

942
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:52,514
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,

943
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,666
it might have gone to DEFCON 1.

944
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,457
You know what that means, David?

945
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:58,624
No. What does that mean?

946
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,166
World War III.

947
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:04,291
- Wow.
- You say you broke into our system

948
00:58:04,457 --> 00:58:05,977
just to... just to play a game, right?

949
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,291
Right. That's right.

950
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:08,791
That's exactly right.

951
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,558
Yeah, but when you heard it on the news,

952
00:58:13,582 --> 00:58:15,249
you must've realized how serious it was.

953
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:16,707
Why'd you do it again?

954
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:19,374
I didn't do it again.
I even threw the number away.

955
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,181
Yeah, they found it in the trash. I know.

956
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,541
Joshua called me.

957
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:26,916
Hey, look at that.
That's some setup.

958
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,499
What did you say?

959
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:30,041
This is some setup.

960
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,707
- No, no. Before that.
- Joshua called me.

961
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:38,291
David,
machines don't call people.

962
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:40,749
Yours did.

963
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:47,541
Who are you, uh,
who are you going to Paris with?

964
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:52,416
Pari...? Oh, no, no, you don't understand.

965
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:55,249
Now, you had
reservations for two to Paris.

966
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,332
Who are you working with?

967
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:00,749
Nobody!

968
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:04,832
Why don't I believe you?

969
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,392
I don't think I should say anything else

970
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:11,541
until I talk to a lawyer.

971
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:15,582
I think we better
forget about the lawyer crap

972
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:18,124
until I get a few
answers out of you myself.

973
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,332
You gonna answer the phone?

974
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:44,832
Hello.

975
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:45,999
Yeah.

976
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,291
What?

977
00:59:49,082 --> 00:59:50,282
All right, I'll be right down.

978
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,749
You stay here. Don't move.

979
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,166
What's going on?

980
01:00:06,332 --> 01:00:08,416
There's just been
a very serious penetration

981
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:10,374
into our WOPR execution order file.

982
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,781
- What the hell is he saying?
- Let's have it in English.

983
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:14,239
I'll give it to you in English.

984
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:17,082
Somebody got into
Mr. McKittrick's well-known system

985
01:00:17,249 --> 01:00:19,166
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

986
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,558
- That right, Mr. McKittrick?
- There's no cause for alarm.

987
01:00:21,582 --> 01:00:24,582
The system won't accept a launch code
unless we're at DEFCON 1.

988
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,791
I can change those codes
in less than an hour.

989
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,457
Well, who did this?

990
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:30,234
I think the kid's gotta be working

991
01:00:30,374 --> 01:00:31,749
with somebody on the outside.

992
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,142
I don't know what they're up to,

993
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,267
but I sure as hell don't
want our bombers on the ground

994
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,291
when it happens.

995
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:39,499
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

996
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,791
- Where are you?
- Sir.

997
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:43,457
Oh, get me an update on those subs.

998
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:45,332
I wanna know what
those bastards are up to.

999
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:46,499
Yes, sir.

1000
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:15,124
Joshua.

1001
01:01:17,499 --> 01:01:19,457
<i>Greetings, Professor Falken.</i>

1002
01:01:19,624 --> 01:01:20,624
Hi.

1003
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:23,791
Hello,

1004
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,624
are you still playing the game?

1005
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:29,499
<i>Of course.</i>

1006
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:35,291
<i>I should reach DEFCON 1
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.</i>

1007
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:39,832
<i>Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?</i>

1008
01:01:40,332 --> 01:01:43,207
69 percent of the housing destroyed.

1009
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,832
72 million people dead.

1010
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:52,666
Is this a game

1011
01:01:53,249 --> 01:01:54,791
or is it real?

1012
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:57,499
<i>What's the difference?</i>

1013
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:58,666
Oh, wow.

1014
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,707
<i>You are a hard man to reach.</i>

1015
01:02:02,874 --> 01:02:04,791
<i>Could not find you in Seattle</i>

1016
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:09,666
<i>and no terminal is in
operation at your classified address.</i>

1017
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,832
What classified address?

1018
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:24,957
<i>DOD pension files
indicate current mailing as...</i>

1019
01:02:27,624 --> 01:02:32,666
<i>Dr. Robert Hume, AKA Stephen W. Falken.</i>

1020
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:39,791
<i>5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose Island, Oregon, 97...</i>

1021
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,225
Can I just talk to Mr. McKittrick?

1022
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:42,457
I think I know what's going...

1023
01:02:42,624 --> 01:02:44,249
Can I talk to Mr. McKittrick, please?

1024
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:46,892
David Lightman, I'll be escorting you
to federal authorities in Denver,

1025
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,600
where you'll be placed under arrest
pending indictment for espionage.

1026
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:50,791
Espionage? No, wait a minute!

1027
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:53,124
Let me talk to him! He's right over there.

1028
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,374
Get that little bastard
out of the war room!

1029
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:57,957
No. It's Joshua!

1030
01:02:58,124 --> 01:02:59,541
He's still playing the game!

1031
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:00,874
He's gonna start a war!

1032
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,601
Hold him where you had him before.

1033
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,142
We'll be ready to leave in a few minutes.

1034
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,707
Call Falken! He'll tell you!

1035
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:08,416
Please, call him!
Please, call him! Call him!

1036
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:10,666
What the hell's he doing in here, anyway?

1037
01:03:28,582 --> 01:03:31,249
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

1038
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:43,600
<i>Patient's eyes are dilated,</i>

1039
01:04:43,624 --> 01:04:47,791
<i>consistent with use of
marijuana and possibly PCP.</i>

1040
01:05:17,249 --> 01:05:18,600
Depending on what information you want,

1041
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,184
you have to know which button to press.

1042
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,791
Oh, well, let's say I wanted to find out

1043
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:23,957
how to hit a backhand.

1044
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:26,957
I don't think... I don't think
I have the right program.

1045
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,582
Excuse me. What do you want?

1046
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:32,374
The bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

1047
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:33,541
Excuse me.

1048
01:05:39,582 --> 01:05:41,017
Please! Let me talk to Mr. McKittrick.

1049
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,558
- I gotta talk to him!
- Look, you're not supposed

1050
01:05:42,582 --> 01:05:44,749
to talk to anybody.
The FBI will be here any minute.

1051
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,476
Now, do you have to take a leak or not?

1052
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:47,624
No.

1053
01:06:15,124 --> 01:06:17,124
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1054
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,147
- Stop it.
- This right here...

1055
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:21,957
- Oh, you have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

1056
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:28,416
I'll get the elevator.

1057
01:06:28,582 --> 01:06:30,166
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

1058
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:55,916
I heard they voted you Miss Fine in 1979.

1059
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:57,791
Is that true?

1060
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,416
- Will you stop it?
- Am I bothering you?

1061
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:03,624
- Yes.
- Do you want me to leave?

1062
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,791
Yes.

1063
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:19,387
All right, I want
this door open right now.

1064
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,642
- How about getting on a phone...
- Is there a connection?

1065
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:21,957
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1066
01:08:22,124 --> 01:08:24,499
I don't believe it.

1067
01:08:57,374 --> 01:08:59,416
Hey, Scooter. Wait up.

1068
01:09:00,624 --> 01:09:02,264
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

1069
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:04,274
Okay. I'll be right with you.

1070
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,916
I think it's jammed from inside.

1071
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:09,499
- Come on.
- David!

1072
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:13,124
Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

1073
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:16,916
Okay.

1074
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,207
Let's go.

1075
01:09:28,499 --> 01:09:30,249
Right this way, folks.

1076
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,707
I've just been informed

1077
01:09:31,874 --> 01:09:34,332
that they're cleaning
the floors in the computer center.

1078
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:36,591
Don't want anyone to
slip and hurt themselves,

1079
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:38,666
so we'll have to end the tour here.

1080
01:09:38,832 --> 01:09:40,457
Now, if I can ask you to board the bus

1081
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:42,332
as quickly as possible,

1082
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:43,957
we'll have a complimentary beverage

1083
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:46,392
waiting for each one of you
down the hill at the officer's center.

1084
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:47,457
- Hold it!
- Ah!

1085
01:09:47,624 --> 01:09:48,892
Now, what do you think you're doing?

1086
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,582
Got it. Here it comes.

1087
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:53,850
So what, you kids
think you own this place?

1088
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:55,957
Oh, I was, uh, I was...

1089
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:57,666
I was just looking around.

1090
01:09:58,249 --> 01:09:59,892
You know you're not supposed
to leave the group, don't you?

1091
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,516
- Yes.
- So why don't you get back there?

1092
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:04,124
Okay, excuse me. Thank you very much, sir.

1093
01:10:05,249 --> 01:10:07,124
- Get out of the way!
- Come on!

1094
01:10:08,957 --> 01:10:10,197
Hey, be careful there.

1095
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,332
Take care. Watch your step.

1096
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:14,749
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

1097
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:16,957
Watch your step.
Thanks again.

1098
01:10:17,124 --> 01:10:19,416
Quick, check everywhere.
He can't be far. Let's go.

1099
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,082
Come on, move it, will you?

1100
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:17,802
- Thanks, pal.
- Take care.

1101
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:44,082
One, five, two...

1102
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,791
<i>What city, please?</i>

1103
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:57,374
Goose Island, Oregon, please.

1104
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:02,332
The number for Dr. Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

1105
01:13:05,124 --> 01:13:08,707
<i>Checking under Dr. Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road,</i>

1106
01:13:08,874 --> 01:13:10,332
<i>I find no listing.</i>

1107
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:13,082
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

1108
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,207
<i>I'm sorry. I have no listing.</i>

1109
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:17,124
Oh, wait. Uh...

1110
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:19,832
Falken. Dr. Stephen Falken.

1111
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:23,082
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

1112
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:26,244
<i>I find no listing for
a Dr. Stephen Falken,</i>

1113
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:29,541
<i>F-A-L-K-E-N,
on Tall Cedar Road, Goose Island.</i>

1114
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:31,457
Thank you.

1115
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:49,791
Yeah?

1116
01:13:50,249 --> 01:13:51,541
Jennifer? It's me, David.

1117
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,457
- David?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1118
01:13:53,624 --> 01:13:55,999
Listen, I'm in Colorado,

1119
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,874
<i>and I need a really big favor.</i>

1120
01:13:58,582 --> 01:13:59,707
Can you lend me some money?

1121
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:00,957
What?

1122
01:14:01,332 --> 01:14:02,374
I need an airline ticket.

1123
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,957
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

1124
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,126
<i>But I need a ticket from
Grand Junction, Colorado,</i>

1125
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,791
<i>- to Salem, Oregon.</i>
- Why? What's going on?

1126
01:14:08,957 --> 01:14:10,558
<i>I'll tell you all about it later.</i>

1127
01:14:10,582 --> 01:14:12,666
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

1128
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:14,407
<i>You know, I went by your house</i>

1129
01:14:14,457 --> 01:14:15,850
<i>and your parents were just freaked,</i>

1130
01:14:15,874 --> 01:14:17,707
<i>and there are men around from the FBI</i>

1131
01:14:17,874 --> 01:14:19,082
<i>asking all these questions.</i>

1132
01:14:19,249 --> 01:14:20,749
I can't talk about it right now!

1133
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:23,124
Listen, when you buy the ticket,

1134
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,767
will you tell them that I'll pick it up

1135
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:26,999
in... in Grand Junction airport?

1136
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:28,999
David, what's happening?

1137
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,292
I can't talk right now.
I gotta get off the phone.

1138
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:33,541
But, please, will you just
do this for me, please?

1139
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,166
Punch up number five.

1140
01:14:39,332 --> 01:14:40,852
- Let me see what you have.
- Yes, sir.

1141
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:45,457
22 typhoon-class
submarines departing Petropavlovsk,

1142
01:14:45,624 --> 01:14:49,332
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

1143
01:14:49,499 --> 01:14:51,874
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

1144
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:53,041
Yes, sir.

1145
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:54,683
I just hope they don't make me eat

1146
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,416
none of them damn fish eggs.

1147
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,291
Sir, the Soviets are denying

1148
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:07,249
any increase in
their submarine deployment.

1149
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,558
They wanna know what
the hell we're doing provoking them.

1150
01:15:09,582 --> 01:15:12,124
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

1151
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,249
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

1152
01:15:57,207 --> 01:15:58,207
Surprise!

1153
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:00,832
What are you doing here?

1154
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:02,517
Well, you didn't
sound too good on the phone.

1155
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:03,767
It was only a three-hour drive down here.

1156
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,392
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm in real trouble.

1157
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:06,416
Why?

1158
01:16:07,999 --> 01:16:10,079
David, is this because of
what you did with my grade?

1159
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,183
Hey, you kids better hustle.

1160
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,607
The ferry's gonna leave any second.

1161
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:22,499
Thanks. Come on, we gotta run.

1162
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,707
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1163
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:31,036
- Wait! Oh, wait!
- Hold it, hold it.

1164
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:41,124
David, if he's still alive,

1165
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,957
why did the obituary say he's dead?

1166
01:16:43,124 --> 01:16:44,874
No, he's not dead. He left.

1167
01:16:46,624 --> 01:16:49,124
When they know too much,
they give them new identities.

1168
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,582
Anyway, the computer said so.

1169
01:16:50,749 --> 01:16:51,791
Oh, the computer said so.

1170
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,749
Is that the computer
that's still playing the games?

1171
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:58,249
It's the military's computer.
Why wouldn't they know about it?

1172
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:00,499
They don't know about Joshua!

1173
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,416
Falken knows about Joshua!

1174
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:04,832
He's the only one
who knows what it can do!

1175
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:06,559
That computer is trying to win the game

1176
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:08,207
that we asked it to play.

1177
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,707
For real!

1178
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:12,707
You don't even believe me!

1179
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:18,957
David.

1180
01:17:19,832 --> 01:17:21,249
David. David.

1181
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:23,041
He's not dead.

1182
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:24,207
I'm sorry.

1183
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:28,582
I believe you.

1184
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:18,082
Oh, shit!

1185
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:19,999
What was that?

1186
01:18:20,749 --> 01:18:21,832
I don't know.

1187
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:27,957
Did you see that?

1188
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,600
Do you know there are still people
who won't believe they could fly?

1189
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,424
I tell you, the sky
was once filled with them!

1190
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,249
I'm looking for Dr. Robert Hume.

1191
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:36,600
Oh, is either of you a paleontologist?

1192
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:38,064
I desperately need a paleontologist.

1193
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:39,541
No, we're high school students.

1194
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:41,582
Oh, pity.

1195
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:45,041
Well, high school students,

1196
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,666
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

1197
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,832
But aren't you Stephen Falken?

1198
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,166
Now, listen carefully.

1199
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:57,332
Path. Follow path.

1200
01:18:57,874 --> 01:18:58,874
Gate.

1201
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,749
Open gate, through gate, close gate.

1202
01:19:01,207 --> 01:19:03,124
Last ferry, 6:30.
So run, run, run.

1203
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:07,541
Wait! Wait!
I came because of Joshua.

1204
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:51,332
Radar reports two unknown tracks

1205
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:53,749
are penetrating
the Alaskan Air Defense zone.

1206
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,457
Confidence is high.

1207
01:19:57,624 --> 01:20:00,142
<i>Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.</i>

1208
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,957
I want a visual confirmation on that.

1209
01:20:02,124 --> 01:20:04,166
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

1210
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,332
Yes, sir.

1211
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:08,416
Go to DEFCON 2.

1212
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:43,859
<i>Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.</i>

1213
01:20:43,957 --> 01:20:45,957
<i>I have negative radar contact.</i>

1214
01:20:46,124 --> 01:20:48,374
<i>Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.</i>

1215
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,041
27, this is Brass Hat.

1216
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,874
They're right in front of you!

1217
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:53,541
You're almost on top of them.

1218
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:56,392
<i>Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar</i>

1219
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,041
<i>and 40 miles visibility.</i>

1220
01:20:58,749 --> 01:21:01,207
<i>There's nothing out there,
General. Just blue skies.</i>

1221
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,082
What the hell?

1222
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:16,725
You really haven't
been listening, have you?

1223
01:21:16,749 --> 01:21:17,957
Yes, I have.

1224
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,582
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

1225
01:21:21,082 --> 01:21:23,582
A suitably biblical ending
to the place, don't you think?

1226
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:26,916
You gonna call them up and
tell them what Joshua's doing?

1227
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:30,600
Now, children, come on over here.

1228
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,457
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story.

1229
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:35,082
Are you sitting comfortably?

1230
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,082
Then I'll begin.

1231
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:39,457
Once upon a time,

1232
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:43,166
there lived a magnificent race of animals.

1233
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,332
They dominated
the world through age after age.

1234
01:21:47,499 --> 01:21:49,124
They ran and they swam

1235
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:52,791
and they fought and
they flew until suddenly,

1236
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,624
quite recently, they disappeared.

1237
01:21:56,832 --> 01:22:00,249
Nature just gave up and started again.

1238
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,749
We weren't even apes then.

1239
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:06,749
We were just these smart
little rodents hiding in the rocks.

1240
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:11,124
And when we go, nature will start again

1241
01:22:11,874 --> 01:22:13,374
with the bees, probably.

1242
01:22:15,332 --> 01:22:17,374
Nature knows when to give up, David.

1243
01:22:18,124 --> 01:22:19,166
I'm not giving up.

1244
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,499
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack,

1245
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,666
it'll be your fault.

1246
01:22:24,457 --> 01:22:25,582
My fault?

1247
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:27,517
The whole point was to find a way

1248
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,624
to practice nuclear war
without destroying ourselves,

1249
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,451
to get the computers to learn

1250
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:34,499
from mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

1251
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:37,082
Except that I never could get Joshua

1252
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:38,707
to learn the most important lesson.

1253
01:22:38,874 --> 01:22:39,874
What's that?

1254
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,166
Futility.

1255
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,582
That there's a time
when you should just give up.

1256
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:46,499
What kind of a lesson is that?

1257
01:22:47,124 --> 01:22:48,749
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

1258
01:22:50,749 --> 01:22:51,999
Yeah. Of course.

1259
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,999
- But you don't anymore.
- No.

1260
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,291
Why?

1261
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,832
Because it's a boring game.

1262
01:22:58,082 --> 01:22:59,166
It's always a tie.

1263
01:22:59,332 --> 01:23:01,332
Exactly. There's no way to win.

1264
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:03,624
The game itself is pointless.

1265
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:06,541
But back at the war room,

1266
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:09,041
they believe you can win a nuclear war,

1267
01:23:09,749 --> 01:23:12,207
that there can be acceptable losses.

1268
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:16,957
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

1269
01:23:18,082 --> 01:23:21,916
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

1270
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,749
Did you know that no land animal

1271
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:29,124
with a body weight of over
50 pounds survived that age?

1272
01:23:30,499 --> 01:23:33,457
Extinction is part of the natural order.

1273
01:23:33,624 --> 01:23:34,624
Bullshit!

1274
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:38,850
If we're extinguished,
there's nothing natural about that.

1275
01:23:38,874 --> 01:23:39,874
It's just stupid!

1276
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:42,291
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

1277
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:45,624
We're just three
miles from a primary target.

1278
01:23:46,957 --> 01:23:50,666
A millisecond of
brilliant light and we're vaporized.

1279
01:23:51,582 --> 01:23:53,374
Much more fortunate than the millions

1280
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:56,874
who'll wander sightless
through the smoldering aftermath.

1281
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:01,541
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

1282
01:24:02,582 --> 01:24:04,832
I'm only 17 years old.

1283
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,832
I'm not ready to die yet.

1284
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:09,874
You won't make a simple phone call?

1285
01:24:12,624 --> 01:24:14,582
If the real Joshua was still alive,

1286
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,041
your Joshua, you'd do it, wouldn't you?

1287
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:18,666
Look, we might gain a few years.

1288
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:22,166
Perhaps time enough for
you to have a son and watch him die.

1289
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:27,082
But humanity planning its own destruction,

1290
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,249
that, a phone call won't stop.

1291
01:24:31,082 --> 01:24:32,166
This is unreal!

1292
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:35,957
You don't care about death
'cause you're already dead.

1293
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:40,374
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

1294
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,874
What was the last thing you cared about?

1295
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,416
You've missed the last ferry.

1296
01:24:57,582 --> 01:25:00,832
You're welcome to stay.
You wanna sleep on the floor?

1297
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,707
Good night.

1298
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:11,416
Let's get out of here.

1299
01:25:21,624 --> 01:25:23,332
Come on, we'll find a boat.

1300
01:25:23,499 --> 01:25:24,707
There's gotta be a boat.

1301
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:45,666
Mr. President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States,

1302
01:25:45,832 --> 01:25:50,249
and we've got 100,000 Soviet
troops massing in East Germany.

1303
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,374
We're monitoring
their bombers that are on alert.

1304
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,832
Yes, sir.
Well, that's a load of shit!

1305
01:25:55,499 --> 01:25:56,874
No, no, sir. Not you.

1306
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:01,041
Yes, sir, we'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

1307
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:04,249
Intelligence reports
rumors of a new Soviet bomber

1308
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:05,541
with stealth capabilities.

1309
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:07,082
It can project a false radar image

1310
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:09,249
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

1311
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:12,124
Christ, now they got us chasing shadows.

1312
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:25,624
I think I saw one.

1313
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:33,054
What kind of an asshole lives on an island

1314
01:26:33,124 --> 01:26:34,707
and he doesn't even have a boat?

1315
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:37,582
Maybe we can swim for it.

1316
01:26:37,749 --> 01:26:38,829
How far do you think it is?

1317
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:42,374
No, it's two or three miles, at least.

1318
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:43,957
Maybe more.

1319
01:26:44,124 --> 01:26:45,832
Well, what do you say?
Let's go for it.

1320
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:47,374
- No.
- Come on.

1321
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,541
No. I can't swim.

1322
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:52,249
You can't swim?

1323
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,457
No, I can't. Okay, Wonder Woman?
I can't swim.

1324
01:26:55,249 --> 01:26:57,169
Well, what kind of
an asshole grows up in Seattle

1325
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,651
and doesn't even know how to swim?

1326
01:26:58,999 --> 01:27:00,791
I never got around to it, okay?

1327
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:03,957
I always thought there
was gonna be plenty of time.

1328
01:27:04,124 --> 01:27:05,124
I'm sorry.

1329
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:13,166
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

1330
01:27:15,457 --> 01:27:17,541
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world

1331
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:20,957
and tomorrow it would just be over.

1332
01:27:23,707 --> 01:27:28,582
There wouldn't be any
time to be sorry about anything.

1333
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:37,166
Oh, Jesus.

1334
01:27:39,374 --> 01:27:41,291
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

1335
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:43,916
I swear to God I did.

1336
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:58,999
Did I tell you that next week
I was gonna be on TV?

1337
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:01,457
- You're kidding.
- No.

1338
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:03,808
It's on an aerobics
show that's on in the afternoon

1339
01:28:03,832 --> 01:28:05,916
with some girls from my dance class.

1340
01:28:06,082 --> 01:28:07,166
A movie star.

1341
01:28:07,332 --> 01:28:08,832
Yeah.

1342
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,707
I know, it's kind of stupid, huh?

1343
01:28:11,874 --> 01:28:14,183
I mean, nobody would have
been watching me, anyway, I guess.

1344
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:15,332
I would have.

1345
01:28:34,957 --> 01:28:35,957
Oh, Jesus!

1346
01:28:36,707 --> 01:28:38,416
The bastard turned us in!

1347
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,124
<i>It's all right. Get in.</i>

1348
01:30:09,332 --> 01:30:10,642
<i>We have a launch detection.</i>

1349
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:12,499
<i>We have a Soviet launch detection.</i>

1350
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,475
<i>BMEWS confirmed a massive attack.</i>

1351
01:30:14,499 --> 01:30:16,642
<i>- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confidence is high.</i>

1352
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:18,041
<i>I repeat, confidence is high.</i>

1353
01:30:18,207 --> 01:30:19,767
<i>Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?</i>

1354
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:21,183
<i>Negative, this is not an exercise.</i>

1355
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:24,666
General, DBS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

1356
01:30:31,541 --> 01:30:33,141
Tell me this is one of your simulations,

1357
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:34,651
- Mr. McKittrick.
- It's not, Jack.

1358
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,749
All right. Flush the bombers.

1359
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:38,541
Get the subs in launch mode.

1360
01:30:39,624 --> 01:30:41,499
We are at DEFCON 1.

1361
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:43,957
<i>DEFCON 1.</i>

1362
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,957
Better look at this.

1363
01:30:48,124 --> 01:30:49,999
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1364
01:30:52,207 --> 01:30:54,832
Initial attack profile is
a full-scale Soviet strike.

1365
01:30:55,999 --> 01:30:58,624
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95 percent

1366
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,207
of the strategic forces.

1367
01:31:00,374 --> 01:31:02,332
What does WOPR recommend, Mr. McKittrick?

1368
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,846
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1369
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:09,082
I need some
machine to tell me that?

1370
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,142
President's on his way to Andrews
to join Airborne Command.

1371
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,874
Sir, we have to give launch option.

1372
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,808
Has he been in touch with the premier?

1373
01:31:15,832 --> 01:31:17,517
Russians are still
denying everything, sir.

1374
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:19,916
We have a Soviet
submarine launch detection.

1375
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:22,957
Let's go into a launch mode.

1376
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:24,416
Close up the mountain.

1377
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:32,808
<i>This is Crystal Palace.</i>

1378
01:31:32,832 --> 01:31:34,957
<i>We're closing up the mountain.
You'll have to hurry.</i>

1379
01:31:35,124 --> 01:31:37,499
<i>After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.</i>

1380
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:46,291
Initiate internal power.

1381
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:50,041
Generators on and functioning.

1382
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:00,874
External power disconnected.

1383
01:32:04,582 --> 01:32:05,916
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1384
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:08,332
Shaft locks sealed.

1385
01:32:13,582 --> 01:32:15,100
The gate's closed!

1386
01:32:15,124 --> 01:32:16,124
Oh, Jesus!

1387
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:24,850
- David!
- Everybody okay?

1388
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,634
Are you all right? Are you all right?

1389
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:27,946
Yeah, yeah. Run for it!

1390
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:33,124
Move it! Get inside!
Come on! Come on!

1391
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:36,041
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1392
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:49,457
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1393
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:55,541
Hold the goddamn door!

1394
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:02,624
Come on, come on! Hurry!

1395
01:33:04,999 --> 01:33:06,999
They're clear! They're clear!

1396
01:33:26,457 --> 01:33:28,767
<i>All units confirm
weapons targeted and ready.</i>

1397
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:30,166
Awaiting launch codes.

1398
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:32,166
We are in a launch mode.

1399
01:33:32,332 --> 01:33:34,749
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1400
01:33:35,124 --> 01:33:37,624
Roger, lock out enabled.

1401
01:33:46,999 --> 01:33:48,291
All right, I'll call you back.

1402
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:50,624
Here!

1403
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,826
I don't know what
you think you could do here, Stephen.

1404
01:34:01,707 --> 01:34:03,291
John. Good to see you.

1405
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:05,166
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1406
01:34:05,332 --> 01:34:07,166
What has this kid been telling you?

1407
01:34:07,707 --> 01:34:08,749
How far has it gone?

1408
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:11,350
The President's about
ready to order a counter-strike.

1409
01:34:11,374 --> 01:34:13,207
That's what we're recommending he do.

1410
01:34:16,624 --> 01:34:17,850
It's a bluff, John. Call it off.

1411
01:34:17,874 --> 01:34:19,291
No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1412
01:34:19,957 --> 01:34:22,249
Hello, General Beringer. Stephen Falken.

1413
01:34:23,707 --> 01:34:26,207
Mr. Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit!

1414
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:29,457
General, what you see
on these screens up here

1415
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:33,749
is a fantasy,
a computer-enhanced hallucination.

1416
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:35,499
Those blips are not real missiles.

1417
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:36,666
They're phantoms.

1418
01:34:37,582 --> 01:34:40,082
Jack, there's nothing to
indicate a simulation at all.

1419
01:34:40,249 --> 01:34:41,489
Everything's working perfectly.

1420
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:42,874
But does it make any sense?

1421
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:44,374
Does what make any sense?

1422
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:45,374
That.

1423
01:34:45,541 --> 01:34:48,624
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now!

1424
01:34:49,457 --> 01:34:52,957
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1425
01:34:53,124 --> 01:34:56,041
- You betcha!
- Do you think they know that?

1426
01:34:56,207 --> 01:34:58,058
I believe we've made that clear enough.

1427
01:34:58,082 --> 01:34:59,916
Then don't.

1428
01:35:00,749 --> 01:35:02,624
Tell the President to ride out the attack.

1429
01:35:03,707 --> 01:35:05,249
Sir, they need a decision.

1430
01:35:06,457 --> 01:35:08,791
General, do you really believe

1431
01:35:08,957 --> 01:35:11,041
that the enemy would
attack without provocation,

1432
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:13,416
using so many missiles, bombers and subs,

1433
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:14,767
so that we would have no choice

1434
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:16,707
but to totally annihilate them?

1435
01:35:17,124 --> 01:35:19,374
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1436
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:22,749
General, you are listening to a machine.

1437
01:35:23,874 --> 01:35:25,624
Do the world a favor
and don't act like one.

1438
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:33,249
<i>One minute and 20 seconds to impact.</i>

1439
01:35:45,249 --> 01:35:47,433
- Yes, Mr. President.
<i>- One minute and ten seconds.</i>

1440
01:35:47,457 --> 01:35:48,537
Sir, at this point in time,

1441
01:35:48,582 --> 01:35:50,582
we cannot positively confirm the inbounds.

1442
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:53,374
We have reason to
believe they may not exist.

1443
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:55,874
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1444
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,666
Yes, sir.

1445
01:35:59,249 --> 01:36:02,041
- I do, too.
<i>- One minute to impact.</i>

1446
01:36:03,832 --> 01:36:05,124
Who's first and how soon?

1447
01:36:05,457 --> 01:36:07,457
Sir, initial impact
points at the 43rd Bomb Wing

1448
01:36:07,624 --> 01:36:09,416
at Loring, 319th at Grand Forks,

1449
01:36:09,582 --> 01:36:11,582
and Alaskan Air Command Headquarters
at Ellmendorf.

1450
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:13,350
<i>50 seconds to impact.</i>

1451
01:36:13,374 --> 01:36:15,392
Get me the senior controllers
at each of those stations.

1452
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:16,957
I wanna talk to them myself.

1453
01:36:17,124 --> 01:36:18,957
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1454
01:36:19,124 --> 01:36:21,957
Stand by for a message
from Brass Hat. Acknowledge?

1455
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:24,142
<i>Eimendorf Air Force Base Operations.</i>

1456
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,499
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.</i>

1457
01:36:26,374 --> 01:36:28,957
<i>319th Bomb Wing Operations. Colonel Chase.</i>

1458
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,541
<i>This is Loring Air Force Base.</i>

1459
01:36:31,707 --> 01:36:34,374
<i>The senior controller
isn't here right now.</i>

1460
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:36,541
That's all right. Who are you?

1461
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:39,249
<i>Sir, this is Airman Doherty, sir.</i>

1462
01:36:40,874 --> 01:36:42,666
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1463
01:36:42,832 --> 01:36:45,374
- <i>40 seconds to impact.</i>
- Our current situation...

1464
01:36:46,374 --> 01:36:49,249
Men, we're currently tracking

1465
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:52,499
approximately 2,400
inbound Soviet warheads.

1466
01:36:53,082 --> 01:36:55,291
But at the moment, we cannot confirm this.

1467
01:36:55,749 --> 01:36:58,207
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1468
01:36:58,374 --> 01:37:00,207
30 seconds to impact.

1469
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:02,929
We're right there with you guys.

1470
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:04,749
We've taken all the steps we can.

1471
01:37:06,499 --> 01:37:08,291
Stand by to launch missiles at my command.

1472
01:37:16,499 --> 01:37:18,499
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1473
01:37:19,374 --> 01:37:20,791
We'll be standing by.

1474
01:37:20,957 --> 01:37:23,332
<i>20 seconds to impact.</i>

1475
01:37:32,749 --> 01:37:33,749
Ten,

1476
01:37:34,291 --> 01:37:35,291
<i>nine,</i>

1477
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:36,582
<i>eight,</i>

1478
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:38,249

1481
01:37:41,707 --> 01:37:42,791
<i>four,</i>

1482
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:44,207
<i>three,</i>

1483
01:37:44,582 --> 01:37:45,666
<i>two,</i>

1484
01:37:45,999 --> 01:37:47,916
one, impact.

1485
01:38:05,499 --> 01:38:07,082
This is Crystal Palace.
You still on?

1486
01:38:09,457 --> 01:38:11,582
This is Crystal Palace.
You still on?

1487
01:38:12,207 --> 01:38:13,207
Anyone there?

1488
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,341
<i>That's affirmative, sir.</i>

1489
01:38:17,624 --> 01:38:19,224
<i>Yeah, we're here!</i>

1490
01:38:19,832 --> 01:38:22,874
- <i>Jesus H. Christ! We're still here!</i>
- Report is showing impact.

1491
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,457
<i>No, sir, no impact.</i>

1492
01:38:26,624 --> 01:38:27,624
<i>We're alive and well.</i>

1493
01:38:27,707 --> 01:38:29,332
All right!

1494
01:38:30,291 --> 01:38:31,499
All right!

1495
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:34,749
Yeah! Yeah!

1496
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:36,666
- That's right!
- Yeah!

1497
01:38:36,832 --> 01:38:39,582
All right!

1498
01:38:45,457 --> 01:38:47,666
All right! Recall the bombers!

1499
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:50,416
Stand down the missiles!

1500
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:23,666
Joshua, what are you doing?

1501
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:29,541
COC, I need Dr. McKittrick right away.

1502
01:39:30,249 --> 01:39:31,291
Yeah, this is McKittrick.

1503
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:32,791
Sir, we got a problem.

1504
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:35,082
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1505
01:39:35,249 --> 01:39:36,929
<i>I can't get in to stand down the missiles.</i>

1506
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:38,374
All right, stand by.

1507
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,082
Yeah, Paul, this is McKittrick.

1508
01:39:53,457 --> 01:39:54,874
<i>The WOPR is not letting us back in.</i>

1509
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:58,291
I know. No one can get back on.

1510
01:39:58,457 --> 01:39:59,457
We're trying everything.

1511
01:39:59,624 --> 01:40:02,332
It's like the entire
password file has been wiped out.

1512
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,791
I tried that.
Don't you think I would've tried that?

1513
01:40:09,749 --> 01:40:10,916
What are those?

1514
01:40:11,791 --> 01:40:13,207
Those are launch codes.

1515
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:14,374
What are they for?

1516
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:18,871
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1517
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,517
<i>Yeah, Paul, what's happening?</i>

1518
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:32,933
I checked the random number generators,

1519
01:40:32,957 --> 01:40:34,874
they're not even running.
Got anything?

1520
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,433
- No, sir. I'm still looking.
- Keep going.

1521
01:40:36,457 --> 01:40:39,017
All right, look, I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1522
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:42,582
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1523
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:46,166
Yeah.

1524
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,874
General, the machine has locked us out.

1525
01:40:49,041 --> 01:40:50,957
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1526
01:40:51,124 --> 01:40:53,457
It's trying to get
the codes to launch the missiles.

1527
01:40:53,832 --> 01:40:55,457
Just unplug the goddamn thing.

1528
01:40:55,624 --> 01:40:56,707
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1529
01:40:56,874 --> 01:40:58,207
That won't work, General.

1530
01:40:59,582 --> 01:41:02,332
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1531
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:03,832
The computers in the silos

1532
01:41:03,999 --> 01:41:05,392
would carry out their last instructions.

1533
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:06,416
They'd launch.

1534
01:41:07,707 --> 01:41:09,107
Well, can't we disarm the missiles?

1535
01:41:09,291 --> 01:41:12,249
Over 1,000 of them? There's no time.

1536
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:15,499
At this rate, it'll hit
the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1537
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:21,166
Mr. McKittrick,
after very careful consideration, sir,

1538
01:41:21,332 --> 01:41:25,374
I've come to the conclusion
that your new defense system sucks.

1539
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,291
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1540
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:31,457
Oh, I was hoping for something

1541
01:41:31,624 --> 01:41:32,933
a little better than that from you, sir.

1542
01:41:32,957 --> 01:41:34,207
A man of your education.

1543
01:41:34,374 --> 01:41:36,457
General, it's the President.

1544
01:41:41,874 --> 01:41:43,114
Well, what do you...

1545
01:41:43,291 --> 01:41:44,457
What are you gonna tell him?

1546
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:48,624
That I'm ordering
our bombers back to failsafe.

1547
01:41:49,082 --> 01:41:51,166
We might have to go
through this thing after all.

1548
01:41:54,707 --> 01:41:55,707
Yes, sir.

1549
01:42:03,332 --> 01:42:04,374
He's got one.

1550
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,421
When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1551
01:42:06,541 --> 01:42:07,981
Well, can't they get in and stop it?

1552
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:09,499
No, they can't.

1553
01:42:12,874 --> 01:42:14,874
They've taken out my password.

1554
01:42:15,707 --> 01:42:16,787
Well, what are we gonna do?

1555
01:42:16,957 --> 01:42:18,332
I don't know. Do you?

1556
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:21,166
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1557
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:27,124
It's games.

1558
01:42:29,832 --> 01:42:31,666
- Games!
- Try it.

1559
01:42:31,832 --> 01:42:33,541
John, let's feed it a tapeworm.

1560
01:42:33,707 --> 01:42:35,433
No, it's too risky.
It might smash the system.

1561
01:42:35,457 --> 01:42:36,975
How'd the kid get in?
Through the back door?

1562
01:42:36,999 --> 01:42:39,124
- We took it out.
- Can we invade the deep logic?

1563
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:40,666
We keep hitting a damn firewall.

1564
01:42:40,832 --> 01:42:42,472
If it wants to play a game, then play it!

1565
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,916
- Have it list games.
- Stephen, for Christ's sake.

1566
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:46,767
No, let him. He's played it before.

1567
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:48,350
He can hardly do
worse than you have, John.

1568
01:42:48,374 --> 01:42:50,814
- Two numbers.
- God damn it, I'd piss on a spark plug

1569
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:52,166
if I thought it'd do any good.

1570
01:42:52,457 --> 01:42:53,749
Let the boy in there, Major.

1571
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:54,916
List games.

1572
01:43:01,249 --> 01:43:02,249
Chess.

1573
01:43:09,999 --> 01:43:11,499
Three numbers locked in.

1574
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:12,666
Poker.

1575
01:43:15,749 --> 01:43:18,069
The security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1576
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:23,499
Global Thermonuclear War.

1577
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:33,666
Four numbers.

1578
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:38,249
Stephen, for Christ's sake, do something.

1579
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:40,749
- Come on, kid, let's go.
- No. Try again.

1580
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,582
- Put the list back up.
- Yeah, we already tried that.

1581
01:43:46,749 --> 01:43:48,291
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1582
01:43:56,499 --> 01:43:57,916
It's not on the list!

1583
01:43:58,582 --> 01:43:59,582
What's not on the list?

1584
01:43:59,749 --> 01:44:01,429
Go ahead. It's gotta
be in there somewhere.

1585
01:44:04,457 --> 01:44:06,957
Tic-tac-toe.

1586
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:14,291
You're in.

1587
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:16,433
Order it to disarm the missiles.

1588
01:44:16,457 --> 01:44:17,457
No, no!

1589
01:44:27,582 --> 01:44:29,332
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1590
01:44:31,624 --> 01:44:32,749
One.

1591
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:36,624
- Put X in the center square.
- I know.

1592
01:44:47,874 --> 01:44:49,100
- Six up.
- There's no way

1593
01:44:49,124 --> 01:44:51,749
- you can win that game!
- I know that. It doesn't.

1594
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:53,124
It hasn't learned.

1595
01:44:53,291 --> 01:44:54,891
Is there any way to make it play itself?

1596
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:57,916
Yes. Number of players, zero.

1597
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,207
Seven.

1598
01:45:20,582 --> 01:45:21,832
Come on.

1599
01:45:21,999 --> 01:45:24,457
Learn, Goddamn it!

1600
01:45:35,957 --> 01:45:36,999
Eight.

1601
01:45:37,207 --> 01:45:38,567
It must be caught in a loop.

1602
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:41,166
It's drawing more and more power
from the rest of the system.

1603
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:44,332
Nine numbers.

1604
01:45:48,207 --> 01:45:49,933
Ten. It's got the code.

1605
01:45:49,957 --> 01:45:50,957
It's gonna launch.

1606
01:46:06,707 --> 01:46:07,707
General!

1607
01:46:10,332 --> 01:46:11,642
Colonel Conley, call SAC.

1608
01:46:11,666 --> 01:46:12,866
Get me a launch status report.

1609
01:46:15,582 --> 01:46:17,462
- Major Davis, get me the President.
- Yes, sir.

1610
01:46:50,791 --> 01:46:52,058
How you doing, Colonel?

1611
01:46:52,082 --> 01:46:53,933
Sir, all land lines out
of the mountain are dead.

1612
01:46:53,957 --> 01:46:55,475
I'm trying to break through on satellites.

1613
01:46:55,499 --> 01:46:59,582
Okay, keep trying.

1614
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:23,041
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1615
01:48:10,874 --> 01:48:13,332
<i>Greetings, Professor Falken.</i>

1616
01:48:22,874 --> 01:48:25,082
Hello, Joshua.

1617
01:48:26,582 --> 01:48:27,957
<i>A strange game.</i>

1618
01:48:28,124 --> 01:48:31,582
<i>The only winning move is not to play.</i>

1619
01:48:39,582 --> 01:48:43,207
<i>How about a nice game of chess?</i>

1620
01:49:19,332 --> 01:49:23,082
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1621
01:49:23,249 --> 01:49:24,332
Yes, sir.
