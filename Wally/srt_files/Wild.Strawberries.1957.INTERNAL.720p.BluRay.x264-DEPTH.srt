1
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,719
<i>In our relations with other people,</i>

2
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

3
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:57,642
<i>their character and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:03,231
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

5
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,984
<i>from nearly all so-called relations.</i>

6
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:12,157
<i>This has made my old age
rather lonely.</i>

7
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,706
<i>My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.</i>

8
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,542
<i>It began as toil
for bread and butter</i>

9
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:27,422
<i>and ended in a love for science.</i>

10
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.</i>

11
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:38,850
<i>He has been married for many years.
They have no children.</i>

12
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:45,523
<i>My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.</i>

13
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:55,450
<i>My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.</i>

14
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,870
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,459
Thank you.

16
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,796
<i>I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.</i>

17
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:13,384
<i>Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,</i>

18
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,722
<i>which at times
has been rather trying</i>

19
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:22,811
<i>for myself and those around me.</i>

20
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,149
<i>My name is Isak Borg,</i>

21
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,528
<i>and I am 78.</i>

22
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,076
<i>Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.</i>

23
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,761
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,742
<i>In the early hours of June 1st,</i>

25
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,996
<i>I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.</i>

26
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:09,334
<i>I dreamt that during
my morning walk</i>

27
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:14,964
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

28
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,592
<i>with ruined houses.</i>

29
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,070
Are you ill?

30
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,865
Miss Agda, please prepare some breakfast.
I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,245
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,581
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,042
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,171
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,300
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:58,307
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:03,062
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,024
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,403
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,155
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,784
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,370
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:24,083
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in MalmÃ¶?

44
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,212
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,218
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,638
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:42,768
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,313
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:49,984
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:54,572
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,158
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,243
Yes, that's my last word.

53
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,376
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,590
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,676
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,639
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:24,185
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:29,774
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:42,620
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,127
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,046
Really?

62
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,548
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,592
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:01,138
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:11,524
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,948
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,742
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:26,497
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,166
Would the professor like some toast?

70
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,460
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,505
What are <i>you</i> cross about?

72
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,929
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,603
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:54,400
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,112
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,531
There has been no row.

77
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,324
No, not at all.

78
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,287
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,413
Yes.

80
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,248
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,875
You're going home?

82
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,794
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,629
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,381
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,134
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,511
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,180
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,393
Good heavens!

89
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:02,092
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,594
I forgot.

91
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,014
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,475
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:13,395
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,607
I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,359
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,737
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,823
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,035
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,913
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,373
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,250
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,253
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,380
Oh, well.

104
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,719
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,264
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,391
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,393
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,728
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,272
So he is.

110
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,858
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,819
You don't need to tell me <i>that.</i>

112
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,320
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,281
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,075
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,744
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,204
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,206
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,167
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,169
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,589
You have your own income.

121
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,650
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,050
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:30,764
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,226
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:48,073
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,867
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,327
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,164
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:59,752
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:05,841
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,348
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,645
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,191
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,737
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,323
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,867
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,037
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,750
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,880
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,674
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,801
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,469
Did I say that?

143
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,847
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,641
These were your very words:

145
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,852
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,938
so don't come lamenting to <i>me.</i>

147
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,443
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:10,155
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,990
Did I say that?

150
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,036
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,164
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,548
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,341
Like a cat.

154
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,802
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:37,141
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,893
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,271
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,988
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,407
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,369
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,551
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,220
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,717
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,387
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,390
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,226
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,024
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,692
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,583
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,641
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental.</i>

171
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,603
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

172
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,314
<i>and felt a bit sad.</i>

173
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:56,196
<i>It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,</i>

174
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,033
<i>associated with places
where I played as a child.</i>

175
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,787
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>

176
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,332
<i>but the day's clear reality</i>

177
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:12,588
<i>dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory</i>

178
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,173
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

179
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,176
<i>with the strength
of a true stream of events.</i>

180
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,652
Sara.

181
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,199
Sara,

182
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,286
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:51,001
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:57,799
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,642
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,977
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,564
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,443
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:20,072
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,407
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,118
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,411
I'll help you.

193
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:30,040
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,875
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:35,003
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,131
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,093
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,637
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,641
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,227
- Says who?
<i>- I</i> say.

201
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,021
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,815
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,234
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,403
With you!

205
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,531
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:07,828
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,456
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,918
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,630
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,842
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,971
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:31,935
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,396
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,064
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,859
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:43,822
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:47,034
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,494
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,371
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:57,377
And the twins,
who know <i>most</i> things,

221
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:02,340
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:07,804
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:11,266
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,644
You <i>must</i> kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:19,107
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,443
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,406
And the twins say

228
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,659
that you're <i>mad</i> about girls.

229
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,495
Is that true?

230
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,965
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,346
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:55,018
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,106
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,233
At any rate, <i>nearly.</i>

235
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,903
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,865
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,536
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,777
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:50,991
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:57,080
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,132
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,677
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,689
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,692
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,319
I <i>have.</i>

246
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,823
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,619
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,704
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,876
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,922
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,174
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,552
It's <i>paint</i> under my nails.

253
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,429
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,057
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,229
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,107
I did!

257
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,860
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,196
How kind of you.

259
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:58,201
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,037
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:05,125
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:09,129
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,548
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,426
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,514
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,727
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,521
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:30,150
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,152
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,071
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,948
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,742
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:44,748
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:48,752
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

275
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:54,132
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,093
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,846
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,015
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,683
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,685
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,856
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,943
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,904
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,867
But Sara!

285
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,952
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:54,651
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:00,031
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,284
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,746
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,791
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,879
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,758
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,553
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,390
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,645
And I <i>am</i> worthless...
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,777
But sometimes it sees to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,113
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:44,826
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:51,291
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,585
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:56,212
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,298
I don't want to!

303
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,633
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,218
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,762
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,514
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,559
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,188
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,066
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,820
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:24,032
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:30,622
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,332
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:37,337
<i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i>

315
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,926
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

316
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:48,598
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

317
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,683
<i>And with our song</i>

318
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:55,146
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

319
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:59,526
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:03,780
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,373
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,958
You do that.

323
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:21,422
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,</i>

324
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:25,510
<i>but was soon awakened
from my reveries</i>

325
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,014
<i>by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.</i>

326
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,975
Is this your house?

327
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,143
No, it's not.

328
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:36,563
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,524
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,528
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,947
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,576
Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:50,785
Looks antique.

334
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:53,746
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:58,876
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,004
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,922
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,675
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,511
I'm honored.

340
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,930
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,392
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,768
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:20,690
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:21,941
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:25,903
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,823
Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,908
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:34,954
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,249
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,543
Let's be off.

351
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,551
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:54,641
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,438
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,693
What a big bus.

355
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,737
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,991
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:31,344
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,221
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,599
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:42,855
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,858
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,445
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,951
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,078
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:02,291
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,130
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,632
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,635
She was, actually.

369
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,303
What happened to her?

370
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:18,766
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,854
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,565
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:31,195
Oh, dear,
now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it.

374
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:08,983
Wait.
Let me get my glasses... There.

375
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,073
Are you all right?

376
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,160
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

377
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,287
My wife was driving.

378
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,081
Are you all right?
Completely all right?

379
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,416
Thank goodness for that.

380
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,547
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

381
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,092
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

382
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,137
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

383
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,389
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

384
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:44,143
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

385
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:48,564
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

386
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:53,820
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

387
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,906
Let's get your car upright.

388
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,784
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

389
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:04,372
Some people are unselfish,
though <i>you</i> don't think so.

390
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:11,212
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

391
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:17,844
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

392
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:23,766
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

393
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,817
Darling, you might have a stroke.

394
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,864
My wife likes ridiculing me.

395
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:41,033
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

396
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:49,185
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

397
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,188
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

398
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,818
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

399
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:59,946
Can't you shut up?

400
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,823
My wife can really <i>live</i> a part.

401
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:07,119
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

402
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:10,790
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

403
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,751
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

404
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:19,632
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

405
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,926
It's natural that you're upset,

406
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,470
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

407
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,931
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

408
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:30,184
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

409
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,315
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

410
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,109
So you can <i>afford</i> to defend her.

411
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,654
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

412
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,906
Very sarcastic!

413
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,409
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

414
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,579
But little Berit is.

415
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,165
Do you know
what that means for me?

416
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,084
I gather you're a Catholic.

417
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,586
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

418
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,006
We ridicule each other.

419
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,383
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

420
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,761
So, you see,
we need each other.

421
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:08,931
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

422
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,235
There it came.

423
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,613
That's what's called a syncope,
isn't it?

424
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,285
Very funny.

425
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:36,792
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

426
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:40,087
Shut up! Shut up!

427
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,846
This may be too blunt,

428
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,684
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

429
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,238
Forgive us, if you can.

430
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:40,356
<i>It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.</i>

431
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,692
<i>I had my first practice here,</i>

432
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:48,405
<i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i>

433
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,876
Hello there, Doctor.

434
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,588
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

435
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:07,800
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

436
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,097
Eva! Come here a moment!

437
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:18,644
It's Dr. Borg in person.

438
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,607
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

439
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,943
The world's best doctor.

440
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:31,198
Let's call the baby after him.

441
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,660
Isak Ãkerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

442
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,704
Suppose it's a girl.

443
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:39,832
We only have boys.

444
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,175
And how's your father these days?

445
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:53,262
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

446
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,140
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

447
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,685
And you're going to see
<i>your</i> mother, Doctor?

448
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:04,690
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

449
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:07,318
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

450
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,071
What do I owe you?

451
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:14,366
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

452
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,329
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

453
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:23,000
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

454
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,879
There are things
that <i>can't</i> be paid back...

455
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:28,631
not even with gas.

456
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:31,217
We haven't forgotten.

457
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,054
Ask anyone around here.

458
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:38,140
They all remember your kindness.

459
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:43,437
Maybe I should have stayed here.

460
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,147
What do you mean?

461
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,153
You said you should have stayed.

462
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,489
Did I?

463
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:57,076
Well, thanks anyway.

464
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:02,915
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

465
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,917
You know where to find me.

466
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:24,520
Then I told the old bat
that I'm the district medical officer.

467
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:31,068
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

468
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:35,614
<i>and told the young people
about my years as district medical officer.</i>

469
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:38,325
<i>My stories were quite a success,</i>

470
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:41,870
<i>and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.</i>

471
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:46,750
<i>I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.</i>

472
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:56,552
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

473
00:43:57,386 --> 00:44:00,681
how radiant must be its source!

474
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:02,975
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

475
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,227
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

476
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:09,732
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

477
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,066
It was beautiful!

478
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,571
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

479
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:20,075
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

480
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,910
I say that modern man...

481
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,787
I say that...

482
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:27,666
believes only in himself

483
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,794
and his biological death.

484
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:33,630
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

485
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:37,343
Man regards death with horror.

486
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:41,680
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

487
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,349
How sweet they <i>both</i> are!

488
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,517
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

489
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,520
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

490
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:52,107
You never had any imagination!

491
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:54,693
What do you say, Professor?

492
00:44:54,777 --> 00:45:00,574
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

493
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,201
so I'll say nothing.

494
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:04,203
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

495
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:08,040
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

496
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:13,629
"Where is the Friend I seek
where'er I'm going?

497
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:19,385
At break of dawn,
my need for him is growing.

498
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:23,514
At night he is not there..."

499
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:26,892
"At night he is not there
to still my yearning."

500
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,729
"My heart is burning.
I see his footprints..."

501
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:32,815
Are you religious, Professor?

502
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:39,113
"I see his footprints
here in nature's power.

503
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,992
The weighted wheat that bends,
the scented flower."

504
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:54,378
"His love is in the very air I'm breathing,
the sigh I'm heaving.

505
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,257
I hear his voice
where summer breezes quiver."

506
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,510
Not bad for a love poem.

507
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:06,682
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

508
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:13,021
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

509
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:15,858
- May I come?
- Of course.

510
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,913
Here comes the thunder.

511
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,883
I have just sent you a telegram

512
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,052
on your great day.

513
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:45,846
And now you're here.

514
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,475
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

515
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,730
Is that your wife over there?

516
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,941
I don't want to talk to her.

517
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,986
She has done us too much harm.

518
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,822
No, Mother dear.

519
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:08,494
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

520
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,663
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

521
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,918
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

522
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:19,505
And why are you
gadding about like this?

523
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,632
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

524
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:25,844
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

525
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,847
Evald and I have no children.

526
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:34,102
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

527
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:41,527
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

528
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,448
My mother lived in this house.

529
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:50,202
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

530
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,162
Very well.

531
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:56,291
Here are some of your toys.

532
00:47:56,375 --> 00:48:01,338
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

533
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:05,133
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

534
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:07,219
Twenty grandchildren.

535
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,389
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

536
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:13,267
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

537
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:17,354
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

538
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:23,193
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

539
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:29,157
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

540
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:32,744
unless they want to borrow money.

541
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:36,039
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

542
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:38,667
Don't think that, Mother.

543
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,919
And I've one more fault.

544
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,422
I don't die.

545
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:47,134
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

546
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:50,304
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

547
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,017
This was Sigbritt's doll.

548
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,270
She got it when she turned eight.

549
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,023
I made the dress myself.

550
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,483
But she never cared for it

551
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,527
so it went to Charlotta.

552
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:09,239
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

553
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,743
Do you see who that is?

554
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:16,163
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

555
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,292
And myself.

556
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,836
What a fright
one looked in those days.

557
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:25,297
May I have it?

558
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,966
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

559
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,802
And here's a coloring book.

560
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:36,516
I don't know whose it was.

561
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,227
They've all put their names in it.

562
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,230
Kristina has scrawled,

563
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:47,319
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

564
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:53,575
And Birgitta has put,
"I'm going to marry Papa."

565
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:58,997
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

566
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:04,169
Don't you think it's cold in here?

567
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:06,922
No, not particularly.

568
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:10,676
I have felt cold all my life.

569
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:14,221
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

570
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:17,182
You have low blood pressure.

571
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:22,145
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

572
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:25,440
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

573
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:32,572
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

574
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:35,784
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

575
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,830
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

576
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:54,052
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

577
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:59,558
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

578
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:02,728
Now he's turning 50.

579
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:09,317
And little cousin Sara
used to carry him around and sing to him.

580
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,195
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

581
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:18,618
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

582
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:23,790
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

583
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:27,419
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

584
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,490
Where are Anders and Viktor?

585
00:51:56,573 --> 00:52:02,496
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

586
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,791
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

587
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:09,836
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

588
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,965
I said they could talk
about me instead.

589
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:18,386
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

590
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,971
so I left.

591
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:24,184
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

592
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:27,229
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

593
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,606
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

594
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,025
Don't even try it.
Watch yourself.

595
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,610
Stop that!

596
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,320
I'll see to them.

597
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,864
Which one do <i>you</i> like best?

598
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,450
Which one do you like best?

599
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:43,912
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

600
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,081
He's a darling.

601
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:49,000
But a minister's wife...

602
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:52,087
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

603
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,632
Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

604
00:52:55,715 --> 00:53:00,971
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

605
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:04,766
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

606
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,978
But how <i>can</i> anyone believe in God?

607
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,202
Well? Does God exist?

608
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:53,315
<i>I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid</i>

609
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:59,029
<i>and humiliating dreams.</i>

610
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:06,286
<i>There was something overpowering
in these dream images</i>

611
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:12,334
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i>

612
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,055
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

613
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:30,185
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

614
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:35,523
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

615
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:38,318
but I have all my life before me.

616
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:42,322
That hurt your feelings, after all.

617
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:46,493
No, it didn't hurt.

618
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:51,706
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

619
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:56,294
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

620
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,047
And so became unintentionally cruel.

621
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,301
I understand.

622
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:08,348
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

623
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:11,309
Look in the mirror again.

624
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:13,436
No, don't turn away.

625
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,605
I see.

626
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,899
Listen to me.

627
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:22,320
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

628
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:27,283
Love is almost a game for us.

629
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:33,456
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

630
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,711
There! Now you're smiling.

631
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,840
But it hurts so.

632
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:47,262
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

633
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:48,972
But you don't know.

634
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:54,019
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

635
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,605
I must go.

636
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:01,276
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

637
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:32,223
Poor little thing.

638
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:35,685
Hush, baby. Sleep.

639
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,772
Don't be afraid of the wind

640
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:44,652
or the birds

641
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:48,490
or the waves of the sea.

642
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:52,494
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

643
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:55,163
Don't be afraid, little one.

644
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:58,666
It will soon be day again.

645
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,669
No one will hurt you.

646
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,964
I am with you.
I am holding you.

647
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:15,113
Please come in, Professor Borg.

648
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,390
Please, have a seat.

649
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:35,443
Have you brought
your examination book?

650
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:46,621
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

651
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:00,134
There must be something wrong.

652
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:05,848
Not with the microscope.

653
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:09,394
I can't see a thing.

654
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:13,189
Please read this text.

655
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,539
What does it mean?

656
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:33,042
I don't know.

657
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:35,753
Really?

658
01:02:35,837 --> 01:02:39,674
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

659
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:46,347
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

660
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:50,560
Don't you know what that is?

661
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:55,106
Let me think.

662
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:56,691
Take your time.

663
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:02,864
A doctor's first duty...

664
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:05,032
A doctor's...

665
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,286
I've forgotten.

666
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:12,665
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

667
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:17,587
Of course! Now I remember!

668
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:32,226
You have been accused of guilt.

669
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,770
Accused of guilt?

670
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:38,399
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

671
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,571
Is it serious?

672
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,948
Unfortunately, Professor.

673
01:03:57,919 --> 01:03:59,629
I have a weak heart.

674
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:02,006
I'm an old man.

675
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,926
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

676
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:08,095
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

677
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:12,266
Do you want to stop the examination?
- No, for God's sake, no!

678
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,985
Please diagnose the patient.

679
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,460
The patient is dead.

680
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,901
What are you writing in my book?

681
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:07,113
- My verdict.
- And that is?

682
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,490
That you are incompetent.

683
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:18,207
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

684
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:23,296
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

685
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:27,091
Your wife has made the charge.

686
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,510
You'll be confronted with her.

687
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:32,096
But my wife has been dead for years!

688
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:34,098
Do you think I'm joking?

689
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,853
Please come with me.

690
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:41,439
You have no choice.

691
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:05,040
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

692
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:08,836
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

693
01:08:09,712 --> 01:08:14,925
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

694
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,597
Tuesday, May 1st, 1917.

695
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,390
You stood on this very spot

696
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:26,103
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

697
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:45,581
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

698
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:49,001
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

699
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,047
Just as if he were God.

700
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:59,929
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

701
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:05,601
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

702
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:10,231
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

703
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:11,732
He'll say,

704
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:17,947
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

705
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,493
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

706
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,747
because he's cold as ice.

707
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,335
And suddenly he gets very tender,

708
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:35,381
and I scream at him that he's mad

709
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:40,427
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

710
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:44,640
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

711
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:47,768
and that he understands
everything quite well.

712
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:51,313
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

713
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:57,736
And he looks sad
and says it <i>is</i> his fault.

714
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,949
But he doesn't really care
about anything

715
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,702
because he's so cold.

716
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:30,185
Where is she?

717
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:34,565
Gone. All are gone.

718
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:38,652
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

719
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,907
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

720
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,743
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

721
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:47,995
How silent it is.

722
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:51,498
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

723
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,335
And the punishment?

724
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:58,088
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

725
01:10:58,172 --> 01:10:59,757
The usual?

726
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,759
Loneliness.

727
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:04,178
Loneliness?

728
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:07,139
Precisely.

729
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:09,934
Is there no mercy?

730
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:13,437
Don't ask me. I don't know.

731
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,376
What's this?

732
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:39,254
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

733
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:42,049
But it's still raining.

734
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:46,387
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

735
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,138
Oh, dear.

736
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:49,348
Slept well?

737
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:55,062
Yes, but recently
I've had the weirdest dreams.

738
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:59,400
It's comical.
- What's comical?

739
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,196
As if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

740
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,656
What's that?

741
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:10,160
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

742
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:13,664
You and Evald are very alike.

743
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,166
So you've said.

744
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,502
He said the same thing.

745
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:21,005
About me?

746
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,840
No. About himself.

747
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:24,425
But he's only 38.

748
01:12:26,844 --> 01:12:29,513
May I tell you about it?

749
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:33,559
Yes, I'd be grateful.

750
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:39,356
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

751
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,525
so he drove me down to the sea.

752
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:45,863
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

753
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:52,369
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

754
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:54,705
Something unpleasant, of course.

755
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,125
I wish I didn't have to.

756
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,294
You have found someone else.

757
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,047
Don't be childish.

758
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:07,718
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

759
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,555
and then you find it
hard to begin.

760
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:17,603
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

761
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,563
I almost want to laugh now.

762
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:21,565
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

763
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:25,861
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

764
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:27,738
I'm going to have a baby.

765
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,992
Are you sure?

766
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:34,495
The doctor told me yesterday.

767
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:39,124
So that was the secret.

768
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:44,421
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

769
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:48,133
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

770
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:06,902
You know I don't want a child.

771
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,530
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

772
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:12,366
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

773
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:15,077
It's absurd to live in this world,

774
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,240
and even more absurd
to provide it with new wretches.

775
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:19,832
What's most absurd
is to think they'll have it better than us.

776
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:23,627
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

777
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:28,006
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

778
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,968
Is he even sure I'm his son?

779
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:34,763
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

780
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:36,390
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

781
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:39,476
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

782
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,438
You're a coward.

783
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,482
Yes.

784
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,985
This life sickens me.

785
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,903
I will not be forced to take on

786
01:14:49,987 --> 01:14:53,073
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

787
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:57,661
And you know
that I mean what I say.

788
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,884
I know that this is wrong.

789
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:14,344
There's neither right nor wrong.

790
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:18,557
We act according to our needs.

791
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,933
And what are they?

792
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:25,189
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

793
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:26,565
And yours?

794
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:31,570
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

795
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:48,212
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

796
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:55,344
Why have you told me all this?

797
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:04,144
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

798
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:06,939
I don't understand.

799
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:13,820
I thought: That's his mother.

800
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:19,660
An old woman, cold as ice,

801
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:22,829
more forbidding than death.

802
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:26,333
And this is her son,

803
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,045
and there are light-years
between them.

804
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,715
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

805
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:41,223
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

806
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:45,894
And I thought of the baby inside me.

807
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:51,149
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

808
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:54,236
and loneliness.

809
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:57,489
It must end somewhere.

810
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:01,201
But you're going back to Evald!

811
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:05,998
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

812
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:10,127
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

813
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,796
Not even the man
I love most of all.

814
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,135
Can I help you?

815
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:19,720
No one can help me.

816
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:24,391
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

817
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:28,145
What happened after your talk?

818
01:17:28,228 --> 01:17:30,731
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

819
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,567
Hasn't he got in touch with you?

820
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:40,198
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

821
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:44,411
Like those two in the car today.

822
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:48,832
I was just thinking of them.

823
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:52,878
It reminded me of my own marriage.

824
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,422
But we love each other.

825
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:58,008
<i>Long may he live
Long may he live</i>

826
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:00,927
<i>May he live to be
a hundred years old</i>

827
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:06,141
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

828
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:10,437
With these simple flowers
we want to say

829
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,108
that we are <i>very</i> impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

830
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:19,029
We know you must be
a very wise old man

831
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,532
who knows <i>everything</i> about life

832
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:27,079
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

833
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:31,792
Thank you.

834
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:36,254
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

835
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:09,830
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

836
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:12,833
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

837
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:16,670
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

838
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:21,299
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

839
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:23,885
Thank you.
That was most kind.

840
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:26,763
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

841
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:32,144
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

842
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,855
Welcome, Father.

843
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,150
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

844
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:40,986
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

845
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:44,114
The guest room as usual, Father?

846
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,949
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

847
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:48,285
Go into the kitchen.
I'll be right there.

848
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,537
You can put your things down there.

849
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,331
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

850
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:54,666
Who are those young people?

851
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:56,960
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

852
01:19:57,043 --> 01:20:00,046
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

853
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,883
It's a quarter past 4:00.

854
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,973
I've bought you new shoelaces.

855
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:21,276
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

856
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,778
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

857
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:27,616
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

858
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:30,660
Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

859
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:32,454
And unexpected.

860
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:34,539
Same here.

861
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:37,501
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

862
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:42,130
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

863
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:51,932
Hurry up, Professor!

864
01:22:26,818 --> 01:22:31,781
<i>During the ceremony,</i>

865
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:35,827
<i>my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,</i>

866
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:40,790
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

867
01:22:40,874 --> 01:22:43,710
<i>to write down what had happened.</i>

868
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:50,091
<i>In this jumble of events,</i>

869
01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:54,387
<i>I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.</i>

870
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:23,166
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

871
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:24,876
Yes, thank you.

872
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,254
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

873
01:23:28,338 --> 01:23:29,964
I won't deny it.

874
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,092
Take one of my sleeping pills.

875
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:39,849
Miss Agda,
I am sorry about this morning.

876
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,310
Are you ill, Professor?

877
01:23:42,394 --> 01:23:44,354
No. Why?

878
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:47,899
I don't like the sound of it.

879
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:50,860
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

880
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,907
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

881
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:06,626
I'll open the balcony doors. There.

882
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:13,967
It's raining.

883
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:24,102
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

884
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:26,438
Miss Agda,

885
01:24:28,273 --> 01:24:32,736
as we have known each other

886
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:34,988
for so many years,

887
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:38,575
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

888
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:41,369
No, I don't.

889
01:24:41,453 --> 01:24:42,746
Why not?

890
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:45,206
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

891
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:51,171
No intimacies for me, thank you.

892
01:24:51,254 --> 01:24:53,423
It's all right between us as it is.

893
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:56,468
But we are old now.

894
01:24:56,551 --> 01:25:01,347
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

895
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:06,269
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

896
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,313
They would make fun of us.

897
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:11,816
Are you always right?

898
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,985
Almost always.

899
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:19,115
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

900
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:22,160
Yes, good night, Miss Agda.

901
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:30,585
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

902
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:34,714
You know where I am
if you want anything.

903
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:52,273
<i>Sunny children of air and light</i>

904
01:25:52,357 --> 01:26:00,357
<i>Oh, I understand your quiet murmur</i>

905
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:09,282
<i>Blooming beautiful valleys</i>

906
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:17,499
<i>Home to your heart's peace</i>

907
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:24,180
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

908
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:26,182
We were terribly proud
to know you.

909
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:30,186
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

910
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:33,189
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

911
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:35,191
We just wanted to say good-bye.

912
01:26:35,275 --> 01:26:37,777
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

913
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,490
It's you I really love, you know.

914
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:46,536
Today, tomorrow, always.

915
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:48,872
I'll remember.

916
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:51,916
Come on.

917
01:26:57,463 --> 01:27:01,134
We have to go now.

918
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:06,848
Let me hear from you.

919
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:21,613
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

920
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,240
Yes, Father?

921
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:26,451
Are you back already?

922
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:30,246
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

923
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:34,375
So you're going to the dance?

924
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:37,337
I suppose so.

925
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:41,674
How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

926
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:44,510
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

927
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,348
Sleep well.

928
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:53,394
Sit down a moment.

929
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:57,023
Anything special?

930
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:03,655
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

931
01:28:05,073 --> 01:28:06,741
Forgive my asking.

932
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:08,368
I don't know.

933
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,955
It's not my business, but...

934
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:16,459
But wouldn't it...

935
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,628
I have asked her to stay with me.

936
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,922
Shouldn't you... I mean...

937
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:25,301
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

938
01:28:25,385 --> 01:28:28,471
I can't live without <i>her.</i>
That's what I mean.

939
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:30,515
Oh, I see.

940
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:32,392
It will be as she wants.

941
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,478
And she...

942
01:28:36,062 --> 01:28:39,273
She says she'll think about it.

943
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:42,110
About that debt of yours...

944
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:44,988
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

945
01:28:45,071 --> 01:28:48,449
- That's not what I meant.
- You'll get your money.

946
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:50,994
How are you, Uncle Isak?

947
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:52,996
Fine. Just fine.

948
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:56,124
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

949
01:28:56,207 --> 01:28:58,710
They're very nice.

950
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:03,756
Thanks for coming with me.

951
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,971
I like you, Marianne.

952
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:12,932
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

953
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:25,570
<i>If I have been worried
or sad during the day,</i>

954
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:31,617
<i>it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.</i>

955
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,996
<i>I did so on this evening too.</i>

956
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:50,261
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

957
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:53,222
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

958
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:56,225
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

959
01:29:56,309 --> 01:30:00,980
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

960
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:04,192
Come, I'll help you.
