1
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,894
Yes, Marlin.

2
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,021
I see it. It's beautiful.

3
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,816
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,611
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

5
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,573
Oh, yeah!

6
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,744
A fish can breathe out here. Did
your man deliver or did he deliver?

7
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,246
- My man delivered.
- It wasn't so easy.

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,207
A lot of clownfish had
their eyes on this place.

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,961
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,298
You did good and the
neighbourhood is awesome.

11
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:45,772
- So you do like it, don't you?
- No, no, I really do like it.

12
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,816
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

13
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,818
great schools, amazing view,

14
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,446
but do we really
need so much space?

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,032
Coral, honey, these are our
kids we're talking about.

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,241
They deserve the best.

17
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,621
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,831
right by their bedroom window!

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,502
- You're going to wake the kids.
- Oh, right. Right.

20
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,465
Look.

21
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,885
They're dreaming.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,306
- We still have to name them.
- All of them? Right now?

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,559
All right. We'll name
this half Marlin Jr.

24
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,770
and this half Coral Jr.

25
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,314
- Okay, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,816
Nemo?

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,694
We'll name one Nemo, but I'd like
most of them to be Marlin Jr.

28
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,697
In a couple of days, we're
going to be parents!

29
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,907
Yeah.

30
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,577
- What if they don't like me?
- Marlin...

31
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,329
There's over 400 eggs.

32
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,582
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
What?

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,340
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,633
Well, I remember.

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,553
Excuse me, miss. Can you see
if I have a hook in my lip?

37
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,847
- Marlin.
- Look closer.

38
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,141
- Get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here!

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,437
Where did everybody go?

40
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,029
Coral, get inside the house.

41
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,993
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

42
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,744
You. Right now.

43
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,748
No!

44
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,019
Coral!

45
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:59,322
Coral?

46
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:11,375
Coral!

47
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,466
Coral?

48
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
There, there.

49
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,660
It's okay. Daddy's here.

50
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,871
Daddy's got you.

51
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,128
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

52
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,505
Nemo.

53
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,920
First day of school! Wake up! Come on.
First day of school.

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,216
I don't want to go to school.

55
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,093
- Not you, Dad. Me.
- Okay.

56
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,178
Get up! Time for school!

57
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,766
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
- Oh, boy!

58
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,976
Nemo!

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,812
- First day of school!
- Don't move.

60
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,399
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

61
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,317
- You feel a break?
- No.

62
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,571
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

63
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,365
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?

64
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,367
- Answer the question.
- Three.

65
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,829
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

66
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,789
Three. That's all I have?

67
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,875
You're okay. How's
the lucky fin?

68
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,210
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

69
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,132
Sure you want to go
to school this year?

70
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,927
- You can wait five or six years.
- Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

71
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,221
Forgot to brush.

72
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,766
Do you want this
anemone to sting you?

73
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,309
- Yes.
- Brush.

74
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,895
- I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

75
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,855
- Where?
- There.

76
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,316
Right there. And here and here.

77
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,538
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

78
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,832
What do we have to
remember about the ocean?

79
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,418
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

80
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:04,298
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

81
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,592
Then we go out and back in.

82
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,595
Then one more time.
Out and back in.

83
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,348
- If you want to do it four times...
- Dad...

84
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,350
All right. Come on, boy.

85
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,688
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

86
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,399
- I doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,152
- No, and I don't plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?

88
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,446
Sea turtles? I don't know.

89
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,949
Sandy Plankton from
next door said that

90
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,203
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

91
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,833
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask
him, after I'm done talking to the shark.

92
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,960
Hold on. Wait to cross.

93
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,588
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

94
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,925
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

95
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,553
That snail was about to charge.

96
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,472
I wonder where we're
supposed to go.

97
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,684
- Bye, Mom.
- I'll pick you up after school.

98
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,480
Come on, you guys. Stop it.
Give it back.

99
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,567
Come on. We'll try over there.

100
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,571
Excuse me. Is this where
we meet his teacher?

101
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,157
- Look who's out of the anemone.
- Yes, shocking, I know.

102
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,617
- Marty?
- Marlin.

103
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,660
- Bob.
- Ted.

104
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,745
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

105
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,623
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

106
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,001
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

107
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,297
That's a misconception. Clownfish
are no funnier than any other fish.

108
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,841
- Come on, Clowny.
- Do something funny.

109
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,176
All right. I know one joke.

110
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,306
There's a mollusk.
He walks up to...

111
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,099
Well, he swims up.

112
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,020
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

113
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,521
And then the sea cucumber...

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,817
I'm mixed up. There was a
mollusk and a sea cucumber.

115
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,736
None of them were walking...

116
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,947
Sheldon! Get out of Mr
Johanssen's yard now!

117
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,034
All right, you kids!

118
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,161
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

119
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,622
Can I go play, too? Can I?

120
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,458
I would feel better if you go
play over on the sponge beds.

121
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,923
That's where I would play.

122
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,011
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

123
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,556
- Hey, what did I do?
- Be nice. It's his first time at school.

124
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,142
He was born with it. We
call it his lucky fin.

125
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,268
Dad...

126
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,105
See this tentacle? It's shorter
than all my other tentacles.

127
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,568
But you can't really tell. Especially
when I twirl them like this.

128
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,654
I'm H2O intolerant.

129
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,156
I'm obnoxious.

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

131
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,955
Let's name the zones
of the open sea

132
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,373
Mr Ray!

133
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,500
- Come on, Nemo.
- Stay with me.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,419
There's epipelagic, mesopelagic,
bathyal, abyssopelagic

135
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,006
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

136
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,759
I wonder where my
class has gone.

137
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,636
We're under here.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,431
There you are! Come
aboard, explorers.

139
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,059
Knowledge exploring
is oh so lyrical

140
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,603
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

141
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,938
Dad, you can go now.

142
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,983
- Well, hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

143
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,611
Nemo, all new explorers must
answer a science question.

144
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,614
- Okay.
- You live in what kind of home?

145
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,868
In an anemoninny.
Anemonemenemone.

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,329
Don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard.

147
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,456
Just so you know, he's
got a little fin.

148
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,043
If he's having trouble swimming,
let him take a break. 15 minutes.

149
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,295
Dad, it's time for
you to go now.

150
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,464
We're going to stay together.

151
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,175
Okay, class. Optical
orbits up front.

152
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,638
Remember, we keep our supraesophageal
ganglion to ourselves.

153
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,433
- That means you, Jimmy.
- Oh, man!

154
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,894
- Bye, Nemo.
- Bye, Dad.

155
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,646
Bye, son.

156
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,984
Be safe.

157
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,486
You're doing well
for a first-timer.

158
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,822
You can't hold on to
them forever, can you?

159
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,117
I had a tough time when my
eldest went out on the Drop Off.

160
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,745
The Drop Off! They're
going to the Drop Off?

161
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,455
Are you insane?

162
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,416
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,126
Hey, Marty, calm down.

164
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,003
Don't tell me to
be calm, pony-boy.

165
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,756
Pony-boy?

166
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,467
For a clownfish, he
really isn't that funny.

167
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,551
Pity.

168
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,181
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

169
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,100
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

170
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,859
Mollusca and gastropoda,
arthropoda, echinoderma, chordata

171
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,194
And some fish like you and me!

172
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,196
Come on. Sing with me.

173
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,874
Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun

174
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,959
lt makes its food from
the rays of the sun

175
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,756
Okay, the Drop Off.

176
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,134
All right, kids. Feel free
to explore, but stay close.

177
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,887
Stromatolitic cyanobacteria!
Gather.

178
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,182
An ecosystem contained in
one infinitesimal speck.

179
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,311
Come on. Let's go.

180
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,271
Come on. Sing with me.

181
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,358
There's porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

182
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,984
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas three

183
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,779
Hey, guys, wait up.

184
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,156
Whoa!

185
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,328
Cool.

186
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,124
Saved your life!

187
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,751
You guys made me ink.

188
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,920
What's that?

189
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,341
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

190
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,553
He said it was called a butt.

191
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,306
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

192
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,353
Look at me. I'm going
to go touch the butt.

193
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,316
Oh, yeah? Let's see
you get closer.

194
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,693
Okay.

195
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,529
Beat that.

196
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,115
Come on, Nemo. How
far can you go?

197
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,494
- My dad says it's not safe.
- Nemo, no!

198
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,704
Dad?

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,414
You were about to
swim into open water.

200
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,498
No!

201
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,375
Good thing I was here.

202
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,878
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

203
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,505
- I wasn't.
- This does not concern you.

204
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,050
You're lucky I don't tell your parents.
You can't swim well.

205
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,345
- I can swim fine, Dad, okay?
- No. It's not okay.

206
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,889
You shouldn't be near here.

207
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,558
You'll start school
in a year or two.

208
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,728
No. Just because you're
scared of the ocean...

209
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,730
Clearly you're not ready.

210
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,774
You think you can do these
things, but you just can't!

211
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,736
I hate you.

212
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,948
There's...

213
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,825
Nothing to see. Gather there.

214
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,204
Anything I can do? I am a scientist.
Is there any problem?

215
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,457
I didn't mean to interrupt.
He isn't a good swimmer.

216
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,710
I think it's too soon for him
to be out here unsupervised.

217
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
I can assure you, he's
quite safe with me.

218
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,255
I'm sure he is.

219
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,592
But you have a large class and
he can get lost from sight

220
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,552
if you're not looking.

221
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,430
Oh, my gosh! Nemo's
swimming out to sea.

222
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,600
Nemo!

223
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,686
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,731
You're going to get stuck

225
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,692
and I'm going to have to get
you before another fish does.

226
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,403
Get back here.

227
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,948
I said get back here now!

228
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,742
Stop.

229
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,869
You take one more
move, mister...

230
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,249
Don't you dare. If you put
one fin on that boat...

231
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,833
Are you listening to me?

232
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,961
Don't touch the boa...

233
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,045
Nemo!

234
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,713
He touched the butt.

235
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,591
You paddle your little
tail back here.

236
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,469
That's right. You are in
big trouble, young man.

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,638
Do you hear me? Big...

238
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,397
Daddy, help me!

239
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,983
I'm coming, Nemo.

240
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,569
Get under me, kids.

241
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,322
No! Dad!

242
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,331
Nemo!

243
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,254
Nemo! Nemo, no!

244
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,631
Nemo!

245
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,924
Nemo, Nemo!

246
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,013
No!

247
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,858
Nemo, Nemo!

248
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,411
Hold on!

249
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,883
Oh, no.

250
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,469
No. It's gone. It's gone.

251
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,888
It can't be gone. No. No!

252
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,140
Nemo! Nemo...

253
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,434
Nemo!

254
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,727
No.

255
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,481
Nemo! Nemo!

256
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,607
No.

257
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,150
No. Please, no.

258
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,071
No, no.

259
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,325
Has anybody seen a boat?

260
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,243
Please. A white boat?

261
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,746
My son! My son!

262
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,164
Help me. Please.

263
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,582
Look out!

264
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,006
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

265
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,508
Are you okay?

266
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,259
- He's gone.
- There, there.

267
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,011
- He's gone.
- It's all right.

268
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,514
- It'll be okay.
- No, they took him away.

269
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,182
I have to find the boat.

270
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,851
- A boat? I've seen a boat.
- You have?

271
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,979
- And it passed by not too long ago.
- A white one?

272
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,107
- Hi. I'm Dory.
- Where? Which way?

273
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,193
It went this way.

274
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,529
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

275
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,988
Thank you so much.

276
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,573
No problem.

277
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,226
Wait.

278
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:52,279
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

279
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,489
You got a problem, buddy?

280
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,824
Do you? Do you?

281
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,034
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

282
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,661
I'm scared now!

283
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,746
- Wait.
- Stop following me, okay?

284
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,916
What? You're showing me
which way the boat went.

285
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,670
A boat? I've seen a boat. It
passed by not too long ago.

286
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,673
It went this way. Follow me.

287
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,758
Wait a minute. What is going on?

288
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,886
You already told me which
way the boat was going.

289
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,139
I did? Oh, no.

290
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,018
If this is some kind ofjoke,
it's not funny and I know funny.

291
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,314
- I'm a clownfish.
- No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

292
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,775
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

293
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,195
Short-term memory loss.

294
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,113
- I don't believe this.
- No.

295
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,700
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.

296
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,535
At least I think it does.

297
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,372
Where are they?

298
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,128
Can I help you?

299
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,423
Something's wrong with you.
Really.

300
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,300
You're wasting my time.

301
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,260
I have to find my son.

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,723
Hello.

303
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,850
Well, hi!

304
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,353
Name's Bruce.

305
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,105
It's all right. I understand.

306
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,608
Why trust a shark, right?

307
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:24,329
So, what's a couple of bites
like you doing out so late?

308
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,373
Nothing. We're not even out.

309
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,707
Great.

310
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,295
Then how would you morsels like to come
to a little get-together I'm having?

311
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,591
- You mean like a party?
- Yeah, right. A party.

312
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,844
- What do you say?
- I love parties. That sounds like fun.

313
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,515
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

314
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,017
Come on. I insist.

315
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,603
Okay. That's all that matters.

316
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,401
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

317
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:59,406
Mind your distance, though. Those
balloons can be a bit dodgy.

318
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,241
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

319
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,882
Anchor! Chum!

320
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,719
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

321
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,597
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

322
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,558
We've gone through the
snacks and I'm starving.

323
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,768
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

324
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,478
Let's get this over with.

325
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,067
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

326
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,777
Let us all say the pledge.

327
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,738
I am a nice shark,

328
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,198
not a mindless eating machine.

329
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,953
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

330
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,706
Fish are friends, not food.

331
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,416
Except stinking dolphins.

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,377
Dolphins! Yeah, they
think they're so cute.

333
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,590
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let
me flip for you. Ain't I something?

334
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,218
Today's meeting is step
five: Bring a Fish Friend.

335
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,512
- Do you all have your friends?
- Got mine.

336
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,017
- Hey there!
- How about you, Chum?

337
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,812
Well, I seem to
have misplaced my

338
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,522
friend.

339
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,566
It's all right, Chum.

340
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,569
Help yourself to
one of my friends.

341
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,114
Thanks, mate. A
little chum for Chum.

342
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,826
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

343
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,119
Hello, Bruce.

344
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,414
It has been three weeks since
my last fish, on my honour,

345
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,792
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

346
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,670
- You're an inspiration to us.
- Amen.

347
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,632
- Right, then. Who's next?
- Pick me. Pick me.

348
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,550
The little sheila
down the front.

349
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,886
Come on up here.

350
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,555
Hi. I'm Dory.

351
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,182
Hello, Dory.

352
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,602
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

353
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,731
- Hey, that's incredible.
- Good on you, mate!

354
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,817
I'm glad I got
that off my chest.

355
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,113
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

356
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,532
Me? I don't have a problem.

357
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,076
- Okay.
- Denial.

358
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,453
Just start with your name.

359
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,789
Okay. Hello.

360
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,917
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

361
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,504
- A clownfish? Really?
- Go on. Tell us a joke.

362
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,755
I love jokes.

363
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,050
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

364
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,555
There was this mollusk and he
walks up to a sea cucumber.

365
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,058
Normally they don't talk, but
in a joke, everyone talks.

366
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,145
The sea mollusk says
to the cucumber...

367
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,940
Daddy!

368
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,777
Nemo!

369
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,864
- I don't get it.
- For a clownfish he's not that funny.

370
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:50,410
No, he's my son. He was
taken by these divers.

371
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,954
You poor fish.

372
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,332
- Humans. Think they own everything.
- Probably American.

373
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,462
There is a father looking
for his little boy.

374
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,589
What do these markings mean?

375
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,551
- I never knew my father.
- Come here.

376
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,762
- We're all mates here.
- I can't read human.

377
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,931
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

378
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,350
- Guys.
- No, Dory.

379
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,811
- That's mine. Give it back.
- Cut it out.

380
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,565
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

381
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,485
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

382
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,988
Dory, are you oka...

383
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,659
That's good.

384
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,536
Intervention!

385
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,248
- Just a bite.
- You hold it together, mate.

386
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,168
- Fish are friends, not food.
- Food!

387
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,754
Dory, look out.

388
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,715
I'm having fish tonight.

389
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,091
Remember the steps, mate.

390
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,140
Just one bite.

391
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,729
G'day.

392
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,027
There's no way out. There's
got to be a way to escape.

393
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,990
- Who is it?
- Help me find a way out.

394
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,868
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

395
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,372
There's no way out. There's
got to be a way out.

396
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,626
Here's something. "Es-ca-pÃ©."
I wonder what that means.

397
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,795
- It's spelled just like the word "escape."
- Let's go.

398
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,965
Here's Brucie!

399
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,094
- Wait a minute. You can read?
- I can read? That's right!

400
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,679
Then here. Read this now.

401
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,684
He doesn't mean it. He never
even knew his father.

402
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,811
Don't fall off the wagon.

403
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,358
Oh, no! It's blocked.

404
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,030
No, Bruce!

405
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,575
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

406
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,827
He's really... A nice guy.

407
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,495
I need to get that mask.

408
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,038
You want that mask? Okay.

409
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,499
No, no, no, no!

410
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,127
Quick. Grab the mask.

411
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,175
Oh, no. Bruce.

412
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,427
What?

413
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,348
Swim away!

414
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,850
Is the party over?

415
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,028
Nice.

416
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,991
Dad!

417
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,037
Daddy?

418
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,227
Barbara.

419
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,104
Prep for his anterior
crown, would you, please?

420
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,608
- And I'll need more cotton rolls.
- All right.

421
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,737
Hello, little fella.

422
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,156
Beauty, isn't he?

423
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,743
I found that guy struggling
for life and I saved him.

424
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,912
Has that Novocain kicked in yet?

425
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,376
Bubbles!

426
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,882
- My bubbles.
- He likes bubbles.

427
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,941
Slow down, little fella. There's
nothing to worry about.

428
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,235
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

429
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,570
Do you know where my dad is?

430
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,281
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

431
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,700
Pet store?

432
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,911
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.

433
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,413
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.

434
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,747
EBay.

435
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,291
- Which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

436
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,419
The ocean. The ocean!

437
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,007
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

438
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,425
Clean him!

439
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,553
Ocean.

440
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,890
VoilÃ . He is clean.

441
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,022
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

442
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,858
Big and blue?

443
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,984
I knew it.

444
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,487
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

445
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,159
If I'm not around you can always talk
to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

446
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,370
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

447
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,541
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

448
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,001
- Yes!
- Boy, oh, boy.

449
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,253
- What have we got?
- Root canal.

450
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,588
It's not going to be pretty.

451
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,841
- Clamp installed?
- Yup.

452
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,344
- What did he use to open?
- Glidden drill. He favours that one.

453
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,347
I can't see, Flo.

454
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,186
- Schilder Technique.
- That's a Hedstrom file.

455
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,730
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

456
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,816
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

457
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,569
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

458
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,738
There I go. Little help.
Over here.

459
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,698
I'll go deflate him.

460
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,911
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

461
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,289
The human mouth is a
disgusting place.

462
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,752
- Nigel.
- What did I miss?

463
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,838
- Root canal. A doozy.
- What did he use to open?

464
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,590
- Glidden drill.
- He favours it.

465
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,843
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

466
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,888
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

467
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,557
- The dentist took him off the reef.
- An outie.

468
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,393
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

469
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,729
Fish got to swim.
Birds got to eat.

470
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:56,192
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

471
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,198
The picture broke. This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

472
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,324
Going to be eight this week.

473
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,577
Hey, little fella. Say
hello to your new mummy.

474
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,080
She's going to be here
Friday to pick you up.

475
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,998
You're her present.

476
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,042
It's our little secret.

477
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,418
Well, Mr Tucker,

478
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,839
while that sets up, I'm going to
go see a man about a wallaby.

479
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,591
Darla!

480
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,345
- What's wrong with her?
- She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

481
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,891
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

482
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,686
Hitched a ride on the
porcelain express.

483
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,231
She's a fish killer.

484
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,819
I can't go with that girl. I
have to get back to my dad.

485
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,198
- Daddy! Help me!
- He's stuck.

486
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,205
Nobody touch him.

487
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,462
Can you help me?

488
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,883
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

489
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,719
- Gill...
- I just want to see him do it, okay?

490
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,306
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

491
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,309
I can't. I have a bad fin.

492
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,102
Never stopped me.

493
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,734
Just think about
what you need to do.

494
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,323
Come on.

495
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,661
Perfect.

496
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,581
- You did it.
- Good squirming.

497
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,877
Wow, from the ocean!
Just like you, Gill.

498
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,170
Yeah.

499
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,216
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?

500
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,262
I'm thinking tonight we give
the kid a proper reception.

501
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,641
- So, kid, you got a name or what?
- Nemo.

502
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,142
I'm Nemo.

503
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,064
Nemo.

504
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,779
You going to eat that?

505
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,750
Careful of that hammer.

506
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,594
- Dory!
- Sea-Monkey has my money.

507
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,930
Wake up. Get up.

508
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,599
- Come on.
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.

509
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,476
- Get up!
- Look out. Sharks eat fish!

510
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,502
Wow. Dusty.

511
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,380
The mask. Where's the mask?

512
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,383
No! The mask! Get it!

513
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,385
Get the mask! Get it!

514
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,188
Keeps going on, doesn't it?

515
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,107
Echo! Echo!

516
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,235
- What are you doing?
- I've lost the mask.

517
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,237
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

518
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,865
That was my only chance of finding my son.
Now it's gone.

519
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,288
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

520
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,250
- When you're down, know what to do?
- I don't want to know.

521
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,627
Just keep swimming.

522
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,297
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

523
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,632
What do we do? We swim

524
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,468
Dory, no singing.

525
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,262
L love to swim

526
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,932
And when you want to
swim you want to...

527
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,977
I'm going to get stuck with that song.
It's in my head!

528
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,228
Sorry.

529
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,358
- See anything?
- Something's got me!

530
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,401
- That was me. Sorry.
- Who's that?

531
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,737
Who could it be? It's me.

532
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,448
Are... Are you my conscience?

533
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,659
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

534
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,579
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

535
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,706
- Can't complain.
- Good.

536
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,293
Now, Dory, I want you to tell
me, do you see anything?

537
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,253
I see a...

538
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,756
- I see a light.
- A light?

539
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,966
Yeah. Over there.

540
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,760
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

541
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,345
I see it, too.

542
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,312
What is it?

543
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,774
It's so pretty!

544
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,111
I...

545
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,446
I'm feeling happy.

546
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,909
Which is a big deal for me.

547
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,744
I want to touch it.

548
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,415
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

549
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,293
I'm going to get you.

550
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,212
I'm going to swim with you

551
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,048
I'm going to be your best friend

552
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,466
Good feeling's gone.

553
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,017
I can't see. I don't
know where I'm going.

554
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,980
- The mask!
- What mask?

555
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,233
Okay. I can't see a thing.

556
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,026
Whoa, geez.

557
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,154
- Look. A mask.
- Read it!

558
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,242
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. I need the light.

559
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,411
That's great. Keep
it right there.

560
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,330
- Just read it!
- Okay, okay.

561
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,874
Mr Bossy.

562
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,418
"P." Okay. P.

563
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,086
"Sher..."

564
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,755
P. Sher... P. Shirley...

565
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,340
P not Shirley.

566
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,427
The first line's "P. Sherman."

567
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,096
"P. Sherman" doesn't
make any sense!

568
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,556
Second line.

569
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,183
"42..."

570
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,979
Light, please.

571
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,691
"Walla... Wallaby."

572
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,779
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

573
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,949
Just finish up. Speed read.
No pressure.

574
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,036
There's a lot of pressure!
Take a guess, with pressure.

575
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,538
- Sydney. It's Sydney!
- Duck!

576
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,669
I'm dead. I'm dead.

577
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,546
I died. I'm dead.

578
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,473
We did it, we did it

579
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,225
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

580
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,478
No eating here tonight,
eating here tonight

581
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,314
No eating here tonight
You're on a diet

582
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,275
Dory. What did it say?
What did the mask say?

583
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,903
P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney.

584
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,365
I remembered what it said! I forget
things, but I remembered it.

585
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,492
- P. Sherman...
- Where is that?

586
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,119
I don't know. But who cares?
I remembered.

587
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,291
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!

588
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:39,989
Nemo.

589
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,658
Nemo!

590
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,915
Follow me.

591
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,183
State your name.

592
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,268
Nemo.

593
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,729
Brother Bloat, proceed.

594
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:58,734
Nemo, newcomer of
orange and white.

595
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,238
You have been called forth to the
summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

596
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:08,035
to join with us in the
fraternal bonds of tankhood.

597
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,122
- We want you in our club, kid.
- Really?

598
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,959
If you are able to swim through

599
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,546
the Ring of Fire!

600
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,012
Turn on the Ring of Fire.
You said you could do it.

601
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,889
The Ring of Fire!

602
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,143
Bubbles. Let me...

603
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,821
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy.

604
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,294
From this moment on, you will
now be known as Sharkbait.

605
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,671
Sharkbait!

606
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,464
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

607
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,757
Sharkbait.

608
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,593
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait...

609
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,013
- Sharkbait's one of us now.
- Agreed.

610
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,517
We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.

611
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,102
So what are we going to do?

612
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,063
I'll tell you.

613
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,858
We're going to get him out of here.
We'll help him escape.

614
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,402
- Escape? Really?
- We're all going to escape.

615
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,071
Not another one of
your escape plans.

616
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,198
Sorry, but they never work.

617
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,742
Yeah, why should this
be any different?

618
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,203
- 'Cause we've got him.
- Me?

619
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,955
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

620
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,751
You're the only one who can
get in and out of that thing.

621
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:43,046
We need you to take a pebble
inside there and jam the gears.

622
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,925
You do that and this tank's going
to get filthier by the minute.

623
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,678
Soon the dentist will
have to clean the tank.

624
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:53,891
When he does, he'll take us out of the
tank, put us in individual baggies,

625
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,894
then we'll roll down the
counter, out of the window,

626
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,481
off the awning, into the bushes, across
the street and into the harbour.

627
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,150
It's foolproof.

628
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,236
- Who's with me?
- I.

629
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,155
I think you're nuts.

630
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,492
No offence, kid, but you're
not the best swimmer.

631
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,328
He's fine. He can do this.

632
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,539
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

633
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,832
Let's do it!

634
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,548
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

635
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,926
To P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney.

636
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,345
If you ask where I'm
going, I'll tell you.

637
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,767
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where?
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

638
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,062
Excuse me. Excuse me.

639
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,481
Hi. Do you know how to get...
Hello?

640
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,317
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

641
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,777
Hold it!

642
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,821
Wait a minute. I'm
trying to talk to you.

643
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,448
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

644
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,369
One quick question. I need to...
And they're gone again.

645
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,789
P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney.

646
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,041
Why do I have to tell you again?

647
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,628
- I don't get tired of it.
- All right, here's the thing.

648
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,925
I think it's best if I
carry on from here by...

649
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,387
- By myself.
- Okay.

650
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,013
You know. Alone.

651
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:20,018
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

652
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,189
I don't want to
hurt your feelings.

653
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,984
- You want me to leave?
- Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

654
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,653
I just can't afford
any more delays.

655
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,614
You're one of those
fish that cause delays.

656
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,742
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

657
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,287
- They're delay fish.
- You mean...

658
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,624
- You mean you don't like me?
- Of course I like you.

659
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,168
Because I like you I don't
want to be with you.

660
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,421
It's a complicated emotion.

661
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,258
Don't cry. I like you.

662
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,467
Hey, you!

663
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,554
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

664
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,558
- I don't remember. Were you?
- No, no. We're just...

665
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,518
Do you guys know
how I can get...

666
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,314
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

667
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,902
Okay. Just like in
rehearsals, gentlemen.

668
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,695
What are we? Take a guess.

669
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,823
- I've seen one of those.
- I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

670
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,867
- Wait.
- It's a swordfish.

671
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,536
Hey, clown-boy, let
the lady guess.

672
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,538
Where's the butter?

673
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,874
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Lobster.

674
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,375
- Saw that.
- What?

675
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,502
- Lots of legs.
- Clam?

676
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,795
Close enough.

677
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,340
It's a whale of a tale
I'll tell you, lad

678
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,675
- They're good.
- Somebody give me directions?

679
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:37,554
"Would somebody give
me directions?"

680
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,973
- I'm serious.
- Blah, blah, me, me.

681
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,516
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

682
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,185
Thank you.

683
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,479
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

684
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,398
What's the matter?

685
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,609
While they're doing impressions,

686
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,235
I am miles from home

687
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,363
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

688
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,199
- I bet that's frustrating.
- My son is out there.

689
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,201
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo.

690
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,913
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

691
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,665
I'm helping you.

692
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,335
Wait right here.

693
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,755
- Guys.
- Is he bothering you again?

694
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,423
No, he's a good guy.

695
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,884
Go easy on him. He's
lost his son Fabio.

696
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,470
Heard of P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney?

697
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,931
Sydney? Oh, sure.

698
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,934
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

699
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,396
- Sure do.
- Hey, they know Sydney!

700
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,108
- You wouldn't know how to get there?
- Follow the EAC.

701
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,777
That's East Australian Current.

702
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,947
Big current. You can't miss it.
It's in

703
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,490
that direction.

704
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,118
Then you got to follow
that for about...

705
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,954
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

706
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,124
That baby's going to float
you right past Sydney.

707
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,709
Great! That's great!

708
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,836
- Dory, you did it.
- Oh, please.

709
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,130
I'm just your little helper.
Helping along.

710
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,465
- Fellas, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

711
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,010
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

712
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,179
You guys! You really nailed him.
Bye.

713
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,848
- Ma'am. One more thing.
- Yes?

714
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,560
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

715
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,730
Trench. Through it. Not over it.
I'll remember.

716
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,064
Hey!

717
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,776
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

718
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,697
Wait. I've got to tell
you something. Whoa.

719
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,367
Nice trench.

720
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,830
Hello!

721
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,003
- Let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

722
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,049
- We're going to swim over this thing.
- Little red flag going up.

723
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,177
Something's telling me we
should swim through it.

724
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,388
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

725
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,266
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

726
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,477
I'm done talking about this.
Over we go.

727
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,978
Come on. Trust me on this.

728
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,439
- Trust you?
- Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

729
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,941
- Something shiny!
- Where?

730
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,986
- It just swam over the trench. Come on.
- Okay.

731
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,952
- Boy, it sure is clear up here.
- Exactly.

732
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,245
And look at that.

733
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,624
There's the current. We
should be there in no time.

734
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:14,211
- Hey, little guy.
- You wanted to go through the trench.

735
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:18,715
I shall call him Squishy and he
shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

736
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,842
Come here, little Squishy.

737
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,932
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy.

738
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,391
Shoo! Get away.

739
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,352
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it.

740
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,896
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

741
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,856
How come it didn't sting you?

742
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,400
It did. Hold still.

743
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:42,739
I live in this anemone and I'm used
to these kind of stings. Come here.

744
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,866
You're going to be fine.

745
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:48,245
But now we know that we don't
want to touch these again.

746
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,872
Let's be thankful it
was just a little one.

747
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,502
Don't move.

748
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,631
This is bad, Dory.

749
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,885
- Boing. Boing.
- Dory!

750
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,637
You can't catch me.

751
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,348
Don't bounce on the tops.
They will

752
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,267
not sting you!

753
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,687
- The tops don't sting you.
- Two in a row. Beat that.

754
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,397
Listen to me. I have an idea.

755
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,274
- A game.
- A game?

756
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,025
I love games. Pick me.

757
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,655
Here's the game. Whoever can hop the
fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

758
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,282
- Okay!
- Rules.

759
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,868
Don't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

760
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,538
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

761
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,416
Wait!

762
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,543
Go faster if you want to win.

763
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,045
- Dory!
- Boing, boing, boing!

764
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,090
Wait a minute.

765
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,303
So, we're cheating death now.

766
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,972
We're having fun
at the same time.

767
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,765
I can do this. Just be careful.

768
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,517
Careful I don't make
you cry when I win.

769
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,060
I don't think so!

770
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,734
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

771
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,278
- The question is, are you hungry?
- Hungry?

772
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,864
Yeah. 'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

773
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,492
Duck to the left, back and
coming over, right there!

774
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,372
The clownfish is the winner!

775
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,917
We did it. Look at us!

776
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,251
Dory?

777
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,755
Oh, no.

778
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,052
Dory! Dory! Dory!

779
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,514
Dory!

780
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,521
Am I disqualified?

781
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,690
You're doing fine.
You're winning.

782
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,526
Stay awake. Where does P.
Sherman live?

783
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,780
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

784
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,323
That's it!

785
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,621
Stay awake. Stay awake.
Stay awake.

786
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,916
Stay awake!

787
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,047
- Awake...
- P. Sherman...

788
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,259
- Awake...
- 42 Wallaby Way...

789
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,011
- Wake up.
- Sydney.

790
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,137
Nemo...

791
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,697
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

792
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:29,906
Yeah.

793
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,868
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

794
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,121
He's not looking for me.

795
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,290
He's scared of the ocean.

796
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,167
Peach? Any movement?

797
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,920
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

798
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,672
Keep on him.

799
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,136
My first escape, landed
on dental tools.

800
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,596
- I was aiming for the toilet.
- The toilet?

801
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,558
All drains lead to
the ocean, kid.

802
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,644
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

803
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:04,774
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

804
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,943
The bubbles, the bubbles!

805
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:11,114
Potty break! He just grabbed the
Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

806
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,782
That's your cue.

807
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,243
- You can do it, kid.
- We got to be quick.

808
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:19,622
Once you get in, swim to the bottom
and I'll talk you through the rest.

809
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,707
Okay.

810
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,168
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

811
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,970
- Nicely done. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

812
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,972
Here comes the pebble.

813
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,690
Now, do you see a small opening?

814
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,902
Okay. Inside it you'll
see a rotating fan.

815
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:53,406
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

816
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,329
Careful, Sharkbait.

817
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,082
- I can't do it.
- This isn't a good idea.

818
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,875
He'll be fine. Try again!

819
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,543
Okay.

820
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,297
That's it, Sharkbait.

821
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,633
Nice and steady.

822
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,097
- I got it, I got it!
- He did it.

823
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,392
That's great, kid. Now
swim up the tube and out.

824
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,953
Oh, no! Gill!

825
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,956
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

826
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,541
- Help him!
- What do we do?

827
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,502
- Oh, no!
- Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

828
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,173
- Help me!
- Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

829
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,886
No!

830
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,888
- Feed me more.
- That's it!

831
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,099
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

832
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,686
- I got it.
- Pull!

833
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,821
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

834
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,659
No. We're done.

835
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,886
Dude?

836
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,472
Focus, dude.

837
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,515
Dude?

838
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,810
He lives. Hey, dude.

839
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,524
- What happened?
- I saw the whole thing, dude.

840
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,028
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

841
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,323
- Then you were, like, whoa...
- What are you talking about?

842
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:05,288
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

843
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,581
Awesome.

844
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,541
Oh, my stomach.

845
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,420
Man, no hurling on the shell.
I just waxed it.

846
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,966
- So, Mr Turtle...
- Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

847
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,551
Name's Crush.

848
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,637
Crush? Really?

849
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,472
Okay, Crush.

850
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,934
Listen, I need to get to the
East Australian Current.

851
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,477
EAC?

852
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,103
Dude...

853
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,356
You're riding it, dude.

854
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,233
Check it out.

855
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,714
Okay, grab shell, dude.

856
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,008
Grab what?

857
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,520
Righteous! Righteous!

858
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,985
So,

859
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,573
what brings you on this
fine day to the EAC?

860
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,659
Well, Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

861
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,953
Dory! Is she all right?

862
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,581
Oh, little blue.

863
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:30,832
She is sub-level, dude.

864
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,046
Dory, Dory! Dory!

865
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,215
Oh, Dory.

866
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,803
I'm so sorry.

867
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,348
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

868
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,435
...twenty-nine, 30! Ready
or not, here I come!

869
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,272
There you are.

870
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,482
Catch me if you can.

871
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,286
Up you go!

872
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,089
Oh, my goodness.

873
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:24,260
Kill the motor, dude. Let us see
what Squirt does flying solo.

874
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,897
Whoa! That was so cool.

875
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,775
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

876
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:43,029
- Did you see what I did?
- You so totally rock, Squirt.

877
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,781
Give me some fin.

878
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,948
Noggin.

879
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,367
Dude.

880
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:52,872
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

881
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,417
- Jellies? Sweet.
- Totally.

882
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,712
I must have done something
you all liked, dudes.

883
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,381
You rock, dude.

884
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,009
Curl away, my son.

885
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,969
It's awesome, Jellyman.

886
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,431
When the little dudes are eggs we
leave them on a beach to hatch,

887
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,477
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find their
way back to the big ol' blue.

888
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,646
- All by themselves?
- Yeah!

889
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,649
But, dude, how do you
know when they're ready?

890
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,903
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

891
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,327
- Hey, look, everybody.
- I know that dude.

892
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,704
It's the Jellyman.

893
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,207
- Well go on. Jump on him.
- Turtle pile!

894
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,000
Wait. Kids!

895
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,961
- You funny?
- Where's your shell?

896
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,338
- Do your stripes come off?
- I need to breathe.

897
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,632
Did you cross the
jellyfish forest?

898
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:47,719
- One at a time.
- Mr Fish, did you die?

899
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,929
Sorry. I was vague
on the details.

900
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,516
- So where are you going?
- You see, my son was taken.

901
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,852
My son was taken away from me.

902
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:58,646
- No way!
- What happened?

903
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,691
No, kids. I don't want
to talk about it.

904
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,277
- Come on.
- Please.

905
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,696
Well, okay.

906
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,992
I live on this reef, a
long way from here.

907
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,327
This is going to be good.
I can tell.

908
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:17,540
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

909
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,960
Maybe he wouldn't have done it if
I hadn't been so tough on him.

910
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,378
I don't know.

911
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,881
He swam in the open
water to this boat

912
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,426
and these divers appeared
and I tried to stop them.

913
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,387
The boat was too fast, so
we swam out in the ocean...

914
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,638
He couldn't stop them.

915
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,516
Then Nemo's dad, he
swims out to the ocean

916
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,852
and they bump into three sharks.

917
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,354
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

918
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,149
- That's amazing.
- Then dives thousands of feet...

919
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,403
Straight into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

920
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,947
The only thing they can
see down there is...

921
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:53,743
This big, horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

922
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,328
Then he has to blast his way...

923
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,372
These fish have been
searching the ocean for days

924
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,249
on the East Australian Current.

925
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,376
He may be on his way
here right now.

926
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,086
That should put him
in Sydney Harbour...

927
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,546
In a few days.

928
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,590
This guy will stop at nothing...

929
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,468
...stop at nothing until he finds his son.
I hope he makes it.

930
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,387
That's one dedicated
father, if you ask me.

931
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,522
Mine. Mine. Mine.

932
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,364
Would you just shut up?

933
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:35,243
- You're rats with wings.
- This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

934
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,996
- He was taken off the reef by divers...
- There. Take it.

935
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,625
Say that again. You said
something about Nemo.

936
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,418
Mine. Mine. Mine.

937
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,214
Mine.

938
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,467
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbour.

939
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:52,885
Brilliant!

940
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,067
Is he doing okay?

941
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,404
I don't know, but whatever you
do, don't mention D-A-R...

942
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,532
It's okay. I know who
you're talking about.

943
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:27,545
Gill?

944
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,256
Hey, Sharkbait.

945
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,719
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

946
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:40,224
I was so ready to get out, so
ready to taste that ocean,

947
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,603
I was willing to put you in
harm's way to get there.

948
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:47,106
Nothing should be worth that.

949
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,943
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

950
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,241
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

951
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,452
What the...

952
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,121
Well, that's one way
to pull a tooth.

953
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:08,628
Darn kids. Well, good thing
I pulled the right one, eh?

954
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,173
Nigel, you just
missed an extraction.

955
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,967
Has he loosened the
periodontal ligament yet?

956
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,219
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

957
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,930
I've got to speak with him.

958
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,058
Your dad's been fighting
the ocean looking for you.

959
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,143
My father? Really?

960
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,062
He's travelled
hundreds of miles.

961
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,357
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish.
- Sharks?

962
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,360
- That can't be him.
- Are you sure? What was his name?

963
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,445
Some sort of sport fish.
Tuna? Trout?

964
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,113
- Marlin?
- That's it.

965
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,784
- The clownfish from the reef.
- It's my dad! He took on a shark!

966
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,870
- I heard he took on three.
- Three?

967
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,247
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

968
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,500
After you were taken
by Diver Dan,

969
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,585
your dad followed the
boat like a maniac.

970
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,836
Really?

971
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:54,507
He's giving it all he's got and
then three sharks capture him.

972
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,385
He blows 'em up and then
dives thousands of feet

973
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,929
and gets chased by a
monster with huge teeth!

974
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,556
He ties this demon to a rock.
And his reward?

975
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,017
He gets to battle a
jellyfish forest.

976
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,229
Now he's with sea turtles on
the East Australian Current

977
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,774
and the word is he's headed
this way, right now, to Sydney!

978
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,861
- What a good daddy.
- He was looking for you after all.

979
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,451
- He's swimming in the filter!
- Not again!

980
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:25,705
Sharkbait!

981
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,042
- No!
- You've got your life ahead of you.

982
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,044
- We'll help you.
- Get him out.

983
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,386
- Get him out of there.
- Come on. Grab the end.

984
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,389
Are you okay?

985
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,475
Can you hear me, Sharkbait?
Nemo? Can you hear me?

986
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,019
Yeah, I can hear you.

987
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,730
Sharkbait, you did it!

988
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,733
Sharkbait, you're...
Covered with germs!

989
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,693
That took guts.

990
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,947
All right, we have less than 48
hours before Darla gets here.

991
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,074
This tank will get plenty
dirty in that time,

992
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,326
but we have to help it along.

993
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,871
- Jacques, no cleaning.
- I shall resist.

994
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,665
Everybody else, be as
gross as possible.

995
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,208
Think dirty thoughts.

996
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,879
We're going to make this tank so filthy,
the dentist'll have to clean it.

997
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:16,797
Good work.

998
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,183
All right, we're here, dudes.

999
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,061
Get ready! Your exit's
coming up, man.

1000
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:33,731
- Where? I don't see it.
- Right there. I see it. I see it.

1001
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:38,569
- You mean the swirling vortex of terror?
- That's it, dude.

1002
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,531
- Of course it is.
- First, find your exit buddy.

1003
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,786
- Do you have your exit buddy?
- Yes.

1004
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,333
Squirt here will now give you a
rundown on proper exiting technique.

1005
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,503
Good afternoon. We're going
to have a great jump today.

1006
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,715
Crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1007
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,718
There's a screaming bottom
turn, so watch out.

1008
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,554
Remember, rip it,
roll it and punch it!

1009
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,225
It's like he's trying to
speak to me, I know it.

1010
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:14,021
You're really cute, but I don't know what
you're saying. Say the first thing again.

1011
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,066
Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!

1012
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,659
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1013
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,998
That was fun.

1014
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,292
I actually enjoyed that.

1015
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,836
Hey, look! Turtles.

1016
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,755
Most excellent.

1017
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:45,386
Now, turn your fishy tails round and
swim straight on through to Sydney.

1018
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,054
No worries, man.

1019
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,682
No worries. Thank
you, Dude Crush.

1020
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,976
- Bye.
- See you, Jellyman.

1021
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,395
Tell your little dude
I said hi, okay?

1022
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,022
- See ya later, dudes.
- Bye, everyone.

1023
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:59,692
Nemo would have loved this.

1024
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:04,405
Hey, Crush. I forgot.
How old are you?

1025
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,490
150, dude!

1026
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,285
And still young. Rock on!

1027
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,663
150. I got to remember that.

1028
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,040
Whoa.

1029
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,922
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1030
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,883
P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1031
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,009
Yep.

1032
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,554
We're going to just
swim straight.

1033
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,932
Just keep swimming

1034
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,434
Dory...

1035
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,279
Boy, this is taking a while.

1036
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,907
- Hey, how about we play a game?
- Okay.

1037
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,327
Okay, I'm thinking
of something orange.

1038
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,204
- And it's small...
- It's me.

1039
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,330
Right.

1040
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:58,792
This one you'll never guess.
It's orange and small.

1041
01:03:58,877 --> 01:03:59,877
It's me.

1042
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,837
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

1043
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:05,174
It's orange and small
and white stripes...

1044
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,384
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1045
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,677
Okay. That's just scary.

1046
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,847
Wait. I've seen this
floating speck before.

1047
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,516
That means we've passed it.

1048
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,894
That means we're not
going straight.

1049
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,939
We got to get to the surface.
We'll figure it out there.

1050
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,190
- Hey!
- What?

1051
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,567
Relax. Take a deep breath.

1052
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,698
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1053
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,243
Fine. Who? The speck?
There's nobody here!

1054
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,787
There has to be someone.
It's the ocean.

1055
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,539
We're not the only two in here.
Let's see...

1056
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,416
Okay, no one there.

1057
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,001
Nope.

1058
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:47,508
- There's somebody. Hey, excu...
- Dory!

1059
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,052
I'm thinking of
something mysterious.

1060
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:54,306
It's a fish we don't know, and if we
ask it directions, it could ingest us.

1061
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,892
What is it with men and
asking for directions?

1062
01:04:56,977 --> 01:05:00,562
Don't play the gender card. Let's
play the "let's not die" card.

1063
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,606
- Want to get out of here?
- Of course.

1064
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:06,735
How are we going to do that unless we
give it a shot and hope for the best?

1065
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,905
- You don't fully understand.
- Trust me on this.

1066
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,332
All right.

1067
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,129
Excuse me? Little fella?

1068
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:27,548
Hello.

1069
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,466
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1070
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,176
Hello.

1071
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,595
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1072
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,931
- ...was taken to...
- Sydney.

1073
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,349
Sydney, yes.

1074
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:41,228
It's really important that we
get there as fast as we can.

1075
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,063
Can you help us out?

1076
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,692
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1077
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,945
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1078
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,324
I don't think that's
a little fella.

1079
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:58,162
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

1080
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,372
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1081
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,293
We need

1082
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,588
to find his son.

1083
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,466
What are you doing? Are
you sure you speak whale?

1084
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,510
Can you give us...

1085
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,638
- Heaven knows what you're saying.
- ...directions?

1086
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:20,059
- See, he's swimming away.
- Come back.

1087
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,769
You've offended him.

1088
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,395
Maybe a different dialect.

1089
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,902
This is not whale. You're
speaking, like, upset stomach.

1090
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,696
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- No, don't.

1091
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,909
- You sound sick.
- Maybe louder, huh?

1092
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,911
- Don't do that.
- Too much orca.

1093
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:43,791
- Didn't that sound a little orca-ish?
- It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1094
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,920
Just as well. He
might be hungry.

1095
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,006
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1096
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,717
- Swim away!
- Look. Krill!

1097
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,264
Move, Dory! Move!

1098
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,482
Look at that. Would
you look at that?

1099
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,860
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1100
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:15,364
And it's all thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1101
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,366
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1102
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,534
I am ashamed.

1103
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,078
Look. Scum angel.

1104
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,960
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

1105
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:33,424
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

1106
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,634
9:00, and cue dentist.

1107
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,303
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1108
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,597
Okay. Here we go.

1109
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,349
Little Davey Reynolds.

1110
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:46,687
- Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
- Bloat, that's disgusting.

1111
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,106
Tastes pretty good to me.

1112
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,985
Don't you realise we are
swimming in our own...

1113
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,571
- Here he comes.
- What the...

1114
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:58,949
Crikey. What a state.

1115
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:06,081
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1116
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,041
- 10:00, love.
- Leave it open.

1117
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:11,628
I've got to clean the fish
tank before Darla gets here.

1118
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:16,592
- You hear that, Sharkbait?
- Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

1119
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,552
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

1120
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,554
Ready to see your dad?

1121
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,763
Course you are.

1122
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:27,686
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there
in the harbour waiting for you right now.

1123
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,855
Yeah.

1124
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:49,518
Here comes a big one! Come on.
You got to try this.

1125
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:53,188
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1126
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,066
- We're in a whale. Don't you get it?
- A whale?

1127
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:00,112
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help.
And now we're stuck here.

1128
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,449
- A whale? You know, I speak whale.
- You're insane. You can't speak whale.

1129
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,369
I have to get out. I
have to find my son.

1130
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:13,125
I have to tell him how
old sea turtles are!

1131
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,137
Hey.

1132
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,057
You okay?

1133
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,357
There, there.

1134
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,068
It's all right. It'll be okay.

1135
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,613
No. It won't.

1136
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:44,990
Sure it will. You'll see.

1137
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,661
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1138
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,000
That's a funny thing to promise.

1139
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,084
What?

1140
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,670
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1141
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,340
Then nothing would
ever happen to him.

1142
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,178
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1143
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,316
- What's going on?
- Don't know. I'll ask him.

1144
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,780
- What's...
- Dory.

1145
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,533
On?

1146
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:37,417
- I think he says we've stopped.
- Of course we've stopped.

1147
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:41,213
Stop trying to speak whale. You're
going to make things worse.

1148
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,048
What is that noise?

1149
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,595
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1150
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,558
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1151
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,816
- Really? You sure about that?
- Look. Already it's half-empty.

1152
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,945
- I'd say it's half-full.
- Stop that. It's half-empty!

1153
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,742
Okay, that one was
a little tougher.

1154
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,745
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat

1155
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,997
or he wants a root beer float.

1156
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:19,793
Of course he wants us to go there.
That's eating us!

1157
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,587
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1158
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,756
Tell him I'm not
interested in being lunch.

1159
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,259
- Okay. He's...
- Stop talking to him.

1160
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,727
- What is going on?
- I'll check. What...

1161
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,438
No. No more whale. You
can't speak whale.

1162
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,106
Yes, I can.

1163
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,190
No, you can't.

1164
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,777
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo.

1165
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,617
- Okay.
- Dory!

1166
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,458
He says it's time to let go.

1167
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,835
Everything's going
to be all right.

1168
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,879
How do you know?

1169
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,298
How do you know something
bad isn't going to happen?

1170
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,216
I don't!

1171
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,575
We're alive!

1172
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,370
Look. Syd-ney.

1173
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,414
Sydney! Sydney.

1174
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,999
Sydney again.

1175
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,336
You were right. We made it!

1176
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,088
We're going to find my son.

1177
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,179
Thank you, sir.

1178
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,306
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1179
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,600
Now we find the
boat that took him.

1180
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:01,478
- Right.
- Come on. We can do this!

1181
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,788
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

1182
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:24,543
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the
tank is clean and we are getting out of...

1183
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,169
The tank is clean.

1184
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,588
The tank is clean!

1185
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,882
But how?

1186
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,927
Boss must have installed
it while we were sleeping.

1187
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,513
- What are we going to do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1188
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,641
I can't hear you, Peach.

1189
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:44,062
The Aqua Scum 2003 is an all-purpose,
self-cleaning salt-water purifier

1190
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,731
that extends the life
of your aquarium fish.

1191
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:47,899
Stop it!

1192
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:51,862
The Aqua Scum is programmed to
scan your tank every five minutes?

1193
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,655
Scan? What does that mean?

1194
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,746
Temperature 82 degrees,
pH balance normal.

1195
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,249
Nice.

1196
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:09,004
Curse you, Aqua Scum!

1197
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,424
- That's it for the escape plan.
- Then what are we going to do about...

1198
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,384
Darla!

1199
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,261
Stay down, kid.

1200
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,182
- False alarm.
- My nerves can't take much more.

1201
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,019
What are we going to do
when that brat gets here?

1202
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,771
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Help!

1203
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,773
- Help me!
- Hold on. I'm coming.

1204
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,941
Help me!

1205
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,861
Swim down! Come on, kid.
Swim down!

1206
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,322
- Everybody jump in.
- Swim down!

1207
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,865
What the...

1208
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:38,950
Good work.

1209
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,786
- Gill!
- Sharkbait!

1210
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:46,458
- Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!
- Go to the window.

1211
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,340
That would have
been a nasty fall.

1212
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,384
- I don't want to go belly-up!
- Calm down, Nemo.

1213
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,720
You won't go belly-up.
I promise.

1214
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,804
You're going to be okay.

1215
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,060
Darla!

1216
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,692
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1217
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,986
No, but the boat has to be here.

1218
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,114
- We're going to find it.
- I'm totally excited.

1219
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,742
- Are you excited?
- Dory, wake up. Come on.

1220
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,786
Duck!

1221
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,456
That's not a duck.
It's a pelican!

1222
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,677
No! I didn't come this
far to be breakfast.

1223
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,187
Hey, Nigel. Would
you look at that?

1224
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,271
What?

1225
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,650
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1226
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,903
Yeah. Reckon somebody ought
to help the poor guy.

1227
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:01,491
Well, don't everybody
fly off at once!

1228
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,663
All right, Gerald. What is it?

1229
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,540
Fish got your tongue?

1230
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,500
Love a duck!

1231
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,252
I've got to find my son Nemo.

1232
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,004
Nemo?

1233
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:18,008
He's that fish that's been
fighting the whole ocean.

1234
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:20,427
Hey, I know where your son...

1235
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,805
Wait. Come back.

1236
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,391
- Stop!
- Keep going. He's crazy.

1237
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,768
I've got something to tell you.

1238
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,773
Mine.

1239
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:42,073
Okay. Don't make
any sudden moves.

1240
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,702
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1241
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,914
Hop into your mouth? And how
does that make me live?

1242
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:54,169
- Mine?
- Because I can take you to your son.

1243
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:55,587
Yeah, right!

1244
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,050
No. I know your son. He's orange.
He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

1245
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,427
- That's Nemo!
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1246
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,515
Fasten your seat belts!

1247
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,810
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1248
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:31,456
Everybody hold on!

1249
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,337
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1250
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,054
Too loud. Too loud for me.

1251
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,348
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

1252
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:51,184
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place!

1253
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,479
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1254
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,150
All right. Let's see
those pearly whites.

1255
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,236
I'm a piranha.

1256
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,904
They're in the Amazon.

1257
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,491
And a piranha's a fish.
Just like your present.

1258
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,911
- I got a fishy!
- Oh, no.

1259
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,455
Poor little guy.

1260
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,374
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1261
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,126
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1262
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:20,046
Must have left your present in the
car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

1263
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,631
He's still alive!

1264
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,383
Why is he playing dead?

1265
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,218
He's going to get flushed
down the toilet.

1266
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,762
He's going to get out of here.

1267
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,766
- What a smart little guy.
- No, not the trash can!

1268
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,061
Hey! I found his dad.

1269
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,729
- Where's Nemo?
- Dentist!

1270
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,523
- He's over there.
- What's a dentist?

1271
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,193
- Get in there.
- I can't go in there.

1272
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,697
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

1273
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,533
What the...

1274
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,495
Darla, sweetie, look out.

1275
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,127
Hold still. Easy, easy.

1276
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,005
Hold still!

1277
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,882
It's all right. Nobody's
going to hurt you.

1278
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:13,975
Nemo.

1279
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,060
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gotcha!

1280
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:19,606
- Nemo!
- Daddy?

1281
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:23,067
Out with you. And stay out!

1282
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,404
- Daddy?
- Fishy?

1283
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,323
Fishy!

1284
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,116
Wake up! Wake up!

1285
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:31,659
- Oh, no!
- To the top

1286
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,328
of Mount Wannahockaloogie.

1287
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,705
Why are you sleeping?

1288
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,166
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1289
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:43,254
Ring of Fire!

1290
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,591
Fishy!

1291
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,511
- Get it out!
- Crikey!

1292
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,263
The animals have gone mad!

1293
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,351
Get it out!

1294
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,394
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1295
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,438
There's a fish in my hair!

1296
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,274
- Gill.
- Sharkbait.

1297
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,236
Tell your dad I said hi.

1298
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,034
Go get him.

1299
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:19,415
He did it!

1300
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,377
- I'm happy.
- Is he going to be okay?

1301
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,255
Don't worry. All drains
lead to the ocean.

1302
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:26,798
Fishy!

1303
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,307
Daddy!

1304
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,721
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1305
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,974
Truly I am.

1306
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,618
- Hey...
- Dory.

1307
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:42,707
If it wasn't for you, I never
would have even made it here.

1308
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,084
So thank you.

1309
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,796
Hey, wait a minute.

1310
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,632
Wait. Where are you going?

1311
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,594
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1312
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,097
Nemo's gone.

1313
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,099
I'm going home now.

1314
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,268
No. No, you can't.

1315
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,396
Stop!

1316
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:10,610
Please don't go away. Please?

1317
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:14,072
No one's ever stuck with
me for so long before.

1318
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,991
And if you leave...

1319
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:20,578
I remember things better with you.
Look.

1320
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,914
P. Sherman, 42...

1321
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,666
42...

1322
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,379
I remember it. It's there.
I know it is.

1323
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,048
Because when I look at
you, I can feel it.

1324
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,467
And I look at you and I...

1325
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,553
I'm home.

1326
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:43,434
Please. I don't want
that to go away.

1327
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,437
I don't want to forget.

1328
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,024
I'm sorry, Dory,

1329
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,609
but I do.

1330
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:06,833
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life.

1331
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,085
Hey!

1332
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,130
- This is our spot.
- Go on. Get out of here.

1333
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,967
Hey, hey, hey.

1334
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,718
Yeah, that's it.

1335
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,638
Too right, mate!

1336
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,348
I got a live one here!

1337
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,892
- Have you seen my dad?
- Gotcha!

1338
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,562
- Come back here.
- You let him go!

1339
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:35,987
Dad!

1340
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,405
No!

1341
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,462
- Excuse me.
- No.

1342
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,964
- Are you all right?
- I don't know where I am.

1343
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,467
I don't know what's going on.
I think I lost somebody,

1344
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:59,260
but I can't remember.

1345
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,762
- It's okay.
- I can't remember.

1346
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,475
I'm looking for someone, too.
We can look together.

1347
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,978
- I'm Dory.
- I'm Nemo.

1348
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,521
Nemo?

1349
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,440
That's a nice name.

1350
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,576
- Dad!
- Dad!

1351
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,244
- Dad.
- Dad.

1352
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:26,913
Wait a minute. Is it
your dad or my dad?

1353
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,122
My dad.

1354
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:30,124
- Got it. Dad!
- Where are we anyway?

1355
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,417
Dad!

1356
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,587
Syl... Schai...

1357
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,088
Sydney.

1358
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,758
P. Sherman, 42
Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1359
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,969
- Nemo!
- What?

1360
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,679
It's you! Nemo!

1361
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,389
Yes. I'm Nemo.

1362
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,226
You're Nemo. You were dead.
I saw you.

1363
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,645
And then... Here you are.
You're not dead.

1364
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,147
And your father... Your father!

1365
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:56,150
My father? You know my father?
Where is he?

1366
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:57,985
He went this way. Quick!

1367
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:00,655
Hey!

1368
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,740
Have you seen an
orange fish swim by?

1369
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,825
- It looks like him.
- But bigger.

1370
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,620
I saw him, but I'm not
telling you where he went.

1371
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,165
And there's no way
you're going to make me.

1372
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,877
Mine.

1373
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:17,296
All right. I'll talk!

1374
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,924
He went to the fishing grounds.

1375
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,556
- Hey, look out.
- Sorry.

1376
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,432
I'm just trying to get home.

1377
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,187
Daddy!

1378
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,023
- Nemo?
- Daddy!

1379
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,191
Nemo?

1380
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,110
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1381
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,444
Dory?

1382
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,321
- Nemo!
- Daddy!

1383
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:45,783
- Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!
- Dad!

1384
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,411
Nemo! Thank goodness.

1385
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,330
It's all right, son.
It's going to be okay.

1386
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,125
Turn around! You're
going the wrong way.

1387
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,755
- Look out!
- Move!

1388
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,653
- Dory!
- Come on.

1389
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,407
Help! Get us out!

1390
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,493
No, no, no! Dory!

1391
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,746
- Dad, I know what to do.
- Nemo, no!

1392
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,582
We have to tell all the
fish to swim down together.

1393
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,917
- Get out of there.
- This will work.

1394
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,295
No, I am not going
to lose you again.

1395
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,757
There's no time. It's the
only way we can save Dory.

1396
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,509
I can do this!

1397
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:50,681
You're right. I know you can.

1398
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:54,101
- Lucky fin.
- Now, go. Hurry!

1399
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,479
Tell all the fish to swim down.

1400
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:59,857
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

1401
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,946
- Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
- Swim down together.

1402
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,240
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1403
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:10,117
Swim down!

1404
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:18,292
- Everybody swim down.
- Come on. You have to swim down.

1405
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:21,045
Down! Swim down!

1406
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:26,759
Swim down! Swim down!

1407
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,936
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1408
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,897
Just keep swimming!

1409
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,236
That's it!

1410
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,157
It's working!

1411
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,122
Keep swimming!

1412
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,749
Just keep swimming!

1413
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,043
- Come on, Dad!
- You're doing great, son.

1414
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,462
- That's my dad.
- Let's get to the bottom.

1415
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,757
Just keep swimming

1416
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,968
Almost there. Keep swimming!

1417
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:17,309
Keep swimming!

1418
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,864
Hey!

1419
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,449
Where's Nemo?

1420
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:32,908
There!

1421
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,455
Oh, no. Nemo!

1422
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:48,382
Nemo?

1423
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:53,137
It's okay. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1424
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,811
- Daddy?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1425
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,646
Daddy...

1426
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:05,483
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1427
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,986
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1428
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,748
Hey, guess what?

1429
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,209
- What?
- Sea turtles...

1430
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,169
I met one.

1431
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:29,048
And he was 150 years old.

1432
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,091
150?

1433
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,676
Yep.

1434
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:37,431
'Cause Sandy Plankton said
they only lived to be 100.

1435
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:39,850
Sandy Plankton?

1436
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:43,771
Think I would cross the ocean and
not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1437
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,607
He was 150! Not 100.

1438
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:50,027
Who is this Sandy Plankton
that knows everything wrong?

1439
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,699
Time for school! Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1440
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,495
- I'm going to win.
- No, you're not.

1441
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,123
- I did it.
- My own son beats me.

1442
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,251
Climb aboard, explorers.

1443
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:08,629
So then the sea cucumber looks
over at the mollusk and says,

1444
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,215
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1445
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,261
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1446
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,681
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the EAC, dude.

1447
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:21,058
- Sweet.
- Totally.

1448
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,688
Seriously, Marty, did you really
do all the things you say you did?

1449
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:27,064
Pardon me.

1450
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,024
Hello.

1451
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,111
Don't be alarmed.

1452
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,322
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1453
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:37,491
- Thanks.
- We'll see you next week.

1454
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:41,120
- Keep up with the programme, Dory.
- Remember, fish are friends.

1455
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,539
Not food! Bye!

1456
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,499
Hold on. Here we go.

1457
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:47,293
Next stop, knowledge.

1458
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,837
Bye, son. Have fun.

1459
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,046
Bye, Dad.

1460
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,425
Mr Ray, wait. I
forgot something.

1461
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:01,265
Love you, Dad.

1462
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,476
I love you, too, son.

1463
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:09,690
Dad? You can let go now.

1464
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,108
Sorry.

1465
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,319
Now go have an adventure.

1466
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,696
Goodbye. See you later, dudes!

1467
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,531
- Bye, Elmo.
- Nemo.

1468
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:21,118
- Nemo. Bye, Nemo.
- See you after school, Dory.

1469
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:23,287
Bye, Dad!

1470
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,290
Bye, son.

1471
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,392
Barbara.

1472
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:46,936
I don't understand it.

1473
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,314
Here this thing has a lifetime
guarantee and it breaks.

1474
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:54,985
Had to clean the tank myself, take
the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

1475
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,321
Where'd the fish go?

1476
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,079
Come on, Peach!

1477
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,623
You got it. That's it.
You can do it.

1478
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:09,959
That's the shortest red
light I've ever seen.

1479
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,794
Come on, Peach.

1480
01:33:21,680 --> 01:40:30,482
Now what?
