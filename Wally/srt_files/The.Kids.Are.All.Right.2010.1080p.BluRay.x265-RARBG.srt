1
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,573
24, 26.

2
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,782
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:25,078
Joni, there are so many
hotties in your class.

4
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:28,248
You are so gonna hook up
the first week.

5
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:31,186
Just because you're a 24-hour drive-thru
doesn't mean everyone else has to be.

6
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,043
Hey, she worked her ass off.

7
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:36,630
She deserves
some hot jock sausage.

8
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:38,341
Gross.
That's disgusting.

9
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,927
Why don't you guys just do it and
get it over with?

10
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,848
What? I'm just saying.

11
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,934
Maybe because we're friends.

12
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,730
B minus in geometry, dude.

13
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,065
This shit is the bomb.

14
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:01,613
Add that shit up.

15
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,824
Don't be such a bitch, dude.

16
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,745
Yeah.

17
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:16,253
Hey, ladies! Come on,
take it down a notch.

18
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,131
Hey! Hey!
What did I just say, huh?

19
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:23,344
Come here. Come here, big boy.
Let's see what you got.

20
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,761
Come on, get him!

21
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,847
Come on, what you got?
Let's see it. Come on.

22
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:30,476
Come on, Dad. Your pits smell
like burnt ass.

23
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,436
- Burnt ass?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,690
Get out of here.
Take it to his house.

25
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:55,333
Laser, cut it out.
That's driving me crazy.

26
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,685
I'm not doing anything.
Calm down.

27
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,294
You calm down.

28
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,920
Hi, guys.

29
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,214
Hey, babe.

30
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,216
Hey, Mom.
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,633
No, don't worry.
We just started.

32
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,386
Come on.
That's enough.

33
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,222
Oh, my God.
27 fibroids.

34
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,639
All in the lining.

35
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,932
That's disgusting.

36
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,934
Yeah.
We're eating.

37
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,729
Wow. Did they do that
laparoscopically?

38
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,148
That's right, smart girl.
We got them all.

39
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,817
Hey, whose truck is that?

40
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,235
Mine.

41
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:25,279
Yours?

42
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:26,905
Isn't it wicked?

43
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,284
For the business.

44
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,868
What business?

45
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,039
Oh, you mean the gardening?

46
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,833
Isn't it landscape design?

47
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,086
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,754
I got a great deal.
It was super cheap.

49
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,924
Okay. Do we have any
more of the Fiddlehead?

50
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,636
I don't know.
I didn't look, honey.

51
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,267
Hey, what's up?
Yo, what's up, dude?

52
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,120
Laser, no phone calls
at the table, all right?

53
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:59,270
Dude, I shaved my dog.

54
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,439
Are you still feeling it?

55
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:01,666
Yeah. Hey,
let me hit you back.

56
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,773
For sure.

57
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,275
Who's that?

58
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,777
That was nobody.
Just Clay.

59
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,990
Can I ask you something?

60
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:14,619
What do you get from your relationship
with Clay?

61
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,953
What do you mean "get"?

62
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,290
Well, we just feel like
he's a little untended.

63
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:23,544
Do you think he's the kind of person
who's gonna help you grow?

64
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:28,090
Hey, did you get started on those
thank-you notes for the birthday presents?

65
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,611
Mom, you're windshield wiping.
Come on.

66
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:30,967
Not yet, but I will.
Okay.

67
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,197
I just think it's better to knock them out
when it's fresh.

68
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,222
Yeah, I'll do them tonight.

69
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:38,309
I mean, you don't want to have to start with
an apology. You know?

70
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:39,644
Then it's embarrassing.

71
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:41,479
Mom, I know.

72
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,979
It's okay, honey.
She got it.

73
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,398
Let it go.

74
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:48,234
Okay. I'll let it go.

75
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,698
I mean, if it was up to you,

76
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,783
our kids wouldn't even write
thank-you notes.

77
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,826
You know, they'd just
send out good vibes.

78
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,370
That's not nice.

79
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,918
Do you believe our baby's 18?

80
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,378
No, I can't.

81
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,504
You big girl.

82
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,672
Such a big girl.

83
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,299
Big girl. Big girl.

84
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,550
Mom.
What?

85
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:15,803
Oh. Thank you.

86
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,437
What are you doing?

87
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:25,689
Writing my thank-you notes.

88
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,814
That's good.

89
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,710
You know, you don't have to start
with an apology.

90
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:29,752
Yeah, that'd be embarrassing.

91
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:30,859
That's terrible.

92
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:38,158
Hey, have you thought any more about
making that call?

93
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,994
Yeah, I don't want to.

94
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,080
How can you not even
be curious about it?

95
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:47,711
Look, I'm leaving soon, and I don't
want to have to deal with that right now.

96
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,087
Also, that could really
hurt Mom's feelings.

97
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,381
God, why do you have to worry about
them so much?

98
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,508
They don't even
have to know about it.

99
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:57,511
Look, you can do it
when you turn 18, okay?

100
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,472
I never ask you for anything.

101
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:11,525
I just don't understand
why you bought the truck now.

102
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,402
Because if I'm gonna
start this business,

103
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,903
I need something
to haul my equipment in.

104
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:19,324
Okay. It just seems a little
cart before the horse.

105
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,117
What does that mean?

106
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,747
Well, sweetie, you don't have
any clients yet.

107
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,830
You know,

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,334
you're the one who's always telling me
to act "as if."

109
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,839
That's true. I do.
You're right.

110
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:41,137
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's good you bought the truck.

111
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,390
It's proactive.
Yeah.

112
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,063
Hey, you wanna watch a movie?

113
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:53,524
A movie-movie?

114
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,277
Yeah. We haven't
done that in a while.

115
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,323
All right.

116
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,407
You know, I don't
like the guys in this one.

117
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:45,908
They're too shaved.

118
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,786
Don't focus on it.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,078
Okay.

120
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,346
Fuck. Oh, my God.

121
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,973
Hey, hey, I'm cold.

122
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,349
I can't breathe, honey.

123
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,475
Well...

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,601
Shit!

125
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,353
Shit!

126
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,650
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?

127
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,529
Oh, my God.

128
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,989
The whole neighborhood
heard that.

129
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,700
No, they didn't.

130
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:29,743
Shit.

131
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,662
That was a vibe kill.

132
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,634
Hey, hey, Brooke,
can you do me a favor?

133
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,468
Can you get that
Swiss chard for me?

134
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:48,846
Sure, no problem.

135
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,138
Thanks.

136
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,755
How are you?
Hey, Paul.

137
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,217
Hey, foxy.

138
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,097
Flapjack, you are smelling ripe.

139
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,223
Oh, sorry.

140
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,017
That's all right.
I kind of like it.

141
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,937
Oh, yeah?
It's earthy.

142
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,772
I've been out
in the garden hoeing.

143
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,752
How are we doing tonight?
It's gonna be tight.

144
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,651
Oh, really?

145
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,152
Go to work.

146
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,113
See you.

147
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:51,950
Hello?

148
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,784
Hi.
Is this Paul Hatfield?

149
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,828
Yes, it is. Who's this?

150
00:09:56,913 --> 00:10:01,040
My name is Wendy Mitner,
and I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank.

151
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,168
Okay, Wendy Mitner.
What can I do for you?

152
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,837
I just need to confirm that this is the same
Paul Hatfield

153
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:09,758
that donated sperm with us
between 1991 and 1993.

154
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:14,220
Yeah, I did a little bit
of that back then, sure.

155
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:17,390
Well, as you know, the Cryobank has a
confidentiality policy

156
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,685
which prohibits us
from releasing your identity

157
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,603
without your consent.

158
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,942
No... Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I knew that.

159
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,275
Well, we've been contacted

160
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,653
by a young woman
conceived using your donation,

161
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:34,490
and she's asked if you'd be open to
having contact with her.

162
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:40,998
Yeah, I'd be conceivably into something
like that. Yeah.

163
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:45,167
Great, Mr. Hatfield. I'll let her know and
get back in touch soon.

164
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,419
Thanks.

165
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,061
I mean, I was 19 years old.

166
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,564
It was, like, just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.

167
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,691
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.

168
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,817
Why not?

169
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,027
Well, I'd use it.

170
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,318
Oh, baby.

171
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:14,739
It's weird.

172
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:20,410
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of curious, I think.

173
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:22,287
Yeah?
Yeah.

174
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,372
So what are you gonna do?

175
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:25,697
I don't know.
What would you do?

176
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,417
I don't know.

177
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:28,585
You got to figure it out.

178
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,420
Yeah, no doubt.

179
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,507
All right, I got to go now.
All right.

180
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,218
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

181
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:41,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

182
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,807
So, drive safe.

183
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:56,570
M- E-R. "Zoomer."

184
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:57,739
No way.

185
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,823
That is so not a word.

186
00:11:58,908 --> 00:11:59,991
No, it totally is.

187
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,552
That's not a word.
If you're gonna zoom somewhere,

188
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:03,177
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.

189
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:05,473
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...

190
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,580
Hello?

191
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,665
Hi.
I'm looking for Joni Allgood.

192
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,334
Yeah, this is she.

193
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:16,548
This is Paul, your donor.

194
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,925
Eleven points for Mommy.

195
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,510
Oh! Hi.

196
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:23,138
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.

197
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,390
Come back.

198
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,934
Is this a good time to talk?

199
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,894
Yeah. No,
this is great.

200
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:33,231
So, how are you?
How are you?

201
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,858
I'm good.
How are you?

202
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,234
I'm well, thanks.

203
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,155
Wendy at the Cryobank

204
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,616
was talking about maybe...

205
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:44,910
Oh, yeah. Well.

206
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:47,328
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd call you,

207
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,040
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15, which is,

208
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,084
you know, which is
too young to call.

209
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,585
Anyway, he'd like to meet you.

210
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,878
You know, if you want to.

211
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:58,090
Your brother?

212
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:01,259
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.

213
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:04,637
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...

214
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,264
With your...
With your sperm.

215
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,307
Like in both of them?

216
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,559
Yeah.

217
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:10,977
Like in two?

218
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:12,562
U h-huh. Like in gay.

219
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,107
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.

220
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,818
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...

221
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,486
I love lesbians.

222
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:25,158
Great.
So you wanna,

223
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:29,286
I don't know, get a bite to eat or
something? You and your brother?

224
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:40,297
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.

225
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:42,734
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations, all right?

226
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:46,303
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.

227
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:50,183
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.

228
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:54,102
Well, you know, if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.

229
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,283
Hello?

230
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:14,873
You're Joni, right?
Hi, I'm Joni.

231
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,685
I'm Paul. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

232
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,375
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.

233
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,128
Right on.
That's a very cool name.

234
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:21,378
Thanks.

235
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:22,713
Well...

236
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,548
Cool.

237
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:27,551
Yeah. Yeah.

238
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:31,639
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything, anything you want.

239
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,808
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.

240
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:43,192
Laser, do you have
any questions that you wanna ask?

241
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,360
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.

242
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,948
I didn't really have any, you know,
specific questions or anything, so...

243
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:50,074
Nothing?

244
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,243
Not really.

245
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,703
Well, I mean, I'd love to know more
about you guys.

246
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,580
Everything. I mean...

247
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,499
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?

248
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:05,047
I just graduated high school, and I'm
starting college in the fall, so...

249
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,589
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

250
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:07,758
Thanks.

251
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,759
Yeah,
Joni's the brains in the family.

252
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:12,637
She's got the National
Merit Scholarship for science.

253
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:14,056
Shut the front door.

254
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,431
Okay, Laser, thanks.

255
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,184
Wow.
I'm just telling him you're smart.

256
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,602
No, I just work harder than you.

257
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:23,690
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.

258
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:29,070
I mean, I didn't do well in school either,
and I'm not doing so badly now, right?

259
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,532
It's Laser. Yeah.

260
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:36,744
Sorry. Laser. Right.

261
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,121
It's cool.

262
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,707
So, what are you into, Laser?

263
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,417
Laser's an amazing athlete.

264
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,211
Really? Yeah?

265
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,755
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...

266
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,465
I did a little
B-ball in junior high.

267
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,927
That's cool.
Was that it or...

268
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,973
Well, the whole "team" thing just got
on my nerves after a while, you know?

269
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,516
It was like, "Hey, let's go kick some
ass, man!" And...

270
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,893
What about you?

271
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:07,441
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.

272
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,153
You know,
all the team sort of sports.

273
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,279
Hey, man,

274
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:14,072
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.

275
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:17,327
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.

276
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,745
I like teams.
They're cool.

277
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,788
Cool.

278
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,916
So this is your place, right?

279
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,710
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.

280
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,314
You know,
I've been working on it for a while.

281
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:33,091
I also have a little organic co-op farm just
up the street here.

282
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,510
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic

283
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,971
and simple, American food.

284
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:40,098
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.

285
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,767
Yeah?
You are?

286
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:45,728
Yeah, Laser.

287
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:50,108
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know, to buy local for ages.

288
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,322
All right.

289
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,326
We're just over here. There.
Right. Yeah.

290
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,035
Okay.

291
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,453
Is that your bike?

292
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,373
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?

293
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,376
Yeah, I love them,

294
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,795
but, you know, our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.

295
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,631
By "kind of" he means that they'd
kill us if we ever rode one, so...

296
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,424
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.

297
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,967
Yeah, I'm sure.

298
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:20,638
Cool.

299
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:21,847
Cool.
Yeah.

300
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,975
It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.

301
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,268
Nice to meet you, too.

302
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:27,812
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?

303
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:28,979
Yeah, for sure.

304
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:30,291
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.

305
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah, you too.

306
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,402
All right.
All right.

307
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:35,485
So long.

308
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:36,736
Bye.

309
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:37,946
Keep in touch.
Yeah.

310
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,448
Okay?
Yeah.

311
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,919
Wow. I just never pictured him
that way, you know?

312
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,381
He was so cool and interesting.

313
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,006
Yeah, he's all right.

314
00:17:58,551 --> 00:17:59,717
What do you mean "all right"?

315
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,347
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him so bad.

316
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,932
I know.

317
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,351
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?

318
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:09,769
I think he's all right.

319
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,563
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.

320
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,400
God.
What?

321
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,152
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.

322
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:19,237
We are so not telling Moms.

323
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,529
Why not?

324
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:21,822
Ha, ha. Very funny.

325
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:25,493
He wants to die!

326
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:27,870
He wants to die.

327
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,581
Remind me not to take
heroin in Morocco. Or Uganda.

328
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:33,959
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.

329
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:37,380
...it is now time to call it.

330
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:41,133
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!

331
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,636
Hey, bug, come here.

332
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:45,865
We're watching Locked Up Abroad.

333
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:46,972
I want my knife back!

334
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.

335
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,475
Where you going?

336
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,059
Clay's.

337
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,144
Don't be back late.

338
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:53,270
I know, I know, I know.

339
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,147
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.

340
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,231
Hugs.
Come on.

341
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,274
No, Mom.

342
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,276
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.

343
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:09,660
Maybe we should
just sit him down and ask him already.

344
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,663
What? "Are you
and Clay fucking?"

345
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:15,083
"Exploring" is a better word.

346
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:17,061
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are "exploring"?

347
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:19,505
This is the age for that.

348
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:20,796
We should be good with that.

349
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,006
We should. We should.

350
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,675
I just don't understand
why he's exploring with that loser.

351
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,095
We don't really know what's going on.
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

352
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,517
I feel like he has so much potential.
He's just wasting it.

353
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:36,646
What are you trying to say?

354
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,167
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?

355
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,859
I just, you know,
I feel like there's some subtext here.

356
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,024
What are you talking about?

357
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,196
You know,
"like mother, like son"?

358
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,784
Both of us wandering in the dark,
aimless, "wasting our potential."

359
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,080
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.

360
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,207
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

361
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,961
Well, you know, maybe it hasn't risen to
the plane of consciousness for you yet.

362
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:05,799
Yeah. Maybe.

363
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,015
Someone took my knife.

364
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,934
So what were they like?

365
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,019
They were really sweet kids.

366
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:23,942
The boy was this little, you know,
kind of sensitive jock-type kid,

367
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,736
and the girl was really innocent

368
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:31,408
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.

369
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:34,494
Sounds like you really liked them,
like you guys connected.

370
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:39,790
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.

371
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:43,169
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?

372
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:44,689
I mean, are you
gonna see them again?

373
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:45,921
I... Hey, Brooke.

374
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,382
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.

375
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:48,757
How you doing?
Good.

376
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:50,718
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.

377
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:51,802
They're just...

378
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:52,928
Aren't they beautiful?

379
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:54,680
I thought you should
have the first taste.

380
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,349
Thank you.

381
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:04,064
"I thought you should
have the first taste" of my pussy.

382
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:06,692
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:11,674
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.

384
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,699
Dude, hold up.

385
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,041
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.

386
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,294
Oh! Dude!

387
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:26,753
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.

388
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,963
It's alive, dude!

389
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:29,131
Put it back.

390
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:30,633
Fine, fine, fine.

391
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,884
Sweet!

392
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:36,012
Dude, we're watching this.

393
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:49,485
You think the whole
thing's like this?

394
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,986
Maybe...

395
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,322
Maybe we should fast forward.

396
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,926
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.

397
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,061
Laser, your mom and I accept and
love you unconditionally.

398
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,272
You know that, right?

399
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:29,482
Yeah.

400
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:34,027
Yeah. And you know that you can be
open with us about anything.

401
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,364
Yeah, I know.
Okay.

402
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:41,410
Laser, do you want to talk to us
about anything?

403
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,578
Like what?

404
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,746
Just anything.

405
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,498
You know, anything on your mind.

406
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:52,963
Well, there is something.
But it's more of a question, though.

407
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,214
That's okay.

408
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:56,258
We won't judge you.

409
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:01,471
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?

410
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:08,645
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch that movie.

411
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,895
Honey.

412
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,232
And, second,
I really don't appreciate

413
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:13,983
you snooping around
our room, okay?

414
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,943
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.

415
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,405
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again, I don't like him.

416
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,740
I know. I know.

417
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:21,658
Okay, he seems unstable.

418
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,618
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.

419
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,161
Do you want to answer
his question?

420
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:26,621
Yeah, okay.

421
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:32,209
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality is complicated.

422
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:36,589
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.

423
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:38,424
You know, for example,

424
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:42,219
because women's
sexual responsiveness is internalized,

425
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:46,348
sometimes it's exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized,

426
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:49,226
like with a...
Like with a penis.

427
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:52,248
Wouldn't you guys just rather
watch girls doing it, though?

428
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,773
Well, you would think that.

429
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,901
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight women to pretend,

430
00:23:57,985 --> 00:23:59,422
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.

431
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,029
Whoa, that's enough.

432
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,285
Laser, your mom and I sense

433
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:09,455
that there's some
other stuff going on in your life.

434
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,582
We just want to be let in.

435
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,124
What do you mean?

436
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:16,252
Are you having a relationship
with someone?

437
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:20,256
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand and support you.

438
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,384
Look, I only met him once.

439
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,720
What do you mean once?

440
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,055
Did he find you online?
Wait.

441
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:28,533
What?
Wait, wait, who did you meet once?

442
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:29,641
Paul. I met him with Joni.

443
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:30,725
Paul? Who's Paul?

444
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,685
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.

445
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,063
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?

446
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:36,606
Our sperm donor.

447
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,406
Did you guys think I was gay?

448
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:48,158
No.

449
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:49,410
No way.

450
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:51,161
Of course not.

451
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,498
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious

452
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:55,165
about your biological father.

453
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,502
I mean, it's completely natural.

454
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,461
But why didn't you tell us?

455
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,787
Because we knew you'd be upset.

456
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,632
We're not upset!
No, no, no.

457
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:05,844
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in the conversation.

458
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:07,052
That's all.

459
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,973
You know? But...
But you met him, and that's cool.

460
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:13,100
And now, we can move on.

461
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,020
Actually,
I want to see him again.

462
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:19,523
You do?

463
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:20,983
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

464
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:23,902
Well, no. Okay?
No way.

465
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:26,780
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.

466
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:35,497
I get it, okay? He's their biological
father and all that crap.

467
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:39,041
But it still feels
really shitty.

468
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:42,044
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?

469
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,673
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...

470
00:25:44,757 --> 00:25:47,926
I don't want to time-share
our kids with anybody.

471
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,054
Especially when it's Joni's last summer
at home.

472
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:53,347
No way.

473
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:59,812
Jesus, Jules!

474
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:03,566
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.

475
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:08,237
Look, we have to be
smart about this.

476
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:12,783
You know, if we act like grubby bitches,
we're just gonna make it worse.

477
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,577
I know.

478
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:18,581
Let's just kill him
with kindness and put it to bed.

479
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:20,416
I'm with you, honey.

480
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,210
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

481
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,673
I love you, chicken.

482
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,592
I love you, too, pony.

483
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:10,130
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. Hi. Yeah.

484
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,634
Great to meet you, too.

485
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:13,885
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.

486
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,637
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.

487
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,721
Hi.

488
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,472
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

489
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:21,141
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just weave through it.

490
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:22,476
Oh, great.

491
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,561
I brought you this.

492
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,040
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.

493
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,816
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.

494
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,651
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!

495
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,028
'86.

496
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:34,196
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.
All right.

497
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:42,287
Yeah. Wow.

498
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:44,164
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

499
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:45,351
You guys been here a long time?

500
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,084
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.

501
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,169
God, has it been
that long? I mean...

502
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:54,591
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.

503
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,135
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?

504
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,971
Good, how are you?
Good.

505
00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:00,848
Hey, man.
Hey.

506
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,306
What's up, man?

507
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:03,851
You okay?

508
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:06,603
Yeah. Yeah, great.

509
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:09,147
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.

510
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,233
Okay. Same goes for the micromanaging.
Okay?

511
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:20,700
So, Paul, did you
always know that...

512
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:21,784
Yes.

513
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,163
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?

514
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,291
I always liked food.

515
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,709
Oh, yeah.

516
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,004
No, I was asking because I remember
when I was reading your file,

517
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,631
back when we were looking for,

518
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:38,092
you know, sperm...

519
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,696
Can I have the potato
salad, babe? Sure.

520
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,514
Anyway, you said that you were studying
international relations.

521
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,810
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.

522
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:53,190
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out of school.

523
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,570
You dropped out of college?

524
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,363
Yeah, it just wasn't my thing.

525
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,282
No? Why's that?
I don't know.

526
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,786
It just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while, you know?

527
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,663
I was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas.

528
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,249
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.

529
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,755
Okay.

530
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,965
I'm not saying that, you know,

531
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,802
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.

532
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,262
You know, I think
college is great for some people.

533
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,931
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

534
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,934
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.

535
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,896
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess. Thank you.

536
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,690
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services industry.

537
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:37,943
Right.

538
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,112
Hey, Mom,
you see what he did there, right?

539
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,214
You said "food
services industry,"

540
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,489
so then he said
"food services industry."

541
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,366
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.

542
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,287
So, Paul, what about your...

543
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,832
What about your social life?

544
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,834
My social life?

545
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,461
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?

546
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,963
Mom.
What?

547
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,215
We're getting
to know Paul. It's okay.

548
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:07,054
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been married nor divorced.

549
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,180
I date sometimes,

550
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,267
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my restaurant right now.

551
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,315
Well, that's...
Yeah. Makes sense.

552
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,818
So, cheers.

553
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,360
Yeah. Cheers.

554
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:23,779
Excellent wine, by the way.

555
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:24,905
Thank you.

556
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,408
How old are you again?

557
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:31,494
You must be the
griller of the family.

558
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,913
Yeah.

559
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,170
No, that's okay.

560
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:40,295
I like to be positive.

561
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,421
Yeah.

562
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:42,630
So how'd you two meet?

563
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,092
We met at UCLA.

564
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,843
I was a resident,

565
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:50,889
and Jules had an emergency.

566
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:51,973
My tongue was numb.

567
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,518
Really? Your tongue?
Laser.

568
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,978
Oh, my God.

569
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,521
It's not nice.

570
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,816
No, that's not nice. I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.

571
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,582
What happened to your tongue?
I don't know.

572
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,864
I mean, I lost all the feeling in my face
and my tongue.

573
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:11,533
And then, you know, I got really nervous
'cause I thought that I was gonna gag

574
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,203
and, you know, maybe like...

575
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:14,704
Choke? Die?

576
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,039
Yeah, exactly.

577
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:17,164
What'd you do to help her?

578
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,249
I gave her a Valium,

579
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,627
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,

580
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:23,795
you know, move her tongue around.
Yeah.

581
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:26,109
Actually, she started teasing me,
and that really helped.

582
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,674
I was trying to distract you.

583
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,970
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.

584
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,223
You were really pretty.

585
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,558
And then, you know,
my tongue started working again.

586
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,062
Sure.
God, Mom, please.

587
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,068
Yeah.

588
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,630
Wow, we've been glued
at the hip ever since.

589
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,154
Yeah.
No doubt.

590
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,241
Yeah. Great. Great story.

591
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:54,201
Yeah, we like it.

592
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,788
So, Nic, you, you're a doctor,
I know that.

593
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,330
But what are you into, Jules?

594
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:00,707
What do you do?

595
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:06,088
Well, you know, I mean, I studied
architecture in college.

596
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:07,172
Right.

597
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:08,714
But I'm not really an architect.

598
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,424
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,

599
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,928
but I quit before
the kids were born.

600
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:14,137
That happens.

601
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:15,573
And then when they got
a little bit older,

602
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:18,100
I started a Balinese furniture
import business.

603
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,600
Right on.

604
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:21,936
But that didn't really work out.

605
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,082
Yeah, businesses aren't easy.

606
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,147
Yeah.

607
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:27,276
But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.

608
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,943
Great, good for you.
What's that?

609
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,280
Landscape design.
I mean, you know, not gardening.

610
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,531
I mean, you know,
there's a gardening component,

611
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:39,287
but, really, the real work
is in creating unique,

612
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,123
eco-friendly spaces
that, you know, the surrounding,

613
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,584
that blend, you know,
with the surrounding environment.

614
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:46,752
You know what I mean?

615
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:49,255
Definitely.

616
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,299
Most definitely.
Yeah.

617
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:57,138
Hey, Joni, did you
tell Paul about your graduation speech?

618
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:58,638
No, she didn't tell me.

619
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,100
It was so full of
wisdom and hope.

620
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,310
Yeah.

621
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:04,519
Hey, go get it.

622
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,814
You know, I bet Paul
would like to hear it.

623
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,317
No, Mom, I'm sure he wouldn't.

624
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,775
No, no, no, sure he would.

625
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,027
Go on, go get it.

626
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,695
No, I don't want to.

627
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:15,655
Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.

628
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,994
Mom, I'm not embarrassed.
Jesus, give it a rest. Just let it go.

629
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,456
I'm gonna get some ice cream.

630
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,790
I'll help.
Okay.

631
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,503
Honey, it's your fourth glass.

632
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:35,759
Actually, it's my third.
But, you know, thanks for counting.

633
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,179
Hey, I was...
You know, I was thinking.

634
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:41,806
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...

635
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,933
I mean, the backyard's a wreck.

636
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:48,063
Would you be interested in maybe
coming and doing some work for me?

637
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:49,397
That's okay.

638
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:50,939
No, seriously.
I can't...

639
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:53,360
I don't have time
to do it myself and...

640
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,153
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,

641
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,589
but you should think
about it, you know.

642
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,365
No, why?
I just did.

643
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:02,868
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it. It's okay.

644
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:07,122
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.

645
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:09,708
Yeah? Yeah?
Hey...

646
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:10,876
All right.

647
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,378
Okay.

648
00:34:12,462 --> 00:34:13,962
Great.

649
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:15,923
Excellent.

650
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,633
Right on.
Yeah.

651
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:23,847
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit his involvement.

652
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,451
You're unbelievable.
I mean, you're all about me getting clients.

653
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:28,371
And then I get a client,
and you're like, "Oh, no, not him."

654
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,396
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.

655
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,854
He's our sperm donor.

656
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,317
I mean, haven't you heard the expression
"don't shit where you eat"?

657
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:38,070
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.

658
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:45,993
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.

659
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:49,080
You know?

660
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:52,083
Yeah, he was working
the "alternative" thing pretty hard.

661
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,420
Oh, my God.
When he said that thing about,

662
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:58,756
"Oh, I just need to get outside and do
things, not sit on my ass and learn.

663
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:02,093
"But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way."

664
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:18,192
I'd certainly clean up a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.

665
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:19,444
Sure.

666
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:22,155
The lavender is so nice.

667
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,117
And with the sun that
you have, that and, like, that rosemary,

668
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,535
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have

669
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:29,619
to think about it.
Yeah.

670
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:35,334
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden, kind of a trellis-y,

671
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:37,961
like hidden kind of thing.

672
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:43,091
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.

673
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:47,012
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...

674
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,390
Whatever you think.

675
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:52,058
Well, what do you think?

676
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:55,896
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.

677
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,606
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.

678
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,817
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame this space, okay?

679
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,611
Let's just let it be like lush,

680
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:07,615
overgrown, fecund.

681
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,868
Fecund.

682
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:15,080
Like fertile, yeah?

683
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:18,418
No, I love that word. You just, you don't
hear people use it very often.

684
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:20,169
No, yeah.

685
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:23,672
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.

686
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:25,758
Right on.
Let's do that.

687
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,096
I'm sorry.
What?

688
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:36,519
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions in your face.

689
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:37,645
Really?
Yeah.

690
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,315
Like that. Like, "Really?"
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.

691
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,779
Well...

692
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,913
Do you like patios?

693
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,374
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.

694
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,707
Yeah.

695
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,626
We could put a patio up there.
Where?

696
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,127
Let's take a look.

697
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:08,049
Hello. Donor Dad?
Stone cold fox.

698
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,553
Must you take everything beautiful
and make it dirty?

699
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:12,555
Okay.

700
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:16,182
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.

701
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,850
Is he single?

702
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,895
Okay.
First of all, ew,

703
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,981
and second,
he's a really good person.

704
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:27,193
So I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.

705
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,030
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.

706
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,075
You lovebirds can
split my letters.

707
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:42,060
Do you want to keep playing?

708
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:43,376
Sure.

709
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,710
Okay.

710
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,885
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?

711
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,178
Yeah.

712
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:03,479
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?

713
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:04,980
It's just sad.

714
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:07,524
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.

715
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,576
Oh, come on.

716
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,578
Hi ya, what's the score?

717
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:20,954
Pretty close.

718
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,623
Yeah?
20 to three. Match point.

719
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,417
So how'd it go today?

720
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,545
It was good.
We settled on a concept.

721
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,880
Ah. What is it?

722
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:32,840
Well, you know, it's kind of...

723
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:35,469
It's kind of hard to explain.

724
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:37,970
You really have
to see the space.

725
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:43,934
Okay. Hey, Laser, did you write the
get-well card for Pup-pup?

726
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,730
Laser, come on.

727
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:51,317
What do I have to do? I bought
you the card. I put it on your desk.

728
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:53,486
All you have to do is sign it.

729
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,131
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.

730
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:58,407
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.

731
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:02,411
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,

732
00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:04,789
we're not going to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?

733
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:07,375
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.

734
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:08,750
What other plans?

735
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:12,588
I asked you a question.

736
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:16,425
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!

737
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:22,598
Shit!

738
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,581
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.

739
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:29,730
Are you filming?
Yeah.

740
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:32,566
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that, Clay. No way.

741
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:34,150
Let's do something different.

742
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:37,028
Will you quit being
such a choch and run the camera?

743
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,364
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.

744
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,036
All right.

745
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,626
All right, I got it.

746
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:58,675
Shit! Dude!

747
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,238
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!

748
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:03,263
Did you get it, dude?
Clay, you all right, bro?

749
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:05,032
Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!

750
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,475
Did you fucking
get it? God!

751
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,810
Yeah, I got it.

752
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:12,146
Fuck, dude.
Clay...

753
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,148
That was fucking crazy.

754
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,025
Where's your place,
Clay, up here?

755
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,279
Yeah, right here on the right.

756
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,197
This is good.
Cool here?

757
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:23,866
Yeah.

758
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,118
You take care.
Later.

759
00:40:26,202 --> 00:40:27,536
See you.

760
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,753
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.

761
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,673
Maybe we could hang out together just
you and me next time.

762
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:44,261
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets a little amped sometimes.

763
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:48,182
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.

764
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,225
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.

765
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,770
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.

766
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,665
Well, you know what?
You don't know him very well, do you?

767
00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:57,399
I mean, you hung out
with him once.

768
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,777
You're right.
I don't know him.

769
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,156
Can I ask you something?

770
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,492
Sure.

771
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,328
Why'd you donate sperm?

772
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:18,211
It just seemed like a lot more fun than
donating blood.

773
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:27,136
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.

774
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:31,974
People who were in need, you know,
wanted to have kids and couldn't.

775
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,477
So then you did it
to help people?

776
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,397
It was a long time ago.

777
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:42,193
How much did you get paid?

778
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:44,487
Why do you want to know that?

779
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,196
I'm just curious.

780
00:41:48,908 --> 00:41:52,202
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.

781
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:54,831
That's it?

782
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,250
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me at the time.

783
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:02,587
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.

784
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,509
I'm glad I did it.

785
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:22,982
What's this?

786
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:24,442
Hi. Come here.

787
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:27,821
Come here. Sit down.

788
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:38,163
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately, you know.

789
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,750
I know I haven't
been my highest self.

790
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:42,001
Yeah.

791
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:45,839
And you've been
really patient with me.

792
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:50,426
And I just want you to know that that
hasn't gone unrecognized, okay?

793
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:06,066
How's the water?

794
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:09,153
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?

795
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,823
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.

796
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:20,246
I forgot
the lavender bath salts.

797
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:22,040
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.

798
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:23,959
I wanna get them.
I got them special.

799
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:25,920
Don't go. Don't.

800
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:29,047
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

801
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,068
Nic?

802
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:54,405
Hey, Nic?

803
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,533
Jesus!

804
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,999
Right. No,
I understand.

805
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:09,754
I understand where the pain is, but
it doesn't sound like a contraction.

806
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:12,423
It sounds more like gas.
I'm sorry.

807
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:13,716
Fuck!

808
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:16,636
Right. Okay.

809
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,931
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think you should worry,

810
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:23,141
and I think you should
just call me back if it continues.

811
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,011
You sure you don't
want any coffee?

812
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:33,235
No thanks.

813
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:34,695
It's good.

814
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:35,989
I'm all right.

815
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:39,783
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,

816
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:42,911
so I want you to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.

817
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:44,246
Sure.

818
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:45,975
What is this?
Did you make it?

819
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:48,583
Yeah. That's some pie I made.
It's right from my garden.

820
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:50,460
It's strawberry-rhubarb.

821
00:44:50,545 --> 00:44:52,128
Here. Try.

822
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:54,840
Yeah, okay.
Twist my arm.

823
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,137
Oh, my God.
It's good, huh?

824
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:02,407
That's criminal.
Have some more.

825
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:03,765
No. No, please,
just take it away.

826
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,850
Come on.

827
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,852
You had one bite.
No, if I have one more,

828
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:10,022
you're gonna have to tape it to my ass
'cause that's where it's gonna end up.

829
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:13,357
Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
No reason for that.

830
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,322
You're good with
the plants, then?

831
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:31,625
'Cause, you know,
I can change it.

832
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,813
If you're not happy with it,
we can do something else.

833
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:35,773
No. No, no. I'm... We can get whatever
you want, you know?

834
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:37,465
I'm just thinking.

835
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:44,387
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm good with them.
They're great.

836
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,140
They're great.

837
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:53,521
Sorry. Sometimes I mistake
silence for criticism.

838
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:55,565
I wasn't criticizing you.

839
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,484
No, no, I just, you know...

840
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:04,075
Sometimes Nic can be a little critical
'cause she's a perfectionist.

841
00:46:04,158 --> 00:46:06,284
Well, I don't see why
you'd take it that way.

842
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:08,870
I think you're really talented.

843
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:11,790
Really?

844
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:13,084
Really.

845
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:18,463
Excuse me, señora?

846
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:19,589
Yeah?

847
00:46:19,673 --> 00:46:21,216
5:00.

848
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,425
Okay, thanks.

849
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,219
Same time tomorrow?

850
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,221
Yeah. Same time tomorrow.

851
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:29,557
Good night.

852
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:32,351
Thank you. Okay,
good night. Thank you.

853
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:35,312
I should get going, too.

854
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:38,565
Same time tomorrow?

855
00:46:38,651 --> 00:46:40,442
That's mean.
Take this.

856
00:46:40,527 --> 00:46:41,861
No. U h-uh.
I don't want it.

857
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:42,946
Take it.
No.

858
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,823
For the kids.
No. I don't want it.

859
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:46,074
Come on.

860
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:47,741
No. God,
you are such a pusher.

861
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:02,132
Wow. Okay.

862
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:09,596
I don't know where that came from.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I...

863
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,140
Jules.

864
00:47:11,223 --> 00:47:12,975
I'm gonna just go and...

865
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:14,267
It's okay.

866
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:15,477
No, I just...

867
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:17,771
It's okay.
It was okay.

868
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:21,733
But I shall return!

869
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:33,369
What?

870
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:39,250
So how'd it go with Paul today?

871
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:40,751
What do you mean?

872
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:45,631
Well, did you break ground? Did you
dig in? I don't know the terms.

873
00:47:45,716 --> 00:47:48,759
We just talked, conceptually.

874
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:54,849
So it was less of a
"doing" day? Was he okay with that?

875
00:47:56,727 --> 00:48:00,354
You know, I think
we should lay off the Paul digs a little.

876
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:03,232
Oh, okay.

877
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:12,992
And I also think
we should start composting.

878
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,707
Hey, take this.

879
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:21,876
Thanks.

880
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,835
You got that fair skin.

881
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:28,298
You don't have my peasant blood.

882
00:48:32,678 --> 00:48:34,054
Ignore.

883
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:35,430
Who's that?

884
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:38,934
My mom, Nic.
She's driving me crazy.

885
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:41,144
Yeah? What's she doing?

886
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,438
She's treating me like I'm 12.

887
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:45,459
It's like she doesn't want to admit
that I'm an adult.

888
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:48,359
Well, that's your mom.
That's her job.

889
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:51,613
What? To smother me to death?
That's not her job.

890
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:55,742
If you want things
to be different, you got to do that,

891
00:48:55,826 --> 00:48:57,994
make that happen yourself.

892
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,663
That's your job.

893
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:01,831
Yeah.

894
00:49:01,874 --> 00:49:02,958
Do you like peppers?

895
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,084
Yeah.

896
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:06,627
Thanks.

897
00:49:09,464 --> 00:49:11,925
There's no way,
dude. You missed it by, like, 20 feet.

898
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,861
Well, if Paul wasn't there,
I could have made it.

899
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:15,594
That guy creeps me out.

900
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:18,430
He's kind of a fag, dude,
trying to act like your dad and shit.

901
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:20,308
Whatever, all right?

902
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:26,021
Hey, buddy. Hey.

903
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:28,709
I've seen this dog around here before.
I think he's lost.

904
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,693
Let's pee on his head.

905
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:33,153
What? No.

906
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,405
Where you going?

907
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:35,614
Dude, what are you doing?

908
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:36,949
Dude, just hold him.

909
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,158
Dude, quit it.

910
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,244
"Dude, quit it."

911
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:43,454
Go on, get out of here! Go!

912
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:45,666
Why are you such a fag?

913
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,295
Why are you such a fucking dick?

914
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:05,102
That hat looks
good on you. Thanks.

915
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:07,061
Keep it.
Thank you.

916
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:09,063
Never been on a bike?

917
00:50:11,234 --> 00:50:12,318
Never.

918
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:13,860
You got to wear one of these.

919
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:20,825
Okay.

920
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:22,577
You've got to hold on
tight right there.

921
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,000
Here we go. You ready?

922
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,209
I'm ready.
You sure?

923
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,794
Yeah.

924
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,878
Hey, babe, relax.
She'll be back when she gets back.

925
00:51:14,962 --> 00:51:17,297
Quit telling me
to relax. Okay?

926
00:51:25,264 --> 00:51:26,306
What the fuck?

927
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:40,237
Wow. Funny how someone
conveniently forgot to tell me

928
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:43,323
that they were driving home
on a motorcycle.

929
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:48,077
Do you know how many people I've
seen come into the hospital paralyzed

930
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:49,578
from motorcycle accidents?

931
00:51:49,663 --> 00:51:51,415
I'm a very safe driver, Nic.

932
00:51:51,498 --> 00:51:55,334
Yeah, that is so not the point that
I'm making, Paul.

933
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,670
Joni knows that this is something
I'd just never allow.

934
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:58,921
Mom, I'm 18 years old.

935
00:51:59,005 --> 00:52:00,047
Yeah?

936
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:01,933
I won't even be living
here in, like, a month.

937
00:52:02,008 --> 00:52:03,609
Yeah, well, you're living here now.
Yeah?

938
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:06,636
Well, why don't you get a jump on it and
pretend like I'm not?

939
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:15,770
She's never talked
to me like that before.

940
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:18,648
You know, if you backed off a little bit
on the restrictions,

941
00:52:18,732 --> 00:52:21,526
you probably wouldn't
have so much conflict.

942
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:25,448
Oh, really? You think so, Paul?
Is that how it works?

943
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:26,573
What's going on?

944
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:28,284
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

945
00:52:28,368 --> 00:52:31,454
Paul's just giving me some
child-rearing lessons.

946
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:32,537
I'm just saying...

947
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:36,459
Listen, when you've been a parent for
18 years, you come and talk to me, okay?

948
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,126
I'm just making an observation.

949
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:42,380
Yeah? Well, I need your observations
like I need a dick in my ass!

950
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:08,323
Joni?

951
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,247
Honey. Look,
I was upset, okay?

952
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:18,458
You know how I feel
about motorcycles.

953
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,834
Yeah, I know how
you feel about them.

954
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:24,296
But I'm an adult now,
and you have to respect that, okay?

955
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:25,756
Good night.

956
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:47,194
Good? Good?

957
00:53:47,278 --> 00:53:48,403
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thanks.

958
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:08,673
Hey, Paul.

959
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:12,469
Hey, Jules.
What's up?

960
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:17,390
It's all right. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about last night.

961
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:19,016
Hey...
I was really embarrassed.

962
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:22,895
Hey, it wasn't you.
It was her who wigged out.

963
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,333
I think she's, you know,
she's just having a really hard time.

964
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:27,400
You know?

965
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:29,944
Yeah. You really don't
have to defend her. Seriously.

966
00:54:30,028 --> 00:54:33,072
And about that kiss, that's...
You know, I don't do that.

967
00:54:33,156 --> 00:54:34,532
I completely sensed that, yeah.

968
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:36,117
So...

969
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:39,495
I just wanted to clear the air.

970
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,954
The air is cleared.

971
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:42,582
No, it's clear.

972
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:53,426
No, Paul, I can't!

973
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,718
Why? You don't want to?

974
00:54:54,802 --> 00:54:56,136
No, I have a guy outside!

975
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,597
Oh, yeah.
Right, the guy.

976
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:03,935
Oh, God.

977
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:10,275
Okay, wait. Wait.

978
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:24,289
Well! Hello!

979
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,458
Yeah! Yeah!

980
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:28,376
Okay, not so hard.
Not so hard. Okay.

981
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:31,212
What?

982
00:55:31,297 --> 00:55:32,713
Oh, my God!
Yeah?

983
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:35,550
Come on.

984
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:37,760
Excuse me?

985
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:40,680
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

986
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:41,972
Oh, God. Oh, God.

987
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:43,307
Excuse me, señora?

988
00:55:43,392 --> 00:55:47,562
I can't fucking believe it.
Okay.

989
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:50,981
You gotta go talk to him.
Are you gonna go talk to him?

990
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,067
Okay. Fuck.
Oh, God.

991
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:56,236
Shit.

992
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:59,448
Excuse me, señora?
Okay!

993
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:03,911
Hey, what's up?

994
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:07,456
Where do you want the stones?

995
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,748
Stones?

996
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:11,793
Over by the fence.

997
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:15,130
What?

998
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,676
I was using the bathroom.

999
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:22,095
Do you need to use the bathroom?

1000
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:26,015
Okay, then.
I'll be right back.

1001
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,892
Okay.
Take your time.

1002
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,981
That's H.

1003
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:35,484
Yeah, I know.

1004
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:36,652
All right. Lay-up.

1005
00:56:36,736 --> 00:56:38,194
All right.

1006
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:41,781
Now you don't have
to go easy on me because you're winning.

1007
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:45,493
Nobody likes a show-off, man.

1008
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:48,746
You gotta go behind the back.

1009
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:49,914
God.

1010
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,796
Can I ask you a question?

1011
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,467
Would you rather
be buried or cremated?

1012
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:04,387
That's your question?

1013
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:06,305
I'd rather be cremated.

1014
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:09,350
I think I'd...

1015
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,395
I think I'd rather be buried.

1016
00:57:12,479 --> 00:57:14,146
But why? I mean,

1017
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,166
you're just gonna be
taking up more space in the earth.

1018
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,793
I don't know. The idea of being,
you know,

1019
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:22,404
torched into a chalky white substance
has got me a little freaked out.

1020
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:24,883
Why does it matter to you?
You're not even gonna be conscious.

1021
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:27,242
Okay, well, maybe, I don't know,

1022
00:57:27,326 --> 00:57:29,662
I want a place for people to come
and visit me one day.

1023
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:30,912
But why?
You're gonna be dead.

1024
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:32,790
You won't even
know they're there.

1025
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:38,712
Okay. Take it easy.

1026
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:41,590
Come on.

1027
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:44,551
So, what do you like better,
Nike or New Balance?

1028
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:46,720
Nike.
Oh, God, here we go.

1029
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,932
God, I love your
necklace! Can I see it?

1030
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:53,602
Sure.

1031
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:55,562
It's so beautiful.

1032
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:56,979
Thank you.

1033
00:57:57,063 --> 00:57:58,230
Is it African?

1034
00:57:58,316 --> 00:58:00,274
Yes, it's Ethiopian.

1035
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:01,401
Did you get it there?

1036
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:04,320
No, I got it at a flea market
in Brooklyn.

1037
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:07,156
Is that where you're from?

1038
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,949
No, I'm from here.

1039
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:12,662
Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1040
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:14,121
Good.
How's the food?

1041
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:15,206
It's great.

1042
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,517
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?

1043
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,125
It's so yummy.
It's good?

1044
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,335
Yeah, it's really good.

1045
00:58:19,419 --> 00:58:24,465
I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely
Tanya away for a moment.

1046
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:26,967
All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.

1047
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:28,885
You, too.
You, too.

1048
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:38,479
Okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy
is giving me the sex vibe.

1049
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:40,648
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.

1050
00:58:40,732 --> 00:58:43,149
Why not?
He's not my dad.

1051
00:58:43,235 --> 00:58:45,944
God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!

1052
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:49,155
Not everybody
wants to have sex with you, okay?

1053
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,283
Especially when
you act like a slut.

1054
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:53,452
Fuck you.

1055
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:56,831
Well, it makes you seem insecure
and desperate.

1056
00:58:56,914 --> 00:58:59,165
I'm not insecure and desperate.

1057
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,960
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.

1058
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:05,840
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.

1059
00:59:05,923 --> 00:59:08,801
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.

1060
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,473
Oh, my God,
these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.

1061
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:17,100
Oh, yeah, they're in season.

1062
00:59:17,184 --> 00:59:19,371
You know, Joni brought some home from
Paul's garden the other day.

1063
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:20,895
They were huge.

1064
00:59:20,979 --> 00:59:23,231
So the kids have
been spending time with him?

1065
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:27,610
Yeah. Yeah, they're
spending all kinds of quality time together.

1066
00:59:27,695 --> 00:59:30,530
Well, you're lucky. You're lucky that
the kids bonded with the donor.

1067
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:32,448
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.

1068
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:36,578
No, no, it's great.
They all just get along famously.

1069
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:38,454
Apparently, Paul
can do no wrong.

1070
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:42,332
Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?

1071
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,019
Thank you. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I don't need any more.

1072
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:46,754
Yeah, you're alone
on this one, Nicole.

1073
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:52,009
Hey, so have you guys gotten into the
whole acai smoothie craze?

1074
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:53,260
Acai fruit packs.

1075
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:57,222
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like
crack at Whole Foods.

1076
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,975
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.

1077
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:01,393
Here's what I do.

1078
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:06,899
I throw one in the blender with bananas,
frozen strawberries and hemp milk.

1079
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:09,484
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.

1080
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:11,486
Just fucking kill me.
Okay?

1081
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:13,322
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,

1082
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:18,535
but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.

1083
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,872
And, you know, if I hear one more person
say that they love heirloom tomatoes,

1084
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:23,916
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?

1085
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:27,084
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?

1086
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,171
Oh, yeah.
"No, don't throw that in the trash.

1087
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:32,506
"You have to put it
in the composting bin

1088
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:38,095
"where all the beautiful little worms will
turn it into this organic mulch,

1089
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,182
"and then we'll all
feel good about ourselves." You know?

1090
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:44,185
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.

1091
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,024
Hey, babe. How about
some green tea?

1092
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:55,071
You know what, Jules?
I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.

1093
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:58,616
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called resveratrol in it,

1094
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,953
which has been proven
to significantly extend human lifespan.

1095
01:01:02,036 --> 01:01:05,665
If you drink, like,
a thousand glasses a day, yeah.

1096
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,416
Fuck you.

1097
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,298
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1098
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:16,968
Go to her.

1099
01:01:22,515 --> 01:01:24,976
What the hell
is going on with them?

1100
01:01:31,065 --> 01:01:33,608
Oh, my God.
What is going on with you?

1101
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:35,235
It's this whole Paul thing.

1102
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:37,737
It's just driving me
crazy, all right?

1103
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:39,698
I feel like he's taking over
my family.

1104
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:41,074
No. He's...

1105
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:42,409
Can I get you anything?

1106
01:01:42,493 --> 01:01:44,911
No thanks, no.
He's not. He's not.

1107
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,163
Okay.

1108
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,584
Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

1109
01:01:53,587 --> 01:01:55,714
I guess I'm just exhausted.

1110
01:01:57,257 --> 01:02:00,677
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some time off, recharge.

1111
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:01,845
Right?

1112
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:03,680
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay for that?

1113
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:07,558
I mean, look, I'm sorry,

1114
01:02:07,643 --> 01:02:10,020
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying the whole load here.

1115
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:12,688
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.

1116
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:14,273
That's the way you keep control.

1117
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:16,127
What are you talking about?

1118
01:02:16,151 --> 01:02:18,527
Come on,
you hated it when I worked.

1119
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,339
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.

1120
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:22,197
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.

1121
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:23,824
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,

1122
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,701
and you sure didn't
back my career.

1123
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:30,039
What are you talking about? I just
helped you start another business.

1124
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:33,124
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.

1125
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:38,505
No, Jules.
So you can feel better about yourself.

1126
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:43,093
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?

1127
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:47,263
Would you still like the wine?

1128
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:51,267
No, thank you. We'll just take the
check from inside, please.

1129
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,978
Okay, no problem.

1130
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,398
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.

1131
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,275
Okay. Oh, yeah.

1132
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:02,820
Okay.

1133
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,754
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked since Laser was born.

1134
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,318
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?

1135
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:24,801
Sometimes, but I don't have any.

1136
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:26,511
I could go run out
and get you some.

1137
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,764
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.

1138
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,266
God.

1139
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,437
Do you think

1140
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,858
I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?

1141
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,822
You know, I have been trying to come up
with a way to describe you to my friends,

1142
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,666
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.

1143
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,868
Fuck you.

1144
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,286
You want to get that?

1145
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,081
No, no. I want
to get some of this.

1146
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,374
Paul, it's Joni.

1147
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,628
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for my friend Sasha.

1148
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,047
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,

1149
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,715
I think that she thought that...

1150
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,467
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
Don't get that.

1151
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,530
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.

1152
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,932
No, I didn't even... No, no. No...
Really, I didn't even notice that.

1153
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,035
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.

1154
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,727
No, not at all. I...

1155
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,646
Not at all.

1156
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,731
Okay, sure.
Well, as long as... Hold on, hold on.

1157
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,983
Wait, wait, wait.

1158
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,483
No, just get off me.

1159
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:25,838
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.

1160
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,653
Get off.

1161
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,781
Jone?

1162
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,116
Oh, is my mom there?

1163
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,368
Your mom?
No, no. She split.

1164
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:36,662
She went on a Home Depot run.

1165
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,337
Did you go to Home Depot?

1166
01:04:45,422 --> 01:04:47,506
Yeah. Just got back.

1167
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:51,302
That was fast.

1168
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:52,928
Yeah, no lines.

1169
01:04:58,768 --> 01:05:01,145
What's that look
you're giving me?

1170
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:02,312
What look?

1171
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:05,816
The look that you're
giving me right now.

1172
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:09,778
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.

1173
01:05:09,863 --> 01:05:13,032
Yeah, I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

1174
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:15,533
You know, you can
keep your judgments to yourself.

1175
01:05:15,618 --> 01:05:17,828
No. I didn't give
no looks, señora.

1176
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:20,496
I don't ask
why you blow your nose all the time.

1177
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:22,684
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.

1178
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:25,335
No, I don't have
no drug problem.

1179
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:26,419
I have allergies.

1180
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:29,215
Then why are you a gardener?

1181
01:05:29,298 --> 01:05:31,466
'Cause I love the flowers.

1182
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:34,220
Man, this is not gonna work.

1183
01:05:34,303 --> 01:05:36,471
You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,

1184
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:38,890
and then we're through. Okay?

1185
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:41,392
Thank you very much.

1186
01:05:41,477 --> 01:05:43,144
Thanks. Thank you.

1187
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:47,398
Can we talk about...

1188
01:05:47,483 --> 01:05:48,566
No, we can't.

1189
01:05:48,651 --> 01:05:50,235
A little bit.
You know why?

1190
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:51,778
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.

1191
01:05:51,862 --> 01:05:53,655
I think you know.

1192
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:56,658
You know.

1193
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:44,578
Look.

1194
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,917
I know you've all
been enjoying your time with Paul.

1195
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:53,964
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him as everybody else,

1196
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:56,216
and that's caused some
friction between us.

1197
01:06:56,301 --> 01:07:00,137
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?

1198
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:02,139
So I was thinking

1199
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:05,350
it might be nice if we all had dinner at
his house sometime.

1200
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:07,727
Now that way, I could get to know him
a little bit better,

1201
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:12,648
and I could see all the good work
that Mom's been doing in the backyard.

1202
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:16,652
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.

1203
01:07:16,737 --> 01:07:17,820
Yeah.
Sure.

1204
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:18,988
Yeah?

1205
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:20,156
Yeah.

1206
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,365
Great.

1207
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,784
It's not...
I'm not done yet.

1208
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:25,013
You know, I'm not, you know...

1209
01:07:25,037 --> 01:07:26,203
No. No, I know.

1210
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:28,205
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.

1211
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,665
But I wanna see the process.

1212
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,959
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.

1213
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:34,837
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see the process.

1214
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:36,421
Great.

1215
01:07:42,595 --> 01:07:44,305
Need a hand?
Sure.

1216
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,270
Hold on.
Let me help you.

1217
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:53,314
Ready? Okay.

1218
01:07:53,398 --> 01:07:54,773
Right here.

1219
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:58,235
Yeah.

1220
01:08:05,117 --> 01:08:06,326
We can't be doing this.

1221
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:09,037
I know. This is...

1222
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:10,454
I'm married.

1223
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:11,831
The kids.

1224
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:14,167
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...

1225
01:08:14,251 --> 01:08:15,835
Hey.
I don't...

1226
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,503
It was fun while it lasted.

1227
01:08:18,255 --> 01:08:19,422
Sorry.

1228
01:08:23,844 --> 01:08:26,553
I bought you some cigarettes.

1229
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:30,474
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?

1230
01:08:32,186 --> 01:08:35,355
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.

1231
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,564
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.

1232
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:40,109
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up sometimes.

1233
01:08:40,194 --> 01:08:44,322
No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.

1234
01:08:46,616 --> 01:08:48,826
I am so fucked up.

1235
01:08:54,499 --> 01:08:56,792
I think I'm falling for you.

1236
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,170
Oh, God, Paul.

1237
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:02,923
Don't.

1238
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,657
Tonight was a really good night.

1239
01:09:29,741 --> 01:09:30,783
Yeah.

1240
01:09:30,868 --> 01:09:34,329
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.

1241
01:09:35,706 --> 01:09:38,375
It was crazy.
It was a big night.

1242
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:41,294
You know, Joni's really pretty.

1243
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,796
I think she's got
some of your genes.

1244
01:09:43,881 --> 01:09:46,466
You think? I think she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.

1245
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,800
I appreciate that.

1246
01:09:48,469 --> 01:09:50,887
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.

1247
01:09:50,971 --> 01:09:52,221
Yeah?

1248
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,266
Yeah.

1249
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,351
It made me want to fuck you.

1250
01:09:58,479 --> 01:09:59,603
Yeah?

1251
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:00,729
Yeah.

1252
01:10:00,813 --> 01:10:04,442
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.

1253
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:07,903
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in a while, have we?

1254
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:13,409
You want to meet up later?

1255
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,077
Tanya,

1256
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,582
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...

1257
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:24,961
I don't think
we should do that anymore.

1258
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:29,132
You know,
what we have is really fun and easy,

1259
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:33,303
but I don't want to be that, like, 50-year-
old guy who's just hanging out, you know?

1260
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:35,222
I really do want
to have a family,

1261
01:10:35,306 --> 01:10:39,935
and I need to be doing that with someone
who's, like, ready to go there with me.

1262
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:46,858
Okay.

1263
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:50,195
Tanya.

1264
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:58,537
Yeah? Fuck you.

1265
01:11:24,187 --> 01:11:25,604
It's locked.

1266
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:37,074
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have
more to do down here.

1267
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:39,577
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.

1268
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,204
No, it looks great.

1269
01:11:42,289 --> 01:11:43,289
Yeah?

1270
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:44,415
It's so indigenous.

1271
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:46,166
Really.
I am so proud of you.

1272
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:49,127
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?

1273
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:50,837
I'm so proud.

1274
01:11:55,759 --> 01:11:56,968
I love you, honey.

1275
01:11:57,052 --> 01:11:58,845
I love you, too.

1276
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:00,972
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.

1277
01:12:01,056 --> 01:12:02,098
Oh, man.

1278
01:12:02,182 --> 01:12:04,100
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis working out?

1279
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,227
Man, I had to fire him.

1280
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:07,312
Oh, my God.

1281
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:09,105
Yeah, he has a drug problem.

1282
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:10,273
You're kidding!
What drug?

1283
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:11,482
No. I know... I...

1284
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:12,650
Blow, I think.

1285
01:12:13,444 --> 01:12:15,111
You're a natural, kid.

1286
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:30,000
I know.
Good.

1287
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,211
You're a natural.

1288
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:38,343
You can never have
too much olive oil.

1289
01:12:38,427 --> 01:12:39,427
Big no-no.

1290
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:44,599
Oh! I forgot.

1291
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:49,562
Nic, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that
I think you're just gonna love.

1292
01:12:49,647 --> 01:12:52,207
You know what? I think I'm gonna stick
with water, but thank you so much.

1293
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:53,815
You sure?
Yeah.

1294
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,067
Jules.

1295
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:57,379
Paul, this steak is delicious.

1296
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:58,528
Thank you.

1297
01:12:58,613 --> 01:13:01,365
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?

1298
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:04,660
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil, right?

1299
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:07,162
It's so easy.
Wow.

1300
01:13:07,246 --> 01:13:09,956
What a good idea.
We ought to try that. Right, honey?

1301
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,833
And it's done to perfection.

1302
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:14,001
Yeah?
It's not too rare?

1303
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:15,170
Oh, no, no.

1304
01:13:15,254 --> 01:13:18,632
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

1305
01:13:18,716 --> 01:13:20,925
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,

1306
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:23,761
they see the slightest
bit of red, they just start freaking out.

1307
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:25,681
Isn't that annoying?

1308
01:13:25,764 --> 01:13:27,890
That happens to me
all the time when I'm grilling.

1309
01:13:27,974 --> 01:13:29,141
Hey, red is rare.

1310
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:30,768
Hello, it's bloody.

1311
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:32,353
I mean...
Hello?

1312
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:33,730
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.

1313
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:36,733
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,

1314
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:39,944
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.

1315
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:43,591
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos
Aires is supposed to be...

1316
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:46,951
Hey. I noticed
your record collection over there.

1317
01:13:47,035 --> 01:13:49,704
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.

1318
01:13:49,787 --> 01:13:51,539
Thank you very much, Nic.

1319
01:13:51,623 --> 01:13:52,957
You're welcome.

1320
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,395
You don't meet too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.

1321
01:13:55,419 --> 01:13:57,253
You sure don't.

1322
01:13:57,337 --> 01:13:58,754
You like Joni?

1323
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:03,049
No, not really. We just named our
daughter after her.

1324
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,220
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.

1325
01:14:06,304 --> 01:14:09,557
Come on. Really? You never told me
you were named after Joni M.

1326
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:11,285
It's so dorky.
I don't like to bring it up.

1327
01:14:11,309 --> 01:14:12,435
That is so cool.

1328
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:15,311
No, what's your
favorite Joni album? It's not cool.

1329
01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:16,522
Blue.

1330
01:14:17,982 --> 01:14:21,276
Right? My brother
from another mother.

1331
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,319
Oh, my God.
I mean...

1332
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:28,074
Listen, I spent half of high school in my
room crying to that album.

1333
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,119
That record, it kills me.

1334
01:14:31,203 --> 01:14:32,788
It doesn't stop.
No.

1335
01:14:32,872 --> 01:14:35,707
River. California.

1336
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,375
A Case Of You.

1337
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,501
All I Want.

1338
01:14:38,627 --> 01:14:40,253
Oh, God.
Right?

1339
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:44,965
I am on a lonely road

1340
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,471
And I am traveling,
traveling, traveling

1341
01:14:49,555 --> 01:14:51,181
Looking for something

1342
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:53,683
What can it be

1343
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:57,227
I hate you some, I hate you some

1344
01:14:57,313 --> 01:15:00,440
I love you some

1345
01:15:00,524 --> 01:15:02,107
I love you

1346
01:15:02,192 --> 01:15:05,570
When I forget about me

1347
01:15:05,654 --> 01:15:07,739
I want to talk to you

1348
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:09,616
I want to shampoo you

1349
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,285
I want to renew you
again and again

1350
01:15:13,369 --> 01:15:15,037
Applause, applause

1351
01:15:15,121 --> 01:15:16,663
Life is our cause

1352
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:18,332
When I think of your kisses

1353
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:20,375
My mind see-saws

1354
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,211
Do you see, do you see

1355
01:15:27,091 --> 01:15:29,051
Do you see, do you see

1356
01:15:29,135 --> 01:15:32,970
Do you see how you hurt me, baby

1357
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:36,015
And I hurt you, too

1358
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,101
That's why we both get

1359
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:44,858
so blue

1360
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:48,737
Bravo.

1361
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:53,991
Don't quit your day job, Mom.

1362
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:57,453
Hey. It's already hard enough to
open your heart in this world.

1363
01:15:57,538 --> 01:15:59,539
Don't make it any harder.

1364
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:03,710
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.

1365
01:16:03,795 --> 01:16:05,211
Beautiful, thank you.

1366
01:16:05,295 --> 01:16:06,504
I like this guy.

1367
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,091
Why, thank you, Nic.

1368
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:18,140
Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?

1369
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:20,184
It's just right here
around the corner.

1370
01:16:20,269 --> 01:16:21,561
All right. Thanks.

1371
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:27,107
And you know what? I am gonna have
a glass of the Alma Rosa, okay?

1372
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,526
All right.

1373
01:16:31,363 --> 01:16:35,408
So, I think you'd
really love Argentina.

1374
01:16:35,492 --> 01:16:36,701
I really wanna go there.

1375
01:16:36,785 --> 01:16:38,578
Buenos Aires is literally, like,

1376
01:16:38,662 --> 01:16:41,789
one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

1377
01:17:34,007 --> 01:17:36,216
I was in a rainstorm
in the Grand Canyon.

1378
01:17:36,301 --> 01:17:37,761
Can we go?
I'll take you.

1379
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:02,241
A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.

1380
01:18:02,327 --> 01:18:04,870
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.

1381
01:18:04,955 --> 01:18:06,997
I was in the desert and...

1382
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:08,289
What's it like there?

1383
01:18:08,374 --> 01:18:10,083
It's beautiful.

1384
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:13,461
I was surfing, but then
there was no waves,

1385
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:16,130
so we climbed up
into the mountains.

1386
01:18:16,215 --> 01:18:19,467
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.

1387
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:22,553
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,

1388
01:18:22,638 --> 01:18:26,934
so I reached out for a rock, and then
I threw it at the rattlesnake...

1389
01:18:54,252 --> 01:18:55,878
Did you guys spend
some time up there?

1390
01:18:55,963 --> 01:18:59,048
Yeah, a long time ago.
Yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:18:59,132 --> 01:19:01,341
Beautiful, beautiful beaches.
You'd like it.

1392
01:19:01,426 --> 01:19:04,971
It's really nice
having you guys over.

1393
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:07,974
I don't entertain here
very much.

1394
01:19:08,058 --> 01:19:09,266
Cheers.

1395
01:19:10,811 --> 01:19:12,686
All right.
All right.

1396
01:19:14,772 --> 01:19:16,899
To an unconventional family.

1397
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:42,381
You and Paul
were getting along like gang-busters.

1398
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:58,147
You're sleeping
with him, aren't you?

1399
01:19:58,231 --> 01:19:59,315
What?

1400
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:05,154
Just be honest with me, okay?

1401
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:08,407
Don't make me feel crazier
than I feel right now.

1402
01:20:10,494 --> 01:20:13,080
Where is this coming from?
I don't...

1403
01:20:13,163 --> 01:20:16,248
Well, I found your hair
in his drain.

1404
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:23,631
Because...

1405
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:27,510
Because I was working,
and I got dirty, and I took a shower.

1406
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:32,807
Yeah?
Did you take a nap, too?

1407
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:40,396
Are you in love with him?

1408
01:20:42,734 --> 01:20:46,569
No.

1409
01:20:48,322 --> 01:20:49,739
Are you straight now?

1410
01:20:49,824 --> 01:20:52,993
No. It has nothing
to do with that!

1411
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:57,039
I've just felt so far away
from you lately.

1412
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:59,125
Oh, right.
So it's my fault?

1413
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:01,459
No! Who said
anything about fault?

1414
01:21:01,544 --> 01:21:02,919
Just listen to me!

1415
01:21:03,003 --> 01:21:04,295
I'm listening!

1416
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,339
What?

1417
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:09,050
I just... I just...

1418
01:21:10,136 --> 01:21:11,136
I needed...

1419
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:13,012
What? To be fucked?

1420
01:21:13,097 --> 01:21:16,474
No. Appreciated.

1421
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:20,603
Well, it's always what
I'm not doing for you, isn't it?

1422
01:21:20,688 --> 01:21:25,524
Well, okay.
Here's what I don't do to you.

1423
01:21:25,608 --> 01:21:29,236
I don't work out my issues
by fucking other people!

1424
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,321
He's not just "other people."

1425
01:21:31,406 --> 01:21:33,992
No! He's our sperm donor.

1426
01:21:34,076 --> 01:21:36,236
You couldn't have picked
a more painful way to hurt me.

1427
01:21:36,286 --> 01:21:37,494
Where are you going?

1428
01:21:37,579 --> 01:21:38,871
I need water!

1429
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:44,043
Shit!

1430
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:48,173
Shit.

1431
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,202
Joni.

1432
01:22:18,285 --> 01:22:19,410
I don't want to talk to you.

1433
01:22:19,494 --> 01:22:20,848
Can we just talk
about what happened?

1434
01:22:20,872 --> 01:22:24,665
I said I don't
want to talk to you.

1435
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:28,212
Okay. I understand.

1436
01:22:36,262 --> 01:22:38,888
Laser? Honey?

1437
01:22:41,642 --> 01:22:42,725
What?

1438
01:22:43,727 --> 01:22:48,105
I know that
you and Joni heard what was going on,

1439
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:53,277
and I wanted to tell you
that what happened with me and Paul is over.

1440
01:22:54,655 --> 01:22:56,864
There's nothing going on now.

1441
01:22:57,991 --> 01:22:59,075
Okay.

1442
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:03,829
I know it'll probably take you a while to
process your feelings around this,

1443
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:08,750
but I just wanted to tell you that I'm here
if you ever want to talk about anything.

1444
01:23:11,837 --> 01:23:14,257
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

1445
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,674
Not really.

1446
01:23:37,697 --> 01:23:38,863
How's Nic?

1447
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:40,615
She's a mess.

1448
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:45,078
They're not talking.
I've never seen her like that.

1449
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,921
Is it him?

1450
01:23:55,006 --> 01:23:56,047
Hello?

1451
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:57,966
Hey, darling.
How you doing?

1452
01:23:58,050 --> 01:23:59,758
You're such a phony.

1453
01:24:01,886 --> 01:24:02,970
Excuse me?

1454
01:24:03,055 --> 01:24:05,973
You act like you're
so groovy and together, but you're not.

1455
01:24:06,057 --> 01:24:08,684
You're a shitty person!

1456
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:10,102
Oh, no.

1457
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,272
What happened?

1458
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:14,481
With my mom?

1459
01:24:15,942 --> 01:24:19,194
Listen, you gotta let me
just come and talk to you, honey, please.

1460
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,403
What's wrong with you?

1461
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,323
Joni, listen to me. Please...

1462
01:24:22,406 --> 01:24:24,158
Don't call me again.

1463
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:33,292
Hey, Paul, look at these cukes.
Aren't they awesome?

1464
01:24:33,376 --> 01:24:34,417
No.

1465
01:24:35,086 --> 01:24:36,128
Fuck.

1466
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:38,504
Fuck!

1467
01:24:39,883 --> 01:24:41,091
Hello?

1468
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,633
I just talked to Joni.

1469
01:24:42,718 --> 01:24:44,761
What happened?
What's going on?

1470
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:47,222
Nic found my hair
in your bathroom.

1471
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,766
Fuck.
I n the drain.

1472
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,017
The other night?

1473
01:24:51,102 --> 01:24:52,269
Yeah.

1474
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,978
Oh, my God.

1475
01:24:54,063 --> 01:24:55,646
Hey, you know what?

1476
01:24:55,731 --> 01:24:58,691
I just say we go for it.
I mean, it's all out in the open now.

1477
01:24:58,776 --> 01:25:00,610
I mean,
let's just do this thing.

1478
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:01,861
Paul...

1479
01:25:01,945 --> 01:25:04,030
I don't care what you say,
Jules. We can...

1480
01:25:04,114 --> 01:25:06,157
This can work, you know.
This isn't a mistake.

1481
01:25:06,241 --> 01:25:07,241
Paul.

1482
01:25:07,326 --> 01:25:08,887
This isn't just happening
for no reason.

1483
01:25:08,952 --> 01:25:10,244
Let's get the kids together.

1484
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:12,372
Paul, come on.
I'm sick of this life.

1485
01:25:12,455 --> 01:25:13,725
Let's make this happen.
I'm ready.

1486
01:25:13,749 --> 01:25:14,791
I'm gay.

1487
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:16,458
Fuck it. I wanna...

1488
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:18,336
Jesus.

1489
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:20,670
Hello?

1490
01:25:31,225 --> 01:25:33,975
Hey, hey.
Slow down, tiger.

1491
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,312
You don't wanna get sick.

1492
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,646
I'm fine.

1493
01:25:42,194 --> 01:25:44,861
Are you gonna talk to him?

1494
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:46,029
Yeah.

1495
01:25:57,917 --> 01:25:59,584
I like the scruff.
It's sexy.

1496
01:26:01,337 --> 01:26:02,421
Thank you.

1497
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:04,965
Excuse me.
We're in the middle of a conversation.

1498
01:26:05,049 --> 01:26:06,549
That's okay.

1499
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:07,633
Can I talk to you?

1500
01:26:07,676 --> 01:26:08,885
Yeah.

1501
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:13,306
Excuse me.

1502
01:26:19,021 --> 01:26:22,523
Green chilies, queso sauce,
blue corn tortillas.

1503
01:26:22,607 --> 01:26:24,401
This is a poblano pepper.

1504
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:26,652
So, what's up?

1505
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:06,983
Are you okay?

1506
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:08,194
Fine.

1507
01:27:20,664 --> 01:27:24,626
I just wanted to get another pillow.
The couch is really saggy.

1508
01:27:28,756 --> 01:27:29,964
Your back hurts?

1509
01:27:30,049 --> 01:27:32,592
Yeah. It's super achy.

1510
01:27:35,471 --> 01:27:37,931
Well, you should
take some Advil.

1511
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,485
Hey, how was the party?

1512
01:27:52,071 --> 01:27:53,196
Fine.

1513
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,031
Were there a lot
of people there?

1514
01:27:56,741 --> 01:27:57,908
I don't know.

1515
01:28:01,037 --> 01:28:02,829
Are you drunk, honey?

1516
01:28:02,914 --> 01:28:03,956
No.

1517
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,546
Hey, did you drive
yourself home?

1518
01:28:09,629 --> 01:28:12,465
Yeah. What's the big deal?
I'm not drunk.

1519
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:16,176
You seem drunk to me.

1520
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:18,220
Yeah, well, you should know.

1521
01:28:18,304 --> 01:28:19,638
What did you say to me?

1522
01:28:19,722 --> 01:28:21,598
Nothing. I'm going to bed.
Hey, honey. I...

1523
01:28:21,683 --> 01:28:25,811
What do you want from me?
I did everything you wanted!

1524
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:29,314
I got all A's!
I got into every school I applied!

1525
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:32,692
Now you can show everyone
what a perfect lesbian family you have!

1526
01:28:32,776 --> 01:28:34,194
Don't talk to your
mom like that!

1527
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:37,573
You're really gonna
tell me how to act? Now?

1528
01:28:37,656 --> 01:28:39,218
You know what?
I am still your mother, and you...

1529
01:28:39,242 --> 01:28:42,785
Don't touch me!
I'm so sick of both of you!

1530
01:29:59,904 --> 01:30:02,280
Hey, did you remember
to pack the lamp I gave you?

1531
01:30:04,408 --> 01:30:06,451
Well, we can always
get stuff there, you know.

1532
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:11,414
I mean, if your room's
too dark, or you need extra bedding or...

1533
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:15,377
I'm not going to Siberia, Mom.

1534
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,922
I can't believe
it's your last dinner at home.

1535
01:30:22,259 --> 01:30:24,594
Are you seriously about to cry?

1536
01:30:25,929 --> 01:30:29,139
I wish you were gay.
You'd be much more sensitive.

1537
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:36,772
That's probably Sasha.
I'll get it.

1538
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,693
How long a drive is it?

1539
01:30:39,776 --> 01:30:41,568
About eight hours, I think.

1540
01:30:43,947 --> 01:30:45,364
What are you doing here?

1541
01:30:45,448 --> 01:30:48,992
I just needed to talk to you
before you left. Please.

1542
01:30:54,124 --> 01:30:55,457
There's nothing to talk about.

1543
01:30:58,628 --> 01:31:00,754
I wanted to apologize again.

1544
01:31:02,674 --> 01:31:05,175
I can't tell you

1545
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:10,681
how ashamed,
how much I regret what happened.

1546
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:13,434
So, like, everything that
happened between us,

1547
01:31:13,518 --> 01:31:15,561
what was that?
That was just bullshit?

1548
01:31:15,645 --> 01:31:19,188
No, no.
It wasn't bullshit at all.

1549
01:31:21,024 --> 01:31:22,150
Okay?

1550
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:28,239
I know that I don't
have much credibility right now,

1551
01:31:28,323 --> 01:31:33,244
but I really, really
care about you.

1552
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:38,416
And I wanna know that I'm gonna be able
to see you again someday.

1553
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,711
I mean, I...
Do you think that could ever happen?

1554
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:47,175
I don't know.

1555
01:31:48,552 --> 01:31:51,179
I just wish that
you could've been...

1556
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:53,889
What?

1557
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:58,311
Better.

1558
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:07,779
You have got some balls, mister.

1559
01:32:07,862 --> 01:32:08,945
Hold on, Nic.

1560
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,740
No, no, no.
You hold on.

1561
01:32:11,032 --> 01:32:13,785
You know what
you did to my kids?

1562
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:14,951
Shit.

1563
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:21,041
Let me tell you something,
man, this is not your family.

1564
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:23,627
This is my family!
I know that, Nic.

1565
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:25,796
No, you don't know.

1566
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:28,048
You don't know,
and you know why?

1567
01:32:28,132 --> 01:32:30,300
Because you're
a fucking interloper.

1568
01:32:31,052 --> 01:32:34,721
If you want a family so much,
you go out and make your own!

1569
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:42,872
I need to say something.

1570
01:33:45,332 --> 01:33:50,420
It's no big secret
your mom and I are in hell right now, and...

1571
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:56,801
Bottom line is,
marriage is hard.

1572
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:58,177
It's really fucking hard.

1573
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:01,514
Just two people

1574
01:34:01,599 --> 01:34:06,394
slogging through the shit,
year after year, getting older, changing.

1575
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:09,439
It's a fucking marathon, okay?

1576
01:34:10,566 --> 01:34:14,402
So, sometimes, you know,
you're together so long, that you just...

1577
01:34:14,486 --> 01:34:16,111
You stop seeing
the other person.

1578
01:34:16,195 --> 01:34:20,282
You just see
weird projections of your own junk.

1579
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:25,454
Instead of talking
to each other, you go off the rails

1580
01:34:25,539 --> 01:34:29,541
and act grubby and make stupid choices,
which is what I did.

1581
01:34:29,627 --> 01:34:34,129
And I feel sick about it because I love you
guys, and I love your mom,

1582
01:34:35,506 --> 01:34:37,466
and that's the truth.

1583
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:42,889
Sometimes you hurt the ones you love
the most. I don't know why.

1584
01:34:42,973 --> 01:34:46,433
You know, if I read more
Russian novels, then...

1585
01:34:50,313 --> 01:34:51,897
Anyway...

1586
01:34:56,694 --> 01:35:00,405
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am for what I did.

1587
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:06,202
I hope you'll
forgive me eventually.

1588
01:35:11,124 --> 01:35:12,458
Thank you.

1589
01:37:40,814 --> 01:37:42,188
Nice, huh?
This is big.

1590
01:37:42,272 --> 01:37:45,150
It's bigger than
I thought it would be.

1591
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:46,818
Okay.

1592
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:49,006
Did you remember the lamp? Thank God.
Here it is. Here.

1593
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:50,132
Honey, where do you want this?

1594
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:51,967
Do you want it on your desk?
Do you want it next to the bed?

1595
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,199
Guys, I've got it.

1596
01:37:53,283 --> 01:37:56,078
I think the sheets
are in here. Mom.

1597
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,830
Guys, I can do it, okay?
No, no, I can do it.

1598
01:37:58,914 --> 01:37:59,956
Mom.

1599
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,290
Is that...

1600
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:04,001
Mom, I got it.
I can do it.

1601
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:08,089
Thanks. Can I just have a minute,
please? Okay?

1602
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:10,007
Okay.
Okay.

1603
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:11,134
Okay?

1604
01:38:11,217 --> 01:38:12,300
Okay.

1605
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:14,679
Great.

1606
01:39:30,629 --> 01:39:31,795
Where'd you guys go?

1607
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,088
We had to move the car.

1608
01:39:33,174 --> 01:39:34,965
I thought you left.

1609
01:39:36,009 --> 01:39:37,801
We wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1610
01:39:37,886 --> 01:39:39,345
Give us some credit.

1611
01:39:45,727 --> 01:39:47,895
It's gonna be weird
not having you around anymore.

1612
01:39:47,979 --> 01:39:50,898
Sorry to leave you
alone with them.

1613
01:39:50,982 --> 01:39:52,900
It'll be okay.

1614
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:09,499
Hey, guys, come on.

1615
01:40:14,672 --> 01:40:18,091
Hey, it's okay.
I'll speak to you soon, okay?

1616
01:40:23,681 --> 01:40:24,847
Okay.

1617
01:41:35,751 --> 01:41:39,712
I don't think you guys
should break up.

1618
01:41:39,796 --> 01:41:41,672
No? Why's that?

1619
01:41:43,759 --> 01:41:45,634
I think you're too old.

1620
01:41:48,555 --> 01:41:50,182
Thanks, Laser.
