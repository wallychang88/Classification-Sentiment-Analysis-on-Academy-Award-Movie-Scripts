that particle, estimating its value at, uh, .025,

48
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,874
would entail a loss

is useless without a method
of smuggling it abroad.

for keeping string in.

174
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,290
Wouldn't you infinitely prefer thé
comparative purity of an old biscuit tin?

175
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,499
Southend Pier!

176
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,374
Oh, I... I've thought for years
to cut loose from it all,

177
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,957
but I never had thé courage.

178
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,957

181
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,832
Forgive me.

182
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,207
Come and see thé casting room.

183
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,499
We're busy at present on one
of our export lines. Paperweights.

184
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,582
We ship a thousand a week over to France.

185
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,082
Here's a little...speciality.

186
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,915
(MUSIC PLAYING)

187
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,249
Quite a simple process, really.

188
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,249
Pour thé molten lead into
thé mould, allow it to harden.

189
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,582
As soon as it's cool,
it's sprayed with gold paint...

190
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,624
And then it's ready to be shipped to France.

191
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,415
"Slave, I have set my life upon a cast."

192
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,290
Richard III.

193
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,124
I believe it's turning into a self-portrait.

194
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,540
I shall call him "The Slave."

195
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,707
Oh, my dear Holland, I'm so sorry.
You're still feeling bad.

196
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,082
The heat of that place. I always forget.

197
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,749
No, it wasn't thé heat.
I'm used to that in my job.

198
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,999
Oh, really?

199
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,874
Your place is very similar to thé refinery.

200
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,582
Really? I had no idea.

201
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,499
We turn gold into bars,
you turn lead into Eiffel Towers.

202
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:46,249
- That's thé only difference.
- Only! if I had gold to deal with...

203
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,707
- Yes?
- Ah, an idle dream.

204
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,582
- Must be a big responsibility.
- No, not really.

205
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,415
If anyone did rob our van,

206
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,832
well, it's virtually impossible to dispose
of stolen bullion,

207
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,082
in this country, at any rate.

208
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,624
Yes. Oh, yes, I imagine so.

209
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,290
But if it could be smuggled abroad...

210
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,999
- What a hope.
- Well, I wouldn't say it's out of thé question.

211
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,749
Saying one had thé means
of melting thé stuff down.

212
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,207
In thé kitchen stove? What a job.

213
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,540
Oh, of course not.

214
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,624
It would mean taking on a partner.

215
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,582
Ah, Risky. Bringing other people in.

216
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,707
That would be essential, in any case.

217
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,290
No one person could rob our van unaided.

218
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,749
- You mean, he'd need accomplices?
- Precisely.

219
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,124
A gang.

220
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,624
A gang? Not so easy to come by.

221
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,707
Oh, I don't know.

222
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,499
With gold selling on
thé continental black market

223
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,207
at two and a half times its standard price?

224
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,249
I mean, quite a few people

225
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,207
would be willing to chance
an arm for half a million.

226
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,874
Yes, but how...

227
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,582
How would you get your
gold across to thé continent?

228
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,624
Well.

229
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,790
Supposing one had thé right sort of partner,

230
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,707
in thé form of, uh, shall we say...

231
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,624
Eiffel Tower paperweights?

(CHUCKLING)

233
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,790
By Jove, Holland, it's a good job
we are both honest men.

234
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,707
It is indeed, Pendlebury.

235

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

236
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,165
Come in.

237
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,082
Oh, there you are, Holland.
Come in and sit down.

238
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,707
Well, Holland, you've been quite
thé subject of discussion lately.

239
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,707
Don't look so worried, man.

240
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,749
I've managed to persuade
thé chief cashier to give you a leg up.

241
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,749
- A leg up, sir?
- Promotion.

242
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,790
You're going up to foreign exchange.

243
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,332
No more uncomfortable journeys
in that dreary van.

244
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,082
- But, sir...
- Now, now, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.

245
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,415
Don't bother to thank me, man.

246
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,165
I told Abercrombie that you can start
with him next Monday.

247
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,249
- But I can't, sir!
- Why not?

248
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,915
Because, um... Because...

249
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,957
I'm too old to change my views now, sir.

250
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,749
Ah, one's never too old to better oneself.

251
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,915
Think what you can do
with an extra 15 shillings a week!

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,457
But sir, I like thé bullion office.
It holds all I ever wished for.

253
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,832
The trouble with you, Holland,

254
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,749
if I may speak frankly,
is that you haven't enough ambition.

255
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,874
When a good opportunity comes along,
grab it with both hands!

256
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,832
It may not occur again.

257
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,957
Very good, sir. I'll follow your advice.

258
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,249
- So it's now or never.
- This week. Friday's delivery.

259
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,040
- Three days to go.
- Two desperadoes to find.

260
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,582
- Bait.
- Bait?

261
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,332
I said, bait. Trap 'em!

- Hello, Mr Pendlebury!
- Hello!

Why, good evening. Ha!

265
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,499
By Jove, what a bit of luck!
Just thé man I wanted to see.

- What's thé trouble?
- That safe in my office.

267
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,999
Something's gone wrong with thé lock.

268
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,582
- I'll send a man round tomorrow.
- I wish you would.

269
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,749
It worries me a little, leaving thé staff wages
there overnight.

270
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,124
You know thé address,
"Gewgaws, Limited."

271
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,624
"Gewgaws, limited."
You know, thé back of Rathbing Place, there.

272
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,415
Fancy leaving all that money there.

273
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,040
Why, anybody could break into thé place
tonight, and help themselves!

- Where are those guns?
- Guns?

279
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,790
Yes. It's essential that we're armed.

280
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,790
- Here they are. Here's yours.
- Ls it loaded?

281
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,082
Yes. It's a present from Margate.
It fires a stick of rock.

282
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,915
The safe's in thé office, over there.

283
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,082
You squeeze behind that bench,
and surprise anyone making for thé safe.

284
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,874
I'm going over here, to prevent
an escape through thé packing room.

- Yes, Guv. I'm on thé level.

- Yes, Guv. I swear it.

I'd do it. That's all I want.

exactly an honest penny.

00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,249
my friend Mr Holland
will outline what we have in mind.

343
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,249
I must apologize, gentlemen,
for thé somewhat informal manner

344
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,415
in which we effected our introduction.

345
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,790
But my colleague and I

346
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,040
have a certain proposition
which we'd like to put to you.

347
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,332
I might almost call it
a "gilt-edged proposition."

348
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,040
Although, paradoxically,
it does entail a measure of risk.

349
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:52,540
However, when I quote
thé anticipated dividend,

350
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,707
I'm sure that you will
both agree with me that thé...

351
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,915
(CLATTERING)

352
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,957
Not another one, surely.

353
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,415
Tell him we're suited.

354
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,582
- Everything all right here, sir?
- Yes, thank you, officer.

355
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,040
My, uh, my partner
and I are busy stock-taking.

356
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,415
- Only I saw thé window open, you see?
- Oh, yes, yes.

357
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,999
I'll close it. Thank you very much.

358
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,832
- Good night, officer.
- Good night, sir.

359
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,499
And, um, here's thé order
for tomorrow's consignment.

360
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:36,082
Somewhat larger than I expected, 212 bars.

361
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,749
- That won't worry me, sir.
- Dependable to thé last.

362
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,290
- I'm going to miss you, Holland.
- You're very kind, sir.

363
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,332
I shall always have thé happiest memories
of thé dear old bullion office.

364
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,332
Has Mr Abercrombie spoken
to you about your holiday?

365
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,499
- Yes, sir. I'm going to Paris.
- Paris, eh?

366
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,874
You're stepping out, Holland.

367
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,124
Wonderful, isn't it,
what a little extra money will do.

368
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,665
Yes. It's going to make a big difference to me.

369
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,332
Oh!

370
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,707
- Have a go out on your own now.
- Thank you, mate.

371
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,457
That's it. And how are you getting on?

372
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,415
No, you must show some sense of proportion.

373
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,082
Look at that seagull.
It's bigger than thé funnel.

374
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,749
Can't I do something else, Guv?
Sell matches, or boot laces?

375
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,207
No, no. Mr Holland specified
a pavement artist,

376
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,457
and a pavement artist it's got to be.

377
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,957
Come on, try again. It's coming slowly.

378
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,582
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

379
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,457
You're teaching thé wrong man.

380
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,582
Well, I had to change them over.
Shorty can't ride a bicycle.

381
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:07,082
- Doesn't look as if he can, either.
- We're learnin' him.

382
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,249
- Why couldn't you learn Shorty?
- Because Lackery's color-blind.

383
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,540
- What's that got to do with it?
- Oh, my dear Holland,

384
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,207
do use your intelligence,
if a policeman were to come along

385
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,749
and see a green sunset over a purple sea...

386
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,915
All right, all right. Spare me thé details.

387
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,957
- Is everything else fixed?
- Yes, thé map's in thé office.

388
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,249
Come along, boys, this is thé setup.

389
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,582
Uh, Mr Fisher will be sitting here.

390
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,624
The van will stop in front of him at 4:30.

391
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,707
A minute later, thé guard
will appear round this corner,

392
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,540
and you, Pendlebury, will detain
him for at least half a minute.

393
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,790
Ask him for a light, ask him anything,
but keep him there.

394
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,582
We must have those 30 seconds.

395
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,415
- Edgar!
- I beg your pardon?

396
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,874
Isn't one supposed to say
that when one's being briefed?

397
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,790
- On my rare visits to thé kinema...
- The word is "Roger."

398
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,374
- Oh, Roger! How silly of me.
- To continue.

399
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,457
As soon as we've captured thé van,

400
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,415
Mr Wood and Mr Pendlebury
will proceed straight to thé warehouse.

401
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,999
Bit risky, isn't it?

402
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,582
Making Mr Pendlebury go there,
after thé guard's seen him?

403
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,165
It's a risk we must take.

404
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,749
We need everyone.
We've more than 200 bars to move,

405
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,749
and I must have my alibi.

406
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:14,374
You've got to gag me,
bind me, tear my clothes, roll me in thé dust.

407
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,374
We can't afford to waste one second.

408
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,790
Okay. You're thé boss.

409
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:18,915
Yes.

410
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,499
Yes, that's right. I am.

411
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:32,999
Two hundred and eleven,
two hundred and twelve.

412
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:37,624
Ah, Mr Richards. Your deposit
will be returned in thé usual way

413
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,290
as soon as thé gold enters thé bank.

414
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,332
Uh, you're both, uh...

415
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,332
Oi! Oi!

416
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,207
- Here, no you don't.
- Don't what?

417
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,582
I saw you pinch it.

418
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,624
Good gracious,
whatever must you think of me.

419
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:31,915
I think you're thé bloke what pinched

420
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,249
my "Monarch of thé Glen" last week.

421
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,874
Oh, no, I assure you. Pinch a Landseer, me?

422
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,415
Well, you better come quiet.

423
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,082
If you'll have five minutes'
patience, I'll explain.

424
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,915
Five minutes?
Oi, Charlie, get on thé blower. 999.

425
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,082
No, no, no.

426
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,832
Come on, come along with me.

427
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,957
He's picked a wrong 'un this time.

428
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,415
No, no, no! It's all a ghastly mistake, officer.

429
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,874
I'm completely innocent.

430
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,832
- Did you see that car?
- Yes, sir. Police car.

431
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,790
What? Nothing to be afraid of there, sir.
Bloke was a copper.

432
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,040
L... It's some trick.

433
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,165
I'm sure it's thé same
car that followed us thé other day.

434
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,374
You want me to go
and look round thé corner, sir?

(CROWD CLAMOURING)

436
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,499
It's all a mistake, officer.

437

You got a flat tire there, mate!

What's this?

441
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,749
Our van. Stolen. Load of bullion.
Kidnapped thé boss.

Containing bullion, value one million pounds,

of Queen Victoria Street.

Maroon-colored van, LKL638,

stolen from thé vicinity
of Queen Victoria Street.

453

- Cor, what a weight!
- The others will be here soon.

454
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,207
Hoi! Hoi, Shorty.

455
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,374
They got Mr Pendlebury.

00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,165
- Who has?
- The cops, of course!

457
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,457
I saw a crowd down there.
The driver of thé van's there.

458
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,165
There's two cops, and they're holding him.

459
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,790
Will he grass?

460
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,749
Will he squeal? Will he split?

461
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,749
- No.
- Then it don't matter.

462
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,415

and move down here to meet Sergeant Wilson.

468
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,332
Rose, come with me.

469
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,082
We'd better have a look at those warehouses.

470
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,832
That's all right. Leave thé rest.

471
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,082
- Blimey, guv'nor, why?
- Help my alibi.

472
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,415
Turn it up, Guv. There's 75,000 quid in there.

473
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:50,957
- I said, leave it.
- A ruddy waste.

There's many a starving bloke'd
be glad of that lot.

475

Come on, now.

476
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,249
- Fix me up.
- No, behind you.

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,915
Well, stand still.

479
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,207
What's that?

480
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,915
You turn. It's easier.

481
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,124
Other way. Okay.

482
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,582
Hey! Look!

483
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,749
Hey. Hey!

484
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,332
- Come on! Scram!
- Wait! Wait!

485
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,749
Mess me up! Mr Fisher!

486
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,290
Mr Wood!

487
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,707
Mess me up! It's essential!

488
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,582
Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

489
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,749
Wait! You can't leave me like this.

490
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,165
Wait. Wait, stop.

491
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,332
Help!

492
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:14,249
Help! Help!

493
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,124
Can you see from down there?

494
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,457
Help!

495
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,165
- Sir! inspector Talbot! Sir!
- I'll get you!

496
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,082
Fight going on over there.

497
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,707
Purely an oversight, officer.
I had something on my mind.

498
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,832
Three pictures in a week I missed from there.

499
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:01,665
You can't accuse him of
taking those others, too.

500
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,290
I should think not.

501
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:07,165
I'm no thief, officer.
My character's an open book.

502
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,749
Well?

503
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,582
Well, you might as well know.

504
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,915
I was lying. I am a thief.

505
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,582
It was madness to attempt it.

506
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,040
We weren't cut out for crime, either of us.

507
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,082
- We?
- My partner and I.

508
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,165
Your partner?

509
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,415
If you're working with a fence
who's got them other pictures...

510
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,915
Shh. Carry on.

511
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,582
Oh, I make no excuses.

512
00:38:55,666 --> 00:39:00,415
All my life it's been my ambition to surround
myself with rare and beautiful things.

513
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,749
Suddenly faced with
this golden opportunity...

514
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,040
Here. You call that picture of mine
rare and beautiful?

515
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,249
Since you will keep on
interrupting me, you ought to know...

516
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,957
It's a charming example of an early Rochet,

517
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:17,290
while he was still
under thé influence of Corot.

518
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,624
Oh, yeah.

519
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,374
- How much is it worth?
- Ten pounds,

520
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,249
to those who can afford it.

521
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,915
Oh, blimey. I've got it marked up at five bob.

522
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,207
- Here, what about this charge?
- Let him go.

523
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,915
I've got to get back
before they sell that picture!

524
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,332
Your lucky day, it seems.

525
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,415
All right. Case dismissed. Off you go.

526
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:47,832
Yes, about five minutes ago. Who, sir?

527
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,582
Oh, yes, we've got him, all right.

528
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,540
He's here now, giving us a statement.

529
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,040
Yes, he's told us quite a lot already.

530
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,499
Go on. Hop it.

531
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,040
Yes.

532
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,624
Yes, you can depend on that, sir.

533
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,457
We'll get all we can out of him.

534
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,457
I see.

535
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,457
Yes, he stood it pretty well.

536
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,415
Yes, we'll look after him all right, sir.

537
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,832
We're fixing him up
with some dry clothes now.

538
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:28,665
Yes, I agree, sir. We're up
against some very tough customers.

539
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,290
- Here, what are you doin'?
- They'll have to put a new floor in.

540
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,165
He'll be able to afford it.

541
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,499
Get on with thé job.

542
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,207
You make me sick.

543
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,999
What's happened?

544
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:52,665
- She only just made it.
- Here! I thought you was pinched.

545
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,124
- No, it's Holland they've got.
- Holland?

546
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,499
I was in thé police station when they
brought him in, under arrest.

547
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,165
- You sure of that?
- Of course I'm sure!

548
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,915
Hé was all dripping wet.
There were two policemen holding him.

549
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,165
They must have seen everything.

550
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,124
- We gotta blow.
- Nah, wait a minute.

551
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,415
Can they connect you with him? I don't know.

552
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,290
We both live at thé same house, but...

553
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,874
- What?
- The map!

554
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,165
The map showing thé route
from here to thé warehouse.

555
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,540
- Holland took it home with him.
- Now we are done for.

556
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,749
No, we're not. You finish thé job.

557
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,332
- Come on.
- Where to?

558
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,332
Your place.
If they ain't searched his room yet.

559
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,082
Too late.

560
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,582
- Helmet's in thé hall.
- You'll have to go in alone, Guv.

561
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,582
Might be somebody I know.

562
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,957
But they're there already.

563
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,915
There's still a chance
they haven't found it yet.

564
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,124
Go on, get weaving.

565
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,499
But surely you must have some suspicion.

566
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,582
Who work thé hoist rackets in this territory?

567
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:58,874
Beg pardon, lady?

568
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,415
Oh, really, I can't make myself much plainer.

569
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,957
Which hoodlums around here
specialize in toby jobs?

570
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,915
- Holland!
- Pendlebury!

571
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:02,249
Determination, pluck and fortitude
worthy of thé highest praise.

572
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,207
Come along, now.
We mustn't keep him waiting.

They must never be touched.

This "R" stands for "reserve stock."

584
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,749
These crates will remain in
our Paris warehouse.

585
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,832
I've sent instructions
to our young lady over there,

Oh, I estimate about two weeks here.

592
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,040
And then a week in Paris, to find our market,

593
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:34,957

back here till it all blows over...

01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,124
# We may be slow on thé feather... #

853
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,290
Shh. Sit down girls.

854
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,540
These gentlemen are from thé firm

855
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,582
that makes thé Eiffel Tower models

856
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:05,040
that some of you bought in Paris.

857
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,249
It appears that, by a mistake,

858
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:09,874
you were sold a new experimental type

859
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:11,540
which they're anxious to have back.

860
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,915
They'll exchange them for others
equally good.

861
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:18,457
Also and I consider this most generous...

862
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,207
They will give ten shillings

863
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,332
to each girl who helps them in this way.

864
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,749
(ALL CHATTERING)

865
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,415
Here you are. And for you.

866
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:46,040
There's yours. And that's for you. Thank you.

867
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:49,457
One, two, three, four, five.

868
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:53,165
Only five. Who bought thé sixth one?

869
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,124
Who bought thé sixth?

870
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,415
June Edwards bought one.

871
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,957
You have one, too, have you dear?

872
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,749
Where is it, June? In here?

873
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:06,499
Now, don't be silly, June, dear.

874
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:08,290
Wouldn't you like to have ten shillings...

875
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:11,832
- Another one just as nice?
- Oh, come, come.

876
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,040
Think of all
thé sweeties you could buy with this.

877
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,790
There we are.

878
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,957
Just as pretty, isn't it?

879
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,499
Really, June. Look at them
together and you'll see.

880
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,249
There's no difference, is there?

881
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,749
Now, come on. Tell us. What's thé difference?

882
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,499
That one is mine.

883
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:36,082
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't force thé child to give it up.

884
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,749
- Does thé odd one really matter?
- Indeed, it does, madam.

885
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,582
- Were it to fall into thé hands of...
- A business rival.

886
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,832
- Yes.
- But that won't happen.

887
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,457
We've kept you too long as it is.
Thank you very much.

888
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:49,249
But, but I...but...what?

889
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,415
Oh. That's interesting.

890
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,915
I bought a pyramid stud box
in Cairo during thé war.

891
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,290
- I suppose that was made here too.
- I expect so.

892
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,915
We send stuff all over thé world.

893
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,040
- Just finished, sir.
- Good.

894
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,999
You don't keep a record
of where thé van goes?

895
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:12,499
Anyone takes thé blooming thing
when they feel like it.

896
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,290
Away for a week, just recently, it was.

897
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,165
No recollection of who
had it that particular afternoon?

898
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,249
Well...

899
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,207
I've an idea it was thé boss.

900
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,457
- Mr Pendlebury.
- Mr Pendlebury.

901
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:27,207
But I'm not really sure, and I can't ask him
'cause he's away in Paris.

902
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,582
In Paris? Oh, well. Thanks.

903
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:31,999
All right. Hendon.

904
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,415
But, Dutch, robbing a child...

905
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,915
it won't be robbing her. It'll simply be a swap.

906
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,457
If only you had let me talk to that woman.

907
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:46,499
I couldn't, Al.
She was getting suspicious as it was.

908
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,499
Look.

909
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:15,749
- Isn't George here today?
- No. I'm taking his place today.

910
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,249
Your boyfriend's on duty in there.

911
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,915
Exhibition's straight ahead, sir.

912
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,790
Straight ahead for thé exhibition, sir.

913
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:24,290
On thé steering wheel
of a car stolen last night in Piccadilly...

914
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:27,374
And abandoned two hours later near Croydon.

915
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:33,082
In thé west gallery, you will find a display
from thé criminal records office

916
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,999
containing, for example,

917
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:39,457
thé actual dossier of a man now
serving a sentence for housebreaking.

918
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:43,082
It contains all his known
aliases and nicknames...

919
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:45,874
And those of his relatives and friends.

920
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,999
Next door, a fingerprint expert
is ready to take...

921
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

922
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,457
Where have you been all this time?

923
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:57,415
I've been to Paris,
and I brought this back for you.

924
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,624
I say, that is nice of you.
What a beautiful present.

925
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,415
It's a paperweight. Put it on those papers.

926
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,832
Thank you very much indeed.

927
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:07,665
- Cheerio.
- Bye-bye.

928
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,249
- Now what do we do?
- Tell him thé same story.

929
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,582
- Excuse me.
- One moment, sir.

930
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,290
A demonstration of police scientists

931
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,957
that work on an actual case...

932
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,582
The recent big gold robbery.

933
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:24,915
CID officers have taken samples
of dust from four different vans...

934
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,124
- Take your fingerprints, sir?
- No.

935
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,957
We are testing those samples
for gold content.

936
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:33,415
- Had thé van repaired?
- Yes. Completely new floor.

937
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,207
The dust is being placed in nitric acid,

938
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:39,749
which will dissolve any metal
with thé exception of gold.

939
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:43,290
That's funny. I've just come from thé place
where they make these things.

940
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:44,415
Pretty, isn't it?

941
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,874
My little girlfriend brought it back from Paris.

942
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:48,124
Paris.

943
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,415
- Try this.
- Come on. Let's get out here.

944
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,665
No! The evidence!

945
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,749
- Run, Dutch! Run!
- Stop those men!

946
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:14,207
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

947
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:17,290
- Stop those two!
- Break it up!

948
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,415
- Stop those men!
- Stop that woman!

949
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,249
- Where'd they go?
- There they are!

950
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,957
Stop that woman!

951
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,040
Stop them, Charlie!

952
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,999
Stop him, Charlie! Stop them!

953
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:43,915
Stop thé men! Stop them!
Which way did they go?

954
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:48,249
Attention, everyone, please.
Attention, everyone, please.

955
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,415
Two dangerous men
are at large in this building.

956
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,082
There he is!

957
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:02,040
You can assist thé police
by keeping thé gangways clear.

958
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,915
Now keep calm and avoid crowding.

959
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:05,957
Do not panic.

960
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,874
Attention, everyone, please.

961
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,582
The men are now believed to be
in thé east gallery.

962
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:21,749
Cut them off that way!

963
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,665
Psst!

964
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:28,415
Help thé police by leaving
thé gangways clear.

965
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:32,624
Keep calm. Avoid crowding. Don't panic.

966
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,749
The public can assist thé police
by keeping thé gangways clear.

967
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:43,915
Now keep calm, do not panic
and avoid crowding.

968
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,915
Keep calm. Avoid crowding.

969
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,874
Don't panic. Don't panic!

970
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,749

Am proceeding south

# Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O

1024
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:23,540
# And on his farm
he had some turkeys E-I-E-I-O

# Here a baa, there a baa

Would you mind giving me a lift
to thé police box?

1035
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,749
They're flashing for me.

1036

# Everywhere a gobble gobble

1037
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:02,082
# Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O

# And on that farm he had some pigs

01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,165
Nice to have music when

Well, thank you very much, sir.

1044

Hello. All cars from M2GW.

1045
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,582

1046
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,707

01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,415
Stop! Oi! Stop him!

1051
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,624
Instead of changing
as usual at Charring Cross,

1052
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,874
I came straight on to Rio de Janeiro,

1053
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,790
"Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease."

1054
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:22,207
Pendlebury. Plus six Eiffel Towers.

1055
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,332
- How much did they fetch?
- 25,000 pounds.

1056
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:27,790
Enough to keep me for one year

1057
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,415
in thé style to which I was,
um, unaccustomed.

1058
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:33,582
Hello there. By Jove, that was a party
you gave thé other evening.

1059
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:35,707
We should give a few like it
at thé embassy, what?

1060
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,165
Your Excellency is very kind.

1061
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,582
Done a lot for our prestige out here.

1062
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:42,707
Worth a battleship. Jolly good
show. Well done.

1063
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,707
