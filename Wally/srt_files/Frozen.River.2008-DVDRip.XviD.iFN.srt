1
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,085
Are they
here yet?

2
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,787
Hey, little sleepy head.

3
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,688
Because I'm ready.

4
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:02,146
You really are ready,
aren't you?

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,851
Whoa, whoa!
Wait a second! Your coat!

6
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,191
We're all ready for you.

7
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,143
Just need that balloon
payment to unload.

8
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:35,646
We have it. It's just they
called Troy from Titus last night.

9
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,716
The ski place?

10
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,686
Do you have
the $4,372 or not?

11
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:45,072
It was some emergency
with the lift.

12
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,574
And he just took
off out of here

13
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:49,261
without thinking,
with the money.

14
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,462
Completely forgot
you were coming.

15
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,762
So as soon
as he gets back...

16
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,265
When's he getting back?

17
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,935
When you come with the other half,
I'll have it.

18
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,254
You don't get the other half
until I get the cash.

19
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:02,640
This is the second time
you've dragged me out here.

20
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,675
If you can't come up
with it by Christmas,

21
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,544
you've lost your
$1,500 deposit.

22
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,265
Look, Mr. Versailles,

23
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,817
I've got a good job
at Yankee One Dollar.

24
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,587
They're probably going to make
me manager right after Christmas,

25
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,356
so I can definitely
make the payments

26
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,790
if you just leave
the house.

27
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,795
Just call me when you have
the balloon payment.

28
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,115
I'll call you.

29
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:39,110
RICKY: Where are
they going?

30
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,211
I'll get it back.
I promise.

31
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:51,856
You got to get
ready for school.

32
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,074
You're going to
miss the bus.

33
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,310
I can get a job,
you know.

34
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,795
You're 15, T.J.

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,129
They won't ask
any questions.

36
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,731
You're finishing school.

37
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,832
Mom, you think
we can make a living

38
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,267
on what you make
at Yankee Dollar?

39
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:06,320
You're going to school.

40
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,289
I bet I could make
more than you do.

41
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,846
Where's Daddy?

42
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,249
RAY: He'll be back.

43
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,285
Aren't we even
going to look for him?

44
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,170
I'm going to work,
and you're going to school.

45
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,354
What, that's it?

46
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:25,039
Where did he go?

47
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,575
On a business trip.

48
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,576
When is he coming home?

49
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:30,961
I don't know, Ricky.

50
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:33,598
I can't believe you're not
even going to look for him.

51
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,033
Where? Where do I look?

52
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,601
The reservation!

53
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,870
He's probably
in Atlantic City by now.

54
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,542
The glove compartment,
that was so stupid.

55
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:47,344
You're going to school.

56
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,846
There you go.

57
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,418
Hey. Lunch money.

58
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,724
Okay.

59
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,712
Go on. You're going
to miss the bus.

60
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,346
Oh, fuck.

61
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,997

Two, three, four.

$2.74.

No, make that $7.74.

78
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,025
Okay.

79
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:07,485
Did you see a Dodge Spirit
in here last night? Dark green?

80
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,053
Spirit? No.

81
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,304
But I only worked
until 9:00.

82
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,256
You can try asking inside,
if you want.

83
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,491
No, that's okay.

84
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:17,695

Afternoon session
is over.

91
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,308
The next session
starts at 6:30.

92
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,442
I don't want to play.

93
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,911
I just need to look
around for a second.

94
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,413
You have to pay the $5.

95
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,681
Look, I'll stand
at the door.

96
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:12,116
I won't even go inside.

97
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:14,568
I just need to see
if my husband's in there.

98
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,037
You have to pay
the admission.

99
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,426
He's gambling away
the money for our house.

100
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,363
What does he look like?

101
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:30,334
Long, brown hair.
Tall. Skinny.

102
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,536
Ponytail.

103
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,237
No. He's not in there.

104
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:35,807
Can I just look?

105
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,209
Lady, I just told you,
he's not in there.

106
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,260
Hey!

107
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,497
Hey! Hello! Hey!

108
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,552
That's my car.

109
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,974
What are you doing
with my car?

110
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,010
That? I found it.

111
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,012
You stole it?
- Had the keys in it.

112
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,748
And so you just took it?

113
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:56,153
We'll see what the troopers
have to say about that!

114
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,306
Go ahead. They got
no jurisdiction here.

115
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,774
This is Mohawk territory.

116
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,278
Troy?

117
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,764
You in there?

118
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:12,152
If you are,
you better come out.

119
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:14,421
Versailles says that if we get
the money to him by Christmas,

120
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,357
we won't lose our deposit.

121
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,309
I think we need
to talk about this, Troy.

122
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,477
Come on out.

123
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,813
Troy?

124
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,052
I mean it, honey.
Come on out.

125
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:38,162
The Tribal Police don't like people
shooting holes in other people's houses.

126
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:42,816
This is New York State, so quit the
bullshit and give me my goddamn keys!

127
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,914
LILA: This camper belongs
to my brother-in-law.

128
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,298
He won't like this.

129
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,066
Then you should
quit stealing cars.

130
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,835
I thought
it was abandoned.

131
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,271
The guy driving it
got on a bus.

132
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,974
A bus? To where?

133
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,827
New York. Buffalo.
I'm not sure.

134
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,386
Hello? Yeah, what is it?

135
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,805
Well, there's a hard-boiled egg
in the fridge.

136
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,975
Well, then take out the yolk.

137
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,380
Look, T.J., I don't have
time for this right now.

138
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:49,684
No. I'm not looking
for him.

139
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,635
I got to go.

140
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,559
Shit!

141
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,968
I'm not leaving it.

142
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,938
I got a friend
who might buy that.

143
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:29,490
It's not for sale.

144
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,926
He'll pay more than
it's worth. Maybe 2,000.

145
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,678
Why's that?

146
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,764
He's a smuggler.

147
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:40,801
He's always looking for cars
with button-release trunks.

148
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,972
You don't need
papers or anything.

149
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,325
Where does he live?

150
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,728
Through the woods.
Not far.

151
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,629
What's in it for you?

152
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,232
He'll give me something
for finding it.

153
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,140
If you try anything,
I'm not afraid to use this.

154
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,143
Yeah.

155
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,493
Turn up there.
- Where?

156
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,562
Up at those trees.

157
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:27,981
There's no road.

158
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,050
There's a path.

159
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,753
It's not far.

160
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:43,313
I'm not crossing that.

161
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,366
Don't worry.
There's no black ice.

162
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,235
That's Canada.

163
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:50,203
That's Mohawk land.

164
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:52,907
The rez is on both
sides of the river.

165
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,207
What about
the border patrol?

166
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,243
There's no border.

167
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,312
I'm still
not crossing that.

168
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:00,915
Don't worry.
It'll hold a Spirit.

169
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,216
I've seen semis cross it.

170
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,771
The only other way is
the Cornwall Bridge,

171
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,606
and they're not going
to let you take that.

172
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,646
They plow it
and everything.

173
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,885
This is
so fucking stupid.

174
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,817
Better pick up some speed
to get up the bank.

175
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:13,203
It's just on the other
side of those trees.

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,667
LILA: Honk the horn.

177
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:48,872
No.

178
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,191
Keep your mouth shut.
Just keep it shut. Okay?

179
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,762
Thunder, shut up!

180
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,213
Get back under there!

181
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,737
He don't like
whites, Lila.

182
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:05,372
LILA: Sorry.
And you're late.

183
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:06,757
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:09,509
I shouldn't even
be dealing with you.

185
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,679
Count it.

186
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,829
What's going on here?

187
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,598
Just count it.

188
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,289
Come on. How much?

189
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,441
How much is there?

190
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,745
1,200.

191
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,353
Who the fuck are they?

192
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,890
Never mind.

193
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:43,427
I'm not going anywhere until
those people get out of my trunk.

194
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,945
I'll give you half.
Now, let's go.

195
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,047
Let's go!

196
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,615
I'm not taking them
across the border.

197
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,367
It's a crime.
- There's no border here.

198
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,285
This is free trade
between nations.

199
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:53,386
This isn't a nation.

200
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:55,021
Let's go.

201
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,962
Why'd your husband
leave you?

202
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,396
Fuck you.

203
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,166
Maybe he wanted
a younger woman.

204
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,385
That's what usually happens.

205
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,622
I never have to worry about that.
My husband's dead.

206
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:31,675
He went down
in the river on a run.

207
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,827
They never found him.

208
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:37,147
Probably tangled in the
river weeds somewhere.

209
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,699
You better slow down.
There's ruts out here.

210
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,167
You could get us
stuck in one.

211
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,093
Keep going.

212
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,895
Keep going.

213
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,447
What if the troopers
stop us?

214
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:57,099
They're not going to stop you.
You're white.

215
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,236
LILA: Stop and wait for him
to come to the window.

216
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,712
Roll down your window.

217
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,549
Count it.

218
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,594
1,200.

219
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:06,569
Let's go.

220
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,497
Stop at those trees.

221
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,207
Now open the door.

222
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:29,459
Open it!

223
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,979
Now get out.

224
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,346
You can't have my car.
- Get out!

225
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,216
You can't have
my car. No!

226
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:25,315
I told you not to use that
thing when I'm not here.

227
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,968
If I get it working,
I can sell it.

228
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:31,821
I don't care. Don't use
that thing when I'm not here!

229
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,625
Rent-to-Own called.

230
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,743
They said they're
coming to get the TV

231
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,295
if you don't pay
by 4:00 tomorrow.

232
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,233
Did you find him?

233
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,502
No.

234
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,354
Where was the car?

235
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,840
At the bus stop
on the rez.

236
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,208
I bet he went
to Atlantic City.

237
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,377
You don't know that.

238
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,012
Yeah, well,
you can find out.

239
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,180
Go to the bus station, see what
buses came through last night.

240
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:58,748
And what?
Chase him across the country?

241
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,900
Miss work? No.

242
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:06,890
What happened
to your head?

243
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,608
Nothing.

244
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,994
What, did you get
in a fight with somebody?

245
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,763
It was no big deal.

246
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,182
Wait.
You got in a fight?

247
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:18,718
Some Indian chick
tried to steal your dad's car.

248
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,291
No way. I say we go back there
and kick some Mohawk ass.

249
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,042
It doesn't matter.

250
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,794
Where's your car?

251
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:29,963
I'll get it tomorrow.

252
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:31,582
Did you and Ricky eat?

253
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,516
That would be
kind of miraculous,

254
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,067
since there's
no food in the house.

255
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:35,769
There's food.

256
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,803
Popcorn and TANG?

257
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,587
Hi, Lila.
- Hi, Mick.

258
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,456
How's life
at the Bingo Palace?

259
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,125
Good. How's business?

260
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,493
Oh, you know.
It's okay.

261
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,897
How much for the Sierra?

262
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,015
Come on, Lila.

263
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:23,951
What? I've been saving up.

264
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:26,269
You know what.

265
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,205
Does Bernie Littlewolf
run your whole life?

266
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,140
No, but he told me
not to sell you a car.

267
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,926
I got to walk up 37 with
semis kicking up snow and mud

268
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:34,895
in my hair just
to get to work.

269
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,782
For you, all's I got is
the Civic and the Sundance.

270
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,052
I don't like Civics.

271
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,954
I figured.

272
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,625
Look, I'll give you
$1,000 for the Sierra.

273
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,277
Nothing with a trunk.

274
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,562
That thing's been sitting
out there for six months.

275
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,864
I don't want Bernie
in my face. Okay?

276
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,000
He doesn't have to know.

277
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:39,092
EVELYN: Chance!

278
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:42,528
Come back in here before
you freeze your ass off!

279
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,001
Chance!

280
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,556
Mommy?

281
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:32,762
What's going to happen to our old
house when we get our new house?

282
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:35,698
They're going to flatten it
and send it to China.

283
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,601
Then what?

284
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,871
They're going to melt it down
and make it into little toys.

285
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,774
Then what?

286
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,074
Then they're going
to send them back here

287
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:48,161
so I can sell them
at Yankee Dollar.

288
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:49,412
Can you get me some?

289
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,965
That's right.
- Yes!

290
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:08,231
I'm not eating
this again for dinner.

291
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:11,834
We just have to make it
till my paycheck on Friday.

292
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:13,670
What about Rent-to-Own?

293
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,305
What about them?

294
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,623
They said they're
coming to get the TV

295
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:18,491
if they don't get
a payment by 4:00.

296
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:19,992
You told me that already.

297
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,011
I know.

298
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,174
Here.

299
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:40,146
Lunch money.

300
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:42,865
I still don't see why you won't
just let me get a job with Mitch.

301
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,434
Who's Mitch?

302
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,836
He's got this whole business
he runs at school.

303
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,605
He sells pot to kids?

304
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,891
No, Mom, it's computers. Okay?
He fixes computers.

305
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:53,310
You're 15.

306
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,611
It's not going to happen,
so forget it.

307
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,380
This is so stupid!
We're going to lose the TV,

308
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,248
while I'm sitting in some Christmas
assembly when I could be out...

309
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,983
Your job is looking
after your brother.

310
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:02,585
Who's going to
take care of him?

311
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,194
T.J.: Come on, we're going.

312
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:14,764
Take them with you, honey.
You need them at recess.

313
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,885
I still say we go
down to the rez,

314
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:21,554
get the Sentra and
kick some serious butt.

315
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:49,565
Matt? Could I talk
to you for a minute?

316
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:58,274
I need to come
on full-time.

317
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,060
I see you
as a short-timer.

318
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:02,679
What is that?

319
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,981
Not here for long,
not really committed.

320
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,384
When I started working here, you
told me it would be six months

321
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,386
before I could
come on full-time.

322
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,037
That was almost
two years ago.

323
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,422
That's my opinion.

324
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:16,409
You know, I mean,
at least I show up.

325
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,179
Pat's always late.
She's late now. Late every day.

326
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,838
See you tomorrow.
- See you.

327
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,097
I want my half.

328
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,585
You hear me.
I want my half.

329
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:38,008
I'll give you the money
if you give me the car.

330
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,742
No way.

331
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:44,179
The money's gone.

332
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:52,989
Then I want to get
more of those Chinese.

333
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:07,870
It's going to cost me
to get that hole fixed.

334
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:09,789
I froze last night.

335
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,824
Look, I just need enough
for the balloon payment

336
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:15,729
for my doublewide, and then I'm
out of this. I'm no criminal.

337
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,714
It's not a crime.

338
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,015
You people can call it
what you want.

339
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,551
I just want my double.

340
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:30,292
I don't usually
work with whites.

341
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,650
How many bedrooms?

342
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,919
Three. I got kids.

343
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,188
How old?

344
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,474
Five and 15.

345
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,459
I got a boy.

346
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,343
Almost one.

347
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,014
He lives with
my mother-in-law.

348
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,233
She stole him from me.

349
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:55,602
Stole him?

350
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,571
Yeah. Right out
of the hospital.

351
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:00,856
Did you call the cops?

352
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:05,811
Tribal Police don't get
involved in stuff like that.

353
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,989
Get under there!

354
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:23,029
Bernie was asking if I'd
seen you. I told him no.

355
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,947
Thanks.

356
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,648
I don't want any
trouble from him, Lila.

357
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,567
Don't worry about it.

358
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:29,552
This guy's been
calling all morning.

359
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,354
He's got two
by the old tires.

360
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,905
Okay.

361
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:38,561
What's going on?

362
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,863
We got to pick them up.

363
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,050
What the hell
is going on?

364
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,003
Keep that thing down.

365
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,303
Roll down the window.
See what he wants.

366
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:24,557
RAY: What's going on here?
LILA: Just roll it down.

367
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:29,195
They don't like
the women driver.

368
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,597
Count it.

369
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,564
BRUNO: Pop the trunk.

370
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,001
Pop the trunk!

371
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,586
1,200.

372
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,087
BRUNO: Hey!

373
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,776
Get in.

374
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,903
Open it.

375
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:58,290
This should keep
them from running.

376
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:12,738
Why would
they want to run?

377
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:15,541
To get away
from the snakeheads.

378
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,409
What's that?

379
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,078
The snakeheads pay
to get them here,

380
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,913
and then they got to
work off what they owe.

381
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:25,685
How much does it cost?

382
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:29,672
40, 50,000. Depends on
where they're coming from.

383
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,991
Sometimes they got to work
for years to pay it off.

384
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:34,877
To get here?
No fucking way.

385
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:47,156
Yes. Yes. Hello.
Is this Mrs. Irene

386
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:49,141
Three Rivers?

387
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,379
Mrs. Three Rivers,
I have good news.

388
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,501
I am the business manager
of Mr. E.F. Three Rivers,

389
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:01,387
and I have been authorized

390
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:04,756
to inform you that you
have inherited money.

391
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:09,695
$26,750.

392
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:16,652
No, no, you have no obligation
whatsoever, Mrs. Three Rivers.

393
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:20,723
Just a small
processing fee of $29

394
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:25,560
will authorize me to send
your first installment

395
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:30,115
of $13,375.

396
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,823
You can place it on
any major credit card.

397
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,924
Sure, I can hold.

398
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,179
Yes.

399
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,515
Oh.

400
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,317
Okay.

401
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:52,954
Yes. Which credit card?

402
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,751
Are they always there?

403
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:06,369
Yeah.

404
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,972
They won't stop you unless
you give them a reason to.

405
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:11,040
You ever been caught?

406
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,175
Once.

407
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,009
What happened?

408
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,663
They gave me the choice of paying a
fine or spending three months in jail.

409
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:18,965
What did you do?

410
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,782
I paid the fine.

411
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:24,570
I made it back in two
nights of smuggling,

412
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:27,006
but back then it was
cigarettes and everybody did it.

413
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:29,642
Some of the troopers
were into it, too.

414
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:31,410
Smuggling?

415
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:32,911
Yeah.

416
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,806
LILA: Count it.
- Right, I know.

417
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,558
Make sure it's right.
I don't want to get stiffed.

418
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,159
Then why don't
you count it?

419
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,145
I got bad eyes.

420
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,048
Looks good.

421
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,936
Shit.

422
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,910
You're welcome.

423
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,341
What about mine?

424
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,276
Now we're even.

425
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:28,594
Um...

426
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:30,997
My mom told me to give you
her credit card number.

427
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,399
We only take cash
or money orders.

428
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,334
Well, she's going
to be a little late.

429
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,686
She's got three minutes.

430
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:08,617
Hey. It's okay, guys.
I got it right here.

431
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,707
It's $255.50, right?

432
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,546
Fifty-five.

433
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:28,905
RICKY: Mommy!

434
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,406
Hey! Come here!

435
00:38:36,997 --> 00:38:38,998
Who wants to go to PC, huh?

436
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:40,866
Me.
- Mmm-hmm.

437
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,485
You want to go
to the Chopper?

438
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,788
Where'd you get that?

439
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,490
Matt made me
assistant manager.

440
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:52,093
Buckle you in.

441
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:53,980
No way.

442
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,832
That so hard to believe?

443
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,800
It's been, like, two years.

444
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:01,003
Exactly. That's why
he gave me a bonus.

445
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:05,874
Do you want to go
to the Chopper or not?

446
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,244
Yeah.

447
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,197
But you better not
blow it all

448
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:14,417
on that bubble bath stuff,
which you never even open.

449
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,753
I'm going to use that
sooner than you think,

450
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,256
in a big fancy tub.

451
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:25,661
<i>MAN ON TV: Some big changes in
the weather department here.</i>

453

dip down big time, not only tonight,</i>

454
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:34,487

not all. We're expecting anywhere</i>

457
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,761

<i>Want a blast?
Want to crash?</i>

462
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,177
That's what he wants.

463
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,845
What?

464
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:01,797
For Christmas.

465
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:05,685
What is it, again?

466
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:09,138
Hot Wheels Blast
and Crash Track.

467
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:11,940
I'm getting something
even better than that.

468
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:14,042
Yeah? What?

469
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,245
The doublewide.

470
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,864
Don't mention it to Ricky yet,
just in case.

471
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,599
Yeah,

472
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,901
just in case.

473
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,971
It's for real this time.

474
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,909
What about Dad?

475
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,893
What about him?

476
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,096
What are you going to do?

477
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,148
Why, did he call broke yet?

478
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:39,818
No, but maybe he would
if you weren't so bitter.

479
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,205
Here we go again
with Saint Dad.

480
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,740
That's what I mean, Mom.
You're always on him.

481
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:46,475
"Give me your paycheck.
Where's your receipts?

482
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,676
"Do you need a meeting?"

483
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:50,178
He's an addict, T.J.

484
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:56,501
You're still bitter.

485
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:59,805
I need you and Ricky to put up the
Christmas tree after school tomorrow, okay?

486
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:03,024
Where are you going?
- Christmas shopping.

Lila! Get up!

499
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,218
I got a job for you!

500
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:40,923
There's two people
out sick today.

501
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:43,125
If we get down there,
you got a job.

502
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,376
Huh?

503
00:42:44,377 --> 00:42:47,646
Get your jacket.
Let's go. I got coffee.

504
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,188
Where are we going?

505
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:59,090
Get in. I'll tell you
on the way.

506
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:07,767
Rita said you quit.

507
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,301
She fired me.

508
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:10,436
That's not
what she told me.

509
00:43:10,437 --> 00:43:11,787
Well, she should have.

510
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:14,640
I couldn't see to count the money.
I told you that.

511
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:16,808
It was coming up
short half the time.

512
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,577
Then get some glasses.

513
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:21,046
They make me carsick.

514
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:23,498
So where are we going?

515
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:25,066
The Tribal Council.

516
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,368
They need someone
to answer phones.

517
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,136
No! No way!

518
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:29,672
Why? You can't
answer phones?

519
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,140
Not there.
Not with them.

520
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:36,711
What's that?

521
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:38,413
I bought it.

522
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,915
From who?

523
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,934
Some white lady.

524
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,987
What?

525
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:46,789
What do you need
a car for?

526
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,839
To get to work.

527
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,774
So I don't have to walk
in the breakdown lane.

528
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,495
Last week,
I almost got hit by a plow.

529
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,612
You'll live.

530
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:56,748
And you know what
I'm talking about.

531
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:02,304
All right, all right.
I'll go.

532
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,989
Let's go!

533
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,513
$3.76.

534
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:29,348
I got exact.

535
00:44:48,401 --> 00:44:50,885
Do I have any messages?

536
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:06,017
I can't read this.

537
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,576
That's a "T."

538
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,828
No, I can't read
any of it.

539
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:19,781
I told Bernie
I couldn't see.

540
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:24,185
Never mind.

541
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,321
I'll go.

542
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:47,276
We got to go to Wolfmart and get some
anti-freeze, unless you got extra.

543
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,360
Why?

544
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,711
I think you got a leak
in your heater coil.

545
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:51,513
It's making
your windows fog up.

546
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:55,833
We better hurry, because I
got nothing for under the tree.

547
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,768
<i>MAN ON RADIO:
Cold snap for tonight</i>

548
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:39,838
<i>with low temperatures dropping down to
19 below Fahrenheit.</i>

549
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,825
<i>Very hazardous for the cars
and also the Ski-Doos.</i>

550
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:46,111
<i>Stay off the roads if you can.</i>

551
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:50,382
<i>Currently outside our C-Tribe Radio
studios, it's 5 below Fahrenheit.</i>

552
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:58,356
Mohawks don't
celebrate Christmas.

553
00:47:58,357 --> 00:48:02,394
You could have fooled me, the way they
were all lined up at Yankee Dollar today.

554
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:04,930
Those are Christians,
the converted.

555
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,965
From what?

556
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:09,300
The Longhouse ways.

557
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:13,405
That's messed up,
not having Santa Claus.

558
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:15,840
For the kids, I mean.

559
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:18,560
RICKY: The oxygen.

560
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,384
ANNOUNCER: It's the Blast and Crash Track set.
BOY: Go!

561
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,102
<i>You've timed it right
to slam your competition.</i>

562
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:28,803
<i>So load, lock and launch...</i>

563
00:48:28,804 --> 00:48:31,206
Dad's going to get
me that for Christmas.

564
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:33,492
Yeah? What about
Santa Claus?

565
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:37,062
Santa Claus is going
to get me the house for Christmas.

566
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:38,613
<i>ANNOUNCER: You got him!
BOY: Yeah!</i>

567
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,973
Wait.
They're not Chinese.

568
00:48:49,475 --> 00:48:51,643
LILA: They're Pakis.

569
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:52,977
What's that mean?

570
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,462
They're from Pakistan.

571
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:55,797
Well, where's that?

572
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:56,898
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

573
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:59,184
A big difference.

574
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,606
If we wait much longer, we're not going
to be able to get back across the river.

575
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,425
Look, I'm not driving just
anybody across the border.

576
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:08,861
Do you want the money?

577
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,680
I want to know
what's in that bag.

578
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:13,782
What's in there?

579
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,403
They don't understand you.

580
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:19,938
Well, if they want
to come here so bad,

581
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:21,773
they should take the time
to learn English.

582
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:24,025
Hold on a second.

583
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,212
RAY:
Hold on a second.

584
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:37,823
LILA: What are you doing?

585
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:39,491
Just count the money
and let's go.

586
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:43,027
If we get stuck on the river,
it won't matter what's in there.

587
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:44,429
RAY: Let's just hope
they're not the ones

588
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,231
that blow themselves
and everyone else up.

589
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:55,873
We don't have time.

590
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,752
Is that a 20 or a 50?

591
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,286
50.

592
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:18,262
Shit.

593
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:23,902
What are you doing?

594
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:27,172
Nuclear power,
poison gas.

595
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:30,157
RAY: Who knows what they
might have in there?

596
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,830
I'm not going to be
responsible for that.

597
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,988
Hey, I'm going to be
a little late. Okay?

598
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,341
I'm at work.

599
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:48,476
Is Ricky asleep?

600
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:51,079
Put him on.

601
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,450
Now listen, Ricky, he's not
coming till you go to sleep.

602
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,986
No. Not yet.

603
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:03,025
He's still flying
over Canada.

604
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,993
He's not even done
with Canada yet,

605
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:08,596
so he's not coming
until you get to sleep.

606
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:15,537
Hi. Is Mitch there?

607
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:19,841
T.J.: Yeah. Hey.

608
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:23,728
No, T.J. from school.

609
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:26,698
Yeah. Yeah.

610
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:32,070
I was just wondering if you still needed
those numbers we talked about earlier.

611
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:34,790
'Cause, uh...

612
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:39,894
Only thing is, I don't really have
any wheels at the moment, so...

613
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,582
On Moira Road, off of 37.

614
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,385
Mmm-hmm.

615
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:49,621
One more thing.

616
00:51:49,622 --> 00:51:54,792
Can you go to Kmart and
pick me up a Blast and Crash Track set?

617
00:51:57,263 --> 00:51:58,397
Yeah, exactly.

618
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:01,716
Uh, thanks, man.

619
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:04,585
T.J., look at me.

620
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:06,838
Yeah, that's pretty cool, but it's
going to hurt when you sit down.

621
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,324
Now, unwrap yourself.
It's dinnertime.

622
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,441
Hey, I'll be
right back. Okay?

623
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,677
DEALER:
They say there's a bag.

624
00:53:18,678 --> 00:53:20,629
It was too heavy.
We had to unload it.

625
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:28,337
What's the matter with her?
What's she saying?

626
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,522
DEALER: That bag,
her baby is in the bag.

627
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,964
RAY: It didn't feel like
there was anything in that bag.

628
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,465
LILA: We got to go back.

629
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,917
I know. I know that.

630
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:51,792
T.J.: Hey.

631
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:54,212
MITCH: This the right one?

632
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:56,314
Uh, yeah.

633
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,449
Yeah.

634
00:54:02,154 --> 00:54:04,488
Thanks, man.
Have a merry one.

635
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:06,207
Okay.

636
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:55,690
Look. There. Tracks.

637
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:58,226
Where?
- Up there.

638
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:02,463
Slow down.
I don't want to run over it.

639
00:55:06,235 --> 00:55:08,602
Stop.
I think it was here.

640
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:38,182
It's dead.

641
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,387
Oh, my God.

642
00:55:53,665 --> 00:55:55,499
Come on.

643
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:17,655
It's dead.

644
00:56:19,124 --> 00:56:20,959
Tap the bottom
of his feet.

645
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,361
Why?

646
00:56:23,362 --> 00:56:25,864
That's what they did to get
Ricky breathing when he was born.

647
00:56:25,865 --> 00:56:27,332
I don't want to touch it.

648
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,867
I can't hold it
and drive.

649
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:36,374
I don't think it matters.

650
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,577
Just hold it next to your body.
Keep him warm.

651
00:56:39,578 --> 00:56:41,712
But it's too late!

652
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:45,416
Just do it. We can't
give it back to her cold.

653
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,984
Shit! Shit!

654
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:23,505
What do I do?
- Calm down! Pull over.

655
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,874
What if he saw us go by
before to the Pioneer?

656
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,277
He's got no reason to stop us, unless you
give him one. Just keep your mouth shut.

657
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,279
What if he searches the car?
What do we say about...

658
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,549
He won't!
Just remember, you're white!

659
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:59,657
License and registration.

660
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,889
Could you step out of the
vehicle, please, ma'am?

661
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,424
I wasn't speeding, was I?

662
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:18,593
Did I do something?

663
00:58:18,594 --> 00:58:21,529
I'm just directing you
to step out of the vehicle.

664
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,996
Okay.

665
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:30,888
Step behind the vehicle.

666
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:40,665
You see that?

667
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:42,884
Oh!

668
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:47,138
Your left rear parking light,
it's not illuminated.

669
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:50,174
Oh, I didn't know.

670
00:58:50,175 --> 00:58:52,844
I'm going to have to give
you a provisional ticket.

671
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:56,364
As long as you get it repaired within
48 hours, it won't be a problem.

672
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:58,149
Thanks.

673
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,317
Who's your friend?

674
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,539
She takes care of my kids
when I have to work late.

675
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,141
You can step back
in the vehicle.

676
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:37,537
We got to take it in.

677
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:42,159
What is it?

678
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:45,062
It's moving.

679
00:59:45,063 --> 00:59:47,381
What? Are you sure?

680
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,889
Hello, little baby.

681
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,057
He was just cold.

682
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,344
We found him.

683
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:28,014
Come on. Let's go.

684
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:40,744
He was dead.

685
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:44,882
He was just cold.

686
01:01:45,985 --> 01:01:47,718
He was dead.

687
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:50,954
Okay. Whatever.

688
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:55,660
He was dead.
You brought him back to life.

689
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:58,629
That was the Creator,
not me.

690
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:07,471
All I know is
Kmart is closed,

691
01:02:07,472 --> 01:02:10,041
and I got nothing
for under the tree.

692
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:05,129
Here.

693
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,034
Merry Christmas
or whatever.

694
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,170
Yeah.

695
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:52,543
Bernie!

696
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:28,796
What's that?

697
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:31,232
Hot Wheels.

698
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:32,699
Where'd you get it?

699
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,001
I called a friend.

700
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:37,004
That kid Mitch?

701
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:39,807
It's probably stolen.
- It's not stolen.

702
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:42,709
I don't want you hanging around
with him. That kid is bad news.

703
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,412
It's not like you
were going to get it.

704
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,779
Move it.

705
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,766
Move it! Listen, mister.

706
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:52,019
I got more important things
to worry about than toys.

707
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,621
I'm trying to get
our doublewide.

708
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:55,657
Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

709
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,425
You can lose
that attitude.

710
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:03,630
Anyway, Kmart was closed
by the time I got off work.

711
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,967
What's that smell?

712
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,321
Popcorn.

713
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,746
Hi, it's me.
I can't get to the phone right now.

714
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:21,749
Please leave a message.
And, Troy, if it's you, please,

715
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,718
at least let us
know you're alive.

716
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,420
The boys are really
worried about you.

717
01:05:50,979 --> 01:05:52,462
Daddy!

718
01:05:58,236 --> 01:06:00,170
Is there a Ray Eddy here?

719
01:06:00,171 --> 01:06:02,273
Yes.

720
01:06:02,974 --> 01:06:04,341
Can I talk to you
outside for a minute?

721
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:06,544
I haven't gotten
that light fixed yet.

722
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,079
It's not about that.

723
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,164
I just have
a few questions.

724
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:13,217
Uh, sure. One second.

725
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:19,556
I'll be back in a second.

726
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:25,012
This is about the woman
that was with you.

727
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:26,464
Yeah.

728
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,299
How long have you
known her?

729
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,885
Not long.
She looks after my kids.

730
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:35,322
She's a smuggler.

731
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,040
Really?

732
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,627
There is that element on the
reservation. I'm sure you know.

733
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:40,611
Well, I've heard about it.

734
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:43,514
I had no idea
she was involved.

735
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:45,049
How did you meet her?

736
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,868
Um...

737
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:51,538
I think there was a sign
for a babysitter at Wolfmart.

738
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,640
That's where I get my gas.

739
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:55,943
I just thought you
should be aware of that.

740
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:58,645
She's known to have brought
illegal aliens into the country.

741
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:00,864
Oh, my God.

742
01:07:00,865 --> 01:07:02,549
If I were you,
I'd get a new babysitter.

743
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,535
Absolutely.

744
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:07,154
Well, you have
an enjoyable holiday.

745
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:09,039
You, too.

746
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,712
T.J., could you
come out here a minute?

747
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:34,481
T.J., get your ass
out here!

748
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,191
What did he want?
Did something happen to Dad?

749
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:45,910
No.

750
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:47,711
What did he want?

751
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:50,381
Did you have a fire
here last night?

752
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,352
Uh, the pipes froze,
so I fixed them.

753
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:56,420
You fixed them?

754
01:07:56,922 --> 01:07:58,022
Yeah.

755
01:07:58,023 --> 01:08:00,591
Did you use
the blowtorch?

756
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:01,926
Dad did it before...

757
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,794
So you used
the blowtorch!

758
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,999
Look at this!
We can't live here anymore!

759
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,034
So what?
It's just a tin crapper.

760
01:08:10,035 --> 01:08:13,504
No, this was our house.

761
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:16,473
So, we're getting
a new one, right?

762
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:18,442
That's it!

763
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,644
Damn it!
- No. What are you...

764
01:08:20,645 --> 01:08:24,364
Son of a bitch!
Don't touch it!

765
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:27,284
It's not yours.
Dad gave it to me!

766
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:28,402
Put it down!

767
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:29,971
Are you going
to shoot me now, too?

768
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,288
Put it down!
- Maybe he didn't like getting shot

769
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:34,375
in his own house!
Maybe that's why he left!

770
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:35,809
That was an accident.
- Yeah, some accident!

771
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,146
You shot him in the foot!

772
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:42,434
T.J., he spent the food money
on scratch cards.

773
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:44,335
He'd done it before.

774
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:47,788
Yeah, and he was clean
32 months since then.

775
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,810
Give me that.
- No, you can't have it. It's mine.

776
01:08:54,012 --> 01:08:56,163
Give it to me!

777
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,595
I didn't know any other way
to keep us together.

778
01:09:11,596 --> 01:09:13,330
I mean,

779
01:09:14,032 --> 01:09:18,168
he's a good dad
when he's not gambling.

780
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:21,405
Yeah.

781
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,408
Awesome dad.

782
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:27,895
Robs us and takes off
a week before Christmas.

783
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:24,601
I quit smuggling.

784
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:26,403
T.J. set the trailer
on fire.

785
01:10:26,404 --> 01:10:28,505
He didn't mean to,
but the pipes froze

786
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:29,874
and he took out
that damn torch,

787
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,710
which I told him not to touch
when I wasn't there,

788
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,212
and he thawed them out.

789
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:38,115
I got glasses, and I
can see up close now.

790
01:10:38,116 --> 01:10:41,686
There's a hole in my house.
We got to move.

791
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:45,222
I just need one more run
to get the double.

792
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:47,892
Look, you can have
the Spirit. Okay?

793
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:49,827
I don't want it.

794
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,896
What is it then?

795
01:10:51,897 --> 01:10:55,766
You still mad about that baby?
'Cause it wasn't my fault.

796
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:59,203
I mean, who puts their baby
in a duffle bag?

797
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:00,905
You're going to need
a lot of money

798
01:11:00,906 --> 01:11:03,574
to raise that
one-year-old kid.

799
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:05,342
I got enough.

800
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:08,812
Yeah, but you still
got to get him.

801
01:11:08,813 --> 01:11:12,966
I'll help you.
You can even borrow my gun.

802
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,599
You should see
the inside.

803
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,068
How many bedrooms?
- Three.

804
01:11:48,069 --> 01:11:51,771
And there's a Jacuzzi tub
in the master bathroom.

805
01:11:52,607 --> 01:11:53,673
Wall-to-wall carpet?

806
01:11:53,674 --> 01:11:54,774
Oh, yeah.

807
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:56,910
But the best thing
is the insulation.

808
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:59,079
Pipes can never freeze.

809
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,314
I'll be right back.

810
01:12:07,472 --> 01:12:11,541
VERSAILLES: There's never any need
to touch up or repaint these walls.

811
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,862
I want to schedule
a delivery.

812
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:19,349
Just give me one sec.

813
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,085
What exactly is it
I can do for you?

814
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:26,223
It's 3,000, but I want
it delivered tomorrow.

815
01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:29,526
You did have a closing date
on Christmas.

816
01:12:30,762 --> 01:12:32,312
I'm here now.

817
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:33,530
You add this
to my deposit.

818
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:34,832
All you have to do
is show up.

819
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:39,035
If I don't have the rest,
you can keep it.

820
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:42,639
All right, well,
I just need you to sign this paper here,

821
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,742
and you'll be ready to go.
Right there.

822
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:54,767
I'm sorry about that.

823
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,224
Heat wave.

824
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:19,126
You got a run
for us, Jimmy?

825
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:21,061
It's pretty slow
after Christmas,

826
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,696
unless you want
to go off the rez.

827
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:26,434
There's that guy
up in Montreal.

828
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,568
He's usually got heads.

829
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:02,351
What? You want a job?

830
01:14:02,904 --> 01:14:04,788
No, Jimmy sent us.

831
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:10,076
BRUNO: Christy.

832
01:14:11,946 --> 01:14:14,147
Put your hands up.

833
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:25,925
CHRISTY: They have nothing.

834
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:27,744
BRUNO: Okay.

835
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:56,906
Pop the back.

836
01:14:58,643 --> 01:15:00,878
We need to get paid first.

837
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,510
There's only 600 here.

838
01:15:18,462 --> 01:15:20,764
You get the rest
at the drop off.

839
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:22,749
It's 600 apiece.

840
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,301
You want to make
a change now?

841
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,658
It's 1,200.

842
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:34,294
You want to have
a problem?

843
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:36,680
BRUNO: Huh?

844
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:40,650
Because it's not a problem for me.
It is a problem for them!

845
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:43,454
Hey!

846
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:45,889
Okay. Okay.
We'll take them.

847
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:47,591
We'll take them with us.
Open the trunk.

848
01:15:47,592 --> 01:15:48,541
LILA: Let's go!

849
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:50,226
Just open the trunk.

850
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:01,020
BRUNO: In.

851
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:03,323
Bitch.

852
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:07,593
Turn around!
- Bruno!

853
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,832
I want the rest.

854
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:16,336
But I have nothing.

855
01:16:31,285 --> 01:16:33,803
LILA: Let's go!
Let's get out of here.

856
01:16:33,804 --> 01:16:35,155
I'll give you
the rest of the money.

857
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:36,690
No. Thanks.

858
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:39,609
You're going to
get us all killed.

859
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:45,348
RAY: Give it to her.
Give it to her.

860
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:08,338
He shot me. I'm shot.

861
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:11,007
I think you're okay.

862
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:12,809
You should have just
took the money from me.

863
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,412
I'm sick and tired of people
stealing from me. Is it all there?

864
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:16,997
We got to get
out of here first.

865
01:17:16,998 --> 01:17:18,915
Just count it.
Make sure it's all there.

866
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:21,001
Okay, okay. All right.

867
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,606
Is it there?

868
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,974
It's all there.

869
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,742
Good.

870
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,545
Slow down a bit. We got to
keep it under the speed limit.

871
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,196
We got to get off
this road.

872
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,169
We got to get
off this road.

873
01:17:42,256 --> 01:17:43,990
Oh, shit!

874
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,514
Where's the reservation?

875
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:53,433
Just past that pole
right there.

876
01:18:04,378 --> 01:18:06,963
What the hell?
We're on the rez.

877
01:18:06,964 --> 01:18:09,316
They can't arrest us, but if they
catch us they can take the money.

878
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:10,816
Shit!

879
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:29,235
It's black ice
out here.

880
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:31,004
Will it hold us?

881
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:32,805
I don't know.

882
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,685
RAY: Shit.

883
01:19:18,169 --> 01:19:20,954
LILA: Get out on your side!
Pop the trunk!

884
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,122
Get the cash.
You got the cash?

885
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:23,689
LILA: Yeah.

886
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:25,492
Come on. Let's go.

887
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,227
Come on, come on.

888
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,493
JIMMY: Hey, Lila!
Over here!

889
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:22,549
Jimmy, you're not
coming in here.

890
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:25,534
JIMMY: We just need to
borrow your oven.

891
01:20:33,928 --> 01:20:37,197
THREE RIVERS: We have a situation
with a couple of smugglers.

892
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,166
They tried to go across the river,
but their car went in.

893
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:43,587
And now the troopers know that
they're on the reservation.

894
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,121
ROSALIE: Who are they?

895
01:20:45,122 --> 01:20:47,323
Lila Littlewolf
and some white woman.

896
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,959
ROSALIE: What do
the troopers want?

897
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,227
They want the surrender
of the two illegals.

898
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:54,680
Second, they want the surrender
of the non-native smuggler.

899
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:57,333
They really mean to set
an example over here.

900
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,651
Do you know
where they are?

901
01:20:58,652 --> 01:21:00,887
Yeah. They're probably
over at Velma's.

902
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:02,639
ROSALIE: What about
Lila Littlewolf?

903
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,658
You can't start throwing
Mohawks off the rez, Rosalie.

904
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:07,911
She's got a Mohawk son.

905
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:09,913
She cost us a Mohawk son.

906
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:11,214
BERNIE:
Jake was a big boy.

907
01:21:11,215 --> 01:21:13,183
He knew what
he was doing.

908
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:33,569
Jimmy,
get out of here.

909
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,385
You, too.

910
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,349
I need my half.

911
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,155
No, no, no.
You stay here. Stay here.

912
01:22:35,933 --> 01:22:37,700
Hi, Lila.

913
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:40,804
Hi, Bernie.

914
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,288
You're in big trouble.

915
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,423
The Council voted
to expel you.

916
01:22:44,424 --> 01:22:46,509
Expel me?
- For five years.

917
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,211
You can appeal,

918
01:22:48,212 --> 01:22:50,096
but I don't think you're going to
be able to change Rosalie's mind.

919
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:53,616
I thought all this was legal
on the reservation.

920
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:55,351
Look, I got to go.

921
01:22:55,352 --> 01:22:57,720
BERNIE: If she leaves,
they'll turn you in.

922
01:22:57,721 --> 01:23:00,006
The troopers
want somebody.

923
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,408
But she's a Mohawk.

924
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,026
BERNIE:
The chiefs want her out.

925
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:06,762
There's going to be nobody standing
between her and the troopers.

926
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:11,718
My kids got no one but me.

927
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:14,738
If you leave, she'll
never see her son again.

928
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,689
Let her go.

929
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:19,059
Lila, you're giving
up on him.

930
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,326
He's only a year old.

931
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,883
Just go.

932
01:23:34,258 --> 01:23:38,310
At least you've got family
to take care of him, you know?

933
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:44,861
I wanted the baby to have a pretty
new crib, not some hand-me-down.

934
01:24:47,097 --> 01:24:49,732
He wouldn't let me go alone.

935
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:57,206
I was too fat to fit
behind the steering wheel.

936
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:00,543
BERNIE: He just wanted to
keep you and Little Jake safe.

937
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:08,267
Just a couple
of months, right?

938
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:10,602
I got no record,
and I'm white.

939
01:25:11,572 --> 01:25:14,273
I got baby stuff
in the shed.

940
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,878
Get a good used singlewide.

941
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:22,181
Insulation is the key thing.

942
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:26,636
Versailles will
give you a hard time,

943
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:27,771
but that will leave
enough for you

944
01:25:27,772 --> 01:25:30,623
and the boys to live on
for a couple of months.

945
01:25:32,226 --> 01:25:35,428
Ricky's allergic
to penicillin,

946
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:39,799
and you can't feed him potato
chips all the time. Okay?

947
01:25:42,452 --> 01:25:45,421
But you got
to get there quick,

948
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:49,125
'cause T.J.
will get scared.

949
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:52,611
And I don't want him
to get scared. Okay?

950
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,080
Okay?

951
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:00,753
Okay.

952
01:26:02,339 --> 01:26:05,440
Don't let Versailles
jerk you around.

953
01:26:05,776 --> 01:26:07,076
You go with her, okay?

954
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:08,610
Sure.

955
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:30,933
What do you want?

956
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:32,634
LILA: I need his coat.

957
01:26:36,373 --> 01:26:38,674
Where's his coat?

958
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:41,410
You can't have him.

959
01:26:42,613 --> 01:26:44,980
You can't have him!

960
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:48,034
<i>Say goodbye to your Toda.</i>

961
01:27:14,344 --> 01:27:17,112
TROOPER: Speak English?
Speak English?

962
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:33,829
What happens to them?

963
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:36,799
They'll probably go back.

964
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,838
But how long for me?
You know, if I confess?

965
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:46,042
Providing they're not on
a watch list, four months.

966
01:27:49,996 --> 01:27:53,516
I don't think you have
that much to worry about.

967
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:56,885
Can I have a cigarette?

968
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:07,814
Is there someone
that I can call for you

969
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,482
to take care
of your children?

970
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:11,567
I got somebody.

971
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,437
A relative?

972
01:28:15,973 --> 01:28:17,739
A friend.

973
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:20,876
But I need to call my kids.

974
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:31,303
Mom, what did you do?

975
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:34,874
What? A smuggler?
Holy shit!

976
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:40,847
Are you in jail?

977
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:46,218
Yeah, but are you
gonna be in jail?

978
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:55,094
Yeah, okay. But...
But why? I...

979
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,363
I can do it. I...

980
01:28:57,364 --> 01:28:58,664
I look after him
all the time.

981
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:00,866
I don't see why we need...

982
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:03,736
Yeah, I'm still here.

983
01:29:13,146 --> 01:29:14,763
Hi.

984
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:18,000
Okay.

985
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:31,480
Hey, you've got to put the little
pieces up higher or he'll eat them. Okay?

986
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:33,048
RICKY: What?

987
01:30:30,473 --> 01:30:33,442
You got a little boy
named Troy Junior?

988
01:30:33,443 --> 01:30:35,311
Yeah.

989
01:30:35,946 --> 01:30:37,546
Troy!

990
01:30:38,348 --> 01:30:41,750
Would you come here?
I want to talk to you.

991
01:30:53,863 --> 01:30:56,698
You know, you did a bad
thing to an old lady,

992
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:59,135
and I'd like to
introduce her to you

993
01:30:59,136 --> 01:31:01,938
and give you a chance
to apologize.

994
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:03,605
Because I know you're
probably a good kid,

995
01:31:03,606 --> 01:31:06,108
and I know you want
to set this right.

996
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:07,776
Come on.

997
01:31:08,912 --> 01:31:11,280
Tell her you're sorry.

998
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:14,901
Sorry.

999
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,552
Okay?

1000
01:31:18,154 --> 01:31:21,290
You did good.
Now don't do that again.

1001
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:31,133
Hey, come here.

1002
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:35,504
Muddy.

1003
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,880
Hey.
