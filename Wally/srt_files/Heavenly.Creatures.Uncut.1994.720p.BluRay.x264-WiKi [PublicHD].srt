531
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:33,080
[Panting]
Oh, it's so beautiful.

532
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:34,547
What?!

533
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:38,143
[Crying]
Oh, it's so beautiful!

534
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,312
Pretty flowers.

535
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,913
[Gasping]

536
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:48,887
[Breathing deeply]

537
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,094
Come with me!

538
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:04,344
[Thunder rumbles]

539
00:33:04,412 --> 00:33:05,845
[Both gasp]

540
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,784
It's all right.
You'll see.

541
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:15,914
[Both gasp]

542
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,458
Come on!
Come on!

543
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:21,359
[Laughter]

544
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:34,275
[Birds chirping,
water flowing]

545
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:36,936
[Gasps] Look!

546
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:43,216
Oh! Oh!

547
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,781
[Birds chirping]

548
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,594
[Laughter]

549
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:57,654
Pauline; Today
Juliet and I discovered

550
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,791
the key to the Fourth World.

551
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:02,462
We have had it
in our possession

552
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,164
for about six months,

553
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:06,002
but we only realized it

554
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,804
on the day
of the death of Christ.

555
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:11,869
We saw a gateway
through the clouds.

556
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:15,109
Everything
was full of peace and bliss.

557
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:19,483
We then realized
we had the key.

558
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:22,955
We now know we're not genii,
as we thought.

559
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:25,857
We have an extra part
of our brain

560
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,953
that can appreciate
the Fourth World.

561
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,225
Only about 10 people have it.

562
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:34,757
When we die, we will go
to the Fourth World,

563
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:37,930
but meanwhile,
on two days every year,

564
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:39,473
we may use the key

565
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,374
and look into
that beautiful world

566
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:45,538
which we have been lucky enough
to be allowed to know of

567
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,707
on this day
of finding the key

568
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:52,719
to the way
through the clouds.

569
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:55,756
Ughhhhhh!

570
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,553
Push!

571
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,217
[Panting]

572
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,023
It's coming!

573
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:03,154
Mnhhhhhh!

574
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,131
Oh, God!

575
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,465
[Panting]

576
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:11,266
It's a boy!

577
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,273
Oh!

578
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:15,002
Deborah...

579
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:17,010
[Breathing deeply]

580
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:19,842
We have a son and heir.

581
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:23,941
[Sighs deeply]
I shall call him Diello!

582
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:27,818
Oh, you're
such an incredible woman!

583
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:32,223
I couldn't have done it
without you, Charles.

584
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:35,091
The empress Deborah

585
00:35:35,163 --> 00:35:37,188
has the most enormous
difficulty

586
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,698
fending off her husband,

587
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,893
who tries
to have his way with her

588
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:42,436
morning, noon, and night.

589
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:44,995
[Laughter]

590
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:46,597
[Laughter stops]

591
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:48,164
Thank you, Juliet.

592
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:49,505
[Coughs]

593
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:52,205
However...

594
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,373
the queen's biggest problem

595
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:56,849
is her renegade child, Diello,
who has proven to be

596
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,579
an uncontrollable
little blighter

597
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:01,247
who slaughters his nannies
whenever the fancy takes him!

598
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:02,789
That's enough, Juliet!

599
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:04,552
[Coughs]

600
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,060
I suppose this is
your idea of a joke!

601
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:08,390
No, Mrs. Stevens.

602
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:10,761
I suppose you think it
witty and clever

603
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,231
to mock the royal family,

604
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,030
to poke fun at the queen
and the empire

605
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,367
with this... rubbish!

606
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,235
It's not rubbish!

607
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,275
Sit down, Pauline!

608
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,970
[Coughs]
I really don't understand

609
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,343
why you are so upset,
Mrs. Stevens.

610
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:29,212
I merely wrote an essay
on the royal family,

611
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,478
as requested.

612
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,112
It doesn't say
it has to be the Windsors!

613
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:33,983
Sit down!

614
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:36,285
[Coughs]

615
00:36:36,357 --> 00:36:39,292
A girl like you should be
setting an example.

616
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,952
To your seat.

617
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:42,963
[Coughing]

618
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:50,069
[Coughing continues]

619
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:56,774
Stop it, Juliet!

620
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,476
[Spitting up]

621
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:08,781
Pauline; Mrs. Hulme told me
they had found out today

622
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:13,725
that Juliet has tuberculosis
on one lung.

623
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:16,127
Poor Juliet.

624
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:19,462
I nearly fainted
when I heard.

625
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:22,970
I had a terrible job
not to cry.

626
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:25,528
I spent a wretched night.

627
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,768
It would be wonderful

628
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,640
if I could get
tuberculosis, too.

629
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:31,770
[Door hinges creak]

630
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:33,438
Come on, sit up.

631
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:34,776
I'm not hungry.

632
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:36,476
Oh, Yvonne,
you've got to eat.

633
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:38,485
You hardly ate any dinner
last night.

634
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:39,952
Now, come on.

635
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,717
I'm not having you
falling ill.

636
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,156
I just want to be on
my own for a while.

[Birds chirping]

638
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:49,026
Well,
you may have forgotten

639
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:52,362
that you were once
a very sick little girl,

640
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,298
but I haven't.

641
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,304
All right.

642
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,401
Do you think Juliet
could stay here

643
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:05,139
while her parents
are away?

644
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:06,612
Juliet's infectious.

645
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,546
She'll be going
to the hospital.

646
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:10,914
But she'll have no one
to look after her!

647
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,078
Well, her parents won't
be going overseas now.

648
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:16,248
They have to cancel
their trip.

649
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:18,383
Don't worry about Juliet.

650

00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:24,961
Well, it's not too late

653
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,729
to cancel
our travel arrangements,

654
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:29,667
if that's what you want.

655
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:33,070
[Coughing in distance]

656
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:36,338
I'm sure
you'll like it here.

657
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,402
It's very tranquil.

658
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:40,470
Oh, I've spoken
to the matron.

659
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:43,346
She promises to take
extra special care of you.

[Coughs]

661
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:47,787
And you can carry on
with your studies

662
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:49,413
while you convalesce.

663
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,687
It's for the good
of your health, darling.

664
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:57,626
Cheer up,
old thing, hmm?

665
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:01,897
Four months...
fly by in no time.

Honora; Juliet
won't be allowed visitors

670
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:35,726
for at least
a couple of months, dear.

671
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:38,533
I've booked you in
for a chest X-ray

672
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:41,939
just to be
on the safe side.

673
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:46,275
I thought I'd have a go
at building the birdhouse
on Saturday.

674
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:48,474
Anybody
want to give me a hand?

675
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:54,421
You used to love making
things with Dad, Yvonne.

676
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,185
Pauline; This evening,
I had a brain wave

677
00:39:57,258 --> 00:40:00,091
that Juliet and I
should write to each other

678
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,628
as Charles and Deborah.

679
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,756
I wrote a six-page letter
as Charles

and a two-page letter
as Paul.

681

the spirit of the thing
greatly.

very masterful,

I had not lost my virginity

Mrs. Rieper,
perhaps you, uh,

1054
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:18,547
you wouldn't mind

00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:36,063
Do you like your mother?

No.

1058
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:39,470
And why is that?

1059
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:41,063
She nags me.

1060
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:44,736
And that's why you like
to stay with the Hulmes.

1061
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:48,674
Or is it because you want
to be with Juliet?

1062
00:59:55,021 --> 00:59:59,355
Do you... like girls?

1063
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:02,586
No.

Why not?

But Juliet's not silly.

1240

Hmm.

1241
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:57,795
I thought he was supposed
to be terribly ill.

1242
01:08:57,864 --> 01:09:00,856
That's what we were led
to believe.

1243
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:06,303
Henry... I'm terribly worried
about Bill Perry.

1244
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:09,034
He's just had this spell
in hospital.

1245
01:09:09,108 --> 01:09:11,167
He's got nowhere
to convalesce.

1246
01:09:11,244 --> 01:09:12,871
No?

1247
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:17,248
L-I've offered him
the flat.

1248
01:09:17,316 --> 01:09:19,580
He really shouldn't be
left alone...

1249
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,916
not in his condition.

1250
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:24,582

But it wasn't like that
at all.

Bill!

1260
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,235
I hope
the trip didn't tire you.

Hello.

1262

Hello.

01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,515
It used to be
the servants' quarters,

1267
01:09:56,589 --> 01:09:58,716
but it's...
it's very comfortable.

1268
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,122
Oh. Corker.

1269
01:10:05,932 --> 01:10:08,127
Mother was completely
taken in.

1270
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:13,296
Do you think
bloody Bill's trying
to get into her drawers?

1271
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:15,135
Too right.

1272
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:16,765
But he doesn't have
a show.

1273
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:19,436

Don't worry, Gina.

[Tennis match resumes]

You have alienated
the professorial board

1283

and completely compromised
the good will of the council.

1284

You could've at least been
a bit more reasonable about
the forestry school.

1285
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:53,137
I stand by the report I made
last year.

1286

Canterbury College should not
be diversifying...

Henry,
it's just not working.

1288
01:10:58,517 --> 01:11:01,315
Surely a man of your caliber
is needed back in England.

to consider.

Dr. Hulme,
let's make an effort

to avoid
a public embarrassment.

leave me here with Mother.

[Breathes deeply]

1416
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:35,974
I'm leaving you in South Africa
with Auntie Ena.

1417
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:39,374
Hilda;
That chest of yours isn't
getting any better.

1418
01:18:39,445 --> 01:18:42,937
A warmer climate is
just what you need.

1419
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:44,983
For the good of your health.

1420
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,917
Ahhhhhh!

1421
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:53,257
The Hulmes will look after me.

1422
01:18:53,325 --> 01:18:55,418
They want me to live
with them.

1423
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:58,088
Honora;
Don't be so ridiculous.

1424
01:18:58,163 --> 01:19:00,927
You're our daughter.
You belong here with us.

1425
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:03,331
I belong with Deborah.

1426
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,530
We're going to South Africa.

1427
01:19:07,606 --> 01:19:09,597
You're not going
anywhere.

1428
01:19:09,675 --> 01:19:11,939
You're 15 years old,
Yvonne.

1429
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,002
You have to let me go!

1430
01:19:17,015 --> 01:19:19,950
We'll talk about this
when you've calmed down.

1431
01:19:20,018 --> 01:19:21,610
Pauline;
I felt thoroughly depressed

1432
01:19:21,687 --> 01:19:26,283
and even quite seriously
considered committing suicide.

1433
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:30,192
Life seemed so much
not worth the living

1434
01:19:30,262 --> 01:19:32,253
and death such an easy way out.

1435
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,162
Love, you can still write
to each other.

1436
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:40,672
Anger against Mother boiled up
inside me,

1437
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:45,335
as it is she who is one of
the main obstacles in my path.

1438
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,846
Suddenly a means of
ridding myself of this obstacle

1439
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:50,848
occurred to me.

1440
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:54,545
If she were to die...

1441
01:19:54,653 --> 01:19:57,383
Official; I cannot begin
to attempt to measure

1442
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:00,653
the inestimable value
of Dr. Hulme's contributions

1443
01:20:00,726 --> 01:20:04,822
to Canterbury College,
both social and official.

1444
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:09,334
We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme
all the best for the future.

1445

Juliet; Everything's
going to be okay, Gina.

1447
01:20:24,316 --> 01:20:28,514
Mr. Perry promised to give me
£50 for my horse.

1448
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:30,020
That's 120!

1449
01:20:30,088 --> 01:20:33,546
Just another £30,
and we've got the fare!

1450

1452
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:40,089
I went to
the passport office today.

1453
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:42,531
They won't give me one
till I'm 20!

1454
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,000
But that's not true!

1455
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:45,331
I've got one!

1456
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:47,838
[Crying] No...

1457
01:20:47,906 --> 01:20:52,002
I need
my sodding parents' consent.

Gina, please don't cry.

1461
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:02,553
We're not going to be
separated. We're not.

1462
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:05,021
They can't make us!

1463
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:07,115
They can't!

1464
01:21:07,192 --> 01:21:09,956
They can't! [Sobs]

1465
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:12,462
They can not.

1466
01:21:12,531 --> 01:21:14,362
Off me!

1467
01:21:14,433 --> 01:21:15,866

Pauline; I did not tell Deborah
of my plans

1475
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:47,498
for removing Mother.

1476
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:49,500
I have made no decision yet,

1477
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:53,163
as the last fate I wish to meet
is one in a borstal.

1478
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:57,299
I am trying to think of
some way.

[Thud]

1480
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:02,513
I've just had Hilda Hulme
on the telephone.

1481
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:04,412
[Exhales deeply]
What now?

1482
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,917
She says Juliet's in
a terrible state.

1483
01:22:06,985 --> 01:22:08,885
She's uncontrollable.

1484
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:11,855
I've told her Pauline isn't
going to South Africa.

1485
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:13,686
She refuses to accept it.

1486
01:22:13,759 --> 01:22:17,217
Well, I expect
you've heard the same

1487
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:19,526
from your own daughter.

1488
01:22:19,598 --> 01:22:23,557
Um...
Yvonne hasn't spoken to me

1489
01:22:23,635 --> 01:22:26,763
for... um,
nearly two weeks.

1490
01:22:26,838 --> 01:22:29,773
Yes.

1491
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:33,971
Well... it hasn't been
an easy time

1492
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:36,810
for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.

1493
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:40,818
She's cut us out
of her life, Mrs. Hulme.

1494
01:22:40,886 --> 01:22:44,822
It's been causing
her mother and I
a lot of worry.

1495
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:46,323
What I'm suggesting

1496
01:22:46,391 --> 01:22:49,690
is that we let the girls spend
these last three weeks together.

1497
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:53,390
We would like Pauline
to come and stay with Juliet

1498
01:22:53,465 --> 01:22:54,898
until she leaves.

1499
01:22:54,966 --> 01:22:57,958

it is a definite plan

1589

which we intend to carry out.

I have been very sweet
and good.

1604

I have worked out
a little more of our plan.

Deborah rang,

1609
01:31:59,177 --> 01:32:02,442
and we decided to use
a rock and a stocking

1610

rather than a sandbag.

as though I were
planning a surprise party.

Mother has fallen in
with everything beautifully,

take place tomorrow afternoon.

in this diary,
