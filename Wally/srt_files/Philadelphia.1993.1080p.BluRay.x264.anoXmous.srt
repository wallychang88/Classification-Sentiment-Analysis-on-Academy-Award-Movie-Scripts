00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:16,133
I MISPLACED AN
IMPORTANT COMPLAINT.
THAT'S THEIR STORY.

319
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,802
WANT TO HEAR MINE?

320
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,142
HOW MANY LAWYERS YOU GO TO
BEFORE YOU CALLED ME?

321
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,511
NINE.

322
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,781
CONTINUE.

323
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:35,819
THE NIGHT BEFORE IT WAS DUE,
I WORKED ON THE COMPLAINT
IN MY OFFICE.

324
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,555
I LEFT A COPY ON MY DESK.

325
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:42,292
THE NEXT DAY,
THE COMPLAINT VANISHED.

326
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,495
NO HARD COPY.

327
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:50,233
ALL TRACES OF IT MYSTERIOUSLY
GONE FROM MY COMPUTER.

328
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:55,438
[ANDREW] MIRACULOUSLY,
A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT WAS
LOCATED AT THE LAST MINUTE,

329
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:58,742
AND WE GOT IT
TO COURT ON TIME.

330
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,313
BUT THE NEXT DAY,
I WAS SUMMONED TO A MEETING
WITH THE MANAGING PARTNERS.

331
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,716
THEY WERE WAITING FOR ME
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

332
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,018
HELLO, ANDY!
COME ON IN.

333
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,688
WOULD YOU MIND HITTING
THE WINDOWS?

334
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,925
THANKS.
HEY, COME ON IN.

335
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,696
ROBERT, CHARLES, WALTER
AND LYDIA.

336
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:20,731
<i>[CHARLES]
THANKS FOR COMING IN.</i>

337
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,365
OF COURSE!

338
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:26,870
ANDY, BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY...

339
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:29,807
THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM
IS YOUR FRIEND.

340
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:31,842
I KNOW THAT,
CHARLES.

341
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,979
MORE THAN YOUR FRIEND...
FAMILY.

342
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:41,118
CHARLES,
I MUST APOLOGIZE AGAIN...

343
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,821
FOR THE HIGHLINE MISHAP
YESTERDAY.

344
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:47,124
THAT WAS SOME SCARY MOMENT...
AROUND HERE.

345
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,160
WOW! THANK GOD
THE COMPLAINT WAS FOUND...

346
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:52,462
AND NO DAMAGE
WAS DONE.

347
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,499
THIS TIME.
WHAT ABOUT NEXT TIME?

348
00:25:56,567 --> 00:26:00,904
THERE WON'T BE A NEXT TIME.
I GUARANTEE IT.

349
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:05,075
YEAH. IT'S JUST THAT
SOMETHING'S COME OVER YOU
LATELY, ANDY.

350
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:07,277
I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:10,814
SOME KIND OF STUPOR
OR FOGGINESS--

352
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:13,817
SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE
AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM, BECKETT.

353
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:19,489
REALLY?
WHO THINKS THAT?

354
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:21,291
I DO.

355
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,564
EXCUSE ME.

356
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:30,901
AM I BEING FIRED?

357
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:33,771
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY,
ANDY.

358
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:37,908
YOUR PLACE IN THE FUTURE OF
THIS FIRM IS NO LONGER SECURE.

359
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,811
WE FEEL IT ISN'T FAIR
TO KEEP YOU HERE...

360
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,882
<i>WHEN YOUR PROSPECTS
ARE LIMITED.</i>

361
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:49,386
AND NOW... I DON'T WANT
TO RUSH YOU OUT.

362
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:52,322
WE'VE GOT A
COMMITTEE MEETING.
EXCUSE ME. CHARLES?

363
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,559
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
THIS... THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!

364
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,495
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!

365
00:26:58,562 --> 00:27:02,766
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM.
- TAKE IT EASY, WALTER.

366
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:06,069
IF YOU HAD LOST CONFIDENCE
IN ME, WHY DID YOU
GIVE ME THE HIGHLINE SUIT?

367
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:10,240
ANDY, YOU NEARLY BLEW
THE ENTIRE CASE, FOR CHRISSAKES.
THAT ALONE IS INEXCUSABLE!

368
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:13,310
<i>[ROBERT]
IT WOULD'VE BEEN
CATASTROPHIC FOR US.</i>

369
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,915
UH-HUH.

370
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:21,318
SO YOU WERE CONCEALING
YOUR ILLNESS.

371
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,222
THAT'S CORRECT.

372
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:30,227
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME LIKE
I'M A TWO-YEAR-OLD, OKAY?

373
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:34,464
BECAUSE THERE'S AN ELEMENT
TO THIS THING I JUST CANNOT
GET THROUGH MY THICK HEAD.

374
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:38,401
DIDN'T YOU HAVE
AN OBLIGATION TO TELL
YOUR EMPLOYER...

375
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:40,971
YOU HAD THIS DREADED,
DEADLY, INFECTIOUS DISEASE?

376
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,407
THAT'S NOT...
THE POINT.

377
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,410
FROM THE DAY THEY HIRED ME,
TO THE DAY I WAS FIRED...

378
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:51,081
I SERVED MY CLIENTS
CONSISTENTLY, THOROUGHLY
WITH ABSOLUTE EXCELLENCE.

379
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,851
IF THEY HADN'T FIRED ME,
THAT'S WHAT I'D BE DOING TODAY.

380
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,453
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO FIRE YOU
FOR HAVING AIDS.

381
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,389
SO, IN SPITE OF YOUR BRILLIANCE,
THEY MAKE YOU LOOK INCOMPETENT.

382
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,892
THUS THE MYSTERIOUS LOST FILES.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

383
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,761
CORRECT.
I WAS SABOTAGED.

384
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,134
I DON'T BUY IT,
COUNSELOR.

385
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,138
THAT'S VERY
DISAPPOINTING.

386
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:17,941
I DON'T SEE A CASE.

387
00:28:20,745 --> 00:28:25,883
I HAVE A CASE.
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT
FOR PERSONAL REASONS--

388
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,952
THANK YOU.
THAT'S CORRECT, I DON'T.

389
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:34,591
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, COUNSELOR.

390
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:37,794
MR. BECKETT?

391
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:48,071
UH, I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
IT'S A BITCH, YOU KNOW?

392
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:04,388
HAVE A NICE DAY, MR. BECKETT.
WHAT THE HELL'S THE
MATTER WITH THAT GUY?

393
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:06,890
IRIS, FIND OUT IF ARMBRUSTER
CAN SEE ME.
[PHONE RINGING]

394
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,592
JOE MILLER'S OFFICE.
IRIS, FIND OUT IF
ARMBRUSTER CAN SEE ME.

395
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,495
ARMBRUSTER? WHEN?
SOMETIME THIS AFTERNOON.

396
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:15,732
<i>NO, RIGHT AWAY, IRIS.
RIGHT AWAY, IRIS.
OKAY.</i>

397
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,297
EXCUSE ME.

398
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:56,606
<i>THE H.I.V. VIRUS CAN ONLY
BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE
EXCHANGE OF BODILY FLUIDS:</i>

399
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:59,676
NAMELY BLOOD, SEMEN
AND VAGINAL SECRETIONS.

400
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:01,911
RIGHT. YEAH.

401
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,116
BUT ISN'T IT TRUE THEY'RE
FINDING OUT NEW THINGS ABOUT
THIS DISEASE EVERY DAY?

402
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,551
YOU TELL ME TODAY
THERE'S NO DANGER, GO HOME.

403
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:10,553
I GO HOME. I PICK UP
MY LITTLE BABY GIRL.

404
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,689
THEN I FIND OUT SIX MONTHS
FROM NOW ON THE NEWS:

405
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:16,226
WHOOPS! MADE A MISTAKE.
YEAH, YOU CAN CARRY IT...

406
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:19,629
ON YOUR SHIRT
OR YOUR CLOTHES OR--

407
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,102
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
WE'RE GONNA DRAW BLOOD.

408
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:27,237
WHY ARE WE
GONNA DO THAT?

409
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:30,107
JOE. LITTLE JOE.

410
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,775
I'VE KNOWN YOU
SINCE YOU WERE A KID.

411
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:35,712
AND I DON'T CARE A WHIT
ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.

412
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:41,018
THANKS, DOC.
I DON'T NEED AN AIDS TEST.
THANKS ANYWAY.

413
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:43,286
JUST SEND A BILL
TO MY OFFICE.

414
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,889
OKAY?

415
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,158
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.
REALLY.

416
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:56,766
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH GAYS, JOE.

417
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,169
NOT ESPECIALLY.
YES, YOU DO.

418
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,971
HOW MANY GAYS
DO YOU KNOW?
HOW MANY DO YOU KNOW?

419
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,673
LOTS!
LIKE WHO?

420
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:06,943
KAREN BERMAN.
MY AUNT TERESA.

421
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:10,047
COUSIN TOMMY
WHO LIVES IN ROCHESTER.

422
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:13,150
EDDIE MEYERS
FROM THE OFFICE.

423
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:15,952
STANLEY, THE GUY WHO'S
PUTTING IN OUR KITCHEN CABINETS.

424
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,255
AUNT TERESA IS GAY?

425
00:31:18,322 --> 00:31:22,192
THAT BEAUTIFUL, SENSUOUS,
VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN
IS A LESBIAN?

426
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,494
DUH.
SINCE WHEN?

427
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:28,965
PROBABLY SINCE
SHE WAS BORN.
OH, MAN.

428
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,268
WELL, HEY, I ADMIT IT,
OKAY?

429
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:33,937
I'M PREJUDICED.
I DON'T LIKE HOMOSEXUALS.
THERE, YOU GOT ME.

430
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:37,707
I MEAN, THE WAY THESE GUYS
DO THAT... THING.

431
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:41,844
DON'T THEY GET CONFUSED?
"I DON'T KNOW, IS THAT YOURS?
IS THAT MINE?"

432
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:45,415
[LAUGHING]
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN
THE BED WITH ANYBODY...

433
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:48,452
WHO'S STRONGER THAN ME,
OR HAS MORE HAIR ON
THEIR CHEST THAN I DO.

434
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,221
YOU CAN CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED,
YOU CAN CALL ME CONSERVATIVE.

435
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:54,491
JUST CALL ME A MAN.

436
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,128
BESIDES, I THINK
YOU HAVE TO BE A MAN
TO UNDERSTAND HOW...

437
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,964
REALLY DISGUSTING
THAT WHOLE IDEA IS ANYWAY.

438
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,166
YEAH?
YEAH.

439
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:07,003
WELL, WELL.
LITTLE CAVEMAN OF THE HOUSE.
YOU DAMN SKIPPY!

440
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:09,539
HERE YOU GO, BABY.
STAY AWAY FROM YOUR
AUNT TERESA TOO.

441
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:12,675
JOE, DON'T SAY THAT
TO HER.

442
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:17,180
THINK ABOUT THOSE GUYS PUMPING
UP TOGETHER, TRYING TO BE MACHO
AND FAGGOT AT THE SAME TIME.

443
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:21,351
I CAN'T STAND THAT SHIT!
HEY, I'M BEING TOTALLY HONEST.

444
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,322
<i>OH, YEAH, YOU ARE.
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT A QUESTION.</i>

445
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:30,527
WOULD YOU ACCEPT
A CLIENT IF YOU WERE
CONSTANTLY THINKING,

446
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,829
"I DON'T WANT THIS PERSON
TO TOUCH ME.

447
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:36,199
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO EVEN BREATHE ON ME"?

448
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:39,236
NOT IF I WAS YOU, HONEY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

449
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,671
MM-HMM.
WHAT?

450
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:46,409
HO-HO-HO!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

451
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:50,713
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

452
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:53,283
HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS!
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

THIS IS
THE SUPPLEMENT.

458
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:04,821
YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE IS
A SECTION ON H.I.V.
RELATED DISCRIMINATION.

00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,889
<i>OH, THANK YOU.</i>

00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:10,427
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

461
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:21,804
WE DO HAVE A PRIVATE

<i>I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

<i>EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND THE

00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:54,137
WOULDN'T YOU BE
MORE COMFORTABLE
IN A RESEARCH ROOM?

467
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,684
[COUGHS]

468
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:13,055
NO. WOULD IT MAKE YOU
MORE COMFORTABLE?

OH, AH... BECKETT.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

WHO'D YOU GET?

476
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:07,577
WHAT?

477
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,946
DID YOU FIND A LAWYER?

478
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,682
I'M A LAWYER.

00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,820
HEY, HOW'S YOUR BABY?

480
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:21,524
OH, YEAH, SHE'S...
WONDERFUL, GREAT.

481
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,493
WHAT'S HER NAME?

482
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,595
LARICE.

483
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:28,698
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME!

484
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:31,368
NAMED HER
AFTER MY SISTER.

485

LOOK, I'M, UH--

486
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:19,081
HOW'D THEY FIND OUT
YOU HAVE THE AIDS?

487
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:22,752
ONE OF THE PARTNERS NOTICED
A LESION ON MY FOREHEAD.

488
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:30,393
UM... BUT HOW
DO YOU GO FROM--

489
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:37,199
HOW DO YOU GO FROM A LAWYER
SPOTTING A LESION, WHICH
COULD'VE BEEN ANYTHING,

490
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,870
TO THE PARTNERS DEDUCING
THAT YOU HAVE AIDS,

491
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:44,941
<i>AND TERMINATING YOU ON THE
BASIS OF THAT CONCLUSION?</i>

492
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,945
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

493
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:01,524
THE PARTNER WHO SPOTTED
THE LESION, WALTER KENTON,

494
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:05,628
WORKED FOR WALSH,
ULMER AND BRAHM IN D.C.

MELISSA BENEDICT,

496
00:38:08,098 --> 00:38:11,968
SHE SHOWED LESIONS ON AND OFF
FOR THE BETTER PART
OF TWO, THREE YEARS.

497
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:16,072
IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE
AROUND THE OFFICE THAT HER
LESIONS WERE CAUSED BY AIDS.

498

<i>BUT THEY DIDN'T
FIRE HER.
NO.</i>

00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:47,383
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTED
WITH A SIMPLE FACT:

612
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:51,053
ANDREW BECKETT WAS FIRED.

613
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:54,290
<i>YOU'LL HEAR
TWO EXPLANATIONS
FOR WHY HE WAS FIRED:</i>

614

OURS... AND THEIRS.

615
00:46:56,493 --> 00:47:01,130
<i>IT IS UP TO YOU TO SIFT

OF TRUTH...</i>

616

<i>UNTIL YOU DETERMINE FOR YOURSELVES
WHICH VERSION SOUNDS THE MOST TRUE.</i>

617
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:07,436
<i>THERE ARE CERTAIN POINTS
I MUST PROVE TO YOU.</i>

618
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:12,208
POINT NUMBER ONE:
ANDREW BECKETT WAS...

619
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:16,178
IS... A BRILLIANT LAWYER,
A GREAT LAWYER.

620
00:47:16,246 --> 00:47:20,016
POINT NUMBER TWO:
ANDREW BECKETT, AFFLICTED
WITH A DEBILITATING DISEASE,

621
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:24,186
MADE THE UNDERSTANDABLE,
THE PERSONAL,

622
00:47:24,254 --> 00:47:27,956
THE LEGAL CHOICE TO KEEP
THE FACT OF HIS ILLNESS
TO HIMSELF.

623
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:32,361
POINT NUMBER THREE:
HIS EMPLOYERS DISCOVERED
HIS ILLNESS.

624
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:35,097
AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE ILLNESS I'M REFERRING TO
IS AIDS.

625
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:38,767
POINT NUMBER FOUR:
THEY PANICKED!

626
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:46,642
AND IN THEIR PANIC,
THEY DID WHAT MOST OF US
WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH AIDS,

627
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:49,578
WHICH IS JUST GET IT
AND EVERYBODY WHO HAS IT...

628
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:53,682
AS FAR AWAY FROM
THE REST OF US AS POSSIBLE.

629
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,855
NOW, THE BEHAVIOR OF
ANDREW BECKETT'S EMPLOYERS
MAY SEEM REASONABLE TO YOU.

630
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:04,093
DOES TO ME. AFTER ALL, AIDS
IS A DEADLY, INCURABLE DISEASE.

631
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:08,531
BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU COME
TO JUDGE CHARLES WHEELER
AND HIS PARTNERS...

632
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:12,868
IN ETHICAL, MORAL
AND HUMAN TERMS,
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS...

633
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:17,073
WHEN THEY FIRED ANDREW
BECKETT BECAUSE HE HAD AIDS,

634
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,842
<i>THEY BROKE THE LAW.</i>

635
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:27,983

636
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,989
ANDREW BECKETT'S PERFORMANCE
ON THE JOB...

637
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:37,926
VARIED FROM COMPETENT,
GOOD...

638
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:41,130
TO OFTENTIMES
MEDIOCRE,

639
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:45,301
TO SOMETIMES FLAGRANTLY
INCOMPETENT.

640
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:48,003
FACT:

641
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:53,609
HE CLAIMS HE'S THE VICTIM
OF LIES AND DECEIT.

642
00:48:54,877 --> 00:48:56,778
FACT:

643
00:48:56,846 --> 00:49:00,583
IT WAS ANDREW BECKETT
WHO LIED,

644
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,487
GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL
HIS DISEASE FROM HIS EMPLOYERS.

645
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:06,922
FACT:

646
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:12,628
HE WAS... SUCCESSFUL
IN HIS DUPLICITY.

647
00:49:12,695 --> 00:49:16,132
THE PARTNERS AT WYANT,
WHEELER DID NOT KNOW...

648
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,202
<i>THAT ANDREW BECKETT HAD
AIDS WHEN THEY FIRED HIM.</i>

649
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:25,307
FACT:

650
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:29,211
ANDREW BECKETT IS DYING.

651
00:49:35,118 --> 00:49:38,086
FACT:

652
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:42,724
ANDREW BECKETT
IS ANGRY...

653
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,093
BECAUSE
HIS LIFESTYLE,

654
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,996
HIS RECKLESS
BEHAVIOR...

655
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:51,099
HAS CUT SHORT
HIS LIFE.

656
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:54,236
<i>AND IN HIS ANGER,
HIS RAGE,</i>

657
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:57,139
<i>HE IS LASHING OUT.</i>

658
00:49:57,207 --> 00:50:01,277
AND HE WANTS SOMEONE
TO PAY.

659
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:07,383
THANK YOU.

660
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:26,935
ANDREW BECKETT REPRESENTED
YOUR COMPANY IN A LAWSUIT
IN 1990. CORRECT?

661
00:50:27,003 --> 00:50:28,937
THAT'S CORRECT.

662
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,273
WERE YOU PLEASED
WITH HIS WORK?

663
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:34,643
WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE
OUTCOME OF THE LITIGATION.

664
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:40,383
SATISFIED.

665
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:43,452
MR. LAIRD,

666
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,289
WHEN I APPROACHED YOU
ABOUT BEING A WITNESS,

667
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:50,726
YOU GAVE SWORN TESTIMONY
IN A DEPOSITION,
IS THAT CORRECT?

668
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:53,095
THAT'S CORRECT.

669
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:58,467
IN THAT DEPOSITION,
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
"IMPRESSED AND DELIGHTED...

670
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,736
WITH THE QUALITY OF
ANDREW BECKETT'S WORK."

671
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:02,805
DO YOU RECALL
SAYING THAT?

672
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:13,048
IN ALL HONESTY,
I WAS DELIGHTED...

673
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:15,751
WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS
OF ANDY'S EFFORTS.

674
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:20,055
BUT IN GENERAL,
I FOUND THE WORK TO BE...

675
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:23,058
MERELY SATISFACTORY.

676
00:51:23,126 --> 00:51:25,461
UH-HUH.

677
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:32,835
DO YOU AGREE...

678
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:36,338
THAT A BOLOGNA SANDWICH
IS A SATISFACTORY MEAL?

679
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:40,876
WHEREAS CAVIAR
AND CHAMPAGNE...

680
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:45,213
ROAST DUCK AND...
BAKED ALASKA,

681
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:47,550
THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED
A DELIGHTFUL MEAL?

682
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:51,754
WE OBJECT.
THESE GASTRONOMICAL COMMENTS
ARE IRRELEVANT, YOUR HONOR.

683
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:54,457
[JOE]
THEY ARE NOT IRRELEVANT.

684
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:59,795
YOUR HONOR, FIVE MONTHS AGO
THIS WITNESS CHARACTERIZED
ANDREW BECKETT AS CAVIAR.

685
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:01,730
NOW HE'S CALLING HIM
A BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

686
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:04,232
I THINK THE JURY
IS ENTITLED TO KNOW...

687
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,604
WHAT POWERFUL FORCE
HAS CAUSED HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

688
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:12,608
HE HASN'T CHANGED
HIS MIND.

689
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:14,844
HE'S AMPLIFIED
HIS ANSWER.

690
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:16,946
OBJECTION SUSTAINED.

691
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:24,119
ALL RIGHT.

692
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:31,894
MR. LAIRD, EXPLAIN
THIS TO ME LIKE I'M
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD, OKAY?

693
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:36,031
DID ANDREW BECKETT
WIN YOUR LAWSUIT FOR YOU?

694
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,601
YES, WE WON.

695
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:43,038
OH, CONGRATULATIONS!
THAT MUST'VE BEEN A VERY...

696
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:46,642
SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE.

697
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,244
<i>[CHANTING]
HOMOPHOBIA'S GOT TO GO.
HEY, HEY!</i>

698
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:52,815
<i>HOMOPHOBIA'S GOT TO GO.
HEY, HEY!</i>

699
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:02,525
[CHANTING CONTINUES]

700
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:17,740
READY, MR. BECKETT?
GET READY.
HERE THEY COME.

701
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:20,843
[CHANTING]
NO RIGHTS FOR SODOMITES!

702
00:53:22,345 --> 00:53:25,614
ADAM AND EVE!
NOT ADAM AND STEVE!

703
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:27,950
THOU SHALT NOT LIE
WITH MANKIND.

704
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:31,119
DO YOU SEE THIS AS
A GAY RIGHTS ISSUE?

705
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:35,424
I AM NOT POLITICAL.
I JUST WANT WHAT IS FAIR,
WHAT IS RIGHT.

706
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,760
BUT YOU ARE GAY,
AREN'T YOU?

707
00:53:37,827 --> 00:53:41,764
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT, YES, I AM.

708
00:53:41,831 --> 00:53:45,133
TOTALLY IRRELEVANT.
DOESN'T MATTER.

709
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:48,336
DO YOU THINK THAT
HOMOSEXUALS DESERVE
SPECIAL TREATMENT?

710
00:53:48,404 --> 00:53:51,173
<i>HELL NO!
[JOE]
WE'RE IN PHILADELPHIA,</i>

711
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,977
THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE,
BIRTHPLACE OF FREEDOM...

712
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:58,513
WHERE THE FOUNDING FATHERS
AUTHORED THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.

713
00:53:58,582 --> 00:54:00,950
<i>I DON'T RECALL THAT
GLORIOUS DOCUMENT SAYING...</i>

714
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:03,886
ANYTHING ABOUT ALL STRAIGHT MEN
ARE CREATED EQUAL.

715
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,354
I BELIEVE IT SAYS
"ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL."

716
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:08,824
GIMME A GODDAMN BREAK.

717
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:11,594
[TV]
AS FAR AS SOMEONE BEING FIRED,
FROM A LAW FIRM OR A BUSINESS,

718
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:14,730
IF WE FOUND THAT THEIR ACTION
WAS DISCRIMINATORY,

719
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,332
THEY COULD NO LONGER DO BUSINESS
WITH THE CITY.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.

720
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,367
JOE.

721
00:54:19,435 --> 00:54:24,172
YOU'RE NOT GETTIN' A LITTLE
LIGHT IN THE SNEAKERS,
ARE YOU, PAL?

722
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,109
[LAUGHING]

723
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:38,420
YEAH, I AM, FILKO.
I'M, UH... I'M CHANGING.

724
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,723
I'M ON THE PROWL.

725
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,525
AND I'M LOOKING FOR A HUNK,
NOT JUST ANY HUNK.

726
00:54:43,593 --> 00:54:46,929
I MEAN A MAN,
A REAL MAN LIKE YOU.

727
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:51,500
YOU CAN TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO.
YOU WANNA PLAY SAILOR?

728
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,737
YOU REMEMBER? I'M COLUMBUS,
YOU'RE THE FIRST MATE?
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

729
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:57,940
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THESE PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK.

730
00:54:58,008 --> 00:55:00,776
BUT A LAW'S
BEEN BROKEN.

731
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:04,713
YOU REMEMBER THE LAW,
DON'T YOU?

732
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,753
AT LEAST WE AGREE
ON ONE THING, JOE.

733
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,921
WHAT'S THAT,
CHARLIE?

734
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:16,358
TUTTI-FRUTTIS
MAKE ME SICK TOO.

735
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,502
[JOE] MRS. BENEDICT,
IS IT TRUE YOU WORKED FOR
WALSH, ULMER AND BRAHM...

736
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,840
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE SAME TIME
AS WALTER KENTON?
THAT'S CORRECT.

737
00:55:31,908 --> 00:55:34,810
AT THAT TIME, DID
WALTER KENTON KNOW...

738
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,913
THE K.S. LESIONS ON YOUR FACE
AND ARMS WERE CAUSED BY AIDS?

739
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:41,283
DEFINITELY. I TOLD
ALL THE PARTNERS.

740
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,352
HOW DID WALTER KENTON
TREAT YOU AFTER YOU
TOLD HIM YOU HAD AIDS?

741
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,656
EVERY TIME HE'D COME
IN CONTACT WITH ME,

742
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:50,625
HE'D GET THIS LOOK
ON HIS FACE.

743
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:53,062
I REFER TO IT AS THE
"OH, GOD" EXPRESSION.

744
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:56,464
<i>AS IN, "OH, GOD, HERE COMES
THAT WOMAN WITH AIDS."</i>

745
00:55:56,532 --> 00:56:00,936
THANK YOU, MRS. BENEDICT.
NO MORE QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR.

746
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:04,873
MRS. BENEDICT, HOW DID YOU
CONTRACT THE AIDS VIRUS?

747
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:09,078
THROUGH A TRANSFUSION.
I LOST A LOT OF BLOOD GIVING
BIRTH TO MY SECOND CHILD.

748
00:56:09,145 --> 00:56:12,380
<i>SO, IN YOUR CASE
THERE WAS NO BEHAVIOR
ON YOUR PART...</i>

749
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:15,184
WHICH CAUSED YOU TO BE
INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS.

750
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:18,520
IT WAS SOMETHING YOU
WERE UNABLE TO AVOID.
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

751
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:22,157
I GUESS.

752
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:29,331
THANK YOU.

753
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:31,633
<i>[MRS. BENEDICT]
BUT I DON'T
CONSIDER MYSELF...</i>

754
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:34,536
<i>ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANYONE
ELSE WITH THIS DISEASE.</i>

755
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:39,808
I'M NOT GUILTY.
I'M NOT INNOCENT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE.

756
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:41,343
THANK YOU,
MRS. BENEDICT.

757
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,512
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS
AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR.

<i>[JOE]
BEYOND NOTICING THE MARKS
ON HIS FACE,</i>

<i>WERE THERE OTHER THINGS
ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE,
MISS BURTON,</i>

761
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:01,529
THAT MADE YOU SUSPECT
THAT ANDREW HAD AIDS?

762
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:05,167
HE WAS GETTING THINNER
AND SEEMED VERY TIRED SOMETIMES.

763
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:09,104
BUT HE WAS WORKING SO HARD.
I FELT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

764
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:14,009
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
TRYING TO PRETEND THAT
THEY DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING.

765
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:16,178
OBJECTION.

766
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:18,480
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION,
PLEASE.

767
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:21,750
HAVE YOU EVER FELT
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST
AT WYANT, WHEELER?

00:57:24,453 --> 00:57:26,454
WELL, YES.

769
00:57:26,522 --> 00:57:28,556
IN WHAT WAY?

770
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:31,593
WELL, MR. WHEELER'S
SECRETARY, LYDIA,

771
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,963

HAD A PROBLEM WITH
MY EARRINGS.

<i>REALLY?
APPARENTLY MR. WHEELER
FELT THEY WERE...</i>

773
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:42,004
TOO "ETHNIC"
IS THE WORD SHE USED.

774
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:47,542
SHE TOLD ME HE SAID HE WOULD
LIKE IT IF I WORE SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS GARISH,

775
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:51,780
A LITTLE SMALLER
AND MORE... "AMERICAN."

776
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:54,016
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

777
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,085
I SAID, "MY EARRINGS
ARE AMERICAN.

778
00:57:57,153 --> 00:57:59,955
THEY'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN."

786
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:26,748

AS TO CALL IT UNFETTERED.

787
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:30,285

HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN...

789

IN A FIRM WHICH PRACTICES
DISCRIMINATION...

792
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:48,536
AS WANTONLY AND CONSISTENTLY
AS YOU AND MR. BECKETT CLAIM?

793
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:53,475
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
COULD IT BE...

794
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,245
THAT THESE...

OVERSIMPLIFY THE ISSUE SOMEWHAT.

799
00:59:11,895 --> 00:59:14,629
THANK YOU, MISS BURTON,
I'LL...

800
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:17,266
TAKE THAT NOTE
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

801
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,934
[LAUGHTER]

802
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,022
HOW'S THE
TRIAL GOING?
EXCUSE ME?

803
00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:42,657
IT'S A GREAT CASE.
I SAW YOU ON TELEVISION.
I'M A LAW STUDENT AT PENN.

804
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:45,027
HOW YOU DOIN'?
I'M ALL RIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU?

805
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:46,861
SAW ME ON TV?
YEAH.

806
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,830
IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL, PENN.
WHAT YEAR ARE YOU IN?

807
00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:53,135
SECOND. LISTEN,
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU...

808
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:55,971
THIS CASE,
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT.

809
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,007
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
I THINK YOU'RE DOING
A FANTASTIC JOB.

810
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:02,644
HEY.
THANK YOU.

811
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:05,280
WHEN YOU GRADUATE,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

812
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,849
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

813
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,653
LISTEN, JOE?
YEAH?

814
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,190
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DRINK?
I JUST FINISHED A GAME
AND COULD USE A BEER.

815
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,792
AH, NO, I CAN'T.
MY WIFE IS--

816
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:23,765
I DON'T PICK UP PEOPLE
IN DRUGSTORES EVERY DAY.

817
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,876
WHAT?
YOU THINK I'M GAY?
AREN'T YOU?

818
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:37,145
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I LOOK GAY TO YOU?

819
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,982
DO I LOOK GAY TO YOU?

820
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:42,851
JOE, RELAX.

821
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:45,520
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RELAX?
I OUGHTA KICK YOUR
FAGGOTY LITTLE ASS.

822
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:48,756
TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT,
GEEZ!

823
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:56,465
THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND
OF BULLSHIT THAT MAKES
PEOPLE HATE YOUR...

824
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,500
FAGGOTY ASS.

825
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:01,569
YOU WANT TO TRY
AND KICK MY ASS, JOE?

826
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:03,671
ASSHOLE.
NO, YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE,
BUDDY!

827
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,116
[ATTORNEY]
PLEASE CONTINUE, MISS O'HARA.

828
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:18,753
<i>WE WERE GOING CRAZY LOOKING
FOR THIS COMPLAINT.</i>

829
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:20,922
I FELT LIKE I WAS IN
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

830
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,359
MR. BECKETT WAS SCREAMING
AT EVERYBODY AND HE JUST--

831
01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:26,628
HE LOOKED SO FREAKY.

832
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:30,365
MR. KENTON KEPT SAYING,
"YOU LOST THE HIGHLINE
COMPLAINT?"

833
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:33,468
AND HE CALLED MR. WHEELER,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN...

834
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:37,005
JAMEY COMES IN WITH
THE COMPLAINT IN HIS HAND.

835
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:42,177
HE SAYS, "IT WAS IN
CENTRAL FILES, ANDY."
CENTRAL FILES?

836
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:47,782
CENTRAL FILES IS A PLACE
WHERE PAPERWORK IS SENT
WHEN CASES ARE CLOSED.

837
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,817
JAMEY RAN IT OVER TO
THE COURT JUST IN TIME,

838
01:01:49,885 --> 01:01:55,390
AND EVERYBODY JUST STOOD
THERE COMPLETELY WASTED.

839
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:58,093
AND MR.--

840
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,429

JUST KEPT SAYING,

841
01:02:00,496 --> 01:02:04,966
"I'M SORRY. SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS."

842
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:07,936
<i>THANK YOU,
MISS O'HARA.</i>

843
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:10,004
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS
AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR.

844
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:14,176
[JUDGE]
ALL RIGHT.
MR. MILLER.

845
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:23,918
MAY I?
CERTAINLY.

846
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:35,597
OH, THANK YOU.

847
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:38,500
YOU OKAY?
YES.

848
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:41,436
YOU WANT A GLASS
OF WATER OR SOMETHING?
NO.

849
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:46,608
WAS ANDY
A GOOD BOSS?

850
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:49,277
YES.

851
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:53,415
HE WAS VERY SWEET.

852
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,421
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE
HIS WORK AS AN ATTORNEY?

853
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:02,757
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
I JUST WORKED FOR HIM.

854
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:04,926
[LAUGHTER]

855
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:09,498
EXCUSE ME, YOUR HONOR,
BUT IS THIS FOR THE RECORD?

856
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:13,668
MR. MILLER, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
RETURN TO COUNSEL'S TABLE.

857
01:03:13,736 --> 01:03:16,571
YES, SIR.

858
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,682
MISS O'HARA?

859
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,817
YES?

860
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:32,587
<i>WERE YOU AWARE,
AT ANY TIME,</i>

861
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:35,423
OF ANY PROBLEMS THAT
THE SENIOR PARTNERS HAD...

862
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:39,528
WITH THE QUALITY OF
ANDREW'S WORK PRIOR TO
THIS MISSING FILE EPISODE?

863
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:43,064
NO. NO, I WASN'T.

864
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:46,768
THANK YOU.
NO MORE QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR.

865
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:56,611
[JOE] IS ANDREW BECKET
THE KIND OF LAWYER WHO
MISPLACES CRUCIAL DOCUMENTS?

866
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:00,348
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
NO.

867
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:05,053
MR. COLLINS, IF YOU WANTED TO
MAKE A LAWYER LOOK INCOMPETENT,
WOULD THIS BE A GOOD WAY?

868
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,823
HIDING AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT
MAYBE FOR A FEW HOURS,

869
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:13,127
AND THEN MAKING IT LOOK LIKE
THE RESPONSIBLE LAWYER
MISPLACED IT?

870
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,398
WHY WOULD MR. WHEELER
AND THE OTHERS BEHAVE
SO OUTRAGEOUSLY?

871
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:18,766
BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT
ANDY WAS SICK?

872
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:21,369
[WHISPERS] HE'S NOT
ANSWERING THE QUESTION.
PERHAPS.

873
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:25,973
WE'VE HAD LAWYERS WHO'VE HAD
HEART ATTACKS, ULCERS,
PROSTATE CANCER, LEUKEMIA!

874
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,109
NO ONE
SANDBAGGED THEM.

875
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:33,215
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THIS FILE BEING LOST
ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE?

876
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:34,982
<i>OBJECTION.
I'LL REPHRASE.</i>

877
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,420
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS FILE
BEING MISPLACED?

878
01:04:38,487 --> 01:04:40,154
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

879
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:41,989
ARE YOU
A HOMOSEXUAL?

880
01:04:42,057 --> 01:04:45,293
<i>WHAT?
ARE YOU A HOMOSEXUAL?
ANSWER THE QUESTION!</i>

881
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:48,263
<i>ARE YOU A HOMO?
ARE YOU A FAGGOT?</i>

882
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:50,998
A QUEEN,
PILLOW BITER, FAIRY?

883
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:55,136
BOOTIE SNATCHER,
RUMP ROASTER?
ARE YOU GAY?

884
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,505
<i>OBJECTION!
[GAVEL POUNDING]
ORDER!</i>

885
01:04:57,573 --> 01:05:01,109
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
SUDDENLY COUNSEL'S ATTACKING
HIS OWN WITNESS?

886
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:06,848
<i>MR. COLLINS' SEXUAL
ORIENTATION HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS CASE.</i>

887
01:05:06,915 --> 01:05:09,083
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT,
MISS CONINE.

888
01:05:12,187 --> 01:05:16,057
<i>[JUDGE]
WOULD YOU APPROACH
THE BENCH, MR. MILLER?</i>

889
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,672
[JUDGE, QUIETLY]
COULD YOU KINDLY
SHARE WITH ME...

890
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,141
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON
INSIDE YOUR HEAD,

891
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:37,345
BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT,
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

892
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:42,917
YOUR HONOR,

893
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:47,289
EVERYBODY IN THIS
COURTROOM...

894
01:05:47,356 --> 01:05:51,159
IS THINKING ABOUT...
SEXUAL ORIENTATION,
SEXUAL PREFERENCE,

895
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:53,995
WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO CALL IT.

896
01:05:54,062 --> 01:05:58,300
WHO DOES WHAT TO WHOM
AND HOW THEY DO IT.

897
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:01,703
THEY'RE LOOKING
AT ANDREW BECKETT.
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

898
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:05,740
THEY'RE LOOKING AT
MR. WHEELER, MISS CONINE,
EVEN YOU, YOUR HONOR.

899
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,875
THEY'RE WONDERING

900
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:12,480
[CHUCKLES]
TRUST ME, I KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING
AT ME AND THINKING ABOUT IT.

901
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:15,016
SO LET'S JUST GET IT OUT
IN THE OPEN.

902
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,419
LET'S GET IT OUT
OF THE CLOSET.

903
01:06:17,486 --> 01:06:20,922
<i>BECAUSE THIS CASE IS NOT
JUST ABOUT AIDS, IS IT?</i>

904
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:23,825
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
THIS CASE IS REALLY ALL ABOUT:

905
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:26,428
THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S HATRED,
OUR LOATHING,

906
01:06:26,495 --> 01:06:31,199
OUR FEAR
OF HOMOSEXUALS.

907
01:06:31,266 --> 01:06:34,001
AND HOW THAT CLIMATE
OF HATRED AND FEAR...

908
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:38,373
TRANSLATED INTO THE FIRING
OF THIS PARTICULAR HOMOSEXUAL,

909
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:41,409
MY CLIENT,
ANDREW BECKETT.

910
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:46,815
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT,
MR. MILLER.

911
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:53,287
VERY GOOD.

912
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,657
IN THIS COURTROOM, MR. MILLER,
JUSTICE IS BLIND...

913
01:06:55,725 --> 01:07:00,729
TO MATTERS OF RACE,
CREED, COLOR,

914
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:03,565
RELIGION AND
SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

915
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:07,335
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR HONOR,

916
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:12,106
WE DON'T LIVE IN THIS
COURTROOM, THOUGH, DO WE?

917
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:14,208
NO, WE DON'T.

918
01:07:14,276 --> 01:07:16,978
HOWEVER, AS REGARDS
TO THIS WITNESS,

919
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,214
I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN
THE DEFENSE'S OBJECTION.

920
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:26,755
HOW MANY WEEKS WOULD
YOU BE OUT TO SEA
WITHOUT STOPPING AT PORT?

921
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:31,259
OH, ANYWHERE FROM
TWO WEEKS TO SEVERAL MONTHS.

922
01:07:31,326 --> 01:07:33,294
ANY WOMEN ON BOARD?

923
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:36,097
AH, NOT WHEN I WAS
IN THE NAVY.

924
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:42,136
SO, DURING THESE
LONG VOYAGES,

925
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:46,207
MONTHS AT A TIME OUT TO SEA,
NO WOMEN IN SIGHT,

926
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:50,545
HUNDREDS OF HARDWORKING, ROBUST YOUNG
MEN IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES,

927
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:54,015
AT THE PEAK OF THEIR NATURAL
APPETITES AND DESIRES,

928
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:58,352
THEIR GOD-GIVEN HORMONAL
INSTINCTS, ANYTHING GOING ON?

929
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:01,188
GOING ON?
LIKE WHAT?

930
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:05,226
LIKE TWO SAILORS DOWN BELOW
MAKING FLIPPY-FLOP.

931
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:08,996
<i>[MISS CONINE] OBJECTION.
[JUDGE] MR. MILLER.</i>

932
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,032
WE HAD ONE GUY
LIKE THAT.

933
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:13,535
YOU HAVEN'T RULED ON
MY OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

934
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:15,437
<i>[JUDGE]
GO ON, MR. MILLER.</i>

935
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:19,273
YOU HAD ONE GUY "LIKE THAT."
YOU MEAN A HOMOSEXUAL?

936
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:23,678
HE STRUTTED AROUND QUARTERS NAKED
TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY TO NOTICE HIM.

937
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,947
MADE EVERYONE SICK.

938
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:27,982
HE WAS DESTROYING
OUR MORALE.

939
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:31,653
SO WE LET HIM KNOW THIS KIND
OF BEHAVIOR WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

940
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,188
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
WHAT'D YOU DO?
WROTE HIM A LETTER?

941
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:37,258
WE STUCK HIS HEAD
IN A LATRINE AFTER
TEN OF US HAD USED IT.

942
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:41,228
<i>YOU TAUGHT HIM A LESSON,
DIDN'T YOU?
YES, WE DID.</i>

943
01:08:41,296 --> 01:08:43,765
<i>LIKE FIRING ANDREW BECKETT
TAUGHT HIM A LESSON.
OBJECTION.</i>

944
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:47,068
I WITHDRAW. YOU WERE
AWARE WHEN YOU WORKED
WITH MELISSA BENEDICT...

945
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:49,537
THAT SHE HAD AIDS,
IS THAT CORRECT?

946
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:51,806
SHE DIDN'T TRY
TO CONCEAL IT.

947
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:55,577
SO YOU ARE AWARE OF THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BRUISE
AND A LESION. CORRECT?

948
01:08:55,644 --> 01:08:59,046
BECKETT TOLD ME HE HAD
BEEN HIT BY A RACQUETBALL,
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

949
01:08:59,114 --> 01:09:03,685
DIDN'T YOU TRY TO AVOID CONTACT
WITH MRS. BENEDICT AFTER
YOU FOUND OUT SHE HAD AIDS?

950
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:06,120
SHE SAYS AND I QUOTE,
THAT YOU...

951
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:08,890
"WERE REPULSED BY HER,
YOU AVOIDED HER."
IS THAT CORRECT?

952
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,993
I FELT, AND
I STILL FEEL NOTHING...

953
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:16,263
BUT THE DEEPEST SYMPATHY
AND COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE
LIKE MELISSA...

954
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:20,969
WHO CONTRACTED THIS
TERRIBLE DISEASE THROUGH
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.
