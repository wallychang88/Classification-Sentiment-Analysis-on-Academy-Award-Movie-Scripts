1
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,356
<i>All right, you chipmunks.</i>
<i>Ready to sing your song?</i>

2
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,900
<i>- I'll say we are!</i>
<i>- Yeah. Let's sing it now.</i>

3
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,568
<i>- OK, Simon?</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

4
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,404
<i>- OK, Theodore?</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

5
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>OK, Alvin? Alvin?</i>

6
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,536
<i>- Alvin!</i>
<i>- OK!</i>

7
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,458
You wanna be Atticus Finch.

8
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,794
- Oh, that makes me feel so good!
- I like him.

9
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,297
- Why?
- Well, he's honest.

10
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,466
- Yes.
- He stands up for the right thing.

11
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,594
- Yes.
- And he's a good father.

12
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,596
- He is.
- He did it all by himself.

13
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,598
- Did what all by himself?
- Raised his kids.

14
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,934
He didn't raise them by himself!
Excuse me, who was the woman

15
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,228
- that came to their house every day?
- Calpurnia.

16
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,148
- Calpurnia. He remembered!
- And what about Boo?

17
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,942
What about Boo?
I think that Boo Radley

18
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,819
is one of the most interesting
characters in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

19
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,615
Excuse me? I'm a teacher.

20
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,242
"Xmas" is not a word
in the English language.

21
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,661
It's either "Merry Christmas"

22
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,248
or "Happy Holidays."

23
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,753
- Thank you.
- Sure.

24
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,594
- Mom. Tell me more about Livia.
- She killed everybody off,

25
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,889
so her son Tiberius could inherit
the throne, just like Nixon.

26
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,392
The same stories...
Shakespeare, you know,

27
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,312
like those plays we went
to see at the Old Globe.

28
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,523
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

29
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,361
- Want somethin' to eat?
- Oh, no thanks. I already ate.

30
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,698
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine. I already ate.

31
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,242
Wait. You've been kissing.

32
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,120
- No, I haven't. No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have. Yes, you have.

33
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,915
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

34
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,919
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

35
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,300
What you got under your coat?

36
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,597
It's unfair that we can't
listen to our music.

37
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,475
It's because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex.

38
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,729
- Simon & Garfunkel is poetry.
- Yes, it is the poetry of drugs

39
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,483
and promiscuous sex.
Honey, they're on pot.

40
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,031
First, it was butter.
Then it was sugar and white flour,

41
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,910
bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock and roll, motorcycles.

42
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:32,081
Then, it was celebrating Christmas
on a day in September

43
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,042
when you knew it
wouldn't be commercialized.

44
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,795
- What else are you gonna ban?
- Honey, you want

45
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,088
to rebel against knowledge.

46
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,924
I'm trying to give you the CliffsNotes
on how to live life in this world.

47
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,468
We're like nobody else I know!

48
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,763
I am a college professor.
Why can't I teach my own kids?

49
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,267
- Use me!
- Darryl says that you use knowledge

50
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,228
to keep me down.
He says I'm a "yes" person

51
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,064
and you are trying to raise us
in a "no" environment.

52
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,943
Well, clearly "no" is a word
Darryl doesn't hear much.

53
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,822
I can't live here! I hate you!
Even William hates you.

54
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,699
- I don't hate her.
- You do hate her.

55
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,075
You don't even know the truth.

56
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,453
- Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

57
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,623
- Hey!
- This is a house of lies!

58
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,460
There it is.

59
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,547
- Your sister used the "f" word.
- I think she said, "feck."

60
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,217
- What's the difference?
- The letter "u."

61
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,798
- Are you really in our grade?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,093
Hey, guys, check it out.

63
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
William doesn't have any pubes.

64
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,263
How old are you, man?

65
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,058
He's not a man.
He's a little baby-kid.

66
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,894
- I bet he doesn't even get zits yet.
- Everyone has hair.

67
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,687
- What's wrong with you?
- Pipsqueak!

68
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,397
- How old are you? Like two?
- What's your age, man?

69
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,816
- How old are you?
- You're pathetic!

70
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,610
Where are your pubes?

71
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,780
I had 'em.

72
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,865
I shaved 'em off.

73
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,873
He's a funny guy!

74
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,209
See you, Pubes.

75
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,011
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.

76
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,389
Put on your seatbelt.

77
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,145
- We got our annuals today.
- Received your annual.

78
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,021
Right, received.

79
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,405
I look so much younger
than everyone else.

80
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,823
Enjoy it while you can.

81
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,618
Mom, it's time.

82
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,331
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Mom, pull over.

83
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,667
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

84
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,678
- He knows how old he is.
- But other kids make fun of him

85
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,140
because of how young he looks.
Nobody includes him.

86
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,267
They call him "The Narc"
behind his back.

87
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,186
- They do?
- What's a narc?

88
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,940
- A narcotics officer.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

89
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,402
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

90
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,238
I'm 12. She skipped me a grade.

91
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,282
Big deal. I'm a year younger.

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,576
They're 13, I'm 12.

93
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,290
- Aren't I?
- I also put you in first grade

94
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,000
when you were five,
and I never told you.

95
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,462
- So I'm how old?
- Don't you realize that this

96
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,297
- is gonna scar him forever?
- Honey, sweetheart,

97
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,717
don't be Cleopatra. We have
to be both his mother and his dad.

98
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,220
- You put too much pressure on him.
- How old...

99
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,765
And when he rebels in some strange
and odd way, don't blame me.

100
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,434
- ...am I?
- I skipped you an extra grade.

101
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,478
You're 11!

102
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,899
Eleven?

103
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,320
So you skipped fifth grade!
There's too much padding in the grades.

104
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,197
- I taught elementary school.
- Eleven?

105
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,659
You also skipped kindergarten,

106
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,662
because I taught it to you
when you were four.

107
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,877
This explains... so much.

108
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,296
You've robbed him of an adolescence.

109
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,049
Adolescence is a marketing tool.

110
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,512
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty,

111
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,473
but you're just gonna have
to shine it on for a little while.

112
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,434
Who needs a "crowd"?

113
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,188
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

114
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,025
You're unique.
You're two years ahead of everybody.

115
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,945
Take those extra years
and do what you want.

116
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,948
Go to Europe for a year.
Take a look around.

117
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,866
See what you like.

118
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,744
Follow your dream.

119
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,289
You'll still be the youngest lawyer
in the country.

120
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,124
Your dad was so proud of you.

121
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,126
He knew that you were
a predominantly accelerated child.

122
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,505
What about me?

123
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,884
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

124
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,310
Well, somebody's
gotta be normal around here.

125
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,813
Eleven.

126
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,694
This song explains why I'm leaving
home to become a stewardess.

127
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,322
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,824
I love you.

129
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,444
Hey, man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

130
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,083
One day... you'll be cool.

131
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:56,465
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

132
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,639
Watch the plant.

133
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,561
You're 18 and I can't stop you.

134
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,484
Bye.

135
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,323
She'll be back.

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,203
Maybe not soon.

137
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,668
Hey, William. Hey!

138
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,805
<i>Here's a theory</i>
<i>for you to disregard...</i>

139
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,974
<i>...completely.</i>

140
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,520
Music, you know, true music...

141
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,689
...not just rock and roll,
it chooses you.

142
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,609
It lives in your car, or alone,
listening to your headphones...

143
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,489
<i>...with the vast, scenic bridges</i>
<i>and angelic choirs in your brain.</i>

144
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,782
<i>It's a place apart...</i>

145
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,578
...from the vast, benign lap of America.

146
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,331
Did you know that <i>The Letter</i>
by The Box Tops

147
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,876
was a minute and 58 seconds long?
It means nothing.

148
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,172
Nil. But it takes them less
than two minutes to accomplish

149
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,260
what Jethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish!

150
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:33,682
You see that, this is fatuous,
pseudo-blubber. You know?

151
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,144
I mean, which is fine, but...
foist it off as art?

152
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,814
You know, or The Doors... Jim Morrison?

153
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,191
He's a drunken buffoon,
posing as a poet.

154
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,694
- I like The Doors.
- Give me The Guess Who.

155
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,573
They got the courage
to be drunken buffoons,

156
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,241
which makes them poetic.

157
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,411
It's quite an honor to have
the world's greatest rock critic

158
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,707
and editor of <i>Creem</i> magazine back
home in San Diego for a few days:

159
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,878
- Lester Bangs.
<i>- Live, American Woman.</i>

160
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,549
Have you ever... The most brilliant
piece of gobbledy-gook ever!

161
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,386
Give me some <i>White Light/White Heat.</i>

162
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,599
Iggy Pop! Amen.

163
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,101
Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist either.

164
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,936
Lester, don't you think
it's a little bit early for that?

165
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,730
Not for me.

166
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:26,568
OK, that was Lester Bangs, this
is Alice Wisdom, and here is Iggy Pop.

167
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,578
<i>So you're the kid</i>
<i>who's been sending me those articles</i>

168
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,915
- from the school newspaper.
- Yeah. Yeah.

169
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,543
I've been doin' some stuff
for a local underground paper also.

170
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,588
What are you, like
the star of your school?

171
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,590
- They hate me.
- You'll meet them all again

172
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,551
on their long journey to the middle.

173
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,514
Your writing is damn good. It's just a
shame you missed out on rock and roll.

174
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,767
- It's over. It's over!
- Over?

175
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,186
You got here just in time
for the death rattle.

176
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,314
Last gasp. Last grope.

177
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,234
- At least I'm here for that.
- Yeah, what do you type on?

178
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,986
Smith Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

179
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,782
- And you like Lou Reed?
- The early stuff.

180
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,909
In his new stuff,
he's trying to be Bowie.

181
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,203
He should just... be himself.

182
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,455
Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou,

183
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,457
and if Lou's doing Bowie,

184
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,294
- Lou's still doing Lou.
- If you like Lou.

185
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,673
- You take drugs?
- No.

186
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,133
Smart kid.

187
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,970
I used to do speed.

188
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,806
You know, and sometimes
a little cough syrup?

189
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,269
I'd stay up all night,
just writin' and writin'.

190
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,105
I mean, like 25 pages of dribble.

191
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,150
You know, about
The Faces, or Coltrane.

192
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,528
You know, just to fuckin' write.

193
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,657
All right. It's been nice to meet ya.

194
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,492
Keep sending me your stuff.

195
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,663
I can't stand here all day
talking to my many fans.

196
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,001
Yeah. I understand. OK.

197
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,420
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. Bye.

198
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,392
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,275
You need a ride?

200
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,946
No, man, I took the bus.

201
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,702
You know, because once you go to LA,
you're gonna have friends like crazy.

202
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,289
But they're gonna be fake friends.
They're gonna try to corrupt you.

203
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,250
You got an honest face,
and they're gonna tell you everything.

204
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:51,505
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

205
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,217
- Is it OK if I...
- If you're gonna be a true journalist,

206
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,385
you know, a rock journalist...

207
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,889
First, you never get paid much.

208
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:05,060
But you will get free records
from the record company.

209
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,398
Jesus.

210
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,443
Fuckin' nothin' about you
that is controversial, man.

211
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,281
God, it's gonna get ugly, man.
They're gonna buy you drinks,

212
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,035
you're gonna meet girls, they're gonna
try to fly you places for free,

213
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,079
offer you drugs.
I know, it sounds great,

214
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,872
but these people
are not your friends.

215
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,416
These are people who want you
to write sanctimonious stories

216
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,126
about the genius of rock stars.

217
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,255
And they will ruin
rock and roll and strangle

218
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,382
everything we love about it.

219
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,592
They're trying to buy respectability

220
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,638
for a form that is gloriously
and righteously dumb!

221
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,558
I mean, you're smart enough
to know that.

222
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,186
And the day it ceases to be dumb
is the day that it ceases to be real.

223
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:52,274
Right? And then it just
becomes an industry of cool.

224
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:57,070
I'm tellin' you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock and roll.

225
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,950
I mean, the war is over. They won.

226
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,078
Ninety-nine percent of what passes
for rock and roll these days,

227
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,164
silence is more compelling.

228
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,293
That's why I think you should just
turn around and go back, you know,

229
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,795
and be a lawyer or something.

230
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,510
But I can tell from your face
that you won't.

231
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,346
I can give you 35 bucks.

232
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,348
Give me 1,000 words on Black Sabbath.

233
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,144
- An assignment?
- Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,445
Hey.

235
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,867
You have to make your reputation
on being honest,

236
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,952
and...

237
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,497
you know, unmerciful.

238
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,167
Honest.

239
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,794
Unmerciful.

240
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,339
If you get into a jam,
you can call me.

241
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,341
I stay up late.

242
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,848
Look at this. An entire
generation of Cinderellas,

243
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,934
and there's no slipper coming.

244
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,561
You just remember,
you wanted to be Abraham Lincoln.

245
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,022
You wanted to be Atticus Finch
<i>in To Kill A Mockingbird.</i>

246
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,983
You want to get high?
Lookin' to get high?

247
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,653
All I have to do is listen.

248
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,823
- That's what Lester Bangs said.
- As long as I know this is a hobby.

249
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,202
I'll pick you up right here
at 11:00 sharp.

250
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,497
If you get lost, use the family whistle.

251
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,875
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

252
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,555
- Don't take drugs!
- "Don't take drugs!"

253
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,227
Yes, Mother!

254
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,247
Hi. I'm William Miller.
I'm here from <i>Creem</i> Magazine,

255
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,832
to interview Black Sabbath.

256
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,087
Not on the list.

257
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,600
- I'm a journalist. Here's a copy...
- You're not on the list.

258
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,021
Go to the top of the ramp
with the other girls.

259
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,234
We won't bite.

260
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,862
What happens after I go
to the top of the ramp?

261
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:56,541
- Who are you with?
- Me? I'm with myself.

262
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,044
No, who are you with. What band?

263
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:04,090
I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

264
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,720
- I'm not... Not a... You know.
- You're not a what?

265
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,102
You're not a what?

266
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,648
- Not a... groupie.
- Groupie?

267
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,860
We are not groupies.

268
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,322
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

269
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,159
Groupies sleep with rock stars 'cause
they wanna be near someone famous.

270
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,662
We're here because of the music.
We are Band Aids.

271
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,164
She used to run a school
for Band Aids.

272
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,667
We don't have intercourse with
these guys. We support the music.

273
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,671
We inspire the music. We're here...
because of the music.

274
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,007
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.

275
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:50,303
- It's famous.
- It's a long story.

276
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,973
I'm retired now. Visiting friends.

277
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,186
She was the one who changed
everything. She was the one who said,

278
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:02,232
"No more sex. No more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts."

279
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,734
- Right. Right.
- Just blow jobs, and that's it.

280
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,861
It's all happening!

281
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,614
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

282
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,534
Penny!

283
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:18,706
- It's all happening.
- OK. This is our journalist friend.

284
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,377
Journalist friend meet
Polexia Aphrodisiac,

285
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,420
Estrella Star.

286
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,966
- And you are...
- William Miller.

287
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:32,262
Here comes Sabbath!
Ozzy! Ozzy Osbourne!

288
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,597
It's me, Polexia!

289
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,016
Come on, get out of here!
Back up! Back up!

290
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,730
I think I saw Sapphire in there.

291
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,694
Does anybody remember laughter?

292
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:52,073
- Sapphire!
- Come on!

293
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,410
Passes, girls. Come and get 'em.

294
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,873
- Oh, no. Not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

295
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,708
- Oh, he's with us.
- Top of the ramp!

296
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,335
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this.

297
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,004
If I can.

298
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,106
Come on, boys.
Pick it up, will ya?

299
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,400
This is outrageous.
We're an hour and a half late!

300
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,485
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

301
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,953
Freddy!

302
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,290
Open up, it's Stillwater!
We're on the show!

303
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,463
Hi.

304
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,883
I'm a journalist.
I write for <i>Creem</i> Magazine.

305
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,303
Oh, the enemy. A rock writer.

306
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,598
Right. Well, I'd like to interview you,
or somebody from your band.

307
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,352
Look, I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?

308
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,063
We play for the fans, not the critics.

309
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,150
Freddy!

310
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,614
Russell, Jeff, Ed, Larry.

311
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,659
I really love your band.
I think the song <i>Fever Dog</i>

312
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,328
is a big step forward for you guys.

313
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,581
And you guys producing it
yourselves instead of Glyn Johns,

314
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,792
that was the right thing to do.

315
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,878
And Russell...
Russell, the guitar sound...

316
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,506
...is "incindiary."

317
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,176
Incendiary.

318
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,180
Way to go.

319
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,605
- Hey, man.
- Don't stop there.

320
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,899
- Where you goin'? Come back.
- I'm incendiary too, man.

321
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,028
- Freddy!
- Hey.

322
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,614
- How you doin', buddy?
- How you doin'? He's with us.

323
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,700
- Come on this way, bro.
- He's not on your list!

324
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,451
Here's a list of people
who do belong, all right?

325
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,793
- Red Dog! Hey, Red Dog.
- Hey-hey!

326
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,212
- We're playing here tomorrow night.
- Yeah?

327
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,089
How you doing, brother?

328
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,508
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you, too.

329
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,553
That's the Allman Brothers Band's
number one roadie.

330
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,972
- How are the guys?
- They're having a ball, man.

331
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,309
Having a ball.
Yeah, you know, when we have a party,

332
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,394
we have an Allman Brothers Band
party, man.

333
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,355
Everybody's boogying,
everybody's getting off.

334
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,483
We're like family, man.
Hey, we've got these now.

335
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,444
Check that out.

336
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,323
Yeah, you can taste the color
with your mind, brother.

337
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,367
- You're all gonna be in Maryland?
- Yeah.

338
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,580
All right. All right. Hey, Dickey
and Gregg send you love, brother.

339
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,207
- Cool.
- Take it easy.

340
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,084
Take it easy, brother.

341
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,300
Some people have a hard time
explaining rock and roll.

342
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,510
Really explain rock and roll.

343
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,222
Maybe Pete Townshend, but that's OK!

344
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,476
Rock and roll is a lifestyle,

345
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,937
and a way of thinking, and it's
not about money and popularity,

346
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,899
although some money would be nice.

347
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:17,070
But it's a voice that says, "Here I am,

348
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,198
and fuck you
if you can't understand me."

349
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,326
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

350
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,412
And that means that rock and roll
can save the world,

351
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,414
all of us together.

352
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:33,169
And the chicks are great. But what it
all comes down to is that thing:

353
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:37,590
the indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

354
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,260
What I'm talking about is...
Wait, what am I talking about?

355
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,388
- The buzz.
- The buzz.

356
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,890
And the chicks, the whatever,

357
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,893
is an offshoot of the buzz.

358
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,605
Like you saying you liked Fever Dog.
That is the fucking buzz!

359
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,985
Hey.

360
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,664
Found you a pass.

361
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,168
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

362
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,921
Stillwater.

363
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,693
Now, you're mysterious.

364
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,741
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

365
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,785
Me, too.

366
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,121
How old are we, really?

367
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,457
Seventeen.

368
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,461
- Me, too!
- Actually, I'm 16.

369
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:03,634
Me, too. Isn't it funny?
The truth just sounds different.

370
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,886
I'm 15.

371
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,933
What's your real name?

372
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,937
I'll never tell.

373
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,904
- The Enemy! Yes.
- Russell! Hey. Hey.

374
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,907
This... is Penny Lane.

375
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,452
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

376
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,042
- Pleasure.
- "Penny Lane." Like the song.

377
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,793
Have we met?

378
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,568
Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

379
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,448
<i>Two, two. Two!</i>

380
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,327
It's... It's not what you put into it.

381
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,579
It's what you leave out.

382
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,957
You listen to...
listen to Marvin Gaye.

383
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,625
A song like
<i>What's Happening Brother,</i>

384
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:21,546
there is a single "whoo"
at the end of the second verse.

385
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,673
You know that "whoo"?
That single "whoo"?

386
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,634
I know that "whoo." Yeah.

387
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,887
Yeah. That's what you remember, man.
It's the little things.

388
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,223
The silly things. The mistakes.

389
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,268
There is only one of them
and it makes the song.

390
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,437
It's what you leave out.
Yeah. That's rock and roll.

391
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,314
It's what you leave out.

392
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,110
You're supposed to be the enemy.
What are you, 18?

393
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,195
- Yes.
- There you go.

394
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,738
Still young enough to be honest.

395
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,326
All right.
Could we bring the lights down?

396
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,544
<i>Won't you get on my back</i>
<i>for a piggyback ride?</i>

397
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,005
Hey, get The Enemy in here.

398
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,550
<i>Get on my back for a piggyback ride</i>

399
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:11,846
<i>Get on my back for a piggyback ride</i>

400
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,766
San Diego! You ready, baby?

401
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,690
Hell, yeah!

402
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,445
<i>- Good evening, San Diego!</i>
- Stand right over there.

403
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,534
<i>Would you please welcome,</i>
<i>from Troy, Michigan...</i>

404
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,246
...Stillwater!

405
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,232
Russell! I love you!

406
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,894
<i>Thank you!</i>

407
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,357
Hey! You...

408
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,360
You wanna come to LA?

409
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,779
We'll be at the Riot House all week.

410
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,906
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,244
The Continental Hyatt House.
It's on Sunset Strip.

412
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,122
Oh, yeah. Right. Sunset Strip.

413
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,084
Well, tell your friend...

414
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,589
...Miss "Penny Lane," to call me.

415
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,133
Tell her it ain't
California without her.

416
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,761
And we want her around,
like last summer.

417
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,637
Say it just like that.

418
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,933
- Got it. Got it.
- I'm under Harry Houdini.

419
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,604
I get it.

420
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,565
- Come on, let's blow this burg!
- The Enemy!

421
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,568
- Come up to LA, we'll talk some more.
- Bye!

422
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,154
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia.

423
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,363
- See ya, Dick.
- See ya down the line!

424
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,699
Scully, Ed. See ya, Mick.

425
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,868
Greg. Yeah, later, guys.

426
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,872
Bye, Opie.

427
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,167
Bye.

428
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,630
- Hey, Red Dog. I'll see ya later, man.
- Bye, fella.

429
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,174
"The Wheel." "Frosty."

430
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,136
Ainsworth. Ainsworth.
I'll see you around, man.

431
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,388
- Penny! Penny!
- Hey! Hey! Be cool.

432
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,557
Penny, you just missed Russell.

433
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,393
He said he's at the Riot House all week,
and for you to call him.

434
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,064
He's under the name Harry Houdini.

435
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:57,112
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

436
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,698
Right, well, he had a message.
He said,

437
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,951
"Tell her it's not California
without you.

438
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,245
We want you around,
like last summer."

439
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,581
No! No! He said, "Tell her it ain't
California without you, we want..."

440
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,210
- I get the gist.
- Right. Right.

441
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,547
So... how well do you guys
know each other?

442
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:25,891
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

443
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,436
I think I live in a different world.

444
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,108
Speaking of the world...

445
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,570
...I've made a decision.

446
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,782
I'm gonna live in Morocco,
for one year.

447
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,122
I need a new crowd.

448
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,003
Do you wanna come?

449
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,299
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,635
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

451
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,138
Do you wanna come?

452
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,849
Yes. Yes.

453
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,145
- You've gotta call me.
- OK.

454
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,357
It's all happening!

455
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,526
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

456
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,491
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Great.

457
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,180
<i>And it's not about money,</i>
<i>and popularity...</i>

458
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,106
<i>And the chicks are great. Right?</i>

459
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,407
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey.

460
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,585
- So your sister's a stewardess now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,462
She and Mom are still sort of...

462
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,633
Well, I'd say, I'd say "not speaking,"
but I don't know that they ever did.

463
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,970
The things your sister and I used
to do inside these four walls.

464
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,722
That's OK. That's OK.
I don't want to know.

465
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,809
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.

466
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,062
OK, OK. OK.

467
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,900
- You seem cooler.
- I am...

468
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,277
...I am thinking about going to Morocco.

469
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,781
Let me know if you need a little help
with your mom.

470
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:49,576
- A little may not be enough.
- Yeah, she still freaks me out.

471
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,246
- Yeah. Listen...
- She's famous.

472
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,332
Go ahead and do
whatever you were doing.

473
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,419
I'm just gonna
hang in here for a moment.

474
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,628
OK.

475
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,357
I worry about drunk drivers.

476
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,277
Mom, I'm 15.

477
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:27,614
- Right?
- Yes, you're 15.

478
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,119
And here's that money I owe you.

479
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,622
Your father's favorite joke.
I don't do it as well.

480
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,208
No, I thought that was pretty good.

481
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,128
Keep the small bills on the outside.
And call me if anyone gets drunk.

482
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,630
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere gets drunk.

483
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,467
- Good.
- And don't take drugs.

484
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,677
Very funny.

485
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,929
See? Sense of humor.

486
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,348
Funny joke. Have fun at the dance.

487
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,310
- I'm glad you're making friends.
- Mom, stay.

488
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,605
- OK.
- Love you.

489
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,774
Bye.

490
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,166
I always tell the girls,
never take it seriously.

491
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,502
If you never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

492
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,129
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

493
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,673
And if you ever get lonely,

494
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,176
you just go to the record store,

495
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,345
and visit your friends.

496
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,473
- So, you and Russell...
- No!

497
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:39,770
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

498
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,744
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

499
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,956
These guys are with Alice Cooper. I'm
gonna pretend like I don't know them.

500
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:02,042
Penny! Hey!
Does Alice know you're here?

501
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,546
I'm just showing my very dear,
very wonderful friend,

502
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,714
William Miller, around.
He's a very important writer.

503
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,593
He knows Lester Bangs. And I'm
responsible for his moral conduct

504
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,054
- while he's abroad.
- Penny Lane!

505
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:18,600
- God's gift to rock and roll!
- I'm retired. And don't argue with me.

506
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,727
- Retired? Again?
- Penny!

507
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,064
It's Reg! That's Humble Pie's
road manager, right there.

508
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,692
- Hi!
- Come to Portland where there's love.

509
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,736
- Have we met?
- "Have we met?"

510
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,824
I've made a decision.
I'm going traveling to India

511
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,577
and then I'm going
to learn to play the violin.

512
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,539
And then, I'm going to college.
For one year!

513
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,625
There's nothing they could
teach you in college, darling!

514
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,879
Right on! Call Alice. He's staying
under the name "Bob Hope."

515
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,883
- I heard you're with Russell Hammond!
- Please. I throw the little ones back.

516
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,679
- I lost my head.
- Martin Bell's a fucking asshole.

517
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,016
- And I'm in love with Jeff Bebe.
- Polexia!

518
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,475
Opie?

519
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,107
- Are you OK?
- Harry Houdini, please?

520
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,860
- Houdi... Harry Houdini!
- Sable. It was Sable.

521
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,405
And we had this really great time.

522
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,825
And he said that it was
going to mean something and then...

523
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,119
- And I'm in love with Jeff. I mean...
- Jeff is...

524
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,871
I know.

525
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,883
I saw them on the 7th floor.
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. John Paul Jones,

526
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,804
Mr. Robert Plant.
Mr. Robert Plant signed...

527
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,973
...signed my T-shirt five minutes ago.

528
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,852
Please don't smear it. Oh, dear God,
please don't... Please don't smear it.

529
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,979
But five minutes ago,
he touched this pen.

530
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,649
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- Right, I picked that up.

531
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,568
He tours with them,
but not, you know, with them.

532
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,446
Yeah, they're on
the 12th floor now, but...

533
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,990
There's no bigger Zeppelin fan than Vic.

534
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,166
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs,

535
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,044
William... Miller.

536
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,005
- He's a writer. He knows us.
- Hey! You're that comedian!

537
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,341
- Leonard.
- Blow me!

538
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,511
Come on, William.

539
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,722
OK. Time to put on the lampshade.

540
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:27,062
Ladies and gentlemen!

541
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,691
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials,

542
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:35,696
for the captain has turned on
the "No Smoking" sign.

543
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,614
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked

544
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,450
and in their full, upright position.

545
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,716
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

546
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,635
Oh, thank you, thank you.

547
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:10,105
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care about him.

548
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,571
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her,

549
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,782
but he goes right for her.

550
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,334
Act Three, in which it all plays out
the way she planned it.

551
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,378
She'll eat him alive.

552
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,840
- We've got to stop them.
- Stop them?

553
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,429
You were her excuse
for coming here.

554
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,976
I need ice.

555
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,609
Hey, man.

556
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:05,243
I just worry about people using her
because she brings out the good side

557
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,455
in everybody else,
but what do they do for her?

558
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,167
Life kills me.

559
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,127
Do you have any pot?

560
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,797
No. Not on me.

561
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,177
- Do you smoke?
- No.

562
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,473
But... I grow it.

563
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,060
Yeah. Grow it.

564
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,354
You're funny.

565
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,647
Funny.

566
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,733
If only you were taller,
English, and rich,

567
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,821
and a guitar player, and older.

568
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,491
I'd... I'd be somebody else.

569
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,661
Yeah. Good point.

570
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,165
The Enemy.

571
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,420
I'm always around
if you want to talk some more.

572
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,005
- OK.
- All right.

573
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,342
Bless me Father,
for I may sin tonight.

574
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,413
- How does it end?
- What?

575
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,666
The story about the girl
who dumps the guy

576
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,668
who has the ex-ex-wife.

577
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:42,090
Calls her a hundred...
OK, five times,

578
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,552
and doesn't even leave a pass
in San Diego.

579
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,846
Wake up.

580
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,724
I'm retired.

581
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,561
I never believed you, anyway.
You're too good-looking

582
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,355
and too talented to be trusted.
And everybody knows that.

583
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,984
You're retired
like Frank Sinatra's retired.

584
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,571
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell you
what rock and roll will miss,

585
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,658
the day that you truly retire.

586
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:15,207
The way that you turn
a hotel room into a home.

587
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,918
The way that you pick up strays
wherever you go.

588
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,423
The way that you...
you know the words to every song.

589
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,092
Every song! Especially the bad ones.

590
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,428
And mostly the bad ones.

591
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,432
That green coat in the middle of summer.

592
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,229
The real name that you won't reveal.

593
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,237
I could keep going,
but my glass is full.

594
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,614
Damn.

595
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:12,639
- Come to Arizona?
- Never.

596
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:17,394
We leave Thursday morning, 9am.
And pack light this time. Jesus.

597
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,283
<i>- Hello?</i>
- William Miller?

598
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,119
<i>- This is he.</i>
- William, this is Ben Fong-Torres.

599
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,246
I'm the music editor
at <i>Rolling Stone Magazine.</i>

600
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:40,625
We got a couple copies of your stories
from the <i>San Diego Door.</i>

601
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,587
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

602
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,757
"Voice of God, howling dogs,
the spirit of rock and roll."

603
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,968
- This is good solid stuff, man.
<i>- Well, thanks.</i>

604
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,220
Thanks. Thanks.

605
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,265
Listen, I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

606
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,688
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

607
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,484
"Hard-working band makes good."
New album out, their third.

608
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,570
Starting to do something. Crazy.

609
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:12,365
<i>Let's do 3,000 words.</i>
<i>You'll join the band on the road.</i>

610
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,367
We'll set up billing.
Don't let the band pay for anything.

611
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:18,538
We can only pay,
let me see, 3,000 words...

612
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,583
Seven hundred dollars.

613
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:27,589
All right, a grand.
What's your background?

614
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,591
Are you a journalism major?

615
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,345
- Yeah.
<i>- What college?</i>

616
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,806
Honey, I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.

617
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,775
Well, I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

618
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,694
<i>- Crazy. Crazy.</i>
- Crazy.

619
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,780
- Crazy.
<i>- Stillwater?</i>

620
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,325
Beware, beware of
<i>Rolling Stone Magazine</i>

621
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,286
because they will change your story,

622
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,414
they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill.

623
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,167
But besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

624
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,587
You got starry eyes, my friend.

625
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,717
Look. Do the story.

626
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,179
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for ya.

627
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,600
Remember this: don't do it
to make friends with people

628
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,978
who are trying to use you to

629
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,940
further the big business desire,

630
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,485
<i>to glorify worthless</i>
<i>rock stars like Stillwater!</i>

631
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,696
<i>Don't let those</i>
<i>swill merchants rewrite you.</i>

632
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,492
- "Swill merchants." That's good.
<i>- Yeah, swill merchants.</i>

633
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,620
Now, what are you listening to?

634
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:45,625
- Stillwater.
- Stillwater? The kid's doin' drugs.

635
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:49,838
No. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No. No.

636
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,214
No more than four days,

637
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,717
and I want you to give me a phone
number where you are every minute.

638
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,387
I want you to call me twice a day,
and you do not miss more than one test!

639
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,101
And no drugs.

640
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,646
Oh, this is a big mistake.

641
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,950
Look at Tony the Tiger.

642
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,171
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

643
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,602
- This is what I was talkin' about.
- Russell.

644
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,855
Excuse me. I was wondering
if maybe we could

645
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,815
find some time to talk
when we get to Phoenix.

646
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,942
I want to interview
everybody separately,

647
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,487
and I thought we'd start with
just you and me.

648
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,447
Absolutely.

649
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,365
Because I've got a thing
in a couple of days.

650
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,870
- What?
- It's a... a thing.

651
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,998
Where you go there to graduate.

652
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,918
School.

653
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,922
I never graduated
and look what happened.

654
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,549
You're here interviewing me.

655
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,845
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

656
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:27,143
Don't put that in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, man.
Our bio says that we all graduated.

657
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,729
Him with honors.

658
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,106
We'll figure out something better later.

659
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,693
Just enjoy the ride.

660
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,071
- Keep playing that song.
- All right, man.

661
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,760
I may need to stay in your room tonight.
Russell's in a bad mood.

662
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,180
He's very Bob Dylan
in <i>Don't Look Back</i> today.

663
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:08,726
- He's trying to write.
- Yeah. Sure.

664
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,854
- Yeah?
- Sure.

665
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,982
- You OK?
- Yeah.

666
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,617
Could you put a "Do not disturb"
on my phone?

667
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,954
Here's your key. Here's your room key.

668
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:32,041
Larry, put this on. Bags in ten.

669
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,252
Hey, come by in a few minutes.
We'll do that interview.

670
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,296
- All right?
- Sure.

671
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,551
Is this Mr. Miller?

672
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,969
Yeah.

673
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,179
You have a message from Elaine.

674
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,017
Your mother. She's a handful.

675
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,313
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

676
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,691
Tell her to stop.

677
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,573
They threw me out of my room.

678
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,993
I'm worried, man.

679
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,497
No, you can trust him. He's a fan.

680
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,584
But it's <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
He looks harmless,

681
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:19,172
but he does represent the magazine
that trashed <i>Layla</i>, broke up Cream,

682
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,716
ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

683
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,886
Don't forget the rules, man.
This little shit is The Enemy.

684
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,137
He writes what he sees.

685
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,890
If I don't get into a room,
and take a Valium...

686
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,186
Although, it would be cool
to be on the cover.

687
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,488
Oh, my God!

688
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,991
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

689
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,879
Housekeeping.

690
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,548
Housekeeping.

691
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,218
Go away!

692
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,428
Should I come by later?

693
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:11,224
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood.

694
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,394
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

695
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:20,858
- You OK?
- Yeah.

696
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,902
- Go away!
- Don't worry.

697
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,989
- Come to the radio interview tonight.
- Go away!

698
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,033
- OK.
- Bye.

699
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,785
So rude!

700
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,182
The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

701
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:39,228
The vocal stylings
of Jeff "The Babe" Bebe, Jeff Bebe.

702
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,106
- The Babe.
- Bebe.

703
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,567
Bebe. Fever Dog.

704
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,986
The band is Stillwater.

705
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,490
Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

706
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,291
Look at the dogs
wearing the funny hats,

707
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:05,004
juggling just for you,
freaks and family.

708
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:09,300
It's Quince with Stillwater here, live.

709
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,261
It's The Night Circus.

710
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,389
Every minute a baby
is born somewhere.

711
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,226
Life. Death.

712
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,645
Hermetically sealed bags
of human emotion.

713
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:25,441
Bags of love, bags of kindness.

714
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,197
How'd you all get together?

715
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,038
Well, not to get into a "me" thing,

716
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,917
but I did start the band,
some time, actually, ago.

717
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,045
And I placed an ad in a magazine
called <i>Peaches,</i>

718
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,258
- and Russell Hammond answered.
<i>- Peaches.</i>

719
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,301
I think he was a gift
from God, actually.

720
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,722
- Nobody plays like Russell Hammond.
- Shit, man. Thank you.

721
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,437
Oh, my... Might want to hit
that delay button there, Quincy.

722
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,241
Quince?

723
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,831
Now we're talking, right?

724
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,293
Right?

725
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,920
Why the fuck do you have to wait
till an interview in Arizona

726
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:32,133
to say something nice about me, man?
Why don't you say it to my fucking face?

727
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,219
'Cause I tell you every time
I think you nailed something.

728
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,555
Everybody pays you compliments.

729
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,516
It's not my fucking job

730
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,644
to kiss your fucking ass.

731
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,022
Seriously, then whose fucking job is it,

732
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,443
because my ass is dying for a kiss, man,
and I know yours is, too.

733
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,446
It's my fucking job
and I think you're all geniuses.

734
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,239
And I'd just like to say
to the folks out there,

735
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,033
I'd like to leave you this thought:
smegma.

736
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,702
Nice! Fellows?

737
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,787
Feces.

738
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,250
The name of the song is Love Thing.

739
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,336
Your mind is starting to take effect.

740
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:12,006
They've all come
to watch you swallow fire.

741
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,301
You scream. Soundlessly.

742
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,470
On The Night Circus.

743
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,018
I thought that went well.

744
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,519
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

745
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,526
- Pronto?
- May I speak with William, please?

746
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,028
<i>He's still down in the bar</i>
<i>with the band.</i>

747
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,530
They just got back
from the radio station.

748
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,157
Is this Maryann, with the pot?

749
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,911
Hello?

750
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,375
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

751
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,835
This is Elaine. His mother.

752
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,548
Could you give William
a message for me, please?

753
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,386
<i>Tell him to call home immediately,</i>
<i>and also tell him</i>

754
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:02,556
I know what's going on.

755
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,727
All right. OK. But I'm just gonna
say this, and I'm gonna stand by it:

756
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,230
You should be really proud of him.

757
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,024
'Cause I know men,
and I'll bet you do, too.

758
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,194
<i>He respects women,</i>
<i>and he likes women.</i>

759
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,531
<i>And let's just pause and appreciate</i>
<i>a man like that.</i>

760
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:21,993
I mean, you've created him out of thin
air, you know, you raised him right.

761
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,578
He's havin' a great time.
He's doin' a good job.

762
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:29,542
<i>And, don't worry, he's still a virgin,</i>
<i>and we're all lookin' out for him.</i>

763
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,254
You know? That's more than I've ever
even said to my own parents.

764
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,923
<i>So there you go.</i>

765
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,720
<i>This is the maid speaking, by the way.</i>

766
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,556
Can you please hold it down?

767
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:54,984
Russell! So, what is it
you love about music?

768
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,154
Shut that thing off for a second,
and I'll tell you the truth, all right?

769
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,411
Look... Fuck. I trust you,
so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.

770
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,249
Just make us look cool.

771
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:17,131
I will quote you warmly and accurately.

772
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,593
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

773
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:26,223
You see, some of us, we got girlfriends
back home, you know?

774
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,602
Some of us have wives.

775
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,607
And some of the people
that you meet on the road

776
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,651
are really amazing people.

777
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,575
Like you.

778
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,872
Yeah. But some of the stuff
that happens, it's good for

779
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,334
a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

780
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:56,879
...a million people.

781
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,592
- Understand what I'm tryin' to say?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,970
'Cause see, you're dangerous.

783
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,807
You see everything.

784
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,644
Most people,
they're just waiting to talk.

785
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,062
But you listen.

786
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,610
See, I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

787
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:24,949
I'm past them, as musicians,
but the more popular we get,

788
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,034
the bigger their houses get,

789
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,954
the more responsibilities,
the pressure, you know,

790
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,373
the harder it gets
for me to walk out on 'em.

791
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:38,921
Then you forget,
forget what it's like to be a fan.

792
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,632
You hear it in bands all the time.

793
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,509
Doesn't sound like music anymore,
you know?

794
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,136
Sounds like...

795
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,347
...lifestyle maintenance or something.

796
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,851
"Lifestyle maintenance."

797
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,691
I used to be able to hear...

798
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,405
...the sounds of the world.
Everything, to me,

799
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,574
it sounded like music.

800
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,371
And now I don't hear it,
you know, anymore.

801
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,632
But do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

802
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,135
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

803
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,971
- Come to the party!
- Where'd my hat go?

804
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,516
What am I doing?

805
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:38,063
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

806
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,443
No. No, we'll...

807
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,446
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

808
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,742
- OK.
- OK.

809
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,577
So, tonight, it's...

810
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,788
- Well, friends.
- Right.

811
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,457
We trust ya.

812
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,918
Larry Fellows,

813
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,129
how would you describe your role
in Stillwater?

814
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:05,966
What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

815
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,013
I'm the bass player.

816
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,058
Right.

817
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:19,271
And when you take that away,
what would be missing?

818
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,441
Stylistically, what chemical?

819
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,113
The bass?

820
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,991
OK.

821
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:18,163
Stinkin' roads!

822
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,667
- Hey, hey, what's goin' on?
- Russell just got electrocuted!

823
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,548
Hey, everybody be cool. All right?

824
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:30,843
Come on, come on. Let's get on the bus.
Let's go, let's go.

825
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:34,930
This is bullshit, man. Who's takin' care
of us? Who's responsible for the gear?

826
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,683
I'm gonna deal with it.
Get on the bus. Please, everyone.

827
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,019
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

828
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,688
- Hey. You the manager of this band?
- Yes! That and more!

829
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,523
Yeah, well you didn't finish
your full set, man.

830
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,444
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

831
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,279
Yeah, well you trashed
my fuckin' dressing room,

832
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,989
and you didn't do your 25 minutes.

833
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,907
You don't fuck with
my band's safety, ever!

834
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,536
Fuck you. I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

835
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,413
I'm gonna talk to
Frank Barcelona tonight!

836
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:03,500
- You don't even know Frank Barcelona!
- You're a bunch of amateurs, man!

837
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,544
- You want it?
- Come on!

838
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,339
What do you got? What do you got?
Take it.

839
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:12,718
- Fuckin' go, all right?
- Hey, watch the shirt, fuck!

840
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,554
- Now I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Take it easy!

841
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:19,141
Take it easy, man. All I know is,
I hope you got a good lawyer, buddy.

842
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:23,228
Hey, you better make a live album,
'cause this is your last fuckin' tour!

843
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,815
What? What? What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

844
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,817
Come on!

845
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,447
- Take it easy!
- Let's go!

846
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,907
Lock the gates!

847
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,119
- Let's go through the fucking gate.
- That's your last fucking tour, man!

848
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,413
Lock the gates on these fuckheads!

849
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,083
- Where's my goddamn car?
- William?

850
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,045
William? William. William!

851
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,756
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

852
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,258
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

853
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:57,137
And she says to tell you,
"I know what's going on."

854
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,306
So, I'll see you guys in Topeka, OK?

855
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,897
Amateurs!

856
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,817
You don't know who you're dealing
with here! Lock the gates!

857
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,534
- You wanna buy a gate?
- Yeah!

858
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,956
You just bought a gate!

859
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,981
Hey, give that to me, William.

860
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,654
Give me that!

861
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,542
Russell, wake up.
Wake the fuck up, man.

862
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,296
- It's a girls' running team.
- Goddamn.

863
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:15,007
Let it go, Fellows.
Let it go, buddy.

864
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:18,135
Dick, when do we get
into Topeka, man?

865
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,512
Larry, you're a sick individual.
Leave it alone.

866
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,224
Wake up, man. Look at all these fucking
tasty-looking high school girls.

867
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,853
We can't stop the bus
every time you see a girl in shorts.

868
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,231
Hey. When we go to Morocco,
I think we should wear

869
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:35,319
completely different clothes
and be completely different people.

870
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,696
What will our names be?

871
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,208
What do you think of Russell?

872
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,922
I like him. But that's between us.

873
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,174
Because I am a professional.

874
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,720
You should give him a break.
There are real problems in the band.

875
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,890
- Off the record.
- What problems?

876
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:12,147
OK, I got it. Your name should
be Spencer and mine will be Jane.

877
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,779
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.

878
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:28,121
- You're comin' to Cleveland, right?
- Cleveland, Ohio?

879
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,250
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

880
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:35,254
I have to get my interview with Russell
before Greenville.

881
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:40,259
- You've got to help me, OK?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

882
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,304
He's my last project.
I only do this for a very few people,

883
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,765
and I think we should do it together.

884
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,352
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

885
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:55,649
What's your real name?

886
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,407
All right, let's go!

887
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:13,166
Oh, it's OK. I'm easy to forget.
Just leave me behind!

888
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:17,337
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

889
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:19,131
Hey!

890
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,594
So, Ed Vallencourt,
what do you love about music?

891
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,859
OK, OK.

892
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,988
<i>You told me you would</i>
<i>tell me where you were every minute.</i>

893
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,741
You told me you would
call me twice a day.

894
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,701
You told me you wouldn't
miss any more than one test.

895
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,495
- I'll be home for graduation. Mom...
<i>- Where are you?</i>

896
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,665
Right now, Topeka.
Then, Greenville, then home.

897
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,710
<i>What about graduation?</i>
<i>We had an agreement, William.</i>

898
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,129
I'm sorry I didn't call you yesterday.

899
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,214
I guess I just miss you.
And I don't understand why

900
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,258
I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

901
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,261
<i>By all practical rules,</i>
<i>don't I get you for another three years?</i>

902
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,266
- Was I not fun?
- Yes.

903
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,144
William! This is Beth from Denver.

904
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,356
She's one of the legendary,
original Band Aids.

905
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,567
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

906
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:23,654
<i>I mean, I pick up things here and there.</i>

907
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:28,575
Estrella says hi.
She says I can stay in your room.

908
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,745
- Sure.
<i>- Great!</i>

909
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,206
I've got some hydroponic pot!

910
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,043
- Wow, your aura is really fantastic!
<i>- Hey, hey!</i>

911
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:41,004
- It's this beautiful purple color.
<i>- I love you.</i>

912
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,006
I missed the last thing you said.

913
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,008
<i>- Mom?</i>
<i>- Your aura is purple!</i>

914
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,010
- I love you.
- What?

915
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,721
<i>- Purple, it's purple.</i>
<i>- Mom, what?</i>

916
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:54,017
<i>- Your aura is purple.</i>
- I miss you and I love you!

917
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:57,020
I love you.

918
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,708
That way, you don't get one of those
little creases, know what I'm saying?

919
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,503
Yeah. All right,
so this has to be straight here?

920
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,426
All right.

921
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,137
Fire away. I'm ready.

922
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,764
Do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

923
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,599
Do you have to be in love
to write a love song?

924
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,061
Is the song better
if it really happened to you?

925
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:42,941
Like Love Thing. Where did
you write that? Who is it about?

926
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,486
When did you get so professional?

927
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,451
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

928
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,289
Yes!

929
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,134
Oh, man.

930
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,309
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

931
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:22,147
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

932
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:28,487
Can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this?

933
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,906
- Yeah, OK.
- Because I can see by your face

934
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,366
- you want to get into it.
- How can you tell?

935
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,411
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

936
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,330
Here.

937
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,917
Take it. Let's take
a good look at it, all right?

938
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,004
See, you love this T-shirt.

939
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,173
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

940
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:54,262
- Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
- It's a T-shirt.

941
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,182
Do you give a shit about a T-shirt?

942
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:01,019
I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out
and find some barbecue or somethin'.

943
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,854
Look, I'm always
gonna tell you the truth.

944
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,606
Are you doing coke again?

945
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:10,278
Oh, yeah, all the time.
This is big stuff, man.

946
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,864
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man,

947
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,909
and you're the guitarist with mystique.

948
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,702
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

949
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:22,124
Page, Plant, Mick, Keith.

950
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,458
Blackmore, Gillan.

951
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,169
But somehow it's all turning around.

952
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,797
We have got to control
what's happening!

953
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,175
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me,

954
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,846
but didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

955
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,848
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

956
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:41,309
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You can trust him. Say what you want.

957
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,311
He won't write it.

958
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:47,983
Look, I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

959
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,736
You know what I do? I connect.

960
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,780
I get people off!

961
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,867
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off,

962
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,452
and I make him get off.

963
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,580
Actually, that you can print!

964
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:07,460
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

965
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,922
Look, you want to pretend this
isn't gonna be a very big band?

966
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,634
Well, it is! You call yourself
a leader of this band,

967
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,429
but your direction
allowed this T-shirt

968
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,681
when you allowed Dick to manage us.

969
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,976
'Cause he's your friend!

970
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,812
Don't you see, man,
the T-shirt is everything.

971
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,982
All right, is it my turn now?
Because I think we should, for once,

972
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,485
- say what we really mean.
- This is the part where you quit!

973
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:36,156
- Right. I'm so predictable.
- Deal with it.

974
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,617
And let me just say what
nobody else wants to say.

975
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:42,120
- What?
- Your looks have become a problem.

976
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,413
All right, OK. Enough!

977
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,581
What?

978
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:47,459
Break it up. Everyone out
of the room for five minutes.

979
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,590
Hey! Yeah. William. Sorry.

980
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:58,470
Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

981
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,640
Let's go find something real.

982
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,191
From here on out, I'm only
interested in what is real.

983
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,109
Real people, real feelings.

984
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,488
That's it. That's all
I'm interested in from here on out.

985
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:21,534
- You're real.
- Thanks.

986
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:25,872
You know, you know all about us
and I don't know shit about you.

987
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,710
Tell me, what's your family like?

988
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,674
My dad died of a heart attack

989
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,051
and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense

990
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,512
that she had to escape our family.

991
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,348
And they can't seem to find
a way to get through it.

992
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,475
I mean, they don't even
speak to each other anymore.

993
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:49,604
Plus, she gave me all her albums
and now she's a stewardess.

994
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,362
It's good to talk about.
Really good.

995
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,615
But here I am,
telling secrets to the one guy

996
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,326
you're not supposed to
tell your secrets to.

997
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,374
You're Russell from Stillwater.

998
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,546
Yeah, on my better days
I'm Russell from Stillwater.

999
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,715
You wanna go to a party with me
at my friend Aaron's house?

1000
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,717
I know you're a big rock star and all,

1001
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,429
but do you want to hang with some good
people looking to have a good time?

1002
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,641
We're just real Topeka people, man.

1003
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,188
No.

1004
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,748
Thanks, man. You, too.

1005
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:55,253
Oh, my God. Holy shit.
I grew up with that lamp shade, man.

1006
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:59,299
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

1007
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,601
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

1008
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:16,149
You, Aaron, are what it's all about.

1009
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:20,403
You're real. Your room is real.

1010
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:23,073
Your friends are real.

1011
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,658
Real, man. Real, you know?

1012
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,118
Real.

1013
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,999
Real, you know?

1014
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:41,049
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

1015
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:45,428
The silly machinery.
And you know it.

1016
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:50,266
In 11 years it's gonna be 1984, man.
Think about that.

1017
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,477
Wanna see me feed
a mouse to my snake?

1018
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:53,937
Yes.

1019
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:55,814
Hey, can I have that bitchin' belt?

1020
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,233
Take it.

1021
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:03,321
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, brother.

1022
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,248
Russell, we should
probably get back with the others.

1023
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:15,208
- Oh, it's over, daddy.
- Hey.

1024
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:20,004
There's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

1025
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,216
That's mine.

1026
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:27,345
Topeka. Check it out!

1027
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:31,891
Please don't give him any more acid.
Thank you.

1028
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,861
Dick. Dick, I got him.

1029
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:47,115
He's OK. He is on acid though.

1030
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,201
I can't really tell.

1031
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,162
How do you know
when it's kicked in?

1032
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,039
I am a golden god!

1033
01:19:56,709 --> 01:20:02,046
- Yes, you are!
- I am a golden god!

1034
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:05,258
Hey, Russell, don't jump!

1035
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:09,220
And you can tell
<i>Rolling Stone Magazine</i>

1036
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,890
that my last words...

1037
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,392
...were...

1038
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,232
...I'm on drugs.

1039
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:33,244
Russell, I think we should
work on those last words.

1040
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,663
OK. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it.

1041
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,459
I got it. I got it. This is better.

1042
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:42,003
Last words.

1043
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,256
I dig music.

1044
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,636
I'm on drugs!

1045
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:58,353
Look, just come on down
and we'll go back to the hotel.

1046
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,773
- OK.
- Jump!

1047
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,580
- He's not coming up.
- Something's wrong.

1048
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,833
- Somebody, help him.
- I'll save you, Russell.

1049
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:31,970
<i>They've been crying for you</i>
<i>like a bunch of whimpering pussies.</i>

1050
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,722
Oh, the band's over.
This is my family now.

1051
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,142
- Yeah, that's right, man.
- Definitely.

1052
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,435
He's staying with us.

1053
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,813
Let's just ride on down to Greenville,

1054
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:45,358
we'll listen to some great music,
we'll finish the tour,

1055
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:48,653
and we'll leave those
ungrateful fools behind.

1056
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,864
Then we'll come back here
where you'll live.

1057
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,158
- And he can stay in our basement.
- Yeah.

1058
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:57,662
I see what you're doing and I like it.

1059
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,206
OK, good. Come on.

1060
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,751
I got it, man. I got it.

1061
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,504
That felt kind of good though.

1062
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,548
Excuse me, kids.

1063
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:12,093
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

1064
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,846
How do we know you're not a cop?

1065
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:18,349
- The Enemy! Stop fuckin' looking at me!
- Easy!

1066
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,310
He's your guardian angel, all right?

1067
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:24,063
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.

1068
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:25,398
Which half?

1069
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:29,235
Dick, just help me get my interview.
I have to go home, Dick.

1070
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,738
Dick, I have to go home.

1071
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:35,867
Look, you've saved the tour and that's
good enough for now. All right?

1072
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,370
- Come on, big fella. Let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

1073
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,040
Did you, man? Did you hurt the flower?
That's nice.

1074
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,125
Come on, on the bus.

1075
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,384
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over.

1076
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:59,182
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves
and we'll see you all again in 1974.

1077
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:03,227
- Good evening!
- We love you, Stillwater!

1078
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,171
I have to go home.

1079
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,886
You are home.

1080
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:20,698
In Carl Jung's opinion, we all
have a sixth sense, intuition.

1081
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:22,283
When you meet someone
and you suddenly feel like

1082
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,995
you can't live without them.
This could be the memory of a past love

1083
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,164
from the collective unconscious.

1084
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,209
Or it could just be hormones.

1085
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,507
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

1086
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:41,052
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

1087
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:52,563
<i>On the whole, I'd say most</i>
<i>of the fuck-ups in the world</i>

1088
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,775
<i>come from the brain</i>
<i>and not the instincts.</i>

1089
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:58,986
My whole thing is to try and make my...

1090
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,073
My whole thing is to try
and make my brain go away.

1091
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,826
But I can't, except onstage.

1092
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:09,247
The brain, I think, should be a
softening influence on the instincts,

1093
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:13,042
but the instincts should drive.

1094
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:17,630
Trying to reconcile the brain with urges
that come out of millions of years ago,

1095
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:22,552
the way the brain interprets
these instincts, is a heavy trip.

1096
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,972
While I've got you, you getting
on the fucking bus or what?

1097
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,227
Come on, come on.
Let's get on the fucking bus.

1098
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:41,112
<i>Usually, I'm brain</i>
<i>and Russell is instincts.</i>

1099
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,492
<i>But on the days</i>
<i>when we're both instinct,</i>

1100
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:50,162
<i>that's when we've made the music</i>
<i>people know best.</i>

1101
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,707
<i>Because it's the best!</i>

1102
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,507
Show me any guy who ever
said he didn't want to be popular,

1103
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,301
and I'll show you a scared guy.

1104
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,095
I've studied
the entire history of music.

1105
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:09,807
Most of the time,
the best stuff is the popular stuff.

1106
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:13,853
It's much safer
to say "popularity sucks"

1107
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:17,440
because that allows you
to forgive yourself if you suck.

1108
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:21,402
And I don't forgive myself. Do you?

1109
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,326
Lester, Rolling Stone is calling me.
I don't have my key interview.

1110
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,953
I don't know what to say.
Days are just going by out here.

1111
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:35,291
You're flipping out.
It's good. All right.

1112
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,668
This is how you blow their minds.

1113
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,087
He's gonna ask you...
This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?

1114
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,255
Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:45,051
He's gonna ask you how the story's
going and this is what you do.

1116
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:46,594
Tell him...

1117
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,723
...you know, it's a think piece...

1118
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:53,851
"A think piece."

1119
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,479
<i>...about a mid-level band</i>

1120
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:58,898
struggling with their own limitations

1121
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:02,109
in the, you know,
harsh face of stardom.

1122
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,654
"Harsh face."

1123
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,031
He'll wet himself.

1124
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:15,331
All dressed up and no place to go.

1125
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:18,668
Greenville. I'm bored.

1126
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,887
I have to pee.

1127
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,890
Wow, they're cute.

1128
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,395
Let's deflower the kid.

1129
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,407
Hold on. Hold on. Wait.

1130
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,409
I should leave.

1131
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:55,079
- Things are going backwards for me.
- Backwards?

1132
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:59,250
I don't know. I just...
I thought maybe we could hang out.

1133
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:03,087
You know, do some stuff back home,
like regular stuff.

1134
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,423
Get to know each other
a little bit better,

1135
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,425
and then I'd see you pee.

1136
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:11,137
I mean, that's just
the way I usually do it.

1137
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:15,057
You're one of us.
If you come to Cleveland,

1138
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:17,852
Bowie's gonna be at Swingo's,
the greatest hotel in America,

1139
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,897
and I'll introduce you to him
and his security guard, Dennis.

1140
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,108
Don't you have any regular friends?

1141
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,987
Famous people are just
more interesting.

1142
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,074
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

1143
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,454
Boy. If this was the real world...

1144
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:40,291
Not that anybody's using you.
No. Hold on.

1145
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,671
I'm not famous, but...

1146
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,508
- Your time has come!
- Did Russell call?

1147
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:51,802
- Deflower, deflower.
- Opie must die!

1148
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:55,514
- Oh, no. Stop. We're talking.
- Pants him, girls.

1149
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,309
Opie must die.

1150
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,478
No. No.

1151
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,064
- OK.
- No.

1152
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,318
Up, up.

1153
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:11,405
Guys, come on. I have to write.

1154
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,201
No.

1155
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:39,183

01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,026
- You have such a sexy voice.
- Hello, Ben.

1165
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:34,363
<i>William Miller,</i>
this is your editor at <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

1166
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:38,742
<i>- How's the story?</i>
- I'm getting good stuff out here.

1167
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:42,538
- Yeah, it sounds like it.
<i>- Man, I need some...</i>

1168
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:50,546
Now, listen. Get it together, man.

1169
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:53,424
We're both professionals here, OK?
I don't need to tell you this.

1170
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:56,886
<i>You're not out there to join the party.</i>
<i>We already have one Hunter Thompson.</i>

1171
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,805
<i>You're out there to interview</i>
<i>and to report. You got me?</i>

1172
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:02,725
Now this isn't <i>Creem<i> magazine.
<i>This is Rolling Stone.</i></i></i>

1173
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:06,228
We need this story in four days.
Now, I want to know how it's shaping up.

1174
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,069
It's a think piece
about a mid-level band

1175
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,406
<i>struggling with their own limitations</i>
<i>in the harsh face of stardom.</i>

1176
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,658
That's great.

1177
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:24,330
I like what we're saying.

1178
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,498
Let me try and get you
a thousand more words.

1179
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:31,462
<i>It's in consideration for the cover,</i>
<i>but don't tell the band.</i>

1180
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:36,634
<i>The cover of</i> Rolling Stone Magazine.
<i>Crazy.</i>

1181
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,344
Crazy.

1182
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,306
- ...some coffee.
- Me, too.

1183
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:44,850
Greenville is so boring.

1184
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:49,647
You know, any other city in the world,
and you'd still be a virgin.

1185
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:53,817
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

1186
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:57,238
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

1187
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,991
- Don't worry, baby. You will.
- I gotta find Russell.

1188
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,662
Will you take the laundry?

1189
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,498
"Take the laundry"?

1190
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:13,254
What am I to you?
Tell me. Tell me right now.

1191
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,340
What am I to you?

1192
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:28,852
Excuse me, sir.
Would you mind signing for this?

1193
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,604
Good morning.

1194
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:47,705
Please go the fuck away!

1195
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:45,637
Hey, man. We'll do
the interview in Cleveland.

1196
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,308
No, no, no, no.
I can't go to Cleveland.

1197
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:54,646
Come on, man. We'll have more
time there. Don't be tense.

1198
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,193
Come to Cleveland.

1199
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:00,694
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

1200
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:04,281
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

1201
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,909
- I can't go to Cleveland.
- Hey, can we help it

1202
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:09,870
- if we like having you around?
- Come to Cleveland.

1203
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,331
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come...

1204
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:15,584
Look, I don't wanna
go to Cleveland. OK?

1205
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,128
I want to go home.

1206
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,716
That's good, man.
I like it when you yell.

1207
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:26,637
But I'm not gonna let you miss out
on the rock mecca of the Midwest.

1208
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:31,392
- "Rock mecca."
- Hey, you're with us. Rock and roll?

1209
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:34,728
- Rock...
- ...and roll.

1210
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:39,942
- It's all...
- I know. I know. It's all happening.

1211
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,587
Oh, my God! It's Stillwater!

1212
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,549
Hi, welcome to Swingo's Celebrity Inn.
You must be Stillwater.

1213
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,176
<i>Memory of a Free Festival,</i>
<i>Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud.</i>

1214
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,179
I mean, that's vintage Bowie, you know?
I mean, the new stuff,

1215
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:12,683
<i>Ziggy Stardust</i> is good,
but it's mass media, you know?

1216
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:14,560
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.

1217
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:19,690
It's Bowie! Bowie!

1218
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,553
Good-looking cake. All right.
That's doubles.

1219
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:55,309
Jeff and Russell are
the figureheads of the band,

1220
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:59,396
but I think the true Stillwater fan,
your absolute Stillwater fan,

1221
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:03,400
knows the, the purity, the essence,
the core of Stillwater's music

1222
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,694
comes from Silent Ed Vallencourt.

1223
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:08,739
Hi, Mom. I'm gonna
fly back Monday morning.

1224
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,534
No, no, no. I'll only miss one test.

1225
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:14,828
<i>I'll be back for graduation.</i>

1226
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:16,622
<i>Tell her you're a slave to the groove.</i>
<i>You can't help it.</i>

1227
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,625
Lis... No. Russell.

1228
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,461
No. Russell, Russell.

1229
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:25,964
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

1230
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:31,178
How does it feel to be the mother of the
greatest rock journalist we've met?

1231
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,515
<i>Hello?</i>

1232
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,309
Hello?

1233
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:39,269
Look, you've got a great kid here.

1234
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:42,606
There's nothing to worry about.
We're taking good care of him.

1235
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,525
You should come to the show sometime.
Join the circus.

1236
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,652
<i>Hey, listen to me, mister.</i>

1237
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,780
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

1238
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:53,825
- Of course you like him.
- Well, yeah.

1239
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:58,997
He worships you people. That's fine by
you as long as he helps make you rich.

1240
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:04,127
- Rich? I don't think so.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

1241
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:09,633
He's a smart, good-hearted,
15-year-old kid with infinite potential.

1242
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:12,344
<i>This is not some apron-wearing mother</i>
<i>you're speaking to.</i>

1243
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:14,221
<i>I know all about</i>
<i>your Valhalla of decadence</i>

1244
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,597
<i>and I shouldn't have let him go.</i>

1245
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:18,433
He's not ready for your
world of compromised values

1246
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,144
and diminished brain cells
that you throw away like confetti.

1247
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,814
- Am I speaking to you clearly?
- Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:26,900
<i>If you break his spirit,</i>
<i>harm him in any way,</i>

1249
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:28,485
keep him from his chosen profession,

1250
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,946
which is law, something
you may not value, but I do,

1251
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,907
<i>you will meet the voice</i>
<i>at the other end of this telephone</i>

1252
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:37,661
and it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

1253
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,621
Yes, ma'am.

1254
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,499
I didn't ask for this role,
but I'll play it.

1255
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,336
Now go do your best.

1256
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,506
"Be bold and mighty forces
will come to your aid."

1257
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,508
Goethe said that.

1258
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:56,930
It's not too late for you to become
a person of substance, Russell.

1259
01:38:57,098 --> 01:39:00,350
<i>Please get my son home safely.</i>

1260
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,228
<i>You know, I'm glad we spoke.</i>

1261
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:12,029
<i>Song and bong</i>
<i>It sounds like lots of fun</i>

1262
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:16,366
<i>Won't you get on my back</i>
<i>for a piggyback ride</i>

1263
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,660
<i>Get on my back</i>

1264
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:23,332
<i>For a piggyback ride</i>

1265
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,917
- All right, boys.
- All right.

1266
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:31,757
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

1267
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,385
She means well.

1268
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:42,601
<i>From Troy, Michigan,</i>

1269
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,230
<i>would you please</i>
<i>welcome to Cleveland,</i>

1270
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,651
Stillwater!

1271
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,554
Russell.

1272
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,830
So, Russell, when you play
a great show like tonight...

1273
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,291
OK, I need everyone's attention, please.

1274
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:32,461
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

1275
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:36,506
Well, it seems the rumors are true.

1276
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:40,385
The record company has sent
a big-time manager here

1277
01:41:40,553 --> 01:41:42,512
to try and talk you into replacing me.

1278
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:45,807
His name is Dennis Hope.
I know you've all heard of him.

1279
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:47,184
He's got all the big bands.

1280
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,270
He's outside right now and
he wants five minutes with you.

1281
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:53,190
And I think we've gotta do this.

1282
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:56,902
- Well, send him in.
- Yeah, bring him in.

1283
01:41:57,069 --> 01:42:00,447
- We'll send him out on a rail.
- All right.

1284
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:03,867
We'll finish the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from Maryland.

1285
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,789
- Hi.
- Hi.

1286
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,917
Hey, we've already got a manager, man.
He's been with us from the beginning.

1287
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:14,336
Respectfully. We all have our roots.

1288
01:42:14,504 --> 01:42:16,630
I believe in bands
holding onto their roots.

1289
01:42:16,798 --> 01:42:21,718
But those roots need to be augmented.
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1290
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:27,307
I may enrage some and enthrall others.
I don't really give a fuck.

1291
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:30,560
Your manager here needs a manager.

1292
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:34,022
Example: if you hadn't run out
on your contract in Phoenix,

1293
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,691
we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

1294
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:40,362
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

1295
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:44,199
You effectively traveled a long way to
pay that promoter to electrocute you.

1296
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:47,744
Your damages have put you
way in the hole for this tour.

1297
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,664
Right now you owe the record company
more than you've got.

1298
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,833
But your record's selling.
There's money to be made.

1299
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,292
So I brought a plane in.

1300
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,087
We add more shows to make up
the difference, respectfully.

1301
01:42:57,255 --> 01:43:01,925
- We travel by bus.
- Doris is the soul of this band.

1302
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:06,471
That bus has been our home since we
were the Jeff Bebe Band. No way.

1303
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,765
I'd travel on a pogo stick
if I thought we could make more money.

1304
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:10,767
You could play more dates with a plane.

1305
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,813
Well, it's not about money. It's about
playing music and turning people on.

1306
01:43:14,981 --> 01:43:19,276
Clearly. Respectfully. But
on the distasteful subject of money,

1307
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:22,904
just know that
you're all making it right now.

1308
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,490
And it's all out there.

1309
01:43:26,284 --> 01:43:29,995
I'm just talking about
bringin' it back here.

1310
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:33,623
Why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves?

1311
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,709
Do you know how to keep
from getting charged for the ice

1312
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:38,920
below the floorboards
at Chicago Stadium?

1313
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:40,755
Do you know how
to do a headlining tour?

1314
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:43,675
Do you know Clay Rothman
at the LA Forum?

1315
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:47,804
Do you know Bobby Cowan,
Danny Marcus, Lisa Robinson?

1316
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:50,390
Do you know Frank Barcelona?

1317
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:55,103
This is Cleveland!
Where's Kid Leo? Where is he?

1318
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:57,689
Do you know how to get
a record not pressed, but played?

1319
01:43:57,857 --> 01:44:00,358
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.

1320
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:02,402
I just own the best umbrella.

1321
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:06,448
And as much as you may believe that
this is gonna last forever, it does not.

1322
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:10,702
Your biggest fan right now...
Your biggest fan.

1323
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,245
Soon they're gonna
want to go to college.

1324
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:17,292
Gonna want to buy some clothes,
spend that money some other way.

1325
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,252
And you know what?

1326
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:22,213
They'll tape your record
from a friend's copy.

1327
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:26,343
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can,

1328
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:30,680
and you gotta do it now.
That's what the big boys do.

1329
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:32,474
If you think Mick Jagger
will still be out there

1330
01:44:32,642 --> 01:44:37,103
trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly mistaken.

1331
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:41,024
Yes, well, thank you, Dennis.

1332
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:44,110
- We'll think about what you said.
- Oh, no, you...

1333
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,697
You... You don't understand.
I'll think about it.

1334
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:50,116
I'm not auditioning.

1335
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:54,162
I came here to decide
whether I want to represent you.

1336
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:59,876
So I'll stand outside for a moment
and think about whether I want to stay.

1337
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,296
It was a good show.

1338
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:17,227
I miss him already.

1339
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:22,482
<i>You're coming along at a very</i>
<i>dangerous time for rock and roll.</i>

1340
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:27,070
<i>The war is over. They won.</i>
<i>And they will ruin rock and roll</i>

1341
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,573
<i>and strangle everything</i>
<i>we love about it.</i>

1342
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:52,489
Put them up. All right.

1343
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:55,492
- I don't know what that was.
- It was a donkey dick, man!

1344
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:59,496
I'm sorry. No matter where you come
from, a donkey dick is funny.

1345
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,832
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

1346
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,585
- Is Russell Hammond here?
- Hey, The Enemy.

1347
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:07,003
Come on in, son.

1348
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:12,217
Hey, welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1349
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:16,846
The game has been going on for
two years. Come on. Find a spot.

1350
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:20,517
This is Mick, he's with The Who.
Raymond, he's with The Eagles.

1351
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:22,977
Reg, he's with Humble Pie.
I think you know Red Dog.

1352
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:25,230
Hi, brother.

1353
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,899
We've been developing this system
of poker over the years

1354
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:30,360
so you can play it in any condition.

1355
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:33,404
We only let Russell in
because he brought the hash.

1356
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:37,200
- Easy, easy. The press is here.
- Don't mention me or The Eagles.

1357
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:41,121
- Well, I'm done.
- I'm out.

1358
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:44,082
- I'm in.
- All right, all right.

1359
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:47,377
Side proposition to the winner.

1360
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:49,546
For 50 bucks
and a case of Heineken,

1361
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,631
I'll throw into the pot
three lovely ladies,

1362
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:54,384
including Miss Penny Lane
of the famous Band Aids,

1363
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:58,429
who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1364
01:47:58,597 --> 01:48:02,559
- Russ, is that OK with you?
- Russ is getting soft on us.

1365
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,188
- Is that OK?
- OK.

1366
01:48:07,356 --> 01:48:11,317
It's a deal. Show them.

1367
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:15,363
Three lovely ladies in the custody
of Humble Pie. Be good to them, Reg.

1368
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:20,201
All right, so we owe you $50
and a case of Heineken. All right.

1369
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:23,746
- Joint?
- Know how I know this is good stuff?

1370
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:25,748
- How's that?
- This is from Crosby.

1371
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,917
- Is that Crosby weed?
- Yeah.

1372
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:32,046
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

1373
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:38,595
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1374
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,763
She already knows that Leslie's coming
to New York tomorrow.

1375
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,932
Everybody understands.

1376
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,102
This is the circus.
Everybody's trying not to go home.

1377
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,396
Nobody's saying goodbye.

1378
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,276
Quit looking at me like that.

1379
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,946
Yeah, that's it, Larry!

1380
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:04,787
Yeah, baby. Go get him.
Go get him. Go get him!

1381
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,791
<i>Larry Fellows, he's down...</i>

1382
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:20,094
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>

1383
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:23,681
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>

1384
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:27,143
<i>Happy, happy birthday to you</i>

1385
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,899
I'm making a wish.

1386
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:43,993
So...

1387
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:47,664
"Penny, our friend,
has gained another year.

1388
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:50,625
But long ago she threw it in gear.

1389
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:55,296
She rocked the South,
the East, the West.

1390
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:57,674
Could we please get off
this endless tour

1391
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,551
where we're Black Sabbath's
fucking special guest?"

1392
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,095
Yeah!

1393
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:06,307
"She says she's retired,
but we've heard that before.

1394
01:50:07,977 --> 01:50:09,310
She chose us.

1395
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:12,689
In Penny Lane we trust.

1396
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:15,775
She is a fan of this band.

1397
01:50:17,278 --> 01:50:19,195
Much more so than us."

1398
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:32,333
- Cut the cake!
- Yeah!

1399
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:35,920
<i>- Cut the cake!</i>
- Who wants it? Who wants it?

1400
01:50:36,088 --> 01:50:39,507
<i>Cut the cake!</i>

1401
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:42,719
- Cut the cake!
<i>- Cut the cake!</i>

1402
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:50,685
Thank you, baby.

1403
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,900
Who wants the "P" in "Penny?"

1404
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:01,237
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you. Here you go.

1405
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:03,740
I'm sorry the plane isn't bigger.

1406
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,244
I'll take a piece.

1407
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:16,085
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's fucking great.

1408
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:21,924
<i>Cut the cake.</i>

1409
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,023
Who didn't get cake?

1410
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:49,410
Any extra plates?

1411
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:51,954
Anybody?

1412
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:57,043
<i>You think you can fool me.</i>

1413
01:51:57,211 --> 01:52:00,296
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

1414
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:03,049
What's that?

1415
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:05,843
You're worried about me and Russell.

1416
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:10,973
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1417
01:52:11,809 --> 01:52:13,976
You're so sweet.

1418
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:17,897
God, if there was
more of you in him.

1419
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:22,026
Don't tell me this stuff.
I want to like him.

1420
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:26,322
Did you miss a test or something?

1421
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:30,159
You have no idea.

1422
01:52:30,327 --> 01:52:34,497
I know I'm not on the plane. And I'm not
going on some other band's bus.

1423
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,542
I could go with the road crew,
but that would be pathetic

1424
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,377
and the girls are all
going with Humble Pie.

1425
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:43,172
So if you could
find out from Russell...

1426
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,966
- Penny.
- Forget it.

1427
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:47,760
I'm flying to New York myself.
I've got a bunch of partial tickets.

1428
01:52:47,928 --> 01:52:50,221
I know his ex-wife
current girlfriend thing...

1429
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:53,975
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.
- What are you saying?

1430
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:59,021
- Did Russell say something?
- No. No, I don't know anything.

1431
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,149
Well, I know he wants me there.

1432
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:03,526
Wake up!

1433
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:06,195
Don't go to New York!

1434
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:09,282
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1435
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:12,493
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1436
01:53:12,661 --> 01:53:15,037
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1437
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:17,707
I don't even know your real name.

1438
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:20,710
If I ever met a man
in the real world who looked at me

1439
01:53:20,878 --> 01:53:22,211
the way you just looked at me...

1440
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:26,132
When and where does this
"real world" occur?

1441
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:29,218
I mean, I'm really confused here.

1442
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:32,722
All these rules
and all these sayings and nicknames.

1443
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:37,393
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock and roll.

1444
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,729
Sweet?

1445
01:53:39,897 --> 01:53:43,357
Where do you get off?
Where do you get "sweet?"

1446
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:46,194
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!

1447
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:49,030
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

1448
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:51,240
I am not sweet.

1449
01:53:51,408 --> 01:53:53,326
And you should know that about me.

1450
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:55,578
I am The Enemy!

1451
01:53:55,746 --> 01:53:57,580
Look, you should be happy for me.

1452
01:53:57,748 --> 01:54:00,249
You don't know what
he says to me in private.

1453
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:03,878
Maybe it is love, as much
as it can be for somebody...

1454
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:07,757
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

1455
01:54:08,926 --> 01:54:10,510
I was there.

1456
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:13,012
I was there.

1457
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:21,812
Oh, God.

1458
01:54:26,235 --> 01:54:28,277
I'm sorry.

1459
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,459
What kind of beer?

1460
01:55:00,519 --> 01:55:02,895
Welcome to New York.
It's OK to be nervous.

1461
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,647
You should be nervous.

1462
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:08,568
All you can do is be yourself
and leave a pint of blood on that stage.

1463
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:13,155
Hey, William. We showed you America.
Did everything but get you laid.

1464
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:27,795
No. Yeah?

1465
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:49,775
I'm from the Church of Lenny.
We bow to his will

1466
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:53,487
and all that it represents.
He's the king of the king of kings.

1467
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:56,741
- Maybe I could get an autograph?
- Who should I make it out to?

1468
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:58,701
She's here.

1469
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,708
- Russell, can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.

1470
01:56:07,169 --> 01:56:10,755
- Leslie. How you doing?
- Jeffrey.

1471
01:56:10,922 --> 01:56:14,258
Your room's fully stocked.
The air conditioning's on.

1472
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:16,761
- And by the way, you look stunning.
- Thanks, see you later.

1473
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:21,223
All right, bags in five.
Cars leave for the party at 6:00.

1474
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,225
Oh, God.

1475
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:29,565
There are lighter souvenirs, you know.

1476
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:33,361
Well, I kept thinking I was going
to go home the next day.

1477
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:37,198
Yeah. So did I, 15 years ago.

1478
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:40,409
Oi, that's the wrong bag, you idiot!

1479
01:56:40,577 --> 01:56:43,245
- William?
- Vic.

1480
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:47,625
It's all happening.
They're here. Zeppelin are here.

1481
01:56:47,793 --> 01:56:50,544
They are here.
They're at the Plaza.

1482
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:55,508
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there, too.

1483
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:59,595
They're all staying
under the name Emily Rugburn.

1484
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:02,932
- Wait. Penny Lane is here?
- Emily Rugburn.

1485
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:07,186
William Miller?
Sir, you have an urgent call.

1486
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,189
Hello.

1487
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:13,317
Hello, this is Jann Wenner,
publisher of Rolling Stone.

1488
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:15,277
Congratulations, it's gonna be a cover.

1489
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:18,030
<i>Annie Liebowitz will</i>
<i>shoot them next week in LA,</i>

1490
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:21,117
but we are gonna need you
back in San Francisco tomorrow.

1491
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:23,953
<i>You can finish the story here, OK?</i>
<i>Talk to Ben.</i>

1492
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:26,288
You can tell the band.

1493
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:27,415
Alison, our fact checker,

1494
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:31,335
needs you to transmit whatever
you have of this story tonight.

1495
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:33,963
There's a mojo at the <i>Daily News</i>
they'll let us use.

1496
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:37,466
- A mojo?
- A mojo. It's a very modern machine

1497
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:43,055
that transmits pages over the telephone.
It only takes 18 minutes a page.

1498
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,809
<i>Soon as a couple of people leave,</i>
<i>I can fit you right in, OK?</i>

1499
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:49,019
Right now, it's just...
Excuse me, you got an ID?

1500
01:57:49,187 --> 01:57:51,981
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- No, no, no. You need an ID, man.

1501
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,483
- Hey, man! He's cool.
- Hey, Dennis. How you doing?

1502
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:58,028
Great! Everything's great. Far out.
He's with you guys? Well, enjoy!

1503
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,088
- Opie!
- Hey!

1504
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:19,717
I'm going to England with Deep Purple
and we leave in an hour.

1505
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:24,388
Don't forget me, OK?

1506
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:30,978
It's all happening,
but I must vamoosh!

1507
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:53,876
Hey, The Enemy!
Hey, we got a table back there.

1508
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:57,254
Why don't you come on over?
They're all looking for you.

1509
01:59:01,218 --> 01:59:03,302
Guys!

1510
01:59:04,054 --> 01:59:05,596
Guys!

1511
01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:11,393
You're gonna be on the cover
of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

1512
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:18,484
Are you serious?
The cover of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

1513
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:22,488
And we made it together.

1514
01:59:23,907 --> 01:59:27,701
And they don't just put somebody
with one little hit

1515
01:59:27,869 --> 01:59:33,082
<i>on the cover of Rolling Stone</i>
fucking magazine, man.

1516
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:36,210
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1517
01:59:36,378 --> 01:59:41,340
When I first bought the magazine,
The Beatles were on the cover.

1518
01:59:41,508 --> 01:59:46,095
The Beatles. Four of them, four of us.

1519
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:17,626
Thank you.

1520
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:24,258
Who is that girl?
She's creeping me out.

1521
02:00:24,426 --> 02:00:26,093
She's not with any of you guys, is she?

1522
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:28,178
Yeah, she's with me.

1523
02:00:38,607 --> 02:00:40,941
So who's gonna shoot it?

1524
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:44,194
I want Annie Liebowitz
or Neal Preston.

1525
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:47,031
I love Annie's stuff. She does
great stuff. I'll call her up.

1526
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:31,468
I'm no good at goodbyes.

1527
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:35,931
And you are the last...

1528
02:02:36,975 --> 02:02:41,645
...of my old-time friends.

1529
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:47,735
Polexia. Polexia went
to England with Deep Purple.

1530
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:51,280
Can you believe that?

1531
02:02:51,448 --> 02:02:54,283
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1532
02:02:54,451 --> 02:02:58,454
While all she left
was her Quaaludes.

1533
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:03,584
- Oh, wonderful.
- Where's Beth?

1534
02:03:03,752 --> 02:03:08,088
Where's my friends?
Where are all my friends?

1535
02:03:08,256 --> 02:03:12,134
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

1536
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:14,136
Room 537.

1537
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:17,639
- Penny, get up.
- I'm up.

1538
02:03:17,807 --> 02:03:22,019
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

1539
02:03:22,187 --> 02:03:26,231
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

1540
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:30,402
- Penny, get up. Get up.
- So... You know that.

1541
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:35,574
You know that I'm retired.
I've always been.

1542
02:03:35,742 --> 02:03:39,620
I'm retired and I'm tired.

1543
02:03:39,788 --> 02:03:41,747
Jane Abbot.

1544
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:43,916
Miss Jane Abbot.

1545
02:03:49,672 --> 02:03:51,465
Miss Judy Stanton.

1546
02:03:53,843 --> 02:03:56,637
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1547
02:03:56,805 --> 02:04:00,808
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

1548
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:03,352
<i>- As time goes on</i>
<i>- Seats and tray tables.</i>

1549
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:08,857
- Seat backs and tray tables locked.
<i>- And our pending graduate,</i>

1550
02:04:09,025 --> 02:04:12,861
William Miller, not present.

1551
02:04:21,204 --> 02:04:23,330
Why doesn't he love me?

1552
02:04:33,216 --> 02:04:36,969
<i>And to the class of 1973 we say,</i>

1553
02:04:37,137 --> 02:04:41,390
<i>don't forget to remember</i>
<i>yourselves as you are today,</i>

1554
02:04:41,558 --> 02:04:46,854
full of hope and the dream
that everything is possible.

1555
02:04:47,021 --> 02:04:49,815
And remember this
20 years from now,

1556
02:04:49,983 --> 02:04:52,609
when we all own home computers,

1557
02:04:52,777 --> 02:04:55,821
and we all travel
in shiny electrical cars

1558
02:04:55,989 --> 02:04:59,366
that move swiftly high above our city,

1559
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:01,869
that the key to the future

1560
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:05,539
is keeping today alive. Forever!

1561
02:05:06,749 --> 02:05:09,001
Forever! Forever!

1562
02:05:09,169 --> 02:05:13,547
- Penny, no. Wake up! Wake up!
- I'm up.

1563
02:05:16,259 --> 02:05:20,596
Well, now that I have your attention,

1564
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:23,765
I know you've heard this before,

1565
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:26,393
and I've never said this to anybody.

1566
02:05:26,561 --> 02:05:31,607
Well, nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me,

1567
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:33,609
but...

1568
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:37,863
Oh, God. Why am I so nervous?
You'll never remember this.

1569
02:05:39,115 --> 02:05:40,616
I love you.

1570
02:05:41,868 --> 02:05:45,037
And I'm about to boldly go where...

1571
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:49,082
...many men have gone before.

1572
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:00,969
- What've we got? What's her name?
- Emily.

1573
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:04,514
OK, sweetheart. Sit up, sit up, sit up.
Good girl, good girl.

1574
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:08,227
- What did you take, sweetheart?
- I'll get her legs.

1575
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:09,937
- What did you take?
- I don't know.

1576
02:06:10,104 --> 02:06:13,106
Yes, you do. Tell us what you took.

1577
02:06:13,274 --> 02:06:15,651
Emily, we're gonna have
to pump your stomach, OK?

1578
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:20,656
- Emily, wake up.
- I got the tubes. There we go. Water.

1579
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:24,117
All right, now you're gonna have
to swallow this tube.

1580
02:06:24,285 --> 02:06:26,078
Open, open, open.

1581
02:06:26,246 --> 02:06:28,747
- Don't fight us. We're trying to help.
- Emily, Emily.

1582
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:32,167
- Relax.
- Come on. Swallow, swallow.

1583
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:35,879
I know, I know. Swallow this down.
No, don't bite on it. Swallow.

1584
02:06:36,047 --> 02:06:38,257
Emily, Emily. Come on. Swallow.

1585
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:42,511
- Very good. That's it. All done.
- Got it.

1586
02:06:42,679 --> 02:06:46,682
All done. Very good.
Now we gotta... Come on...

1587
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:49,768
Feed some liquid into your stomach.

1588
02:07:20,216 --> 02:07:22,217
<i>You've never done half</i>
<i>the things you said you did.</i>

1589
02:07:23,428 --> 02:07:26,388
It was in the middle
of <i>Midnight Rambler.</i>

1590
02:07:26,556 --> 02:07:30,767
And Keith Richards saw me,

1591
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:33,228
came to the front of the stage

1592
02:07:33,396 --> 02:07:37,733
and he pulled me out
and they took me backstage

1593
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:40,694
and gave me a Coke

1594
02:07:40,862 --> 02:07:44,489
with ice and a lemon.

1595
02:07:46,242 --> 02:07:49,161
And I never went home.

1596
02:07:49,329 --> 02:07:53,582
I've done twice
the things I said I did.

1597
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:56,668
What about your mom?

1598
02:07:58,755 --> 02:08:04,259
She always said, "Marry up.
Marry someone grand."

1599
02:08:04,427 --> 02:08:07,304
And that's why she named me Lady.

1600
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:12,100
She named you Lady?

1601
02:08:13,269 --> 02:08:14,686
Lady Goodman.

1602
02:08:16,814 --> 02:08:20,108
Lady Goodman. That's great.

1603
02:08:20,276 --> 02:08:22,778
Now you know all my secrets.

1604
02:08:22,945 --> 02:08:24,613
You got me.

1605
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:29,284
See you back in the real world.

1606
02:08:30,536 --> 02:08:34,623
Thank you, William Miller.

1607
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:07,572
Hey, Lady!

1608
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:12,327
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1609
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:16,415
<i>welcome to Eastern Airlines'</i>
<i>nonstop service to San Diego.</i>

1610
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:19,042
<i>In preparation</i>
<i>for our departure today,</i>

1611
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:23,338
<i>we'd like to ask please that you</i>
<i>extinguish all flammable items</i>

1612
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:26,466
<i>and do return</i>
<i>all seats and tray tables...</i>

1613
02:09:27,844 --> 02:09:30,011
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

1614
02:09:33,433 --> 02:09:36,685
<i>...that your seat belts</i>
<i>are securely fastened.</i>

1615
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:39,581
<i>Hey, why didn't you come back</i>
<i>last night? Bob Dylan showed up.</i>

1616
02:10:39,749 --> 02:10:42,918
He was sitting at our table for an hour
or something, right, Dick?

1617
02:10:43,085 --> 02:10:47,506
Just rapping, Bob Dylan at our fucking
table. I was looking for you.

1618
02:10:47,673 --> 02:10:50,258
- I was gonna introduce you.
- What happened to you last night?

1619
02:10:50,426 --> 02:10:53,011
It's a long story.

1620
02:11:03,356 --> 02:11:05,565
<i>Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.</i>

1621
02:11:05,733 --> 02:11:07,609
<i>It appears we've caught the edge</i>
<i>of that electrical storm.</i>

1622
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:09,986
- Oh, my God.
- Electrical storm?

1623
02:11:10,154 --> 02:11:11,404
<i>Buckle up tight. We're gonna do</i>
<i>our best to get you out of this.</i>

1624
02:11:11,572 --> 02:11:14,783
- Rock and roll.
- We shouldn't be here.

1625
02:11:16,494 --> 02:11:19,746
Whoa, baby!

1626
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:23,875
Doris, we miss you.

1627
02:11:26,712 --> 02:11:29,798
Listen, we're gonna
try and land in Tupelo.

1628
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:32,968
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1629
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:34,302
I can't breathe, man.

1630
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:37,347
It's gonna be kind of a rough set down,
but we should be fine.

1631
02:11:37,515 --> 02:11:40,559
Just hang in there
and we'll get you out of this.

1632
02:11:45,523 --> 02:11:48,608
Everyone says,
"It's so glamorous out here."

1633
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:51,653
- He just told us we're gonna die.
- We're gonna die?

1634
02:11:51,821 --> 02:11:54,656
...Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

1635
02:11:56,993 --> 02:11:58,118
Oh, my God!

1636
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:03,498
If something should happen,

1637
02:12:03,666 --> 02:12:06,167
maybe I never said this enough,

1638
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:08,128
I love all of you.

1639
02:12:14,802 --> 02:12:18,597
I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit and run.

1640
02:12:18,764 --> 02:12:22,058
I hit him and just kept on going.

1641
02:12:22,226 --> 02:12:25,270
I don't know if he's alive
or dead, but I'm sorry.

1642
02:12:25,438 --> 02:12:27,522
Not a day goes by
that I don't see his face.

1643
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:31,026
Oh, my God!

1644
02:12:31,193 --> 02:12:34,571
Look, I love you all too.
You're like family to me.

1645
02:12:34,739 --> 02:12:36,072
Especially since Marna left me.

1646
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:40,619
And if I took an extra
dollar or two here and there,

1647
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:44,539
- it's because I knew I earned it.
- Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.

1648
02:12:44,707 --> 02:12:45,874
I did, too.

1649
02:12:47,668 --> 02:12:49,669
I waited until you broke up with her,
Dick, but me too.

1650
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:55,050
I also slept with Leslie
when you were fighting.

1651
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:57,802
You slept with Jeff?

1652
02:12:57,970 --> 02:13:01,556
But it didn't count. It was the summer
we decided to be free of all rules.

1653
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:06,394
- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.

1654
02:13:06,562 --> 02:13:08,730
None of us love you.

1655
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:13,193
- You act above us, you always have.
- Finally, the truth.

1656
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:17,906
You just held it over us like you might
leave, like we're lucky to be with you.

1657
02:13:18,074 --> 02:13:20,158
And we had to live with it, man.

1658
02:13:20,326 --> 02:13:24,079
I had to live with you
and now I might die with you.

1659
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,582
- And it's not fucking fair!
- Please, enough!

1660
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:33,421
And I'm still in love with you, Leslie.

1661
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:36,383
Oh, I don't want to hear any more!
Shut up, Jeffrey!

1662
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:38,426
- Jeffrey?
- It's all happening.

1663
02:13:38,594 --> 02:13:41,096
Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead!

1664
02:13:41,263 --> 02:13:44,724
Don't be self-righteous,
Russell, not now, man.

1665
02:13:44,892 --> 02:13:48,103
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie!

1666
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:51,606
Last summer up until yesterday.
Why don't you tell Leslie that?

1667
02:13:51,774 --> 02:13:56,444
- Shut up, I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit! I quit!

1668
02:13:56,612 --> 02:14:02,409
That groupie? She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

1669
02:14:02,576 --> 02:14:07,914
And you all used her, all of you.
You used her and threw her away.

1670
02:14:08,082 --> 02:14:12,127
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan!

1671
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:16,089
You guys are always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1672
02:14:16,257 --> 02:14:20,427
She was your biggest fan
and you threw her away.

1673
02:14:20,594 --> 02:14:25,056
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1674
02:14:25,224 --> 02:14:27,600
And I love her! I love her!

1675
02:14:37,445 --> 02:14:39,070
Fuck it!

1676
02:14:39,655 --> 02:14:42,699
I'm... I'm gay!

1677
02:14:56,672 --> 02:14:59,007
Thank God above, we're alive!

1678
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:01,009
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1679
02:15:01,177 --> 02:15:06,055
Sweet relief! Hallelujah, dear God!

1680
02:16:13,791 --> 02:16:15,917
Write what you want.

1681
02:16:51,245 --> 02:16:55,290
- Just leave your package on the desk.
- Oh, I'm not a messenger.

1682
02:16:55,457 --> 02:16:59,294
I'm one of your writers.
William H. Miller.

1683
02:17:06,468 --> 02:17:08,761
He's just a kid!

1684
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:13,933
Go right on in.

1685
02:17:37,958 --> 02:17:42,670
- You're William Miller?
- Yep.

1686
02:17:42,838 --> 02:17:45,798
Oh, baby.

1687
02:17:46,842 --> 02:17:50,178
Didn't anything happen, I mean,
after $600 in room service bills?

1688
02:17:50,346 --> 02:17:52,722
Didn't you get anything
on tape with Russell Hammond?

1689
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:55,099
Where are you in this piece?
What did you want to write?

1690
02:17:55,267 --> 02:17:57,393
This reads like what
they wanted you to write.

1691
02:17:57,561 --> 02:17:58,686
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1692
02:17:58,854 --> 02:18:00,146
Something must have happened.

1693
02:18:00,314 --> 02:18:02,023
I think we should push up
Flippo's Who cover.

1694
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:04,984
It's gonna take me three days
to get through this research.

1695
02:18:05,152 --> 02:18:08,655
It's all handwritten
on little bits of paper!

1696
02:18:08,822 --> 02:18:09,781
- It's a puff-piece.
- Plus, they refer

1697
02:18:09,949 --> 02:18:12,283
to all the women as chicks. I mean,
as a woman, I have a problem with that.

1698
02:18:12,451 --> 02:18:14,827
You want them to like you.
It happens.

1699
02:18:14,995 --> 02:18:19,165
Ben, you told me to send what I had.

1700
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:24,170
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1701
02:18:57,037 --> 02:19:01,249
<i>Oh, man.</i>
<i>You made friends with them.</i>

1702
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:05,712
See, friendship
is the booze they feed you.

1703
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:09,215
They want you to get drunk
on feeling like you belong.

1704
02:19:09,383 --> 02:19:11,718
<i>Well, it was fun.</i>

1705
02:19:11,885 --> 02:19:14,846
Because they make you feel cool.

1706
02:19:15,014 --> 02:19:20,059
- And hey, I met you. You are not cool.
<i>- I know.</i>

1707
02:19:20,227 --> 02:19:23,521
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1708
02:19:23,689 --> 02:19:25,773
Because we are uncool.

1709
02:19:26,942 --> 02:19:30,611
Women will always be a problem
for guys like us.

1710
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:34,949
Most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1711
02:19:35,117 --> 02:19:38,161
Good-looking people,
they got no spine.

1712
02:19:39,121 --> 02:19:41,956
Their art never lasts.

1713
02:19:42,124 --> 02:19:44,417
Oh, they get the girls,
but we're smarter.

1714
02:19:46,295 --> 02:19:48,421
Yeah, I can really see that now.

1715
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:53,593
Because great art is about
the guilt and longing,

1716
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:57,597
and love disguised as sex
and sex disguised as love.

1717
02:19:57,765 --> 02:20:01,476
<i>Hey, let's face it,</i>
<i>you got a big head start.</i>

1718
02:20:01,643 --> 02:20:03,478
I'm glad you were home.

1719
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,439
I'm always home. I'm uncool.

1720
02:20:06,607 --> 02:20:09,776
- Me, too.
<i>- You're doing great, man.</i>

1721
02:20:09,943 --> 02:20:12,487
The only true currency
in this bankrupt world

1722
02:20:12,654 --> 02:20:16,324
is what you share
with someone else when you're uncool.

1723
02:20:17,493 --> 02:20:19,494
<i>Listen, my advice to you,</i>

1724
02:20:19,661 --> 02:20:21,996
<i>and I know you think</i>
<i>these guys are your friends,</i>

1725
02:20:23,165 --> 02:20:27,502
if you want to be a true friend
to them, be honest

1726
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:30,671
and unmerciful.

1727
02:20:30,839 --> 02:20:34,008
"I'm flying high over
Tupelo, Mississippi

1728
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:38,763
with America's hottest band,
and we're all about to die."

1729
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:43,184
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, and it gets better.

1730
02:20:43,352 --> 02:20:45,186
Did this all really happen?

1731
02:20:45,354 --> 02:20:49,732
Give it to me. I'll call
and check the quotes.

1732
02:20:51,026 --> 02:20:54,654
Holy shit! I just got off the phone
with <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

1733
02:20:54,822 --> 02:20:56,656
They called me, too.
What's he using?

1734
02:20:56,824 --> 02:21:00,409
All, he's using it all.
This, according to the fact checker.

1735
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:03,496
- So what?
- "So what?"

1736
02:21:03,664 --> 02:21:05,498
We come off like amateurs,

1737
02:21:05,666 --> 02:21:09,836
some average band trying
to come to grips with success,

1738
02:21:10,003 --> 02:21:14,674
jealous and fighting and breaking up.
We're buffoons!

1739
02:21:14,842 --> 02:21:19,178
"Rock and roll can save the world"?
"The chicks are great"?

1740
02:21:19,346 --> 02:21:21,139
I sound like a dick!

1741
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:23,850
- You are a dick.
- I never said that!

1742
02:21:24,017 --> 02:21:26,227
Maybe we just don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

1743
02:21:26,395 --> 02:21:30,523
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1744
02:21:30,691 --> 02:21:34,902
This kid has you on acid screaming, "I'm
a golden god," from a fan's rooftop.

1745
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:38,656
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

1746
02:21:38,824 --> 02:21:41,284
Wait. I never said,
"I'm a golden god."

1747
02:21:42,953 --> 02:21:45,204
Or did I?

1748
02:21:45,372 --> 02:21:46,831
We never took him seriously.

1749
02:21:46,999 --> 02:21:49,959
- Now it's serious.
- I liked him as a person.

1750
02:21:50,127 --> 02:21:53,713
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

1751
02:21:53,881 --> 02:21:58,509
You! You had the right idea all along.

1752
02:21:58,677 --> 02:22:01,679
- How about the plane flight?
- It's all there.

1753
02:22:01,847 --> 02:22:04,265
Don't worry, it's
unspecific who says what.

1754
02:22:04,433 --> 02:22:07,685
No names are mentioned
in the more embarrassing sequences.

1755
02:22:07,853 --> 02:22:10,479
It's just completely obvious who's who,
and we're fucked!

1756
02:22:10,647 --> 02:22:13,858
I... I told him
he could write what he wanted.

1757
02:22:17,446 --> 02:22:20,156
Hey, hey.
They haven't talked to Russell yet.

1758
02:22:20,324 --> 02:22:22,950
You can always deny the key stuff
to the fact-checker.

1759
02:22:23,118 --> 02:22:24,952
One phone call.
Then they can't print it.

1760
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,456
- Is that true?
- This is war, my friend.

1761
02:22:28,624 --> 02:22:31,042
If you'd have met me earlier,
he would never be around.

1762
02:22:31,210 --> 02:22:33,544
He'll live.

1763
02:22:33,712 --> 02:22:35,546
Look, let's identify the goals here:

1764
02:22:35,714 --> 02:22:39,217
T-shirts, foreign markets,
renegotiating your contract,

1765
02:22:39,384 --> 02:22:43,638
merchandising, happiness,
realizing your dreams,

1766
02:22:44,848 --> 02:22:48,309
money, cool, meeting The Beatles.

1767
02:22:49,144 --> 02:22:51,020
Let's put all of it in the pot.

1768
02:22:51,188 --> 02:22:54,023
It all depends on mystique.

1769
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:56,359
Not giving too much away.

1770
02:22:58,278 --> 02:23:00,613
I'm going to LA tonight.
Call me if you need me.

1771
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:04,992
But before I go, let me
give you a lesson in mystique.

1772
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,536
You can only have one.
Which one do you want?

1773
02:23:09,039 --> 02:23:10,790
Which one are you gonna choose?

1774
02:23:13,293 --> 02:23:15,836
As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

1775
02:23:17,756 --> 02:23:19,924
...you'll always want it more.

1776
02:23:23,929 --> 02:23:26,013
It's phenomenal, William,
to be quite honest with you.

1777
02:23:26,181 --> 02:23:27,723
It's sophisticated. It's intelligent.

1778
02:23:27,891 --> 02:23:29,350
We only have to cut out
a couple of 'graphs.

1779
02:23:29,518 --> 02:23:33,020
Jeff Bebe's mother sent over
a shoe box of childhood photos.

1780
02:23:33,188 --> 02:23:35,022
But it's really gonna look fantastic.

1781
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:39,944
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

1782
02:23:40,112 --> 02:23:43,781
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1783
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,660
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1784
02:23:47,828 --> 02:23:49,870
Russell Hammond
is the one who denied it.

1785
02:23:50,038 --> 02:23:52,123
- Now, wait a second.
- Denied it.

1786
02:23:53,625 --> 02:23:57,044
We're going with The Who.
The manuscript's in my office.

1787
02:23:57,212 --> 02:23:59,797
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

1788
02:24:01,591 --> 02:24:03,301
Ben, wait.

1789
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,032
William?

1790
02:24:27,993 --> 02:24:29,952
You guys, this is my brother.

1791
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:33,706
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

1792
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:39,045
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.
I think I'm needed.

1793
02:24:41,006 --> 02:24:42,256
I'll see you.

1794
02:24:49,181 --> 02:24:52,141
You look awful.

1795
02:24:52,309 --> 02:24:55,811
But it's great. You're living your life.

1796
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:59,065
You're free of Mom.

1797
02:25:02,194 --> 02:25:05,696
Hey, I'll take off work.

1798
02:25:05,864 --> 02:25:10,117
Let's have an adventure together,
you and me, finally.

1799
02:25:10,285 --> 02:25:14,997
Anywhere you wanna go.
Anywhere in the world.

1800
02:25:17,042 --> 02:25:19,168
This is not my idea of a good time.

1801
02:25:20,212 --> 02:25:22,671
- Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1802
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:09,260
I forgive you.

1803
02:26:11,388 --> 02:26:13,180
I didn't apologize.

1804
02:26:46,423 --> 02:26:49,884
- Sapphire.
- Hey, boy.

1805
02:26:51,094 --> 02:26:54,054
- I hate goodbyes.
- Me, too.

1806
02:26:55,807 --> 02:27:00,478
All right. So I didn't like you much.
Do we have to like each other?

1807
02:27:01,229 --> 02:27:03,772
I sort of thought so.

1808
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:08,569
I think it would have worked against us.
I really do.

1809
02:27:08,737 --> 02:27:12,406
You know what they say,
"All the great partnerships

1810
02:27:12,574 --> 02:27:15,618
- hated each other."
- We didn't hate each other that much,

1811
02:27:15,785 --> 02:27:18,329
- did we?
- No, maybe not.

1812
02:27:18,497 --> 02:27:20,289
I could work on it, though.

1813
02:27:27,255 --> 02:27:29,715
I just can't picture you with Leslie.

1814
02:27:31,092 --> 02:27:35,304
I'm the you they get...
when they can't get you.

1815
02:27:48,568 --> 02:27:50,694
- Sorry.
- Got it. It's cool.

1816
02:27:50,862 --> 02:27:52,655
- I'll get it, man.
- I'll see you later on.

1817
02:27:52,822 --> 02:27:54,573
- See you.
- All right.

1818
02:28:05,043 --> 02:28:07,253
Is Penny OK?

1819
02:28:08,421 --> 02:28:10,548
The Quaaludes incident?

1820
02:28:10,715 --> 02:28:15,553
Well, it wasn't pretty.
She could have died.

1821
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:20,724
I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1822
02:28:20,892 --> 02:28:23,602
I guess I was wrong.
One of them ended up saving her life.

1823
02:28:25,397 --> 02:28:27,565
- William?
- What do you care?

1824
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:30,276
I mean, we all know what you did to him.

1825
02:28:30,443 --> 02:28:32,820
And everybody knows,

1826
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:36,323
even Penny Lane.

1827
02:28:42,664 --> 02:28:45,916
Something tells me
that 20 years from now,

1828
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:49,169
we'll remember her,

1829
02:28:49,337 --> 02:28:51,505
and not much else.

1830
02:28:51,673 --> 02:28:53,549
Hey, Russell.

1831
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:01,390
Can you believe these new girls?

1832
02:29:01,558 --> 02:29:05,060
None of them use birth control.
And they eat all the steak.

1833
02:29:05,228 --> 02:29:09,565
I mean, they don't even
know what it is to be a fan.

1834
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:14,862
To truly love some silly
little piece of music

1835
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:18,782
or some band so much

1836
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,868
that it hurts.

1837
02:29:27,334 --> 02:29:31,378
Hello, Penny?
It's Russell. Don't hang up.

1838
02:29:31,546 --> 02:29:34,798
I can't really talk right now.
I'm in a room full of people.

1839
02:29:43,224 --> 02:29:47,061
Actually, I'm alone.

1840
02:29:47,228 --> 02:29:49,021
And I won't call again. I promise.

1841
02:29:49,189 --> 02:29:52,900
<i>But I need to see you face to face,</i>

1842
02:29:53,068 --> 02:29:57,071
<i>because I'm never as good</i>
<i>as when you're there.</i>

1843
02:29:57,238 --> 02:30:00,991
<i>And I can see myself</i>
<i>the way you look at me.</i>

1844
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,911
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1845
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:07,081
<i>If we could just get together</i>
<i>and find some time to talk...</i>

1846
02:30:12,337 --> 02:30:14,546
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1847
02:30:18,176 --> 02:30:20,177
<i>Give me your address.</i>

1848
02:30:22,514 --> 02:30:26,892
I'm coming to you this time.

1849
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,950
<i>Got a pen?</i>

1850
02:30:59,801 --> 02:31:03,303
Hello, Penny. Hello, Penny.

1851
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:05,639
Hello, hello, Penny.

1852
02:31:16,901 --> 02:31:19,570
I'm... I'm Russell Hammond.

1853
02:31:20,655 --> 02:31:24,825
So this is the famous
Russell Hammond.

1854
02:31:30,665 --> 02:31:32,708
Come in.

1855
02:31:37,589 --> 02:31:42,009
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1856
02:31:49,142 --> 02:31:51,393
- Where am I?
- Hello?

1857
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:53,687
Hi.

1858
02:31:53,855 --> 02:31:57,524
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1859
02:32:20,673 --> 02:32:23,050
Oh, man.

1860
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:33,435
My son is very important to me, too.

1861
02:32:33,603 --> 02:32:36,188
And I do think you owe him an apology.

1862
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:39,107
I appreciate you showing up.

1863
02:32:39,275 --> 02:32:42,569
No, no. I agree, ma'am.

1864
02:32:45,281 --> 02:32:48,617
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

1865
02:33:03,633 --> 02:33:05,592
Well.

1866
02:33:10,974 --> 02:33:12,140
Hi.

1867
02:33:13,476 --> 02:33:15,060
So, this is...

1868
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:18,981
...where The Enemy sleeps.

1869
02:33:25,321 --> 02:33:28,782
You know, I think we both
wanted to be with her.

1870
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:36,081
And she wanted us to be together.

1871
02:33:51,306 --> 02:33:53,390
You should give her a call.

1872
02:33:54,058 --> 02:33:55,976
You both live in the same city.

1873
02:34:01,107 --> 02:34:03,609
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1874
02:34:06,779 --> 02:34:08,530
That girl really cares about you.

1875
02:34:11,451 --> 02:34:14,161
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1876
02:34:20,877 --> 02:34:24,504
Oh, I called your magazine,

1877
02:34:24,672 --> 02:34:27,257
and told them the truth.

1878
02:34:29,344 --> 02:34:30,302
I don't know what
they're gonna do with it,

1879
02:34:30,470 --> 02:34:33,305
but I told them every word
you wrote was true.

1880
02:34:40,688 --> 02:34:44,691
We are gonna do this one more time.

1881
02:34:56,788 --> 02:34:57,871
So, Russell...

1882
02:35:00,875 --> 02:35:03,335
...what do you love about music?

1883
02:35:13,638 --> 02:35:15,389
To begin with,

1884
02:35:16,808 --> 02:35:18,475
everything.

1885
02:35:26,526 --> 02:35:29,236
- Tickets, tickets, tickets.
- How much?

1886
02:35:45,253 --> 02:35:47,504
Morocco.
A seat by the window, please.
