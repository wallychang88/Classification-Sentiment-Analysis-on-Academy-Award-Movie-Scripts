1
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:21,591
I want to go over to my place
and start, you know, getting it on,

2
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,218
'cause I'm just tired of this all.

3
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,888
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Yeah.

4
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,140
Did you ever take ballet?

5
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,351
Weak ankles.
Do you have a quarter for them?

6
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:35,396
Yes, I do.

7
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,254
Well, what about me?

8
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:02,674
You'll see.

9
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,592
A lot of fun you are.

10
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:09,055
You're supposed to tease me,
give me hints, make me guess, you know.

11
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,948
Oh, look. That's terrible.

12
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,825
He's not hurting anyone.

13
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,871
Neither are we.

14
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,499
Oh, God.

15
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:42,046
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.

16
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,424
What do you think?

17
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:48,636
I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

18
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,722
Really, I do.

19
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,058
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,

20
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,978
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

21
00:05:57,062 --> 00:06:00,315
And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,

22
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:04,611
and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?

23
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,905
Anyway, that's what I always think.

24
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,366
How's he doing up there?

25
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:12,952
I always think how,
when they had the newspaper strike...

26
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,495
We're getting better than 40%.

27
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,332
How about the second position?

28
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,630
It's not so good.

29
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,399
What have we here?

30
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,402
Okay, come on, you little babies,
now, wet your lips there.

31
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:50,198
All right, give me some tongue.
Just give me a little tongue there.

32
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:51,532
Come on.

33
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,078
Come on, just a little tongue outside.

34
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:56,746
Nice, wet French kiss now.

35
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,581
Come on, a nice wet one there.

36
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,459
Come on, come on.
Pay attention to your recordings.

37
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,047
She's coming in loud and clear.

38
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,548
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

39
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:09,884
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?

40
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,179
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.

41
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,598
Well, that's it for Paul. They spotted him.

42
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:17,809
Give me the phones.

43
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:20,895
He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.

44
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,564
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

45
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,360
We're spending too much time
together here.

46
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:29,737
No. Let's stay just a little longer.

47
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,178
I got burned, Harry.

48
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,304
- Yeah.
- She looked at me.

49
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,515
Yeah, yeah, I know. We heard.

50
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,183
Oh, did we hear.

51
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,436
What do you think?

52
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:04,105
I got some good pieces, maybe 25%.

53
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,314
Oh, yeah?

54
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,489
Listen, Paul, I'll call you in a couple of days
if I need you again, okay?

55
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:16,993
Hey, Paul, you going
to the convention tomorrow?

56
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,286
You bet.

57
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:19,662
Hey, how about you, Harry?

58
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,164
Yeah. Maybe.

59
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:24,041
Little party like we did two years ago, huh?

60
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,334
Hey, Stan?

61
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,379
- I'll see.
- Okay.

62
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,630
Here.

63
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:39,098
He's a nice guy for a cop.

64
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:41,309
You go.

65
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,811
I'll stay here a while.

66
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,813
Who's interested in these two anyway?

67
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,107
I don't know for sure.

68
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,611
- The Justice Department?
- No.

69
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,905
I figure it must be the Infernal Revenue.

70
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,449
Their tapes always put me to sleep.

71
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,161
Since when are you here
to be entertained? Here.

72
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:02,955
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

73
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,333
I don't care what they're talking about.

74
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,544
All I want is a nice, fat recording.

75
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,403
Hello, Mr. Caul.

76
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:17,822
And happy birthday!

77
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,116
Happy birthday, Harry.

78
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,121
Happy birthday.

79
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:42,949
Hello.

80
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:45,910
Hello, Miss Evangelista?

81
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,371
Yes. This is Harry Caul from upstairs.

82
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,334
Yes. Well...

83
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:56,003
Thank you very much. Thank you.

84
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:00,508
Yes, well, you're really very nice.

85
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,218
Yes.

86
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:04,220
But...

87
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,805
I know...

88
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,516
Yes, I found it. Yes.

89
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,354
But what I wanted to talk to you about was,
how did you put it in the apartment?

90
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,235
Right.

91
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,363
Well, what about the alarm?

92
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,992
Oh, you did?

93
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:33,332
Well, yes, I thought I had the only key.

94
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,589
Well, what emergency could possibly...

95
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,467
All right. Yes.

96
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:48,431
Well, see, I would be perfectly happy
to have all my personal things

97
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:51,892
burned up in a fire
because I don't have anything personal.

98
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:53,602
Nothing of value.

99
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:57,064
No. Nothing personal except my keys,
you see.

100
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,069
Yes. Which I really would like
to have the only copy of, Miss Evangelista.

101
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:06,866
Miss Evangelista, how'd you know
it was my birthday?

102
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:11,495
Nah. I don't remember telling you.

103
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,749
Would you like to take a guess
how old I am?

104
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,251
Forty-four. Well, that's a very good guess.

105
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:22,673
Miss Evangelista, as of today,
my mail will go to a post office box

106
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:26,135
with a combination on it and no keys.

107
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:29,305
Good-bye.

108
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,510
Hey, Harry.

109
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:51,095
Morning.

110
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:52,847
Hey, man, there's an article in here
about the convention.

111
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,640
- It mentions your name.
- Oh, yeah?

112
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,892
Yeah. You're one of the notables
who's going tomorrow night,

113
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:57,977
did you know that?

114
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,979
Yeah. I told them I'd be there.

115
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,856
Listen to this here.

116
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,151
Listen.

117
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:08,487
"Among those pre-eminent in the field
expected to attend

118
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,533
"are Hal Lipsett and Harry Caul
from San Francisco.

119
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,079
"Kenneth Sperry will speak
on Surveillance and The Law."

120
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:20,040
Wait a minute. Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?

121
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:25,212
"Also attending will be
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan."

122
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,465
Since when did
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan

123
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,092
become pre-eminent in the field?

124
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,219
Oh, he's very big there.

125
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,096
You want some coffee?

126
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,562
He's the guy that told Chrysler
that Cadillac was getting rid of its fins.

127
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:46,567
It was a while ago,
but it was a big thing at the time.

128
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,750
December 2nd, 1:00 p.m.
Shopping bag, Unit A.

129
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:13,928
December 2nd, 1:00 p.m. Parabolic, Unit B.

130
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:26,106
December 2nd, 1:00 p.m.
City of Paris, Unit C.

131
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,222
What do you think?

132
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,225
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

133
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,685
He's already got everything.

134
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,770
He doesn't need anything anymore.

135
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:09,400
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

136
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,952
...get him for Christmas yet.

137
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,745
He's already got everything.

138
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,831
He doesn't need anything anymore.

139
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:28,502
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

140
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:30,921
Well, you better start looking.

141
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,048
Well, what about me?

142
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:36,260
You'll see.

143
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:38,637
A lot of fun you are.

144
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:42,516
You're supposed to tease me,
give me hints, make me guess, you know.

145
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,395
Does it bother you?

146
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,939
- What?
- Walking around in circles.

147
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,611
Oh, look. That's terrible.

148
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,739
He's not hurting anyone.

149
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,240
Neither are we.

150
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,538
Oh, God.

151
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:08,208
Every time I see one of those old guys...

152
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:21,680
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.

153
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,807
What do you think?

154
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:27,770
I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

155
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,272
No, really, I do.

156
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:33,901
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,

157
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:36,445
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

158
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,240
And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,

159
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,952
and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?

160
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,081
Anyway, that's what I always think.

161
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,835
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike in New York,

162
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,921
more of those old guys died.

163
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,633
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.

164
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:38,257
Good afternoon. May I help you?

165
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,968
Yes. Extension 746, please.

166
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:43,095
One moment, please.

167
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,223
Director's office.

168
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,350
Yes, this is Mr. Caul.

169
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,021
I have the material
and I'm calling for an appointment.

170
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,942
I'm sorry. The director has
already left for the day.

171
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,318
We'll call you back tomorrow morning.

172
00:19:58,403 --> 00:19:59,695
May I have your telephone number, please?

173
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:04,741
No, I'm at a pay phone,
and I don't have a home telephone.

174
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:08,412
Hold on one moment, please.

175
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,003
- Mr. Caul?
- Yes?

176
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:18,380
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.

177
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:21,133
2:30 in the afternoon?
Is that payment in full?

178
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,136
Whatever was arranged.

179
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,890
Thank you very much. I'll be there.

180
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,595
- Harry?
- Hello, Amy.

181
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:51,098
I didn't think you were coming.

182
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,480
I brought some wine

183
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,276
someone gave me as a birthday present.

184
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,947
I didn't know it was your birthday.

185
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,616
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.

186
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,410
I do.

187
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,423
How old are you, Harry?

188
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,217
Forty-two.

189
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:32,639
Sweet.

190
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:40,731
Does something special happen between us
on your birthday?

191
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,649
Like what?

192
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,693
Something personal.

193
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,031
Like what?

194
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:54,036
Like telling me about yourself, your secrets.

195
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:14,139
I don't have any secrets.

196
00:23:17,685 --> 00:23:19,269
I'm your secret.

197
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:22,981
You do have secrets, Harry. I know you do.

198
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:24,232
No.

199
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,986
Sometimes you come over here,
and you don't tell me.

200
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:32,991
Once I saw you up by the staircase, hiding,

201
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,368
watching,

202
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,286
for a whole hour.

203
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,503
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

204
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:49,049
You know? I know. A woman can always tell.

205
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,012
You have a certain way
of opening up the door.

206
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:59,726
You know, first the key goes in real quiet,

207
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:02,437
and then the door comes open real fast,

208
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:05,607
just like you think
you're gonna catch me at something.

209
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:21,498
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me

210
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,875
when I'm talking on the telephone.

211
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:26,920
What are you talking about?

212
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,965
I don't know. I just feel it.

213
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:32,259
Really, I do.

214
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,027
Why are you singing that?

215
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,239
It's pretty.

216
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:03,790
What's the matter?

217
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,292
Nothing.

218
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:08,044
It's just that

219
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,965
somebody else was singing that today.

220
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,633
- A girl?
- Yes.

221
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,303
- Who is she?
- No, no. It isn't...

222
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:17,804
- I'm jealous.
- No.

223
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:20,849
Just somebody at work, and she...

224
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:26,021
She reminded me of you.

225
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:34,237
Where do you work, Harry?

226
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:37,616
Oh, different places, different

227
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,910
jobs, you know?

228
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:44,206
I'm kind of a musician, you see.

229
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,295
Freelance musician and...

230
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,219
Where do you live?

231
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,054
I mean, why can't I call you over there?

232
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,724
'Cause I don't have a telephone.

233
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,270
Do you live alone?

234
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:15,654
Why are you asking me all these questions?

235
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,532
Because it's your birthday.

236
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:25,705
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

237
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,416
I want to know you.

238
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,047
Yes, I live alone.

239
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,221
I don't feel like answering
any more questions.

240
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:50,772
Your rent is due.

241
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:54,276
Here's the money for it.

242
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,891
You never used to ask a lot of questions.

243
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,603
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

244
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,108
When I heard you open up the door,
my toes were dancing under the covers.

245
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:40,822
But I don't think
I'm going to wait for you anymore.

246
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,608
- I have a package for the director.
- All right. I'll take it.

247
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:01,778
No. I'm supposed to
hand it to him personally.

248
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,072
I have an appointment.

249
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,283
- Are you Mr. Caul?
- Yes, I am.

250
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:10,620
A Mr. Caul is here. All right.
Make yourself comfortable.

251
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:13,373
The director's assistant will be right down.

252
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,373
There are some nice Christmas cookies
there I made. You want one?

253
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,584
- They're good.
- No, thanks. I...

254
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:29,074
- What do you see?
- Oh, not much.

255
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:31,701
Here's your money,
$15,000 cash, as you asked.

256
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:32,744
And these are our tapes?

257
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:34,621
I had an arrangement with the director.

258
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:38,708
I was to give those to him,
you see, personally.

259
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:42,504
I understand.
But he's not here this afternoon.

260
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,713
As a matter of fact, he's out of the country.

261
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,175
And he asked me to get the tapes from you
and give you the money.

262
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:11,908
I guess I can just wait on this.

263
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:21,793
Now, look,
don't get involved in this, Mr. Caul.

264
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:24,838
Those tapes are dangerous.

265
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:27,423
You heard them. You know what I mean.

266
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,051
Someone may get hurt.

267
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,063
Mr. Caul, be careful.

268
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:39,639
Well, what about me?

269
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:41,307
You'll see.

270
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:43,768
A lot of fun you are.

271
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,201
Who started this conversation anyhow?

272
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:03,997
You did.

273
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:05,581
I did not.

274
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,501
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.

275
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,051
Pretend like I just told you a joke.

276
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,766
Does it bother you?

277
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:26,227
- What?
- Walking around in circles.

278
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,023
Oh, look. That's terrible.

279
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,067
He's not hurting anyone.

280
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:34,736
Neither are we.

281
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,323
Oh, God.

282
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:44,037
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.

283
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:46,873
What do you think?

284
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,291
Yeah, what do you think?

285
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:51,336
I always think that he was once some...

286
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,300
Hey, Harry,
what do you say we take a break?

287
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,303
Come on. We'll go to Al's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer, huh?

288
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:02,680
- How about that?
- No. I want to finish this.

289
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,515
I thought you turned those tapes in.

290
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,142
Stan, be quiet, will you?

291
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:07,560
All right, all right.

292
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:12,398
Do you think we can do this?

293
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,985
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

294
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,112
What a stupid conversation.

295
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,655
Stan, please. I'm trying to work.

296
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,908
I'm tired of mostly everything.

297
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,159
Tired of me?

298
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:26,079
Tired of you, but not today.

299
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,541
What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sake?

300
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,753
Stanley, please, I'm trying to get this done.

301
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,171
All right. Don't get excited.

302
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:36,881
Well, I'm getting fed up.

303
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:40,176
About what?

304
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,512
About your asking me questions
all day long.

305
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,223
Jesus.

306
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,058
Don't say that.

307
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:48,976
Well, for Christ's sake...

308
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:51,521
Stan, don't say that again, please.

309
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:54,524
Don't use that word in vain. It bothers me.

310
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:57,902
What's the matter, Harry?

311
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:01,906
Your work's getting sloppy.

312
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:08,621
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.

313
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,332
Sunday, definitely.

314
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:16,462
We'd have a much better track
if you'd paid more attention to the recording

315
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:18,840
and less attention to
what they were talking about.

316
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:21,509
I can't see why a couple of questions
about what the hell is going on

317
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:22,760
can get you so out ofjoint.

318
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:26,305
'Cause I can't sit here and explain
the personal problems of my clients.

319
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,771
Jack Tar Hotel.

320
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:37,066
3:00.

321
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:39,652
Room 773.

322
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,154
It wouldn't hurt if you filled me in a little bit

323
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:42,405
once in a while. Did you ever think of that?

324
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:45,074
It has nothing to do with me,
and even less to do with you.

325
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,995
It's curiosity. Did you ever hear of that?
It's just goddamn human nature.

326
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:54,917
Listen, if there's one sure-fire rule
that I have learned in this business is that

327
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:56,419
I don't know anything about human nature.

328
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,254
I don't know anything about curiosity.

329
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:00,590
That's not part of what I do. What I...

330
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,758
This is my business, and when I'm...

331
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,353
I'll see you later.

332
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:33,873
I think he's been recording my telephone.

333
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,922
I love you.

334
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:44,091
We're spending too much time
together here.

335
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,135
No. Let's stay just a little longer.

336
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:04,820
I think he's been recording my telephone.

337
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:51,510
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

338
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:42,561
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

339
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:49,694
It's been three months
since my last confession.

340
00:40:50,946 --> 00:40:52,029
I...

341
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,786
These are my sins.

342
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:03,916
I've taken the Lord's name in vain

343
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,669
on several occasions.

344
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,631
I...

345
00:41:15,262 --> 00:41:17,513
On a number of occasions,
I've taken newspapers from the racks

346
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:19,557
without paying for them.

347
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,642
I...

348
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:30,609
...have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts,

349
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,611
and

350
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:36,490
I've been involved in some work

351
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:40,578
that I think will be used
to hurt these two young people.

352
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:43,497
It's happened to me before.

353
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:47,042
People were hurt because of my work.

354
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:48,627
I'm afraid it could happen again,

355
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,548
and I was in no way responsible.

356
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:54,383
I'm not responsible.

357
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:59,096
For these and all my sins of my past life,
I am heartily sorry.

358
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:12,777
Hi. Can I help you?

359
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:17,114
- Well, you could explain your system to me.
- Okay, Mr. Caul, I'm Jim Storey.

360
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,867
- How do you do?
- Come in and take a look here

361
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,494
at the system.

362
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,581
This is for the surveillance
of telephone communication systems.

363
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:26,749
I see.

364
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:27,917
...now available.

365
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,127
Here's the new LT 500.

366
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:34,799
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

367
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,551
You can hear your sounds here

368
00:42:37,636 --> 00:42:40,095
and know exactly
which door has been violated.

369
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,222
I see.

370
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:43,098
And you got your local alarms on the doors,

371
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:44,558
which I'm sure you've heard.

372
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:46,018
It's quite noisy.

373
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:48,312
It has a Super 8mm camera in here,

374
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:50,606
and the dot right here, the 10:00 dot,

375
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,692
will show exactly
what the camera sees on the back.

376
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,528
It's a magazine-loaded camera,

377
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:57,363
Super 8mm...

378
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:02,076
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan,

379
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,161
house courtesy telephone, please.

380
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:10,584
That's your automatic recorder actuator.

381
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:14,797
It undetectably starts the recorder
when the phone is lifted

382
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:18,050
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

383
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,886
- What?
- It's real nice, you know.

384
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:23,973
It's not your old-fashioned voice actuator,

385
00:43:24,057 --> 00:43:27,142
you know, always starting the recorder
when nobody was talking

386
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:30,980
or shutting it off in the middle
of an important conversation.

387
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:33,023
Is it anything like the Moran actuator?

388
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:36,193
The Moran E-27 is a copy.

389
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:39,196
I won't let him even smell
my equipment anymore.

390
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:41,198
- You in surveillance?
- Yeah.

391
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:43,534
Law enforcement or private operator?

392
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:44,827
Private.

393
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:47,913
You mind if I take your name
and address for our mailing list?

394
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,458
Harry... Harry Caul?

395
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:53,002
I didn't recognize you.

396
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:56,672
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

397
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,549
Free of charge. Just to test it.

398
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:01,719
You know, say, in return for
that we can print in our flier

399
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:02,845
that you use it.

400
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:04,722
I build all my own equipment. Thank you.

401
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:07,766
Maybe we could take a picture
of you holding it?

402
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:09,935
Or take a picture of you
in front of our booth?

403
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,021
It would be a great honor for Spectre.

404
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,652
This is not helping crime.

405
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:00,861
It's helping justice.

406
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:19,254
...that may be affixed to
the subject's automobile...

407
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:20,506
Slide.

408
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:23,384
...and will transmit a pulsating tone signal...

409
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,551
Slide.

410
00:45:24,636 --> 00:45:25,594
...which is highly detectable...

411
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,596
Harry, good to see you.

412
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:31,517
- Beautiful suit.
- You like it? It's French.

413
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,601
Oh.

414
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:35,187
Let's go get a drink and talk.

415
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:38,273
Requiring no knowledge
or skill in electronics.

416
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,359
Come on, it's a bore.

417
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:49,201
The TA-30 may be installed and concealed
under the dash in a matter of seconds.

418
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:53,080
Hey, come on, there's somebody
over here I want you to meet,

419
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:54,289
a competitor of yours.

420
00:45:54,374 --> 00:45:56,750
- Hey, Bernie, old buddy.
- Yeah, Paulie, what's up?

421
00:45:57,585 --> 00:46:00,671
This is Harry Caul. William P. Moran.

422
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:02,631
Harry Caul, my pleasure.

423
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:05,175
My friends call me Bernie.
I heard a lot about you, Harry.

424
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,803
- Thank you.
- Bernie just moved in from Detroit.

425
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:11,807
He's the fellow that let Chrysler know
that Cadillac was discontinuing its fins.

426
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:13,267
That's right. I heard.

427
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:16,979
Harry Caul, you're a tough man
to get a hold of.

428
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:19,148
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a long time.

429
00:46:19,232 --> 00:46:20,941
Hey, can you take five? We'll get a drink.

430
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:22,651
Yeah. Maybe in a couple of...

431
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:26,030
Honey... Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

432
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:29,241
I'd appreciate it if you stuck around
for the demonstration, Harry.

433
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:35,873
Ladies and gentlemen.

434
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:41,170
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here
is the Moran S-15 harmonica tap.

435
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:45,758
This electronic marvel can be installed
in a matter of two minutes.

436
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:49,636
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source,

437
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:51,764
so it cannot be detected on the line.

438
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:55,684
Once installed, it can be phoned
from any telephone in the world,

439
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,437
Singapore, Karāchi, even Moscow.

440
00:46:58,605 --> 00:47:01,982
I say Moscow 'cause you look
a little Russian there, sir, with the beard.

441
00:47:02,525 --> 00:47:04,610
You just dial the target's phone number,

442
00:47:04,986 --> 00:47:06,945
pause before the last digit,

443
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,698
blow the harmonica tone into the phone,

444
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,742
press the last digit.

445
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:15,079
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

446
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:19,041
Instead, the receiver will be turned
into an actual room microphone,

447
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,835
thus enabling surveillance to take place.

448
00:47:22,337 --> 00:47:25,798
And now, by way of
an actual demonstration,

449
00:47:25,882 --> 00:47:28,467
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

450
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,427
I will now dial that number.

451
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:32,971
Thank you.

452
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,646
I pause before the last digit.

453
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,024
Harmonica.

454
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:49,905
I dial the last digit.

455
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:56,328
You will note the phone does not ring.

456
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:58,080
Can we get away?

457
00:47:58,164 --> 00:48:00,499
I don't know. Maybe I can.

458
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:02,167
Where's your husband?

459
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,878
He's out at a convention.

460
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,757
When will he be back?

461
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:10,384
Not until late.

462
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:13,262
April fool! Just a little joke, folks.

463
00:48:13,346 --> 00:48:15,013
- That shows you the possibilities...
- Larry Peterson...

464
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:17,432
...of the Moran S-15.
- Larry Peterson Burns.

465
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:19,768
Thank you.
The demonstration is concluded.

466
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:22,354
I'd like you to take a little literature with you
on your way.

467
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,399
Well, what did you think of that?
How did you like it?

468
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:26,608
It's a good item.

469
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:28,443
It's good for the catalogue suckers, huh?

470
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:30,988
Here you go, Harry. Have a free pen.

471
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:32,197
You, too, Paulie.

472
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:34,116
- I'd rather have a free drink.
- Hey, me, too.

473
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:39,163
Stanley! Stanley, do me a favor, huh?

474
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,290
Come on. Mind the booth, all right?

475
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:42,833
Come on. That's what I pay you for.

476
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:44,918
Just a couple of minutes.
I just wanna get a drink, all right?

477
00:48:45,003 --> 00:48:46,336
Hi, Harry.

478
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,256
Hi, Stan.

479
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:52,342
That's right.
You two used to work together, huh?

480
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,389
You see that son of a bitch sitting there?
He stole my latest idea...

481
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,807
A lot of nice ladies around here tonight.

482
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,934
Say, how about that pastry in the yellow?
She come across?

483
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,687
Come on. Forget it. She's a part-time nun.
We'll get supper...

484
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:05,689
Hey, Harry, where you going?

485
00:49:06,065 --> 00:49:08,483
You guys go on without me.
I'm going to talk to Stan.

486
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:10,194
We'll meet you later
at the chrome-dome exhibit.

487
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:12,112
Don't be long, huh, Harry. Come on.

488
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,210
Since when are
you working for Moran, Stanley?

489
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:31,215
Since yesterday.

490
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,509
Listen, that wasn't serious.

491
00:49:34,594 --> 00:49:36,178
That was just a stupid argument.

492
00:49:36,262 --> 00:49:37,471
That wasn't it, Harry. It's just that

493
00:49:37,555 --> 00:49:38,972
I figured it was time I move up, that's all.

494
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:40,599
No... Stan,

495
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,477
I don't want you telling him
about any of my things.

496
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:44,561
It's not ethical.

497
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:46,355
There's not all that much
you ever let me in on, Harry.

498
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,522
Maybe that's the problem.

499
00:49:47,607 --> 00:49:50,943
Okay. All right. I'll bring you along faster.
I'll show you some of the stuff.

500
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:52,361
You won't show me anything.

501
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:55,197
You'll keep it all to yourself.
You know damn well you will.

502
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:57,783
No, really, Stan, wait a while.

503
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:00,244
Will you think about it?

504
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:03,747
Don't do this to me now.

505
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:08,835
Some guy's following me.

506
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,046
Who?

507
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:12,881
I don't know.

508
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:15,342
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

509
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:18,971
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

510
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:23,141
Okay, all right.

511
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:25,936
Okay. Thanks, Stan.

512
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,858
This is junk.

513
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:59,386
I'm sorry, but you have reached
a disconnected number.

514
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,096
Will you please make sure you...

515
00:51:10,189 --> 00:51:11,273
Information.

516
00:51:11,357 --> 00:51:13,608
The number for Amy Fredericks, please.

517
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,485
It's a new listing.

518
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,321
One moment, please.

519
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,619
Sir, I see no listing for an Amy Fredericks.

520
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:27,331
Thank you.

521
00:51:51,898 --> 00:51:53,398
What are you doing here?

522
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:55,400
Take it easy. I'm just a messenger.

523
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:57,569
I brought you a drink.

524
00:51:57,653 --> 00:51:59,821
I don't want your drink.
Why are you following me?

525
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,824
I'm not following you. I'm looking for you.

526
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:03,909
There's a big difference.

527
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:05,827
How did you know I was here?

528
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:07,954
It's a convention of wire-tappers, isn't it?

529
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,666
Oh, excuse me,
surveillance and security technicians.

530
00:52:12,335 --> 00:52:13,460
It was a snap.

531
00:52:13,544 --> 00:52:16,338
Look, I'm telling you, I'm not giving
those tapes to anybody but the director.

532
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:18,590
Yeah, I know what you told me, Mr. Caul.

533
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:20,967
All right, what's the message?

534
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:23,470
We want you to deliver the tapes
on Sunday, 1:00.

535
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:25,055
The director will be there.

536
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:27,766
He'll accept the tapes from you, in person.

537
00:52:28,142 --> 00:52:29,559
You tell him I'll think about it.

538
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:49,413
- Hey, Paulie!
- Come on! Come on, let's go!

539
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:52,541
Lurleen and Millard, get in the back there.

540
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:53,667
And, Stanley, get in front!

541
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,128
Hey, come on, Harry.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

542
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:58,380
Come on. I'm trying to dress up for the bar.

543
00:52:59,215 --> 00:53:01,633
Hey, Bernie, it's a come-as-you-are party.

544
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:05,053
Hey, no, no! Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

545
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,889
I think you take a right
somewhere around here.

546
00:53:09,851 --> 00:53:11,518
Sons of bitches! Those smartasses!

547
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:13,103
Who the hell do they think
they're tangling with?

548
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:14,938
All right! Easy, easy!
Come on. We're going to have a party.

549
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:16,314
He could drive, man.

550
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,737
Millard, make them stop.

551
00:53:22,822 --> 00:53:25,282
Relax, honey.
Paul's the best tail man in the country.

552
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:27,659
Hey, Meredith, do you hear that?

553
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:36,376
Headquarters 111,
I'm driving east on Lombard.

554
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:41,756
I'd like a rolling 10-28 on California 5-6-0,

555
00:53:43,217 --> 00:53:45,302
Boy Adam Lincoln.

556
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,929
What are you calling for a 10-28 for?

557
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:49,931
Thanks.

558
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,980
Hey, Willie Sanchez, 565414th Street,

559
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:01,026
162 pounds, 5'10" and a half shithead!

560
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,867
You cheated!

561
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:12,954
Oh, man...

562
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:16,583
Want me to pick that lock for you, Harry?

563
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,046
- This'll be the bar.
- It's freezing in here.

564
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,591
Oh, boy, Harry. Okay.

565
00:54:24,717 --> 00:54:27,677
- All right, the bar is now open.
- Thank you, thank you.

566
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:29,137
- Stanley.
- Yes, sir.

567
00:54:29,222 --> 00:54:31,723
- How about a little music?
- The man wants a little music.

568
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:34,017
Harry, you got a nice shop here.

569
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:51,618
You know, I was rereading

570
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:55,539
DearAbby the other night, and there was
this article, a letter from a fella

571
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:57,374
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

572
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:01,461
I think it was Harry. Hey.

573
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:08,009
Where's the club soda?
We got any club soda?

574
00:55:08,094 --> 00:55:10,011
Let me tell you something about Harry Caul.

575
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:12,180
There you go.

576
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:15,475
I know you heard this a thousand times,
Harry, but let me say it again.

577
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:20,355
Here's to Harry, the best, bar none.
I'll drink to that.

578
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:21,439
The best what?

579
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:26,069
The best bugger on the West Coast.

580
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:27,696
And who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

581
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,031
Me. I'll drink to that, too.

582
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:33,451
I'll bet you will.

583
00:55:38,165 --> 00:55:41,293
It's really funny we never bumped into
each other in New York, Harry.

584
00:55:41,377 --> 00:55:42,627
Why is that funny?

585
00:55:42,712 --> 00:55:45,297
I don't know, we work in the same business,
the same city.

586
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:47,591
I figure we'd bump into each other.

587
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,593
I didn't know
you came from New York, Harry.

588
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:50,885
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

589
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,971
Harry's famous in New York.

590
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:55,390
You know, the only one
I couldn't figure out though, Harry?

591
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:56,474
One what?

592
00:55:57,643 --> 00:55:59,811
The welfare fund back in '68.

593
00:56:00,605 --> 00:56:03,565
- How did you know about that?
- Everybody in the biz knew about it.

594
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:05,567
But nobody knows
how you did it though, Harry.

595
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,323
- How did you do it, Harry?
- Harry.

596
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:15,410
Ten cents a dance. Come on.

597
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
You all right?

598
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:25,837
- You hurt yourself?
- No. Don't worry about my head.

599
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:28,590
It happens all the time.

600
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,550
In fact, when I was a little baby,

601
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:32,802
I used to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

602
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,429
No, really. I did.

603
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:37,682
Sometimes I still feel like doing it
'cause it's comforting.

604
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:40,393
I tapped my first telephone
when I was 12 years old, Harry.

605
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:43,647
I mean, that's a fact. 12 years old.

606
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:47,525
It was a hallway payphone right
in the tenement, right where I lived.

607
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,487
Everybody in the building. For six months,
they didn't know who it was.

608
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:55,241
My father, he was proud as hell.
He was beaming.

609
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:59,788
Yeah, boy.
"That Bernie's got a real brain," he said.

610
00:56:59,872 --> 00:57:01,456
From then on, it's been all uphill, Harry.

611
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:05,627
I got contacts now you wouldn't believe.

612
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:08,296
Here. Well, bring them over.

613
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:13,385
Take a cab over.

614
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:15,178
Nothing's sacred with you, is it, Harry?

615
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:18,515
Sure. The more, the merrier.
We'll be here all night.

616
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,767
Feel like I'm back in grammar.

617
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:23,812
- Oh, you son of a...
- What?

618
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:27,607
All right, what's the matter, Harry?
Can't you take a vacation?

619
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:30,860
You guys are amateurs, you know that?

620
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,737
When are you gonna get
a new scrambler, Harry?

621
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:34,656
This one went out with the Trojan War.

622
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,367
Harry, come on. I want to hear all about you.

623
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:41,079
- Where you from?
- Really obsolete, you know that, Harry?

624
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:44,624
- Harry got himself a girlfriend.
- Watch out, Harry.

625
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:49,254
- Where are you from?
- New York.

626
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:51,339
I used to live in New York.

627
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:56,761
Yes. First, I worked as a receptionist,
and then I got promoted to secretary.

628
00:57:56,846 --> 00:58:00,181
And then I was promoted to gal Friday,

629
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,852
and special assistant to the boss,
and then I married him.

630
00:58:23,581 --> 00:58:25,331
Do you live far from here?

631
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:33,882
Harry?

632
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,426
Are you still married?

633
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:40,597
Oh, I don't know. Probably.

634
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:44,559
I guess maybe I am.

635
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:47,437
Last time I heard, he was...

636
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:50,440
Well, he was trying
to scrape up enough money

637
00:58:50,524 --> 00:58:53,902
- to buy another hardware store.
- Yeah.

638
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:58,573
And I ended up
out here in San Francisco, unemployed,

639
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:02,494
which is the entire story of my life
up until tonight.

640
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:18,676
Here's to you.

641
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,016
You don't like me very much, do you?
You don't want to talk to me or anything.

642
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,851
I didn't say that.

643
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:43,284
Something is on your mind.
I wish you'd tell me.

644
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:45,954
I really do. I wish that...

645
00:59:46,038 --> 00:59:49,541
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me

646
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,751
and that we could be friends.

647
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:54,754
I mean, aside from all of this junk.

648
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:19,195
Would you...

649
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,283
If you were a girl
who'd waited for someone...

650
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:34,669
You can trust me.

651
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:43,595
Well, you never really knew
when he was going to come to see you.

652
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:49,350
You just lived in a room alone,
and you knew nothing about him.

653
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:52,186
And if you loved him,
you were patient with him,

654
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:58,818
and even though he didn't dare ever
tell you anything about himself personally,

655
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:04,616
even though he may have loved you,
would you...

656
01:01:06,118 --> 01:01:08,494
- Would I what?
- Would you...

657
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:14,542
Would you go back to him?

658
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:24,093
Well, how would I know?
How would I know that he loved me?

659
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:35,146
You'd have no way of knowing.

660
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:48,785
Hey, Harry!

661
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:52,121
Did you hear the one about
the broad who busted Vegas?

662
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:54,791
She wore a see-through blouse.

663
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:55,560
You know something, Harry?

664
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:58,938
Twelve years ago,
I recorded every telephone call

665
01:02:59,023 --> 01:03:02,316
made by the presidential nominee
of a major political party.

666
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,318
I don't want to say which party.

667
01:03:04,403 --> 01:03:08,364
But everywhere he went, that's where I was.
Coast to coast, I was listening, Harry.

668
01:03:09,116 --> 01:03:12,785
I'm not saying I elected
the President of the United States, but

669
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:15,288
you can draw your own conclusions, Harry.

670
01:03:15,956 --> 01:03:18,750
- I mean, he lost.
- Harry,

671
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:22,003
tell them about the time
you put the bug in the parakeet.

672
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,506
- Parakeet?
- No kidding.

673
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:29,343
Harry one time actually put a microphone
in a little parakeet.

674
01:03:29,428 --> 01:03:30,928
Is that right?

675
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,641
Parakeets don't happen to be
my thing, Harry,

676
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:39,270
but I sure would like to know
how you did the teamster local back in '68.

677
01:03:39,396 --> 01:03:40,521
What was that?

678
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:43,941
- Don't you get papers in Chicago, Millard?
- Probably out on strike.

679
01:03:44,026 --> 01:03:46,319
It was all over the front pages.

680
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:49,864
Harry was working
for the attorney general's office at the time.

681
01:03:49,948 --> 01:03:52,158
You didn't know I knew that, did you, Harry?

682
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,660
Anyway, the president of this teamster local
back east

683
01:03:54,745 --> 01:03:58,206
set up a phony welfare fund, right?

684
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:02,835
I mean, you correct me on the details, Harry.
I may be a little fuzzy on them.

685
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,796
There was only two people
that seemed to know about it,

686
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,672
the president and his accountant.

687
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:09,634
They only talked about it
on fishing trips that they went on.

688
01:04:09,718 --> 01:04:13,012
On a private boat.
That was the only place they talked details.

689
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:16,140
And that boat was bug-proof.
I happen to know that for a fact, Harry.

690
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:18,810
They wouldn't even strike up a conversation

691
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:21,854
if there was another boat
even on the horizon.

692
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:25,733
That didn't stop Harry though, did it?
No, he recorded everything.

693
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:29,695
Nobody knows how you did it though,
Harry. Caused a hell of a scandal, too.

694
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,780
Why?

695
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:35,368
Why? No reason.
Three people were murdered, that's all.

696
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:37,745
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it though.

697
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,793
It had nothing to do with me.
I just turned in the tapes.

698
01:04:43,877 --> 01:04:46,170
The president thought
the accountant had talked.

699
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:52,093
- Well, nobody really knows for sure.
- That's right.

700
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:54,428
Three days later,
they found the accountant, his wife and kid,

701
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:57,431
they were all naked and tied up in the house.

702
01:04:57,516 --> 01:05:02,436
Hands and feet tied up with rope,
all the hair on their bodies shaved off.

703
01:05:02,521 --> 01:05:04,605
Their heads were found in different places.

704
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,942
- They killed them?
- No. They gift-wrapped them.

705
01:05:08,026 --> 01:05:11,612
No, no, no. This is ancient history now.
Harry, how did you do it?

706
01:05:11,697 --> 01:05:14,323
What they do with the tapes
is their own business.

707
01:05:14,408 --> 01:05:15,950
That's the first time
I heard about you, Harry.

708
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,744
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

709
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:20,538
It had nothing to do with me.

710
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:24,125
Come on, Harry, show and tell.
How did you do it?

711
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,710
For God's sake, Harry, tell him!

712
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:33,718
- Turn it off, Stan.
- What for?

713
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:36,220
Stan, turn it off!

714
01:05:37,347 --> 01:05:38,389
They ought to hear this, Harry.

715
01:05:38,557 --> 01:05:40,725
It's the best thing you've ever done!

716
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:47,064
What was that, Stan?

717
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:53,529
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

718
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,200
- It'll make history.
- Yeah?

719
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,995
I bet you there's no moment between
human beings that I cannot record,

720
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:03,080
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

721
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:07,501
I could figure out
any of Harry's schemes, right?

722
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:08,836
Come on, come on. Try me.

723
01:06:09,755 --> 01:06:14,008
- Let me give him the assignment, Harry.
- Yeah.

724
01:06:19,765 --> 01:06:22,516
Now, this is a quad in the center of the city.
All right?

725
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:26,395
Now, these are steps coming in here
and benches all around.

726
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,647
It's 12:00 noon,

727
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:28,856
which means that it's lunchtime for

728
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:32,193
all the people that work in
these offices around here.

729
01:06:32,277 --> 01:06:35,279
People are walking, talking, having lunch,
and it's crowded.

730
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:37,573
- Naturally. Come on, Stan.
- Okay.

731
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:38,658
Now, two people

732
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:42,245
are constantly moving in circles,
in and out of the crowd.

733
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:44,288
We don't know
whether they'll sit down or what.

734
01:06:45,374 --> 01:06:47,291
They're convinced that
they can't be recorded

735
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:50,044
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving. Yet,

736
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:52,129
they're the target.

737
01:06:52,214 --> 01:06:55,091
Now, the assignment is
to get everything they say.

738
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:56,175
How would you do it?

739
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:59,220
First of all, one system won't do it.

740
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:01,806
- Hell, I could've told you that.
- Yeah, why didn't you?

741
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,391
Go on, figure it out.

742
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:05,726
Second of all, it's easy.
All you do is get to their clothes first.

743
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:07,144
You pre-rig their clothes.

744
01:07:08,355 --> 01:07:10,523
No. There's no way of telling
what they're going to be wearing.

745
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:12,483
Then you get somebody to bump into them.

746
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:16,362
You just get a drunk or something, bump
into them, you plant a pin mike on them.

747
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:18,155
They've been bugged before. It's too risky.

748
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:20,658
I got it.

749
01:07:21,827 --> 01:07:23,995
You hire a lip-reader with binoculars.

750
01:07:24,788 --> 01:07:28,082
- No. The client wants their actual voice.
- Why?

751
01:07:29,793 --> 01:07:31,002
So he can believe it.

752
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:35,089
All right. I'll figure it out.

753
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:36,674
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

754
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:39,885
- Who was so interested?
- Yeah, was it us?

755
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,887
- Who's us?
- Federal government.

756
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:44,223
Private party.

757
01:07:44,308 --> 01:07:46,017
It would take at least four passes.

758
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:48,477
- I did it in three.
- Three?

759
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:50,604
That's very nice, Harry. What did you use?

760
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:55,693
Three-stage directional microphones
with MOSFET amplifier of my own design.

761
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:59,780
And we got another 20% conventionally,
just tailing them. Paul did.

762
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:00,865
Beautiful.

763
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:03,326
It really was. It was a work of art.

764
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:08,122
You should have seen it, though.
These new microphones are just incredible.

765
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:09,790
I couldn't really believe it myself.

766
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,627
We were over 200 yards away.
It was absolutely readable. Everything.

767
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,589
I broke in a couple of
newsreel cameramen, and...

768
01:08:16,673 --> 01:08:18,090
You should have been there, Bernie.
It was really...

769
01:08:18,175 --> 01:08:19,175
What did they do?

770
01:08:19,885 --> 01:08:20,968
Well, they took

771
01:08:21,219 --> 01:08:23,637
the crosshairs of the telescope
and they lined it up on the mouths...

772
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:26,057
No. The boy and the girl. What did they do?

773
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:31,520
Oh, I don't know. But it was really beautiful,
really something to see.

774
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:34,315
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.

775
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,067
I'd like to take a look at that mike, too.

776
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:37,485
There it is.

777
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:41,822
I always said we should be partners, Harry.

778
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:43,824
I mean, I always said you're the best, right?

779
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:45,826
But you and me together, that'd be tops.

780
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:48,162
All I need is a quick look
at some of your plans and devices.

781
01:08:48,246 --> 01:08:51,665
You know, just get an idea...
I got all the manufacturing plants.

782
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,668
We could make a fortune
selling stuff to Uncle Sam, Harry.

783
01:08:54,753 --> 01:08:57,922
Listen, did you hear
about the fag wire-tapper

784
01:08:58,006 --> 01:09:01,759
- who could only tap a Princess phone?
- No.

785
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:09,934
Made that up yourself, huh?
It's pretty funny.

786
01:09:10,018 --> 01:09:11,644
Excuse me, can I cut in?

787
01:09:11,728 --> 01:09:13,437
He's got a hell of a sense of humor.

788
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,233
I'm talking about making millions,
he's making with the jokes.

789
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:19,110
- Come on!
- Thanks a lot.

790
01:09:22,197 --> 01:09:23,614
What do you say, Harry? Come on.

791
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:25,408
How about going into a partnership, Harry?

792
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:26,742
I could use a partner, so could you.

793
01:09:26,827 --> 01:09:30,162
- 50-50, how about it?
- I don't need anyone.

794
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:31,247
No, no.

795
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:36,252
That's all right.
I do pretty good on my own, anyway.

796
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:39,213
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

797
01:09:39,297 --> 01:09:40,798
Abracadabra, Harry.

798
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:45,386
See, I'm number two, Harry.
I have to try harder.

799
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:49,181
If you were a girl
who'd waited for someone...

800
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:50,516
You can trust me.

801
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:54,228
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

802
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:55,980
What? No shit.

803
01:09:56,064 --> 01:09:57,606
...when he was going to come to see you.

804
01:09:57,691 --> 01:10:00,609
It's the Moran Super P-7 pen mike
and transmitter.

805
01:10:00,694 --> 01:10:03,612
That's terrific! The bugger got bugged, huh?

806
01:10:03,697 --> 01:10:05,281
He got you, Harry.

807
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:07,408
And if you loved him,
you were patient with him,

808
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:13,914
and even though he didn't dare ever
tell you anything about himself personally,

809
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:16,750
even though he may have loved you,
would you...

810
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:18,586
That was wild. When did you do that?

811
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,255
Hey, how do you like it, Harry?
What do you think about it, huh?

812
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:26,677
Would you... Would you go back to him?

813
01:10:28,013 --> 01:10:30,181
I think you'd better turn it off and get out.

814
01:10:30,474 --> 01:10:31,474
You'd have no way of knowing.

815
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:34,894
Are you kidding?
It's just a joke, for Christ's sake.

816
01:10:34,978 --> 01:10:37,563
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sake."

817
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:40,691
Oh, no? Well, I'm sorry, Harry. I apologize.
What, are you crazy, too, Stanley?

818
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:42,401
Hey, Harry. What's wrong?

819
01:10:42,486 --> 01:10:44,361
Come on. Let's have a party here.
What do you say?

820
01:10:44,446 --> 01:10:46,113
Paul, it's getting late.

821
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:47,490
Come on, take it easy.

822
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:49,241
Come on.

823
01:10:49,326 --> 01:10:51,535
- Hey, Millard.
- Know what these things cost, Harry?

824
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,330
This cost 1,500 beans. Come on.
On the house, from me to you.

825
01:10:58,376 --> 01:11:00,127
Very nice to meet you.

826
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:02,713
It was only a joke.

827
01:11:04,257 --> 01:11:06,759
- Meredith?
- Guy's got no sense of humor.

828
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:09,970
- No. I'm going to stay here.
- Paul!

829
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,182
Okay.

830
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:18,229
I forgot my bag.

831
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:22,608
Harry, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

832
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,611
- Come on, Stan.
- See you Monday, Harry.

833
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:29,240
You want us to put the lights out?

834
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,512
- Good night, Harry!
- Yeah. Good night, Harry.

835
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,727
What do you think?

836
01:11:58,812 --> 01:12:01,021
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

837
01:12:01,106 --> 01:12:03,607
He's already got everything.

838
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:15,202
Harry, are you going to
give me a hard time tonight? Harry!

839
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:21,458
Harry! Come on. Come back. Turn it off.

840
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:36,390
She's frightened.

841
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:39,893
This is where she's frightened.

842
01:12:39,978 --> 01:12:41,687
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

843
01:12:41,771 --> 01:12:44,106
This is no ordinary conversation.

844
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,360
- He doesn't need anything anymore.
- It makes me feel...

845
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:51,238
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

846
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:56,327
...something.
- Forget it, Harry. It's only a trick.

847
01:12:57,245 --> 01:12:58,579
- What?
- A job.

848
01:12:58,663 --> 01:13:01,749
You're not supposed to
feel anything about it.

849
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:05,377
You're just supposed to do it. That's all.

850
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:06,837
Relax, honey.

851
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:08,005
A lot of fun you are.

852
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:09,798
- Relax.
- You're supposed to tease me,

853
01:13:09,883 --> 01:13:12,176
give me hints, make me guess, you know.

854
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:15,929
Does it bother you?

855
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:19,892
- What?
- Walking around in circles.

856
01:13:21,519 --> 01:13:25,773
Oh, look. That's terrible.

857
01:13:25,857 --> 01:13:27,816
He's not hurting anyone.

858
01:13:28,985 --> 01:13:30,069
Come on.

859
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:32,738
Neither are we.

860
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,202
- Oh, God.
- "Oh, God."

861
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:42,665
Listen to the way she says, "Oh, God."

862
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:44,541
Come here.

863
01:13:44,626 --> 01:13:50,297
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.

864
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:52,549
What do you think?

865
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:56,345
I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

866
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,891
Really, I do.

867
01:14:00,975 --> 01:14:04,103
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,

868
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:06,939
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

869
01:14:07,065 --> 01:14:10,984
And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,

870
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:14,655
and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?

871
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:20,202
Anyway, that's what I always think.

872
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:25,165
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike in New York,

873
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,167
more of those old guys died.

874
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:29,837
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.

875
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:32,715
Just because there were no newspapers?

876
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:37,094
- Really. Keeps them warm.
- That's terrible.

877
01:14:39,264 --> 01:14:40,931
Who started this conversation, anyhow?

878
01:14:43,685 --> 01:14:46,061
- You did.
- Did not.

879
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:49,606
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.

880
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,194
Pretend like I just told you a joke.

881
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:00,868
- Where did you hear that?
- That's my secret.

882
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:07,207
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.

883
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,544
Sunday, definitely.

884
01:15:13,089 --> 01:15:14,840
Jack Tar Hotel.

885
01:15:16,551 --> 01:15:17,968
3:00.

886
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:19,928
Room 773.

887
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:21,555
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

888
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:23,891
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?

889
01:15:23,975 --> 01:15:27,436
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.

890
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,398
He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.

891
01:15:32,692 --> 01:15:34,985
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

892
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:44,953
Angel...

893
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:49,708
God, it will be so good
to be finished with all this.

894
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:52,669
I love you.

895
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:56,840
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

896
01:15:56,925 --> 01:15:58,967
We're spending too much time
together here.

897
01:15:59,052 --> 01:16:01,428
No. Let's stay just a little longer.

898
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:07,142
"Kill us."

899
01:16:08,895 --> 01:16:10,896
He'd kill them if he had a chance.

900
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,773
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

901
01:16:12,857 --> 01:16:14,191
Oh, God, what I have done.

902
01:16:16,027 --> 01:16:20,322
I have to destroy the tapes.
I can't let it happen again.

903
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:23,408
It's true.

904
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:25,619
- I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.
- Oh, no, please, don't go.

905
01:16:25,703 --> 01:16:28,372
A family was murdered because of me.

906
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:33,961
I know. I know, Harry.

907
01:16:34,045 --> 01:16:35,629
Everything will turn out.

908
01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:40,342
Oh, God. There's no protection.

909
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:43,554
I follow them wherever they're going.
And I can hear them.

910
01:16:43,638 --> 01:16:44,763
Bye-bye.

911
01:16:44,848 --> 01:16:47,140
Oh, wait, you have something in your eye.

912
01:16:47,225 --> 01:16:51,019
- Yeah?
- You really don't. I just wanted to kiss you.

913
01:16:51,104 --> 01:16:54,898
I forgive you. I forgive you, darling.

914
01:18:27,492 --> 01:18:30,869
Listen. Listen. My name is Harry Caul.

915
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:34,915
Can you hear me?

916
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:38,377
Don't be afraid.

917
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:44,299
I... I know you don't know who I am,
but I know you.

918
01:18:46,344 --> 01:18:48,345
There isn't much to say about myself. I...

919
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:01,733
Sick when I was a boy.

920
01:19:03,653 --> 01:19:06,196
I was very sick when I was a boy.

921
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,117
I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.

922
01:19:10,201 --> 01:19:11,952
I couldn't walk for six months.

923
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:16,748
One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.

924
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:19,751
My mother...

925
01:19:20,545 --> 01:19:26,133
My mother used to lower me into a hot bath.
It was therapy.

926
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,137
One time the doorbell rang
and she went down to answer it.

927
01:19:30,221 --> 01:19:31,680
I started sliding down.

928
01:19:31,764 --> 01:19:35,142
I could feel the water.
It started coming up to my chin, to my nose.

929
01:19:35,226 --> 01:19:37,602
And when I woke up,

930
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:42,357
my body was all greasy
from the holy oil she put on my body.

931
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,569
I remember being disappointed I survived.

932
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:46,653
When I was five,

933
01:19:48,614 --> 01:19:49,823
my father introduced me to a friend of his,

934
01:19:49,907 --> 01:19:52,659
and for no reason at all, I hit him
right in the stomach with all my strength.

935
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:53,952
He died a year later.

936
01:19:56,164 --> 01:19:58,040
He'll kill you if he gets a chance.

937
01:20:02,587 --> 01:20:04,838
I'm not afraid of death.

938
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:14,056
I am afraid of murder.

939
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:14,157
Meredith?

940
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:19,037
Hey!

941
01:22:03,624 --> 01:22:05,333
Bitch.

942
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:23,810
Good morning. May I help you?

943
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,647
- Yes. Extension 765, please.
- One moment, please.

944
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,150
Director's office.

945
01:22:30,234 --> 01:22:32,986
Yes, I'd like to speak
to the director's assistant, please.

946
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:37,991
Mr. Stett. Mr. Martin Stett.
Mr. Caul is on the line.

947
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:39,993
One moment, please.

948
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,457
I'm sorry. That's impossible now.
Can we get back to you?

949
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:48,710
No, I... I have to talk to him.

950
01:22:48,794 --> 01:22:52,339
- Can we have your name again?
- Caul.

951
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:57,219
- Would you mind spelling that?
- C-A-U-L. Caul.

952
01:22:57,303 --> 01:22:59,262
I'm putting you on hold.

953
01:23:03,226 --> 01:23:06,895
- Mr. Caul, we'll get right back to you.
- No. You don't have my telephone number!

954
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:08,313
Hello?

955
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:05,704
- Yes?
- Mr. Caul? This is Martin Stett.

956
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:06,746
How did you get this phone number?

957
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:11,251
We prepare a full dossier on everyone
who comes in contact with the director.

958
01:24:11,335 --> 01:24:14,129
You know that means
we've been watching you.

959
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:16,506
We have the tapes. They're perfectly safe.

960
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,384
The director was very anxious
to hear them as soon as possible.

961
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:23,847
You seemed to be...
I don't know... Disturbed.

962
01:24:23,973 --> 01:24:26,850
I couldn't take the chance
that you might destroy our tapes.

963
01:24:26,934 --> 01:24:30,186
You understand, don't you, Mr. Caul?

964
01:24:30,313 --> 01:24:32,397
Our tapes have nothing to do with you.

965
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:36,818
Why don't you come over now
and bring the photographs?

966
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:37,986
- Yes...
- The director's here,

967
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,363
and he's prepared to pay you in full.

968
01:26:02,113 --> 01:26:07,283
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.

969
01:26:07,827 --> 01:26:10,203
What do you think?

970
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:14,124
I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

971
01:26:16,502 --> 01:26:18,336
Really, I do.

972
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,922
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,

973
01:26:21,632 --> 01:26:23,800
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

974
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:28,388
And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,

975
01:26:28,472 --> 01:26:32,183
and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?

976
01:26:33,436 --> 01:26:36,062
Anyway, that's what I always think.

977
01:26:38,524 --> 01:26:42,318
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike in New York,

978
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:43,903
more of those old guys died.

979
01:26:44,447 --> 01:26:46,406
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.

980
01:26:47,366 --> 01:26:49,909
Just because there were no newspapers?

981
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:54,456
- Really. Keeps them warm.
- That's terrible.

982
01:26:56,417 --> 01:26:59,169
Who started this conversation anyhow?

983
01:27:00,838 --> 01:27:03,173
- You did.
- Did not.

984
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:06,676
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.

985
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:11,139
Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.

986
01:27:11,223 --> 01:27:15,768
I can't stand it. I can't stand it anymore.

987
01:27:15,853 --> 01:27:21,107
- You're going to make me cry.
- I know, honey, I know. Me, too.

988
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:24,277
- No, don't.
- Oh, God.

989
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:29,199
- You want to hear that again?
- You want it to be true!

990
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:33,620
No, I don't. I just want you to know
whatever you need to know.

991
01:27:33,704 --> 01:27:34,704
That's all.

992
01:27:35,873 --> 01:27:37,916
Your money's on the table.

993
01:27:39,919 --> 01:27:41,794
Do you think we can do this?

994
01:27:43,839 --> 01:27:45,965
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

995
01:27:48,052 --> 01:27:50,470
I'm tired of mostly everything.

996
01:27:50,554 --> 01:27:52,430
- Tired of me?
- Tired of you,

997
01:27:52,765 --> 01:27:54,724
but not today.

998
01:27:55,768 --> 01:27:59,687
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.

999
01:28:02,483 --> 01:28:04,400
Sunday, definitely.

1000
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,658
Jack Tar Hotel.

1001
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:13,409
3:00.

1002
01:28:13,953 --> 01:28:15,662
Room 773.

1003
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:18,540
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

1004
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:21,000
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?

1005
01:28:21,085 --> 01:28:23,086
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.

1006
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:27,173
Please count your money outside.

1007
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:31,928
He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.

1008
01:28:33,097 --> 01:28:35,598
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

1009
01:28:50,948 --> 01:28:55,285
God, it will be so good
to be finished with all this.

1010
01:28:56,704 --> 01:28:58,663
I love you.

1011
01:29:02,001 --> 01:29:05,086
These are the pictures you asked for.

1012
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:07,171
We're spending too much time
together here.

1013
01:29:07,256 --> 01:29:09,215
No. Let's stay just a little longer.

1014
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,467
What will you do to her?

1015
01:29:12,094 --> 01:29:14,512
...kill us if he got the chance.

1016
01:29:18,058 --> 01:29:20,184
I think he's been recording my telephone.

1017
01:29:22,855 --> 01:29:24,731
Listen, I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.

1018
01:29:24,815 --> 01:29:27,859
No, please, don't go back there. Not just yet.

1019
01:29:29,403 --> 01:29:33,323
All right. All right, honey. I won't.

1020
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:39,329
Fifteen thousand bucks.

1021
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:41,789
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr. Caul?

1022
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:45,543
What'll he do with them?

1023
01:29:48,005 --> 01:29:49,005
We'll see.

1024
01:29:58,682 --> 01:30:02,393
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1025
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:17,033
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.

1026
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:21,579
Sunday, definitely.

1027
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:26,084
Jack Tar Hotel.

1028
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:29,879
3:00.

1029
01:30:29,963 --> 01:30:31,714
Room 773.

1030
01:30:35,678 --> 01:30:39,013
I wonder if you could give me Room 773.

1031
01:30:39,098 --> 01:30:41,140
773?

1032
01:30:42,685 --> 01:30:43,893
That is occupied, sir.

1033
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:50,233
The rooms are
all basically the same, however.

1034
01:30:50,901 --> 01:30:52,235
Well...

1035
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:59,659
Do you have a room that would be
adjoining, close by?

1036
01:30:59,743 --> 01:31:03,579
- Adjoining, just... Yes, I do.
- You do.

1037
01:35:15,499 --> 01:35:17,833
I'm tired of this lying, all right?
I'm tired of lying!

1038
01:35:25,092 --> 01:35:27,969
Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.

1039
01:35:28,053 --> 01:35:33,182
I can't stand it. I can't stand it anymore.

1040
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:37,520
- You're going to make me cry.
- I know, honey, I know. Me, too.

1041
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:38,938
No, don't.

1042
01:35:39,022 --> 01:35:41,190
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1043
01:35:41,274 --> 01:35:43,401
No idea! This has all been a lie!
Don't you understand that?

1044
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:50,366
I love you.

1045
01:36:54,097 --> 01:36:55,765
The answer is, "No."

1046
01:36:55,849 --> 01:36:57,516
At the end of the briefing last night,
it was stated

1047
01:36:57,601 --> 01:37:00,853
that Nixon would not deliver
the State of the Union message in person...

1048
01:37:00,937 --> 01:37:02,354
Why not?

1049
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,534
- Watch out for the bumps!
- Will you cut that out?

1050
01:37:15,619 --> 01:37:19,872
How can you yell at me like that?
And in my condition.

1051
01:37:19,956 --> 01:37:22,708
You're not fit to be the father of my child.

1052
01:37:22,793 --> 01:37:24,376
Oh, what is this?

1053
01:37:24,461 --> 01:37:28,047
- I'm just trying to act like Wilma.
- Well, you're overdoing it.

1054
01:37:32,677 --> 01:37:34,386
All right. Pull over.

1055
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:37,890
What's the big rush?

1056
01:37:37,974 --> 01:37:40,810
I'm taking my wife to the hospital.
She's having a baby.

1057
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:44,772
I got to hand it to you, buddy.
You sure got intestinal fortitude.

1058
01:37:44,856 --> 01:37:48,484
You better sit down, Fred.
You're wearing a groove in the floor.

1059
01:37:50,904 --> 01:37:52,196
Look at Wilma out there.

1060
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,825
How can she be so calm
when she knows what I'm going through?

1061
01:37:55,909 --> 01:37:58,786
- How are you, Fred?
- How do you think I am?

1062
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,996
This waiting, waiting, waiting... It's tough!

1063
01:38:01,706 --> 01:38:04,500
Betty, you go back out there
and tell Wilma if she doesn't...

1064
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:27,679
- Wait. Richard!
- I want to see the director.

1065
01:42:27,764 --> 01:42:32,351
He's not in today.
I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.

1066
01:44:31,262 --> 01:44:33,388
Let's clear an aisle
and let these people through,

1067
01:44:33,473 --> 01:44:35,307
- and we can move on upstairs.
- Come on, clear the way here.

1068
01:44:35,391 --> 01:44:36,642
We'll answer your questions upstairs.

1069
01:44:36,726 --> 01:44:40,479
Just let these people through.
Let these people through.

1070
01:44:40,563 --> 01:44:43,482
- Just one question.
- No, please.

1071
01:44:43,566 --> 01:44:45,901
Do you suspect any foul play
in the accident?

1072
01:44:45,985 --> 01:44:46,985
Please!

1073
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:48,820
What about your corporate control?

1074
01:44:48,905 --> 01:44:50,697
Will your stock now give you
a controlling interest...

1075
01:44:50,782 --> 01:44:52,157
What kind of insurance do you have?

1076
01:44:52,242 --> 01:44:53,325
What's going to happen to the company?

1077
01:44:53,409 --> 01:44:54,409
That's an unfair question.

1078
01:44:54,494 --> 01:44:56,161
- Did you have...
- Did your husband...

1079
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:01,041
What do you think?

1080
01:45:01,793 --> 01:45:03,961
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

1081
01:45:04,045 --> 01:45:06,463
He's already got everything.

1082
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,758
He doesn't need anything anymore.

1083
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,764
Do you feel now
that there's an enemy within the company?

1084
01:45:18,393 --> 01:45:21,019
He's not hurting anyone.

1085
01:45:21,104 --> 01:45:22,354
Neither are we.

1086
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:24,940
Oh, God.

1087
01:45:25,024 --> 01:45:26,650
Did your husband have
a history of drunk driving?

1088
01:45:26,734 --> 01:45:28,485
No comments, no more...

1089
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:31,238
Did your husband have
a history of drunk, reckless driving?

1090
01:45:31,322 --> 01:45:35,784
I can't stand it. I can't stand it anymore.

1091
01:45:39,205 --> 01:45:41,957
Take it!

1092
01:45:48,298 --> 01:45:50,173
Do you think we can do this?

1093
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:53,677
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.

1094
01:45:55,388 --> 01:45:56,930
Sunday, definitely.

1095
01:45:58,099 --> 01:45:59,516
Jack Tar Hotel.

1096
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,269
3:00.

1097
01:46:02,353 --> 01:46:03,854
Room 773.

1098
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:10,319
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1099
01:46:43,895 --> 01:46:45,103
Hello.

1100
01:46:47,106 --> 01:46:48,315
Hello?

1101
01:47:42,036 --> 01:47:43,203
Hello.

1102
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:54,673
- Hello?
- We know that you know, Mr. Caul.

1103
01:47:54,757 --> 01:47:57,759
For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.

1104
01:47:57,844 --> 01:48:00,011
We'll be listening to you.
