Not so fast. Before you hit
the public with that idea...

165
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,990
you better get
a few more facts under your belt.

166
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,541
[ Bell Rings ]

167
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,632
- Monsieur Varnay?
- At your service, monsieur.

168
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,843
Monsieur Nutal,
the real estate agent.

169
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,928
This is Madame Grosnay.
Monsieur Varnay.

170
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,515
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

171
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,809
Madame would like
to look over your house...

172
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,769
if it's not too inconvenient.

173
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,813
By no means.
Won't you come in?

174
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,488
You'll pardon me.
[ Chuckles ] I'm all disheveled.

175
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,325
I've been so busy, I haven't
had time to brush up or do a thing.

176
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,663
- Oh, what lovely roses!
- Do you like them? From my garden.

177
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,874
Mm, they're divine.

178
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,834
- Louise?
- Oui, monsieur?

179
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,128
Will you wrap up these roses
for Madame Grosnay?

180

<i>You'll find tissue paper
in the left-hand kitchen drawer.</i>

- Oui, monsieur.
- Oh!

182
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,469
Oh, no.
You want them for yourself.

183
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,430
Madame,
I want them appreciated.

184
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,058
I therefore give them to you.

185
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,893
This way, please.

186
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,650
This is the sitting room.

187
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,860
Solid oak doors and floors
throughout the house.

188
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,862
Mahogany wainscoting
in all the rooms.

189
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,448
- Architecturally, it's a perfect house.
- Thank you.

190
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,534
Here we have
rather a lovely view...

191
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,827
of the mountains
and the sea below.

192
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,038
Oh! Those beautiful hills.

193
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,749
Mm-hmm. That's the work
of the Supreme Architect.

194
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,670
I'm afraid we can't compete
with that. [ Chuckles ]

195
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,589
Then there's the garden:
175 feet by 85...

196
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,794
with seven fruit trees —
three apples, two pears...

197
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,469
one plum and a mulberry —
and, of course, my rosebushes.

198
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,471
- Quite an atmosphere.
- Yes.

199
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,224
My wife put a great deal
of herself in this house.

200
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:53,352
We were supremely happy here.
I, uh — I think one feels that.

201
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,105
Yes, indeed.
And may I offer my condolences?

202
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,566
- I beg your pardon?
- The irreparable loss of your wife.

203
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,694
Ah, yes.
It was very sudden.

204
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,696
A heart attack
while visiting her family.

205
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:07,449
That's why I must give up this house.
I must get away from the memory.

206
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,411
<i>- [ Phone Ringing ]</i>
- You'll pardon me, I trust.

207
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,414
We should get it for nothing.

208
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,499
Call again. I'm very busy.

209
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,921
This way, please.

210
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,679
This is the dining room,
and to the left, the library.

211
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,142
Cozy, hmm?

212
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,685
Yes.

213
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,152
Uh, this way, please.

214
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,529
Upstairs.

215
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,699
It's a small house and requires
very little to keep up.

216
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,077
We never had a servant, but there's
a maid's room if you need one.

217
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,456
- I have a maid and a cook.
- You could put an extra bed
in the maid's room —

218
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,350
that is, if they're both females.
[ Chuckles ]

219
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,960
Or you could use
one of the rooms upstairs...

220
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,963
unless, of course,
you want it for your family.

221
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,633
- I have no family.
- Just you and your husband, huh?

222
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,261
My husband has been dead
for many years.

We — Uh, pardon me.

231
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:40,167
Ah, yes.
We called it our "Sans Souci."

00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,712
She loved this room.
In fact, she spent most of her time here.

233
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,714
- Very sunny.
- Yes, we loved the sun.

234

- But some people don't like it
shining in the bedroom.
- Oh, I do.

- No, Aries.
- Ah, yes. Of course.

Sky and sun. A dreamer.

239
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,233
It's in your eyes —
deep pools of desire...

240
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,985
that can never be
fulfilled or understood.

- Very interesting.
- You are. Very interesting.

242

You see, I'm also Aries.
I know all about us. We're old souls.

Because companionship
is so essential to Aries people.

A great deal, to a woman.

I venture to say that you were never
as attractive as you are now.

- You're very kind.
- On the contrary. I'm very frank.

No doubt you were extremely
beautiful as a young girl...

more character now...

Why shouldn't I
respond to beauty...

268
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,895
as you did
to those flowers downstairs?

269
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,105
"What lovely roses,"
you said...

270
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,399
and impulsively drew them
near to your lips.

- Words are so futile.
I feel I've known you all my life.

- Oh, I must.
- This is ridiculous!

No, this is beautiful, inevitable.
We can't help ourselves.

It's a bee. Hold still. I'll get it.

Isn't that silly?

00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,663
- Are you hurt?
- [ Chuckles ] I must have slipped.

288
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,164
No doubt.

00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,875
- I think we'd better go.
- I think we had.

enough already. That is, pardon me.

- No bother, if I know where
to get in touch with you.

Oh, a little of everything.

00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,141
Thank you,
but I don't think that incident...

822
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:07,727
requires any further explanation.

823
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,938
Good day, Monsieur Varnay.

824
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:21,658
- Good morning, monsieur.
- Good morning.

825
00:53:21,783 --> 00:53:25,829
I want to order three dozen roses,
a corsage of orchids —
say, about a half dozen —

826
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:29,291
and send them to Madame Grosnay,
151 Avenue Victor Hugo.

827
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,418
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

828
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:35,630
- A card?
<i>- Yes — five or six.</i>

829
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,216
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>
As many as you wish.

830
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,804
I want to repeat the order
twice a week for the next two weeks.

831
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,306
Oui, monsieur.

832
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:46,224
<i>How much will that be?</i>

833
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:47,976
Let me see.

834
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:50,520
That will be
five orders altogether.

835
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,315
2,500 francs, monsieur.

836
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,983
<i>Oh là là.</i>

837
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,987
Ah, well.
These things have to be done.

838
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:04,451
- Keep the change.
<i>- Merci, monsieur.</i>

839
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,089
- Cordial, Martha?
- Yes, thanks.

840
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,258
- Maurice?
- Thank you, Mona.

841
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,510
I hope we'll be seeing
more of you, Henri.

842
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:25,221
You never will. He must be
on the go every minute.

843
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,432
Unfortunately,
one gets caught up...

844
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,602
in this monoxide world
of speed and confusion.

845
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:34,189
Nevertheless, I look forward
to these quiet evenings together...

846
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:37,776
and your delightful and edifying
talks on theurgic matters.

847
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:40,570
The legerdemain
of the apothecary, as it were.

848
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:42,906
You should have been
a chemist, Henri.

849
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,908
Chemistry, my dear fellow...

850
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,911
is the material manifestation
of the metaphysical.

851
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,663
Ah. You're a mystic.

852
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:52,958
Do you remember some time ago
discussing a humane method...

853
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,001
of doing away
with dumb animals?

854
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:58,254
<i>- Very distinctly.</i>
- A lethal formula for veterinary work?

855
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,841
No pain. No convulsions.
Absolutely tasteless.

856
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:04,344
The creature drinks it
and in about an hour...

857
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,263
curls up into
a comfortable sleep and dies.

858
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:09,307
Ah, what a memory you have.

859
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:13,687
You were experimenting with
three elements, as I remember:

860
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:16,272
exnide, ethna bromide,
and something else.

861
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:20,527
Yes. That was very interesting,
pharmaceutically.

862
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:24,197
The ethna bromide
induces asphyxia...

863
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:27,659
but in order to delay
the erodent action of the exnide...

864
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:29,619
C2HC was added.

865
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:32,539
- C2HC, huh?
<i>- A freezing agent.</i>

866
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:34,791
<i>The results are interesting.</i>

867
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:37,752
When swallowed,
tissue changes are gradual.

868
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,797
In about an hour, the action
of the exnide takes place.

869
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:43,133
Its effect is like heart disease.

870
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,635
A systolic cramp, and... poof!

871
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,513
- What have you done about it?
- Nothing.

872
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,682
The State Medical Department
banned it.

873
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:54,310
- Why?
<i>- Too dangerous for public use.</i>

874
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,563
Strangely enough,
in the postmortem...

875
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:58,732
not a trace of the poison
can be found...

876
00:55:58,857 --> 00:56:00,775
neither in the stomach
nor the blood.

877
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,154
Can you imagine such a weapon
in the hands of an archcriminal?

878
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,490
[ Chuckles ]
Think of the money he'd make
from the insurance companies.

879
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,659
That's quite an idea.

880
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,786
We'll incorporate
and go into business.

881
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,539
Insuring people and having them
die of heart failure?

882
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:16,416
We'd make millions.

883
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,377
I'm not sure,
but I think the poison...

884
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:21,379
might show up in a man.

885
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,215
<i>- Why?</i>
- Different metabolism.

886
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,967
<i>We could easily find out.</i>

887
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,427
- How?
<i>- Simple.</i>

888
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:30,388
You say it takes an hour
for the poison to work.

889
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:34,142
Then pick a derelict off the street,
poison him, then send him to a hotel.

890
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:37,395
In such cases, where a person
is found dead in a public place...

891
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,355
there's always an autopsy.

892
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:42,650
You'd know the result
without taking the slightest risk.

893
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,236
What a diabolical thought!

894
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:48,907
However, such experiments
we had better leave...

895
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:50,992
to the archcriminal,
don't you think?

896
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:53,161
<i>[ Bottello Chuckling ]</i>

897
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:04,047
<i>[ Verdoux ]
Hmm. C2HC.</i>

898
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,974
And now for the experiment.

899
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:25,336
- Quite a shower.
- Yes, it is.

900
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:27,338
Can I escort you anywhere?

901
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:29,174
Oh, thank you.

902
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:32,844
Allow me.

903
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:45,690
- So you're from Belgium?
- I came here after the war.

904
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:47,817
- A refugee, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

905
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,445
- Where do you live?
- Hotel Lausanne, off Montmartre.

906
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,198
- Hmm. Just a few doors away.
- Yes.

907
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:54,741
Good.

908
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,327
Why don't you take off your coat?
Allow me.

909
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:02,165
- What's that?
- A kitten.

910
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,751
Poor little thing.
I picked it up in the doorway.

911
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:06,878
- You like cats, huh?
- Not particularly.

912
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,047
But it was all wet and cold.

913
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,216
I don't suppose
you have a little milk.

914
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,009
On the contrary, I have.

915
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:16,221
You see, the prospects
are not as gloomy as you think.

916
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,890
- Do I sound that pessimistic?
- You do.

917
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:21,851
- But I don't think you are.
- Why?

918
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:25,230
To be out on a night like this —
[ Chuckles ] you're an optimist.

919
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:29,067
An optimist?
I'm anything but that.

920
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:30,902
Up against it, huh?

921
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,906
Your faculties of observation
are remarkable.

922
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,783
Indeed.

923
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:40,954
Tell me, how long have you
been in this predicament?

924
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,581
Mm, quite a long time.

925
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,417
<i>- How long?</i>
- Three months.

926
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,920
<i>- I don't believe you.</i>
- Why?

927
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:51,756
An attractive, intelligent girl
like you would have done better.

928
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:53,549
Thanks.

929
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:56,094
Now tell me the truth.

930
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:00,974
You're just out of a hospital
or a jail. Which is it?

931
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,269
- What do you want to know for?
- Because I want to help you.

932
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:06,104
Philanthropist, huh?

933
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:09,232
Precisely.
And I ask nothing in return.

934
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,567
What is this,
the Salvation Army?

935
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,781
Very well. If that's the way you feel,
you're at liberty to go on your way.

936
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,791
Well, if you must know,
I'm just out of jail.

937
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,710
<i>What were you in for?</i>

938
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:31,462
What's the difference?
Larceny, they called it.

939
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:35,258
<i>- Larceny?</i>
- Petty larceny.
Pawning a rented typewriter.

940
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:37,552
Dear, dear.
Couldn't you do better than that?

941
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:42,640
<i>- What did you get?</i>
- Three months.

942
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,893
So this is your first day
out of jail?

943
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,812
<i>Yes.</i>

944
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:50,315
I see.

945
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,067
Poor dear. Ah, well.

946
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:57,822
Nothing is permanent
in this wicked world,
not even our troubles.

947
01:00:57,947 --> 01:01:00,158
- Are you hungry?
- Frankly, yes.

948
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:03,077
Then while I attend
to the culinary operations...

949
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:06,164
you can help bring in
a few things from the kitchen.

950
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,749
Come.

951
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,003
If you will permit me,
I'll adopt that little kitten of yours.

952
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,339
- Please do.
- We'll just set the table for one.

953
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,008
- You'll find everything there.
- Aren't you having anything?

954
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:20,511
- No, <i>merci.</i>
- Then all we need
is a knife, fork, and a napkin.

955
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,513
- Mm-hmm.
- Here they are.

956
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,724
Then you will
take them in there...

957
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,185
make yourself at home,
and I shall be in later.

958
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:29,270
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

959
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:01,886
I don't know whether this will
appeal to your appetite or not:

960
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,888
scrambled eggs, toast,
and a little red wine.

961
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:05,807
- Wonderful.
- Then will you be seated?

962
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:07,392
Thank you.

963
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:16,150
Ah, you're tired,
so immediately after supper...

964
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,653
I shall take you to your hotel.

965
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:22,573
You're very kind. I don't understand
why you're doing all this for me.

966
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:25,743
Why not? Is a little kindness
such a rare thing?

967
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,912
I was beginning
to think it was.

968
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,207
- The toast. Pardon me.
- Can I help you?

969
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,960
No, no. Stay where you are.
I can manage.

970
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:44,095
<i>- Voilà.</i>
- You're funny.

971
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:46,431
- Am I? Why?
- I don't know.

972
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:48,850
However, you're hungry.
Please go ahead.

973
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:36,856
- What book is that you're reading?
- Schopenhauer.

974
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,941
- Do you like him?
- So-so.

975
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:41,360
Have you read
his treatise on suicide?

976
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:44,614
- Wouldn't interest me.
- Not if the end could be simple?

977
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,657
Say, for instance,
you went to sleep...

978
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:49,911
and without any thought of death,
there was a sudden stoppage.

979
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:52,914
Wouldn't you prefer it
to this drab existence?

980
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,501
- I wonder.
- It's the approach of death
that terrifies.

981
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,754
I suppose if the unborn
knew of the approach of life...

982
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:01,923
they'd be just as terrified.

983
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,348
Yet life is wonderful.

984
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:12,433
What's wonderful about it?

985
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,729
Everything. Spring morning,
a summer's night...

986
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:20,149
- music, art, love —
- "Love"?

987
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,568

your friend all through the trial.

1808
02:00:23,718 --> 02:00:26,512
Now give me a break.
A story with a moral to it.

1809
02:00:26,637 --> 02:00:29,849
You, the tragic example
of a life of crime.

1810
02:00:29,974 --> 02:00:32,393
I don't see how anyone
can be an example...

1811
02:00:32,518 --> 02:00:34,228
in these criminal times.

1812
02:00:34,353 --> 02:00:37,690
Well, you certainly are —
robbing and murdering people.

1813
02:00:37,815 --> 02:00:40,026
- That's business.
- [ Scoffs ]

1814
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:43,529
Well, other people
don't do business that way.

1815
02:00:43,654 --> 02:00:46,449
That's the history
of many a big business.

1816
02:00:46,574 --> 02:00:48,951
Wars, conflict —

1817
02:00:49,076 --> 02:00:51,704
it's all business.

1818
02:00:51,829 --> 02:00:54,165
One murder makes a villain...

1819
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:56,500
millions a hero.

1820
02:00:56,626 --> 02:00:58,920
Numbers sanctify,
my good fellow.

1821
02:00:59,045 --> 02:01:01,589
Father Ferro to see you.

1822
02:01:01,714 --> 02:01:04,091
By all means, show him in.

1823
02:01:04,216 --> 02:01:07,511
You'll pardon me,
but my time is limited.

1824
02:01:07,637 --> 02:01:09,472
[ Man Chuckles ]

1825
02:01:09,597 --> 02:01:13,017
Verdoux, is there anything else
you'd like to say before I leave?

1826
02:01:13,142 --> 02:01:16,437
- Yes. Good-bye.
- [ Laughs ]

1827
02:01:23,778 --> 02:01:25,404
All right, Father.

1828
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:41,712
Well, Father...

1829
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:44,131
and what can I do for you?

1830
02:01:44,256 --> 02:01:47,093
Nothing, my son.
I want to help you, if I can.

1831
02:01:47,218 --> 02:01:50,096
I've come to ask you
to make your peace with God.

1832
02:01:50,221 --> 02:01:52,098
I am at peace with God.

1833
02:01:52,223 --> 02:01:54,642
My conflict is with man.

1834
02:01:54,767 --> 02:01:57,478
Have you
no remorse for your sin?

1835
02:01:57,603 --> 02:01:59,438
Who knows what sin is...

1836
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:02,984
born as it was from heaven,
from God's fallen angel?

1837
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:07,071
Who knows
the ultimate destiny it serves?

1838
02:02:07,196 --> 02:02:10,950
After all, what would you
be doing without sin?

1839
02:02:11,075 --> 02:02:13,661
Exactly what
I'm doing now, my son:

1840
02:02:13,786 --> 02:02:17,373
trying in my humble way
to help a lost soul in distress.

1841
02:02:17,498 --> 02:02:20,835
<i>- [ Key Rattles In Lock ]</i>
- They're coming. Let me pray for you.

1842
02:02:21,002 --> 02:02:22,837
As you wish.

1843
02:02:22,962 --> 02:02:26,007
But I don't think these gentlemen
want to be kept waiting.

1844
02:02:26,132 --> 02:02:28,509
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

1845
02:02:28,634 --> 02:02:30,261
Why not?

1846
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:32,930
After all, it belongs to him.

1847
02:02:41,856 --> 02:02:43,691
Henri Verdoux...

1848
02:02:43,858 --> 02:02:46,402
the Criminal Court of Justice
of the French Republic...

1849
02:02:46,527 --> 02:02:48,738
sentenced you to die
by the guillotine.

1850
02:02:48,863 --> 02:02:52,491
It is now the order of the court that
the sentence be carried out this day.

1851

<i>Merci.</i>

1852

- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

- Here.
- What's that?

1854
02:03:01,709 --> 02:03:03,419
Rum.

1855
02:03:03,586 --> 02:03:05,504
No, thank you.

1856
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:07,840
Uh, just a moment.

1857
02:03:07,965 --> 02:03:09,925
I've never tasted rum.
