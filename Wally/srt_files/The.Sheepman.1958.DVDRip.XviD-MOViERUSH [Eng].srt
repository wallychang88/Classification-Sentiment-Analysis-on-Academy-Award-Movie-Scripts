1
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:27,202
THE VALLEY OF THE POWDER

2
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,623
VALLEY OF THE POWDER

3
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,431
So-called...

4
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,309
That he will arrive
if I leave this bag here?

5
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,604
I doubt that he/it leaves all alone.

6
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,607
Do I want to say, will I recover it?

7
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,068
I can supervise it to you.

8
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,820
I count on you.

9
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:33,912
Hê, gentleman!
Do you look for the fight, of times?

10
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,623
With you?

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,043
I don't believe.

12
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,592
Watch therefore where you go!

13
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,763
To control a beast,
it is necessary to be shrewder than she.

14
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,060
This horse has the fragile mouth,
there is the boredom!

15
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,604
A priori, it is not
the only boredom!

16
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,565
Your bit is bad.

17
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:06,403
M. "I don't know who",
I never carry a bit!

18
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:09,823
You speak of the one
of my horse?

19
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,794
One would say well
that there is a êtranger in city.

20
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:30,427
Our city is not to sell!

21
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,479
I had pariê with myself

22
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:46,067
that I would meet you,
immediately arrivê here.

23
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:51,406
You are well
the joker of the city?

24
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,284
The philosopher of the street corner?

25
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:59,039
The citizen who makes the mind
and pleasing of everything.

26
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,376
The Philosopher!

27
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,423
It is not funny, that,
young man?

28
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,841
I don't find.

29
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,323
No, I will take a cigar.

30
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,211
People that achêtent that...
do drink it?

31
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,006
Them the achêtent not
for dêcrasser their youngsters.

32
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,968
Are you sure of it?

33
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,608
Do I can you to help?

34
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,948
Do hold it, do you want?

35
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,966
Let's suppose... that a man
achête this saddle.

36
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,635
He/it is pressê,
straddle his/her/its horse

37
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,514
and meet seated
on cactuses.

38
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,851
That makes you bitter.

39
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,978
You can pay it?

40
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,356
That? No...
You won't sell it to me.

41
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,360
I don't have cherchê to sell it to you!

42
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,786
60 dollars...

43
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:06,333
With a discount of 10%
for payment counting...

44
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,003
54 dollars, by consêquent.

45
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,465
There are your 54 dollars.

46
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:15,675
And I thank you.

47
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,266
The saddlers always offer
a rope and a bridle.

48
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,273
Delighted to have made business with you.

49
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,587
One seems silly
with a saddle without horse.

50
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:56,341
Who sells some horses?
Or what approaches from it?

51
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,718
You, let's see.

52
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,390
Hey yes, it is true.
I sell some horses.

53
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,891
Where are they?

54
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,977
Where, otherwise to the êcuries?

55
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,563
Sometimes, they are at the gambling-den.

56
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,608
Show the path.
I will follow you, to change.

57
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,619
A problême, trêsor?

58
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:28,039
Milt, I believe that my horse
a the bruised mouth.

59
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,500
Would my bit be bad?

60
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,004
Maybe... but that would be able to
to be his/her mouth.

61
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,173
Or the measles, the whooping cough...

62
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,010
Not the whooping cough.
I had it, I would know it.

63
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:44,347
You take account therefore
of my advice.

64
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:48,476
When I have you conseillêe,
you have impolite êtê.

65
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,729
But you blocked me the road!

66
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:55,066
You never learned to say:
"I regret, I was wrong."

67
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:00,322
When you dêciderez which
among us will serve yourselves first,

68
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,490
remember, I pay for cash.

69
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,369
Milt, this man who is?

70
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:11,374
I ignore it, but he/it doesn't look for
the popularitê!

71
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,019
Milt is going to glue him an old nag.

72
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:37,400
These are beasts of race:
Thoroughbredses and Indian ponies.

73
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,987
Of a côtê, rapiditê and beautê.
Of the other, the staying.

74
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,531
There is the marchê:

75
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:45,992
I give you 40 dollars
for the horse of my choice.

76
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,538
40 dollars?
All these horses are worth well more!

77
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:53,208
If me rempoche this money,
the marchê is annulê.

78
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,085
No, don't arrange it.

79
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:56,795
Finished Marchê?

80
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,715
Any horse
being at the scene?

81
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,847
That, it is a beautiful beast.
Come to see therefore...

82
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,307
Hê, where go you?

83
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,356
- I take this one.
- But it is my horse!

84
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,149
Finished Marchê, no?

85
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,569
Any horse
at the scene.

86
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,988
The êcurie is not at the scene?

87
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:27,033
Interfere in your business!
This horse is worth 150 dollars!

88
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,828
Do curry it and saddle it, do you want?

89
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,081
Wait for a little!
This horse is worth well more!

90
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,043
Give me a luck!
You have me roulê.

91
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,754
- Return I another service.
- Again?

92
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:42,215
- Not question.
- Not so quickly!

93
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,218
I look for a man.
You know it maybe.

94
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,845
What does he/it make?

95
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:51,766
It is the most quarrelsome man
and worst of the city.

96
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,476
That looks like Jumbo.

97
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:57,105
- He/it is not old?
- He/it must have your age.

98
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,733
- Is he/it small?
- Small?

99
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,361
One nicknames it the Élêphant!

100
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,407
Is II strong três, that is that?

101
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:11,077
It is well he.
Where can I find it now?

102
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,497
II eats at the Chinese.

103
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:15,957
Thank you.

104
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,867
What do they make all there?

105
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:55,121
They wait
that the fight begins.

106
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,915
What fight?

107
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,960
Between you and me.

108
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,351
Pursue your meal,
miss.

109
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:19,062
- Do you again want some?
- Hey well...

110
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:22,232
This time, I would like to hit it.

111
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,695
It won't be long...

112
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:34,744
Espêce of...

113
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,434
Hê! That way!

114
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:08,653
I don't have for habit
to include me thus to my arrivêe.

115
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,572
But I had a reason...

116
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,867
I intend to get settled here.

117
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:18,455
And to make grazed my beasts
on the public grazing.

118
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:21,958
My herd arrives tomorrow,
by the train.

119
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,921
But I am of pessimistic nature.

120
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:29,424
I wanted êviter
all objection prêalable.

121
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:34,304
Who would therefore object?
Grazing are public.

122
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,931
It is kind to you.

123
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:40,602
Kind Três...
A êtranger feels at it, here.

124
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,396
There is my part of the dêgâts.

125
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,860
Take his
before him himself êveille.

126
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,612
Wait!

127
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:54,491
Of what nature is your herd?

128
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:00,997
I fear that this question
don't blemish any so good relations.

129
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,582
Then?

130
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,460
Of the sheep.

131
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,674
It is a rêgion of bêtail!

132
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,885
You êlêverez not of sheep here!

133
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,262
Do hold therefore?

134
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,556
And who will prevent of it to me?

135
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,015
You?

136
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:23,144
Or the raw patentêe of the rêgion?

137
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:32,863
You fight well!

138
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,699
I would like to clean me.
The best hotel?

139
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,993
The arcade. Me you there emmêne.

140
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,411
Is it the best?

141
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,330
For sure.
Besides, it is the only one.

142
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,003
I believe to know how to judge the men.

143
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,549
- I have a mission to propose to you.
- What kind of mission?

144
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,930
II I am necessary to a man
dênuê of all honor.

145
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:02,184
A man who would betray whoever...

146
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,520
to win twenty coins.

147
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,106
What?

148
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,401
Is it no?

149
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,908
Wait...

150
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,203
Me, for that, I take a dollar.

151
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,414
Who is necessary him to betray?

152
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,918
No one in particular.

153
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:32,589
But you would inform myself
of some things that me êchappent.

154
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,842
- I pay for 75 cents.
- A dollar.

155
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:44,267
You are right,
you judge people well.

156
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,483
Go! Raise it!

157
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,779
Wake you up,
be necessary to warn the colonel!

158
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,699
I go him rêgler his/her/its account!

159
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,785
Go look for water!

160
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,963
Enter.

161
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:16,716
That then!

162
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:21,429
I see that you were not able to rêsister
to the dêsir to see me again.

163
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,640
- Forgiveness?
- Reassure yourselves.

164
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,475
Don't be gênêe of it.

165
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,727
No, indeed. I assure you.

166
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,229
Aprês all...

167
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:34,484
you are not the premiêre
of my impêtueuses admirers.

168
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:37,988
Conceited boaster Espêce
and coarse!

169
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,948
I name me Jason Sweet.

170
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,116
"Sweet?"

171
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,247
- As "soft?"
- Others laughed some before you.

172
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,458
- But sit yourselves therefore.
- No, without way.

173
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,800
Mr. Sweet...

174
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:08,018
There are the thousands of hectares
of free grazing in the west.

175
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:13,106
Why want êlever
of the sheep prêcisêment here?

176
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,525
Hey well, miss...

177
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,361
Excuse me,
I didn't seize your name.

178
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,779
Dell Payton.

179
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,490
Did you ask me a question?

180
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:27,370
Believe yourselves that to thrash a man
will be you sufficient to impose you?

181
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,498
It is dêjà a dêbut.

182
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:33,960
- That won't stop there!
- For my part, if.

183
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,380
If people from here imagine
that I want the war,

184
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,549
persuade them therefore of the opposite.

185
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,092
One instant...

186
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,347
Of the people who have passê
their life to maintain these earths,

187
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,350
they should wait
wisely that a êtranger

188
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:51,019
does come to wreck grazing?

189
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,813
But finally,
who does parlê have to wreck them?

190
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,526
Promise yourselves that your sheep
won't corrupt water?

191
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:01,947
You go quickly in task!
I don't promise nothing at all.

192
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:07,953
Listen, gentleman Sweet...

193
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,455
Does that bore you that I sit down?

194
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:13,875
Pursue.
What did you say?

195
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:21,091
Two years ago
that we lead a restful life.

196
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,012
I saw the duels, of vengeances,
of the hangings...

197
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,225
- One hears that in all the west.
- Here, one put an end there!

198
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,228
And he/it is not question
that that restarts!

199
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:36,231
What pipelette!
A true mill to speech...

200
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:40,360
You don't have me êcoutê.
My intentions are pacific.

201
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,239
You have nêanmoins the intention
to bring your sheep?

202
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,825
I never have hêsitê, Mile Payton.

203
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,870
In 48 hours, you will have died.

204
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,038
Possible.
But listen me well.

205
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,500
If I die,
I won't be the only one.

206
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,463
Say it to anyone
a you envoyêe here.

207
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:02,674
No one has me envoyêe.

208
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:05,552
This idêe stupid êtait mine.

209
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,181
If you descend,
I take you back.

210
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:12,851
- You dêrangez not.
- I descend, anyway.

211
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:21,401
These people seem himself intêresser
to me... or to you.

212
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,321
They would think
what you is my alliêe?

213
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,865
No, M. Sweet.
No one thinks it.

214
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,034
The colonel wants to see you.

215
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,580
That he/it comes.
Who is the colonel?

216
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,583
The man who sends to me
to bring you to him.

217
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:42,631
He/it seems to me a little doubtful
your colonel...

218
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:46,635
Otherwise, he/it would ask a kid
of man's mission?

219
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,059
You are once you dêjà trompê,
today.

220
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,562
A second mistake
would cost you dearer.

221
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:02,067
To prêsent, follow me.

222
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,784
Finish your glass.

223
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,540
Return the glass
on the back of my hand.

224
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,337
Put a token on the glass.

225
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,228
Pour to drink to these gentlemen
on my note.

226
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,273
Of the questions?

227
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,819
You don't come.

228
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,614
Did you say?

229
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:56,413
Either. You pull more quickly
that that in the rêgion.

230
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,456
Did satisfy you?

231
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:00,125
No. Not nêcessairement.

232
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:04,462
I wanted that you know
that I value you êviter all boredom.

233
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,598
- Well mangê?
- This perfect êtait.

234
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,060
But to the future,
put therefore to the menu...

235
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:21,521
of the sheep and the lamb.

236
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,482
Of the flat civilisês, what.

237
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,757
Now, you are going to come!

238
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,427
Your colonel is impatient to see me.

239
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,680
Rather, yes.
Straddle your horse!

240
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:19,287
I see! The colonel
throw a party in my honor.

241
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,916
You dêraillez?
II doesn't give of feast for you.

242
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,545
- For you, then?
- Either.

243
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:30,006
No, the door of service!

244
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:33,051
If I had known that it was necessary
to pass by there,

245
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:34,970
I would not have come.

246
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:37,305
You didn't have the choice!

247
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,443
Go... one hurries.

248
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,949
This young person pursues me
since my arrivêe in city.

249
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,371
You? She/it goes êpouser the colonel.

250
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,457
Now, I regret to have come.

251
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,626
Tell the colonel that one is there.

252
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:16,094
Malgrê his/her/its hurry to see me,
doesn't your colonel wait for me?

253
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:18,555
I am a man três occupê,
Jumbo.

254
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,682
Curl there.

255
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,643
Your colonel must be
of the nervous kind...

256
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:25,729
A whole arsenal...

257
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,816
I collect the weapons,
M. Sweet.

258
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,236
Jumbo, patient outside.

259
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:41,453
- He/it speaks like a cinglê, Boss.
- Sensible...

260
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,544
- Good evening, Jason.
- Good evening, Johnny.

261
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:52,881
Jumbo has me racontê the tour
with the token.

262
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:55,926
I knew whereas the unknown,
this êtait you.

263
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,012
A cigar?

264
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:05,310
You are the only one to rêussir
that tour, Jason.

265
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:09,397
If it is a distinctive sign,
is better that I stop.

266
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:18,657
- "Colonel?" Since when?
- I waited for this question.

267
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,743
When I came here,

268
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:25,330
I needed a respectable passê.

269
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,960
What of more respectable
and seated that a colonel?

270
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:32,671
A gênêral.

271
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,549
Me too young êtais for that.

272
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:40,595
You roll people from here
for a long time, Johnny?

273
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,474
I am there since...
some more six years.

274
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,269
You are well you dêbrouillê.

275
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,646
The honnêtetê pays! I ignored it.

276
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,861
Then, Jason...

277
00:23:56,027 --> 00:24:00,991
that is what was able well to bring you
to leave Texas?

278
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:06,913
Hey well...
I felt there to the êtroit.

279
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,833
I had need of more than space.

280
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,084
Do you see?

281
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:14,087
I see três well.

282
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:18,842
That should have intrigued you
that I didn't come

283
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,218
in Strong Worth.

284
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,305
The day when one had to
to tackle to the revolver.

285
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:25,223
I don't have rêflêchi there ever.

286
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,933
If you say it...

287
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:30,854
Besides, I am not there allê
either.

288
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:32,898
How?

289
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:36,818
Me êtais not certain to beat you.

290
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:40,155
I have rêflêchi
about the quarrel.

291
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,657
The risk appeared me injustifiê.

292
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:45,619
I assure you.

293
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:52,125
We knew êviter
a stupid fight.

294
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,461
We will be able to in êviter another.

295
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:59,549
You know myself, Johnny.
There is not more pacific than I.

296
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:04,304
In actual fact, I knew you
not this qualitê.

297
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:08,558
But you never committed
without being sure to win.

298
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,812
- Who wishes to lose a battle?
- Precisely.

299
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,023
Won't one therefore, have any problems?

300
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,902
The train arrives tomorrow
with your sheep.

301
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:22,405
Change on board
and continuous on 300 km.

302
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:24,574
I will indemnify you.

303
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:27,035
It is effectively a solution.

304
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:30,163
You could also take your bêtail

305
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,792
and the dêplacer of 300 km.

306
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:36,795
But I won't indemnify you.

307
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:42,592
I would only have to spin...
while abandoning all that, hey?

308
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:49,057
I am sure that that will be easy to you.

309
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:53,144
Someone you rachêtera surely
this ranch at a discount.

310
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:59,693
- Me, for example, Johnny.
- I don't use this name anymore!

311
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:06,158
And of what name you use,
if you are not anymore Johnny Bledsoe?

312
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,495
Stephen Bedford.
Colonel Stephen Bedford.

313
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:15,458
The "colonel..."
It is a name that makes the effect.

314
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:19,629
I would vote well
for a like that name.

315
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:23,675
Warn me,
if you you prêsentes to the êlectionses!

316
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,848
- Charm soirêe. Thank you.
- You don't go nowhere.

317
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:34,477
- Ah good?
- Don't make dazed it, Jason.

318
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,606
We don't have anything dêcidê.

319
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:38,899
But if.

320
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:43,403
Your bêtail will remain in place
and my sheep also.

321
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:46,072
And they will live in harmony.

322
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,491
It is impossible!

323
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:50,744
Then it is regrettable três.

324
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:56,791
- I don't pull anymore since annêeses.
- And that you hold there?

325
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,462
You know it well.
I trained every day.

326
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,255
An advice, do you want?

327
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,384
Accustom your bêtail
to live to the côtêses of my sheep

328
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:09,137
or take the practice.

329
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,097
Count of it.

330
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:13,767
That is?

331
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,728
I will get back there.

332
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:22,192
Good evening, Johnny.

333
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,070
Good evening...

334
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:48,927
Espêces of small saligauds!

335
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:51,930
If I take you
to play with these pêtards,

336
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:54,516
I flank you in prison!

337
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:56,560
Go, ouste!

338
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:59,062
Leave from there!

339
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,739
Will you hunt them, these sheep?

340
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:12,492
They are not prêses
of grazed in the corner!

341
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:14,953
You took a good rouste, yesterday.

342
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,705
This êtait yesterday.

343
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:34,181
There is what you simmered with Steve!

344
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,266
Remain apart from that, Dell.

345
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:40,437
Dad, the fire arms
do never have arrangê the conflicts!

346
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,439
A dead, then another...

347
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:45,358
No one will be tuê,
otherwise some sheep.

348
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,613
Sweet didn't learn to pull
while escaping the fights!

349
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:52,532
To face 5 men
would be an idiocy.

350
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:55,619
But he/it will make it!
II is as entêtê that you.

351
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:59,748
You "dêfendez your rights."
If he/it pulls, he/it will be a "assassin."

352
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:03,627
That is sufficient, girl.
By car! Go back to the ranch!

353
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:06,087
I won't go back!

354
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:08,465
You will make what I order you!

355
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:13,887
I go you in dêbarrasser, Frank.
Her you obêit more.

356
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,306
Me you cêde gladly the place!

357
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:18,391
Watch.

358
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:26,274
He/it is going to see the shêrif.

359
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,240
Are you the shêrif?

360
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:35,742
Do you take this for a tattoo?

361
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,079
You expect
to problems, I see.

362
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:42,624
Where I go,
there won't be any problems.

363
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,084
And where go you?

364
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:46,878
To the fishing! And without waiting.

365
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,340
I am here as citizen.

366
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:53,718
I ask for protection
for my life and my goods.

367
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:57,973
The day when you chose
of êlever of the sheep,

368
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,976
you have renoncê
to your citizen's rights.

369
00:30:01,142 --> 00:30:02,185
One has you êlu...

370
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:07,190
The people who have me êlu
êlêvent that of the bêtail!

371
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:09,818
If my taste for the fishing
surprises you,

372
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:13,864
you are a lot less shrewd
that one doesn't say it.

373
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,256
So-called, the youngsters!

374
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:34,259
- Do you want the spending money?
- Pardi!

375
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,778
M. Sweet, it is useless,
I know it, but I try.

376
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:56,072
Leave me
to drive you elsewhere.

377
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:57,991
No one will be blessê.

378
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,494
Please!

379
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:04,039
Nothing is ever useless,
miss.

380
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:05,957
Do you accept?

381
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,960
Otherwise,
would I be at this place?

382
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:10,504
Wait, one instant.

383
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:13,715
What takes you?

384
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:16,343
II will have of it crowd in the station.

385
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,221
If one sees me with you,
it will be bothersome.

386
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:20,639
Yes, it is true.

387
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,391
Slip thereunder you,
I cover you.

388
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,190
Thank you for your hospitalitê.

389
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:41,785
I could not believe my eyes!

390
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,001
For once, she/it has me obêi!

391
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,268
Funny maniêreses
for a damsel.

392
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:10,981
The damsels are like that, here.
You would have stood some.

393
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:16,403
Being êtranger, I could notice
that your fellow citizens stood some.

394
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,487
Do hold therefore?

395
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:21,658
- Stop yourselves!
- What doesn't go?

396
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,535
All goes well três.

397
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:26,705
- It is here that I descend.
- Do you descend?

398
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,293
How to thank you,
miss?

399
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,129
I wondered how
to cross the crowd.

400
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:36,381
Did you use me?

401
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:39,676
- My amitiês to the ranch!
- Espêce of...

402
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:44,556
The colonel would like him that
does his/her/its fiancêe swear like a carter?

403
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:46,474
You are only a cad!

404
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,449
<i > Seor, < /i > the sheep descend.

405
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:05,410
No, < i > seor.
The sheep leave.

406
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:20,675
Why do you pull on me?

407
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:25,722
Because we don't want
of your sheep.

408
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:28,808
Mr. Sweet!

409
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,101
Mr. Sweet!

410
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:33,939
Your boss won't come.
And that is better!

411
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:39,486
The sheep! They must descend,
it is necessary to water them.

412
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,404
As it is a pity!

413
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,657
Did you well understand me?

414
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:47,410
If only one sheep descends,
you are a dead man!

415
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:51,331
Mr. Sweet!

416
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:56,920
Where are you?

417
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,468
Where are you, gentleman Sweet?

418
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:46,636
Standing!

419
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,642
You other, enter in there!

420
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:54,436
Of the nerve!

421
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,771
Hands on the balustrade!

422
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,027
Angelo?
Take their weapons!

423
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:10,952
Jumbo, it is kind to have come
to help me towards dêbarquer my sheep.

424
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,371
Of what do you speak?

425
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,831
Take down them!

426
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,625
And more quickly than that!

427
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:33,642
Don't make them wait.

428
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,854
Will have you need of that.

429
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,752
You don't lose anything to wait...

430
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:44,921
- Of the problems, boss?
- No, none.

431
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:47,132
But this calmness me inquiête.

432
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,178
The sheep
amênent that of the problems.

433
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:54,556
Why the sheep?

434
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:58,351
All to tell you, Angelo...

435
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:02,272
I had enough of to discuss
with cows.

436
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:04,191
They are so silly.

437
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:07,777
- Are the sheep shrewder?
- On the contrary!

438
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:11,740
But they are easier
to convince and softer.

439
00:37:11,907 --> 00:37:12,949
You are mad.

440
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,953
The sheep will make us kill.
Especially me.

441
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,748
There are things so

442
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:23,084
that one cannot make
in this mêtier.

443
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:25,587
One cannot get married.

444
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,423
Too quickly,
the girl meets widow.

445
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,051
One cannot have any children.

446
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,720
Too quickly,
they meet orphans.

447
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:38,475
And one doesn't even can
to go to drink quietly in city.

448
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:41,269
One meets at the end of a rope.

449
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:46,775
Boss, this mêtier is too sad.
And too dangerous.

450
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,195
Why do you make it?

451
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,201
I believe that me the prêfêre
at any other mêtier.

452
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:04,835
You see, it is I that am mad!

453
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,976
Here is a list of provisions.
Put everything in my cart.

454
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:47,020
I will be at the barber.

455
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:48,772
A small instant...

456
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:52,067
We don't have anything of all that
in rêserve, gentleman.

457
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:54,945
You didn't even read it!

458
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,655
It is that...

459
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:59,282
Believe me on speech, M. Sweet!

460
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:01,493
I don't have anything to sell you.

461
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:05,247
- I see...
- No other store in city?

462
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:08,375
No. And even though,
it would be similar.

463
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,503
The colonel has lancê therefore
an interdiction.

464
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,880
It is not what I said!

465
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,550
I am not there for anything!

466
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:24,266
Hê! You!

467
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:30,188
Do the sheep make you to drool of it?

468
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,068
Do you want to win a dollar besides?

469
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:39,990
I am going to load you
to make circulate an information.

470
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,075
It is more difficult dêjà...

471
00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:46,746
Let know that I am going to make me
to shave and to take a bath.

472
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:47,873
Left once,

473
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,294
I want to find this cart
full of these goods.

474
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:55,672
Me you prêcise that it is not about
of a fantasy.

475
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,135
That they are there, otherwise
I will handle it, in my way.

476
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,721
I am one is not able to sêrieuxes anymore.

477
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:04,848
And the dollar besides?

478
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:26,745
Nothing easier.

479
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,960
Is all there?

480
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:38,757
To what do I have to of êtê to have served?

481
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:43,386
Maybe to your threat
to charge to you yourself of it.

482
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,185
But especially to the fact that I am I
portê parking for you.

483
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:54,689
Aprês to have forbidden the tradesmen
to deal with me?

484
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:57,317
No. Me there êtais for nothing, Jason.

485
00:41:57,484 --> 00:42:02,239
They thought that I would be able to
there to be opposê.

486
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:06,952
I have expliquê merely
that that me êtait indiffêrent.

487
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,329
Will I therefore buy in city?

488
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:11,331
How therefore!

489
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:14,209
To your service.

490
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:18,964
Jumbo, where you hid?
You make yourself rare, these days!

491
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:22,050
Ah yes?
Well, me frêquente not the sheep!

492
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:25,345
I don't adore any either,
I must say.

493
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:27,973
And I don't like the shepherds!

494
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:30,976
I must recognize
that they are repulsive.

495
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,144
Ah yes?

496
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,282
Mistrust the colonel.

497
00:42:45,448 --> 00:42:48,326
He/it has annulê his/her/its order
to the tradesmen.

498
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:51,955
But he/it must have a better
idêe derriêre the head!

499
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,212
Stop there!

500
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:42,214
Do I have the choice?

501
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,550
Of the top of the hill,
you seemed a man's.

502
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:48,136
And what do I have air now?

503
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:51,181
What you amêne?

504
00:43:51,348 --> 00:43:53,725
One doesn't offer to drink
to the visitors?

505
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:57,145
The visits are rare,
but you are the welcome.

506
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,444
Dad and the other ranchers
are last night himself rêunis.

507
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:08,698
- Since him êtait question of you...
- Are you willing?

508
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:12,828
II êtait question of you.
Do you want to know their intentions?

509
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:14,538
Let me guess!

510
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,792
If the government doesn't hunt me,
will they make sêcession?

511
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:21,336
No, gentleman Sweet.

512
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:26,508
We have dêcidê that...
us us êtions alarmês to wrong.

513
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:29,678
The bêtail and the sheep will get along.

514
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:32,180
It is too beautiful to be true.

515
00:44:32,347 --> 00:44:35,225
I understand your suspicions.

516
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:41,439
Unless you held
to the problems,

517
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:44,276
be a little less hostile.

518
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:48,822
I had enough problems
for a whole existence.

519
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:50,365
How that, "hostile?"

520
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:54,953
If they want that one is friends,
I will cover them with kisses.

521
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,664
To prove our good faith,

522
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,834
I had to invite you to the feast,
tomorrow.

523
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:09,926
It is the big soirêe of the annêe.
And the only one, of the rest.

524
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,220
Will you come?

525
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:15,307
If you hold there.

526
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:17,642
Of course.

527
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:20,854
Well, then I will be there.

528
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:27,736
Well. 19 h 30, to the City hall.
One will dance until the dawn.

529
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:29,613
Just a question:

530
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,991
The colonel will grant to me him
a dance with you?

531
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,744
I handle it.

532
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,791
- Goodbye, M. Sweet.
- Goodbye, damsel.

533
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,590
Then, boss, one has a girl,
now?

534
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:51,551
That doesn't concern you.

535
00:45:54,471 --> 00:45:56,056
She/it is pretty, in more.

536
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:04,105
This is not easy!
Same dad arrives there!

537
00:46:05,774 --> 00:46:09,402
Watch well.
You leave like that.

538
00:46:10,612 --> 00:46:12,572
Ready? Let's go there!

539
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:17,035
<i > One puts the foot, one rests the foot < /i>

540
00:46:17,202 --> 00:46:19,913
<i > Then one rests the foot on the ground < /i>

541
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,833
<i > Then one puts the foot < /i>
<i > One rests the foot < /i>

542
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:25,627
<i > And one rests the foot on the ground < /i>

543
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,588
<i > A step on the left, a small tour < /i>

544
00:46:28,755 --> 00:46:31,424
<i > A step on the right, a small tour < /i>

545
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:34,344
<i > on the left again, a small tour < /i>

546
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:37,222
<i > It is simple as hello.

547
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:58,910
Does Sacrêe celebrate, hey? All is free.

548
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:03,415
The entrêe is free,
but how much one to the exit pays?

549
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,585
Don't tell to me...

550
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:12,549
It is not necessary to tell me
of the like that things.

551
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:16,761
They will play you maybe
a tour, tonight.

552
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,890
- The short noise?
- Me me mêfie.

553
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:21,641
They offered me the peace.

554
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:25,770
Ah yes? Hey well, to your place,
I would not trust them.

555
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:29,274
Don't believe everything that says
a pretty girl.

556
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,902
He/it happens to them to lie.

557
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:38,783
M. Sweet, I am happy
that you came!

558
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,536
- Gentlemen...
- Delighted to see you again.

559
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:43,371
Is this the dances promised?

560
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:44,831
Not again.

561
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:48,251
But a friend
dies of desire to know you.

562
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:54,341
Say... I have oubliê to inform me.

563
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:57,511
You knew that one had me invitê
tonight?

564
00:47:57,677 --> 00:48:01,097
Of course.
Each me obêit, here.

565
00:48:01,264 --> 00:48:03,683
It is not quite exact.

566
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:06,895
Me, for example,
I act without your permission.

567
00:48:07,062 --> 00:48:10,982
I forgot, Jason.
Each here me obêit, except you.

568
00:48:13,777 --> 00:48:16,238
Here is miss Laura Whitcomb.

569
00:48:16,404 --> 00:48:17,864
Good evening.

570
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,244
Whitcomb mile, you died
of desire to know me?

571
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,579
- Hey well, me...
- No, let...

572
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:29,459
The êcoute not, chêrie.
Occupy you of him, it is all.

573
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:35,090
- Do we dance?
- With pleasure!

574
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:44,599
M. Sweet... Mile Amy Masterson.

575
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:45,892
Enchantê.

576
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,478
She/it dies of desire to know you.

577
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:54,151
Masterson mile, die you
of desire to know me?

578
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:56,611
- Who told you that?
- No matter.

579
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:59,156
Do we dance?
Oh, excuse me.

580
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,203
As you are flighty,
M. Sweet!

581
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:19,843
M. Sweet, Mile Raffery.

582
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,929
I died of desire to know you!

583
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,859
Do you dine with the three?

584
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:39,696
No other exit.
They hold there.

585
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:41,948
Here is my pêre.

586
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:44,201
Enchantê, M. Sweet.

587
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:47,412
- You have fun, me espêre.
- As ever!

588
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:48,955
Then to later.

589
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:51,958
I am going to give you a tray.
Let.

590
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:56,505
Milt, you know that food
don't go fly off.

591
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:59,424
Dance therefore. Me, I savor.

592
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:02,636
- That agrees to me.
- To the fact...

593
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:05,931
This marshmallow that they pass you,
it is doubtful.

594
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:10,977
You believe to have sêduit these girls
by your only charm?

595
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:15,148
I confess that that doesn't often arrive.

596
00:50:16,775 --> 00:50:19,694
That is part of their plan,
whatever he/it is.

597
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:23,990
One puts itself of it, of their plan!
I have fun madly!

598
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:26,034
Thank you. All goes well.

599
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:29,079
Does one have fun, Jason?

600
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:40,090
Hold, one for each.

601
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:08,368
Us êtions not destinês
to dance together, hey?

602
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:10,120
Let's go take air.

603
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:14,833
- What will the colonel say?
- He/it is just derriêre you.

604
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:19,379
She/it will only get used to his/her head.
To what good to antagonize it?

605
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:22,382
The breeze of in the evening and my fiancêe
are yours.

606
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:23,717
Thank you, colonel.

607
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,179
Me rêclamez nor one, nor the other!

608
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:37,522
- Let's go sit down.
- Well.

609
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,445
One says that it is
when she/it gets engaged

610
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:45,906
that a woman
is the happiest.

611
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:48,617
- Is this truth?
- It is what one says.

612
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,205
- Is the marriage for when?
- Next month, the 22.

613
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:55,457
- Fêlicitations.
- Thank you.

614
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,545
- Would a question bore you?
- Not at all.

615
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:03,757
That has us all intriguêses.

616
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:06,468
Why have chosen you
this rêgion?

617
00:52:07,677 --> 00:52:11,806
That goes back up to... about seven years.

618
00:52:12,724 --> 00:52:16,353
I passed that way
to go to get married me.

619
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:20,273
I wanted, for the premiêre time,

620
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,026
a place where me êtablir.

621
00:52:24,152 --> 00:52:25,403
Are you mariê?

622
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:27,489
No.

623
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:33,912
No. My fiancêe...
worked in a bank.

624
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,456
There was a holdup.

625
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:41,127
This êtait a few days
before our marriage, she/it was tuêe.

626
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:47,926
I have retrouvê
and livrê all guilty parties.

627
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:50,262
Indeed?

628
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,305
All, except one.

629
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,351
The one that had tirê.

630
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:59,104
He/it is called Choctaw Neal.

631
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,066
I will recover it, him also.

632
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:10,115
Rêcemment, wanting to install me,
I have pensê to this vallêe.

633
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:15,036
It was necessary to think about the bêtail!

634
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:19,624
I don't have... a passion
for the sheep.

635
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:23,837
But has... I have jouê to the poker.

636
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:27,340
The loser didn't have any money
to cover his/her/its bets.

637
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:30,135
But he/it had some sheep.

638
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:38,101
A pity that the loser
didn't have the bêtail.

639
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:43,648
Would try yourselves to win of the time
not to dance with me?

640
00:53:43,815 --> 00:53:45,192
What do you say of it?

641
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:22,020
What happens?

642
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:30,237
All is parê, boss.

643
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:33,156
While you had fun,

644
00:54:33,323 --> 00:54:36,493
my men drove
your sheep to the train.

645
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:41,581
This stroke of whistle meant
that all is on board, except you.

646
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:46,920
Shrewd Três.

647
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:56,638
- It is good, Jumbo.
- Go! Under way!

648
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,892
Forward, all!

649
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:04,729
Climb therefore in there.

650
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:13,989
The driver won't open
before having browsed 300 km.

651
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:18,285
Aprês that, dêbarque where you want.

652
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:21,204
Jason, don't come back here.

653
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:24,666
One will meet again, Johnny.

654
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:31,965
- Milt, there are 500 dollars.
- Why that?

655
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:34,092
- For your êcuries.
- Hey?

656
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:36,511
- Help Milt to go up.
- But...

657
00:55:37,053 --> 00:55:40,724
Stop!
You cannot make me that!

658
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,486
Good dêbarras.

659
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:57,616
Me you fêlicite, Steve!
You have organisê well that.

660
00:55:57,782 --> 00:55:59,993
Thanks to the help of Dell.

661
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:03,330
Of course.

662
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:06,833
I never had
as shame of my life!

663
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:10,629
My daughter is mad!

664
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,924
You like the sheep again,
boss?

665
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:19,471
To make that to one of theirs!

666
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,852
I have êtê a pioneer, here.
300 inhabitants when I am there arrivê!

667
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,979
And how much now?

668
00:56:28,146 --> 00:56:30,607
What that can make you?

669
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:34,694
To the devil, the numbers!
It is the mentalitê, that counts!

670
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:38,323
To return in city,
it is necessary to come out of here.

671
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:41,409
If you had me êcoutê,
one would be not here!

672
00:56:41,576 --> 00:56:46,414
- She/it had me well.
- You and your mad charm...

673
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:49,125
Does that give you an idêe?

674
00:56:52,462 --> 00:56:53,922
And how!

675
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:56,341
I am going to pull on the padlock.

676
00:56:58,718 --> 00:57:02,389
- It is too êtroit.
- Me, I try.

677
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:04,850
What do you make?

678
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:08,687
I play the bêlier.

679
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:12,649
Pull me from there! Pull me!

680
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:19,614
You saw Milt,
when the colonel said:

681
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,576
"Do help Milt to go up?"

682
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:25,996
Hand us a tournêe!

683
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:28,748
You regret that Sweet
did leave, Jumbo?

684
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:32,210
Before you took your revenge?

685
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:34,004
II left in time!

686
00:57:34,212 --> 00:57:38,216
II didn't want anymore to face you,
hey, that is that?

687
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:41,803
II had me by surprise!
Demand to the Chinese!

688
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,805
Me êtudiais his/her/its technique!

689
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:48,643
You the êtudiais also, the day
where do you have dêbarquê his/her/its sheep?

690
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:54,399
That is sufficient!

691
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,570
We celebrated the end of the conflicts.

692
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:02,324
Let's drink to these sheep...

693
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:05,911
who have quittê forever
the Vallêe of the Powder!

694
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:15,420
One doesn't wait for train.

695
00:58:22,177 --> 00:58:24,846
That goes like that.

696
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:31,311
- Everybody descends!
- Thank you for the round-trip.

697
00:58:31,937 --> 00:58:33,188
He/it came back!

698
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:45,075
Angelo, dêbarque the sheep.
I announce the good news.

699
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:48,453
He/it is going to have trouble there.

700
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:53,458
This man enjoys here!

701
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:56,878
I cannot believe it!

702
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:01,883
Well the hello.

703
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:06,054
Pretty dress. Me espêre that you will have
a beautiful marriage.

704
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:10,433
M. Sweet, I can imagine
your feelings...

705
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,310
Why be so kind?

706
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:14,437
I am as you, Mile Dell.

707
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:17,732
My kindness,
it is necessary to know itself/themselves in mêfier.

708
00:59:18,024 --> 00:59:21,361
The important citizens
do celebrate their victory?

709
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:28,618
Be prudent.

710
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:34,249
It is the most superfluous advice
that one ever has donnê.

711
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:41,506
He/it comes here!

712
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:54,603
I learned
that you celebrated my dêpart.

713
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:57,898
I came back
me rêjouir with you.

714
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:03,069
Decide you, Jumbo.
The hêsitation has tuê more of a man.

715
01:00:04,446 --> 01:00:06,364
He/it doesn't want a fight.

716
01:00:07,824 --> 01:00:11,620
So-called, me rêgle my business
and I leave you the free field.

717
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:13,747
Make therefore, Milt.

718
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:18,585
Me rachête my êcurie, colonel,
at the cost of sale.

719
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:23,548
Less 20 dollars, price of one night
passêe with sheep!

720
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:31,056
I wait outside for you.

721
01:00:32,557 --> 01:00:37,312
You must have understood
that I have the intention to remain here.

722
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:39,523
If I leave, it will be...

723
01:00:41,441 --> 01:00:43,652
Useless of êpiloguer.

724
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,112
Your hat, do I pray you?

725
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:48,198
- My hat?
- It is that.

726
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:56,081
He/it seems that...

727
01:00:56,289 --> 01:01:01,002
your small plot
to hunt has me êchouê.

728
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:04,506
You are going to get therefore
to slaughter my sheep.

729
01:01:04,923 --> 01:01:07,300
As well as my shepherds.

730
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:12,430
Then the things will intensify
for you, gentlemen the ranchers.

731
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:19,229
You see, I put
many names in there.

732
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,482
One is going to pull a winner.

733
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:25,235
The one that will win...

734
01:01:27,112 --> 01:01:30,157
will have right personally
to a small visit.

735
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:34,536
Then, he/it risks to meet
transformê in êcumoire.

736
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:50,051
Choose one, Jumbo, of it.

737
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:02,355
Hold! It is you, colonel.

738
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:06,526
That doesn't surprise you many,
this is not?

739
01:02:06,693 --> 01:02:10,489
Being donnê that your name represents
on all bulletins.

740
01:02:11,364 --> 01:02:14,075
So much pain,
to provoke me in duel?

741
01:02:14,242 --> 01:02:16,953
You are a sly man.

742
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,374
And I am straightforward três.
That me dêsavantage distinctly.

743
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:23,960
Excuse me.

744
01:02:26,963 --> 01:02:31,551
You wonder why
I find it "sly."

745
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,845
He/it had more a reason

746
01:02:34,012 --> 01:02:37,390
of himself dêbarrasser of Milt
at the same time as of me.

747
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:39,684
This is not?

748
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:41,186
Nonsense!

749
01:02:41,937 --> 01:02:45,690
I would have pariê 100 dollars
that you would say that, Johnny.

750
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:49,861
While we looked for
an exit in this wagon,

751
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:54,699
Milt and I have for a long time
parlê of the colonel.

752
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:59,955
The colonel has Milt envoyê
to the capital of the state,

753
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:04,167
where, since annêeses, him achête
of the "public earth" shares.

754
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,754
This same earth that serves you
of free grazing.

755
01:03:10,382 --> 01:03:12,634
One waits that you deny, Johnny.

756
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:16,137
Why would I deny it?

757
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:20,433
I have it achetê
for the association of the êleveurses.

758
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,769
By simple measure of prudence.

759
01:03:23,687 --> 01:03:26,982
Here is that proves well...

760
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:29,776
that one cannot trust Milt.

761
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:32,612
He/it affirmed to have achetê to your name.

762
01:03:32,988 --> 01:03:36,199
- Can be straight ahead transfêrê.
- Of course.

763
01:03:36,408 --> 01:03:39,744
Transfêrons therefore immediately
those rights.

764
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:44,332
You don't see that he/it tries
of dêtourner the attention of him?

765
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:46,251
Do you refuse the transfer?

766
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:48,086
Stop, Jason.

767
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:49,629
One wants this transfer.

768
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:53,425
I refuse to leave me
to dictate my conduct!

769
01:03:54,926 --> 01:03:59,890
Cry, gentlemen,
on your beautiful lost illusions.

770
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,565
As one is mistaken.
I didn't believe never again to see you again.

771
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:10,442
Them either.

772
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:14,946
I am going to inspect my êcurie.

773
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:20,785
We never have êvitê
this fight of Strong Worth.

774
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:26,291
If we must fight,
will be the earliest best.

775
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:30,086
You are dêsavantagê, dês now.

776
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:34,799
I am going to straddle my horse
and to leave the city.

777
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:40,096
Without a look in arriêre,
because you won't pull me in the back.

778
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:44,142
But doesn't count on me
to have this scruple.

779
01:05:27,477 --> 01:05:29,855
Johnny mêne the beautiful life, one would say.

780
01:05:39,614 --> 01:05:40,657
Stop!

781
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:45,620
Is it why?

782
01:05:45,787 --> 01:05:47,914
Tell to him that Choctaw is there.

783
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:50,792
Sensible.
But you remain in saddle.

784
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:53,545
Let, Jumbo.
Enter, gentlemen.

785
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:55,839
I didn't wait so early for you.

786
01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:57,966
Why waste the time?

787
01:06:01,553 --> 01:06:05,724
Why not to liquidate it yourself?
You êtais good gunman.

788
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:07,976
I am it always.

789
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:12,063
And why you some
would not you charge, the boys?

790
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:18,236
You two, he/it made you
to throw in jail.

791
01:06:19,237 --> 01:06:22,991
You, Choctaw, he/it has you traquê
aprês attacks it of the bank.

792
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:25,535
Does one find it where?

793
01:06:27,037 --> 01:06:30,207
There, out in the country.

794
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:34,836
Only, with Mexican shepherds
and of the sheep.

795
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:39,007
Jason Sweet, êlevant of the sheep!
The beautiful history...

796
01:06:39,174 --> 01:06:41,968
Hê, Johnny.
If one broke the crust?

797
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:46,556
Of course. I tell the cook
of you prêparer something.

798
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:17,671
For example!
It is kind to come to see me!

799
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:19,548
It is always a pleasure.

800
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:26,221
Wait, I would not owe me mêfier
of your kindness?

801
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:31,810
Forget that. If me spiteful êtais,
towards all those that have me blessê,

802
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,896
I would be angry at the whole world.

803
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:41,194
- What you amêne?
- Hey well, it is embarrassing enough...

804
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:47,868
I want to buy the b.uf.

805
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:51,788
M. Sweet, are you tired of the sheep?

806
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:55,041
The êlever doesn't oblige me
to eat them.

807
01:07:57,169 --> 01:07:59,921
There is a herd farther.
Let's go choose.

808
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:05,343
Hang your horse in the wagon.

809
01:08:06,428 --> 01:08:08,555
He/it will be able to dêgourdir.

810
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:28,033
You don't get married anymore, one says.

811
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,078
And yes...

812
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:37,751
When dad learned
that you had said truly,

813
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:39,336
hey well...

814
01:08:41,922 --> 01:08:44,007
Did you know it before?

815
01:08:45,175 --> 01:08:46,426
And yes.

816
01:08:47,802 --> 01:08:49,971
Him êtait bad três?

817
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:56,895
The weight of his/her/its aurêole
would not have him donnê the migraine.

818
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,235
And you would have me laissêe
the êpouser without saying anything?

819
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:07,030
II wanted to forget his/her/its passê,
he/it seemed.

820
01:09:07,906 --> 01:09:11,368
Besides, the women
have a weak for the rascals.

821
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:12,661
But not me?

822
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:17,332
Besides, you pursue
