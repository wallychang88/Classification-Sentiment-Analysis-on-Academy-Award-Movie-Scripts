1
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:46,766
This is the story of a ship

2
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,097
(Cheering)

3
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:40,603
(Bosun's whistle)

4
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,888
Ship's company...'shun!

5
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,147
Turn aft, right and left.

6
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,224
Turn!

7
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,565
- Open fire!
- Open fire!

8
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,809
Shoot!

9
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:34,782
Look at the Huns, sir. They're jumping
overboard in full marching order.

10
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,163
Look at that. Come in, the water's lovely!

11
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,716
Look at'em. Somebody must have
blown a whistle. Layer on.

12
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,055
There are a lot more caïques to port, sir,
and some bigger transports.

13
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,602
Shift to the big transports.

14
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,067
Aye aye, sir. Check, check, check.
Shift target right. Follow TBI.

15
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,775
(Explosion)

16
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,866
Can I fire torpedoes at the transports?

17
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,583
All right, get your old mouldies off,
but not more than two at any transport.

18
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,121
Flags, make to the division.
Train tubes to port.

19
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:20,294
- Ready port.
- Main office, make Tommy Tommy port.

20
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,376
(Explosion)

21
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:26,851
That's got'em!

22
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:30,809
- Shoot when you see the whites of their eyes.
- 0-3-5. 1-0 left

23
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:31,936
Bingo!

24
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,563
- Fire one!
- Fire one!

25
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,114
- Fire two!
- Fire two!

26
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,862
Torpedoes fired, sir.

27
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,170
Our fish have hit, sir,
and one transport has blown up.

28
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,669
There goes another.

29
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:58,218
Big stuff.
The rest of the division are doing well.

30
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,672
Must be an enemy destroyer, sir.

31
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,932
- Right, engage her.
- Aye aye, sir.

32
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:06,181
Check check check.
Shift target left Follow TBI.

33
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,328
Take this. It was my mother's.

34
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:25,700
Ah!

35
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,092
- Trainer on.
- Layer on.

36
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,128
- Left gun ready.
- Right gun ready.

37
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,721
0-4-0. 1-0 left.

38
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:58,537
I'll lay you 10-1 they're all Germans.

39
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:02,713
You'd never get the Macaronis to tackle
a job like that, not for love nor money.

40
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,832
The Eyeties will do anything for money.

41
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:08,501
Anything but fight.
That's why they were so lousy in the last war.

42
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:12,634
That's on account of their warm,
languorous southern temperament.

43
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,440
- Cocoa, sir.
- Thanks, Snotty.

44
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:21,813
Thank you.

45
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,479
Here comes the dawn of a new day, Flags.
It could be an uncomfortable one.

46
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,530
Yes, sir. It's a very pretty sky, sir.
Somebody sent me a calendar rather like that.

47
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,069
- Did it have a squadron of Dorniers on it?
- No, sir.

48
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:36,168
- That's where art parts company with reality.
- You're right, sir.

49
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,084
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

50
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,691
Aircraft in sight astern, sir.

51
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,396
Angle of sight 2-0.

52
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,237
Looks like a couple of squadrons
of Junkers 88's.

53
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,574
- Starboard 20.
- Aye aye, sir. Starboard 20.

54
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:08,994
- One blast on the siren.
- Aye aye, sir.

55
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,156
(Siren)

56
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,838
Aircraft in sight, bearing green 1-7-0.
Angle of sight 2-0.

57
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,798
Short-range weapons. Aircraft in sight.
Stand by for dive bombers.

58
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,396
Open fire!

59
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,778
Shoot.

60
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:45,330
The first wave are diving now.

61
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:46,619
Hard a-port.

62
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,372
- Sound two blasts.
- Aye aye, sir.

63
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,540
All guns, sector independent.

64
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,771
Down, everybody

65
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,115
Hard a-starboard.

66
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,125
We got one. Try and get two next time.

67
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:29,756
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

68
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,292
All guns shift to the next wave. Red 1-4-0.

69
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,591
Short-range weapons.

70
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,966
Shift to the next wave. Bearing red 1-4-0.

71
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,276
- Hard a-starboard.
- Hard a-starboard.

72
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:50,279
- Sound one blast.
- Aye aye, sir.

73
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:53,409
(Gunfire)

74
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,826
We've winged that one.

75
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,038
Down, everybody!

76
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:16,509
Midships.

77
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,106
Aye aye, sir. Midships.

78
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,936
There's another wave on the port side, sir.

79
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,016
(Explosion)

80
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,854
- Hard a-starboard.
- Hard a-starboard, sir.

81
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,490
(Rapid gunfire)

82
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,088
The leader of this wave
is coming much lower, sir.

83
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,330
He'll probably hit our mast.

84
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:09,995
Well done.
We've got him, but I'm afraid he's got us too.

85
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,073
Midships.

86
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,422
Midships, sir.

87
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:20,132
- Carry on firing. Here comes the next wave.
- All guns are still in action.

88
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:37,478
Stop both.

89
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:47,282
No answer from the engine room, sir.
The telegraphs must be shot away.

90
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,995
I'm afraid we're going over.

91
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,715
Pass the word to cast loose the Carley floats.

92
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,799
(Gunfire and explosions)

93
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,471
Abandon ship!

94
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,400
(Echoing)
I'll sign for her now I'lll sign for her now.

95
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:57,028
I'll sign for her now I'll sign for her now.

96
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:19,309
- Has Satterthwaite been sighted?
- No, sir, but it's just on ten o'clock.

97
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,638
(Banging)

98
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:23,528
Stop that hammering, Edgecombe.
I can't hear myself think.

99
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,030
Aye aye. sir

100
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,368
Tell No.1 to fall in the hands
on the quarterdeck.

101
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,961
Shall we have it on the desk or the shelf, sir?

102
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,297
Shelf. We'll have the usual one on the desk.

103
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,004
- Wedding dress, sir?
- Yes.

104
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,855
- It's here, sir.
- Good. Give it to me.

105
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:09,123
- Mr Satterthwaite's coming on board, sir.
- Is No.1 bringing him down? Hands all aft?

106
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,197
(Knock at door)

107
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,875
Mr Satterthwaite, sir.

108
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,497
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

109
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,420
- Everything in order?
- Certainly.

110
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:17,588
We'd better get this little ceremony over.

111
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:21,134
- Were you satisfied with the trial?
- Yes, she's a well-found ship.

112
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,264
We'll be hoisting the ensign
in a couple of minutes, Edgecombe.

113
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:27,428
- Now, then.
- Are you prepared to take over the ship, sir?

114
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,222
Yes, I'll sign for her now.

115
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:41,698
Watch your head, sir.
Watch your head, sir.

116
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,075
Watch your head, sir.

117
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,668
(Klaxon)

118
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,387
- You can smoke if you like.
- Thank you, sir.

119
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,185
- Will you have one, sir?
- No, thanks, not at the moment.

120
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,766
- Heard from your missus?
- I had a letter last week.

121
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:07,566
- One of the usuals, full of complaints.
- What's wrong?

122
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,898
Her mother was took bad
and had to go to hospital.

123
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,697
That old woman's always in trouble.
I think she enjoys it.

124
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,020
What's the matter with her?

125
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,613
Last time it was her back,
this time it's her stomach.

126
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,077
It seems she can't keep anything down.
It's not for want of trying.

127
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,208
- You'll be glad to be going to sea.
- To put it mildly, sir!

128
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:36,133
- Darling! I thought you were never coming.
- Everything under control?

129
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:39,683
Far from it. We've been in an uproar all day
since your telegram came.

130
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:40,761
Daddy!

131
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,026
Hello, Bobby.

132
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:51,026
- We've been waiting for hours.
- Mummy wanted us to go to bed.

133
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:54,492
- We saw the ship, Daddy.
- We took our tea on the cliffs and saw it go by.

134
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,412
- Not "it", Lavvy. Her.
- That's right.

135
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,868
She looked beautiful, Teddy.

136
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,957
How fast was she going? Was it 40 knots?

137
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,960
Good heavens, no. She was only doing 20.

138
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:05,256
- But she can do more than that, can't she?
- You bet she can.

139
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:08,302
Take the car round.
Then give Ellen a hand with dinner.

140
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,588
- Good evening, Edgecombe.
- Evening ma'am.

141
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,598
I hope it's a good dinner. I'm starving.

142
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:16,557
- Can I tell him what it is, Mummy?
- It's a surprise. She mustn't spoil it.

143
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,939
- Bobby, keep still. How long have you got?
- Till the morning.

144
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,692
Can we come to the dockyard?

145
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:24,358
No, son. We're commissioning,
making a rush job of it.

146
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:27,277
- But Mummy promised...
- That's enough. You heard Daddy.

147
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:30,446
But we shall be able to come on board
before you go, shan't we?

148
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:33,201
- Well, we'll make time somehow.
- When, Daddy? When?

149
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,041
Bobby, don't be so persistent.

150
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:38,419
Children, it's dreadfully late.
You really will have to go to bed.

151
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,495
Oh, Mummy.

152
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,170
Daddy will come up and say good night
if you're quick.

153
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:43,712
But I want to hear about the ship.

154
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:47,547
I'll tell you about it in the morning.
You can fire as many questions as you like.

155
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,008
Be good, do as your mother tells you,
and go to bed.

156
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,683
- Can I ask questions, too?
- You never do anything else.

157
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,356
Go on. Off you go, both of you.

158
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,938
- I'll be up in ten minutes. Promise.
- Promise?

159
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,777
- Are you coming up, too, Mummy?
- Yes.

160
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,898
Come on, Lavvy, I'll race you.

161
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:03,659
Wait. That's not fair!

162
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:07,412
They've been wild with excitement all day.

163
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:10,078
Darling, you must be exhausted.
I'll get you a drink.

164
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,953
Whisky and soda or a cocktail?

165
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,494
As it's a gala evening,
let's have a Kinross special.

166
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,955
I guessed it. It's all ready, only wants the ice.

167
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,500
I made a private bet
that you'd forget the Cointreau.

168
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:23,053
Wrong again.
I had a sort of feeling this was an occasion.

169
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,425
Were the trials satisfactory?
Were you pleased?

170
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:29,475
More than pleased. She's a lovely ship.
Does what she's told without a murmur.

171
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:32,014
Why are you making a rush job
of the commissioning?

172
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:35,152
- I like getting things done quickly.
- Is that the only reason?

173
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:38,779
We're living in strange times, darling.
It's as well to be prepared.

174
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:40,569
Yes, I suppose it is.

175
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,363
It's nothing to worry about.

176
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:46,078
No, of course not.
Here, try this. It may be a bit too sweet.

177
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,958
My love.
My love.

178
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,631
Just right, not a bit too sweet.

179
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,051
Miss me?

180
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,300
Of course not. I never gave you a thought.

181
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:57,924
What's the surprise for dinner?

182
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:00,643
Grouse. Maureen sent us a brace
from Scotland.

183
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,559
There's a girl of fine perception.

184
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:05,439
They're a bit high, but I expect you'll like that.

185
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:06,680
Is that a new dress?

186
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,810
Oh, no, darling. I've had it for ages.

187
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:12,729
- I swear I've never clapped eyes on it before.
- Only about 20 times, my love.

188
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:16,234
Perhaps it's you that looked new.
As good as new, anyway.

189
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,994
- Is there going to be a war, do you think?
- Yes, I think there is.

190
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:24,325
Oh.

191
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:28,080
No good worrying about it till it comes.
Not much good then, really.

192
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,164
No.

193
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,928
Don't be sad.

194
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,253
I'm not sad, really. I'm just sort of...

195
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,767
gathering myself together.

196
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,179
- Any more Kinross special left in the shaker?
- Yes, of course.

197
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:47,647
However busy you are, and however quickly
you've got to get your commissioning done,

198
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:51,777
I should like to come on board just once
before you go to sea to give the ship my love.

199
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:54,400
You'll have to.
My cabin's got to be made presentable.

200
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,578
- Is the chintz all right?
- First class.

201
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:00,575
Good. We'd better drink these up quickly
and go up to the children.

202
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,788
Dinner will be ready in a minute.

203
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,871
Here we go.

204
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,124
Here we go.

205
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,901
Swim to the float.

206
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,571
Swim to the float.

207
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,286
(Coughing and spluttering)

208
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,346
(Gunfire)

209
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,312
(Aircraft returns)

210
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,991
(Aircraft flies over)

211
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,438
Heave!

212
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,792
I've got some brandy in my Gieves.

213
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:48,478
Kath.

214
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:51,941
Kath.

215
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,111
Kath.

216
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:15,262
Here's the paper, dear.

217
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:18,267
I shan't have time
to do more than look at the headlines.

218
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:21,152
- There you are, then.
- It don't look too good, does it?

219
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,276
Oh, you can't believe anything they say.
Look at all the fuss we had last year.

220
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,528
Everybody flying about in aeroplanes
and making speeches.

221
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,370
After all that, nothing happened.

222
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:33,581
Nothing happened to us,
but a hell of a lot happened to other people.

223
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:36,544
- Do you really think we'll have another war?
- Looks like it.

224
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,545
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

225
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,081
You may see it quicker than you bargained for.

226
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:45,464
I don't believe that Hitler'd be so silly.
What would he expect to gain by having a war?

227
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:48,848
World domination,
that's what that little rat's after.

228
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:51,811
They haven't got enough to eat in Germany
as it is.

229
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:54,856
Mrs Blacket's nephew,
the one that travels in underwear,

230
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,308
came back from Berlin two months ago.

231
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:01,490
- He said they was all half-starved.
- I can't help what Mrs Blacket's nephew says.

232
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,483
- I think we're for it.
- Well, if we have another war, I give up, see,

233
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,530
after all we went through last time.

234
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:11,414
All you went through? You was too young
and innocent to know about anything.

235
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:16,040
Don't talk so silly. You know perfectly well
how old I am, so don't pretend you don't.

236
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,298
You'll always be young and innocent to me.

237
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,838
Will I indeed, now?

238
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:23,720
If you ask me, you've got a hangover
from all that beer you put away last night.

239
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:24,881
I must be going.

240
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:28,020
- Is Mother coming down?
- I promised I'd call her. Wait a minute.

241
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,472
Mother? Walter's just going.

242
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:33,230
- You'd better come down as you are.
- That will be nice.

243
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:38,107
Will you get ashore after commissioning?
Before you go to sea, I mean.

244
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,908
That all depends. Don't forget
to put those bulbs in when the time comes.

245
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,363
- You and your bulbs!
- Goodbye, old girl.

246
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,083
Walter Hardy, whatever is the matter with you?

247
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,372
Anyone would think
you was going away for ever.

248
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,587
You never know.

249
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,959
You ought be ashamed of yourself, saying that.

250
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,301
And give them a piece of my mind.

251
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,008
Here comes Mother.

252
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,097
That spirit lamp of mine
will be the death of me yet.

253
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:07,191
- What's the matter with it?
- It blew up again. Frightened the wits out of me.

254
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,191
You will put in too much methylated.

255
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:12,736
What do you want to go fussing about
with spirit lamps in your bedroom for?

256
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:15,356
You could pop down to the kitchen.
Nobody'd notice.

257
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,162
I've made my own tea
in my own bedroom all my life.

258
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:20,162
I don't see any reason to stop now.

259
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,659
Yes, but that doesn't happen to be
your own bedroom. It's my spare.

260
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:27,294
If you go on blowing things up in it,
it won't be fit to sleep in.

261
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,298
Stop it, you two. I've got to go now.

262
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:32,464
A nice thing,
when my own daughter starts criticising me.

263
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:36,215
Oh, shut up, Mother. Say goodbye to Walter.
That's what you came down for.

264
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,842
- Will you get ashore again?
- All depends on Hitler.

265
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,556
Who does he think he is, anyway?

266
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:45,068
That's the spirit! Goodbye, Mother.
Look after Kath for me.

267
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:48,196
Don't you two go nagging each other
from morning to night.

268
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,320
Nagging?

269
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,692
I like that, I must say.

270
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,369
Come on, Kath.

271
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,748
- Goodbye, old girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

272
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,093
Ship's company...'shun.

273
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:09,545
(Whistle)

274
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,767
- Ship's company present, sir.
- Thanks, No.1. Stand them at ease.

275
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:25,401
Ship's company, stand at... ease.

276
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,873
Break ranks and gather round me.

277
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:41,170
- Can you hear me all right at the back?
ALL: Aye aye, sir.

278
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:45,431
It's the custom for the captain to address
the ship's company on Commissioning Day

279
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,261
to give them his policy
and tell them the ship's programme.

280
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:53,305
Now, my policy's easy. If there are any here
who've served with me before, they'll know it.

281
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:55,434
Are there any old shipmates of mine here?

282
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,359
Oh, glad to see you again, Reynolds.

283
00:27:58,405 --> 00:27:59,864
And Adams.

284
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:01,187
And Blake.

285
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,487
And Coombe.

286
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,777
Who's the small fellow behind the chief stoker?

287
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,407
Parkinson, sir.

288
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:08,864
Coxswain of the All Comers whaler
in the Valletta?

289
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,788
I was that, sir, when we won the cup
in the 1936 regatta.

290
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,328
And fell into the ditch when you got to the ship.

291
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:19,385
Well, there are enough old shipmates
to tell the others what my policy's always been.

292
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,596
Reynolds, Adams, Blake, Coombe, Parkinson,

293
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:25,428
what sort of a ship do I want the Torrin to be?

294
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,850
- A happy ship, sir.
- That's right.

295
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,308
An efficient ship, sir.

296
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,388
Correct.

297
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,518
A happy and efficient ship.

298
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,941
A very happy and a very efficient ship.

299
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:37,277
You might think I'm ambitious wanting both,

300
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,361
but in my experience,
you can't have one without the other.

301
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:44,707
A ship can't be happy unless she's efficient,
and won't be efficient unless she's happy.

302
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,031
Now for our programme.

303
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:49,953
You've seen the commissioning programme
published in Plymouth General Orders.

304
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:53,756
And you will have noted
that this allows the company three weeks.

305
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:55,463
Well, you've all read your papers.

306
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:59,262
Ribbentrop signed a non -aggression pact
with Stalin yesterday.

307
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,847
As I see it, that means war next week.

308
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:06,308
So I will give you not three weeks but exactly
three days to get this ship ready to sail.

309
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,317
None of us will turn in or take our clothes off
or sling our hammocks till the job's finished.

310
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:16,074
Then we'll send Hitler a telegram saying,
"The Torrin's ready. You can start your war."

311
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:26,204
You four bring in the sugar, you six gas masks,
and I'll join you and bring in the rum.

312
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,671
Wake up, England. You've had your hour.
It's my turn now.

313
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,604
RADIO: Here is an announcement.

314
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:28,529
At 11:15, that is, in about two minutes,
the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation.

315
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,239
Please stand by.

316
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:38,128
(Bells chime)

317
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:47,717
CHAMBERLAIN: I am speaking to you
from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.

318
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:58,105
This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin
handed the German government a final note

319
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:04,159
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11 o'clock

320
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:09,709
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

321
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:13,620
a state of war would exist between us.

322
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:21,087
I have to tell you now
that no such undertaking has been received

323
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,431
and that consequently
this country is at war with Germany.

324
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:35,445
You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me...

325
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,529
It ain't exactly a bank holiday for us.

326
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,352
She's still afloat.

327
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,891
Yes, sir.

328
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:12,988
ALIX KINROSS: God bless this ship
and all who sail in her.

329
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:16,901
God bless this ship and all who sail in her.

330
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:23,752
(Distant) # O hear us when we cry to thee

331
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:31,093
# For those in peril on the sea

332
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:38,600
# O Trinity of love and power

333
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:44,436
# Our brethren shield in danger's hour

334
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:51,408
# From rock and tempest, fire and foe

335
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:58,037
# Protect them wheresoe'er they go

336
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:04,373
# Thus evermore shall rise to thee

337
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:13,052
# Glad hymns of praise from land and sea

338
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:18,229
# Amen

339
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,153
Let us pray.

340
00:33:24,408 --> 00:33:28,655
Eternal Lord God, who spreadest out
the heavens and rulest the raging of the sea,

341
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:32,204
who has compassed the waters with bounds
until day and night end,

342
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,121
be pleased to receive
into thy most gracious protection

343
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,337
the persons of us, thy servants,
and the fleet in which we serve.

344
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:41,716
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea
and the violence of the enemy,

345
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:45,925
that we may be a safeguard unto
our most gracious sovereign lord, King George,

346
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:49,260
and a security for such as pass on the seas
upon their lawful occasions.

347
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:53,144
That the inhabitants of our island may
in peace and quietness serve thee, our God,

348
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:57,569
and that we may return to enjoy the blessings
of the land with the fruits of our labours,

349
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:01,777
with the thankful remembrance of thy mercies
to praise and glorify thy holy name.

350
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:03,450
Through Jesus Christ our Lord...

351
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:06,412
Amen.

352
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:09,659
We will now sing the carol
on the back of the hymn card.

353
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:11,784
(Coughing)

354
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:17,883
# Good King Wenceslas looked out

355
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:22,306
# On the feast of Stephen

356
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,562
# When the snow lay round about

357
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:30,271
# Deep and crisp and even

358
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,778
# Brightly shone the moon that night

359
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,191
# Though the frost was cruel

360
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,658
# When a poor man came in sight

361
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:45,248
# Gathering winter fuel

362
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,544
# Hither, page, come stand by me

363
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,131
# If thou...
(Whistle)

364
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,546
(Laughter)

365
00:34:57,223 --> 00:35:01,008
Them kids have been at it all day.
Beats me why their mothers let'em do it.

366
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:02,888
Oh, it's the Christmas spirit, Mum.

367
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:07,815
I'll give'em Christmas spirit, coming home
with their feet sopping, getting colds.

368
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,103
This is the time for goodwill towards all men.

369
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,728
Can't have you grumbling
as if it was an ordinary day.

370
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:15,108
Me grumble? Well, I like that, I must say.

371
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,364
I remember in the last war
spending Christmas in the Red Sea.

372
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:22,033
We was coming home from Aden.
Hot? You could have fried an egg on the deck.

373
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:24,542
The Red Sea is hot, all right.
So's the Persian Gulf.

374
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,333
I was out there two years ago.

375
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:30,677
The fridge went wonky and everything went bad,
including the language.

376
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,093
You certainly see life in the big ships.

377
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,967
We don't do so badly in the small ones.

378
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,805
Oh they're off again. Stop'em somebody.

379
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:39,479
I'm not starting anything.

380
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:43,022
It's a darned sight more lively in a big cruiser.
It stands to reason.

381
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:44,646
It don't do no such thing.

382
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:47,780
You're a Marine.
You don't know nothing about destroyers.

383
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:49,615
What's the matter with the Marines?

384
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:52,364
Well, Bert, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you.

385
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:56,790
- Where would the Navy be without us?
- Without a Navy, there wouldn't be no Marines.

386
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:00,038
Oh, shut up, you two. Who cares anyway?

387
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:03,374
That's a nice way to talk, and no mistake!
You, the mother of a sailor.

388
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:07,340
- And the mother-in -law of a Marine.
- Pass the port wine and don't talk so silly.

389
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:10,971
- I'm as dry as a bone.
- Mum's right. What's the sense in arguing?

390
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:13,343
We was only having a friendly discussion.

391
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:17,345
You'll be saying next it was a friendly discussion
last night in the Green Man.

392
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,476
Why, you had the whole place in an uproar!

393
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,145
Bert, I give you a toast.

394
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:26,526
The Royal Marines - God bless'em and
a happy Christmas to every man jack of'em.

395
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:28,616
The Royal Marines.

396
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:40,962
Thanks, Shorty, old man.
I respond to your toast in a fitting manner.

397
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,680
On behalf of my corps,
of which I am justly proud...

398
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,753
Hear, hear.

399
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:47,428
...I give you destroyers,
and the Torrin in particular.

400
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:50,347
- May her shadow never grow less.
- It never will.

401
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:53,184
Destroyers and HMS Torrin.

402
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:58,445
I should like to take the opportunity
of this festive occasion

403
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,063
to drink the healths of one and all present,

404
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:04,035
and to thank a kindly fate for so arranging

405
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,029
that my ship should have to come home
for boiler cleaning two days before Christmas -

406
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,832
a bit of luck which any sailor would tell you
is little short of a bloody miracle.

407
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:15,213
Walter, how can you?
You know I don't like you using that word.

408
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:18,592
Be that as it may, Kath,
that's a highly expressive word.

409
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:22,470
It's been bound up with naval tradition
since times immemorial.

410
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,509
I have heard it whispered in the RAF.

411
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,641
Well, be that as it may, I would like to add
that I consider we're all...

412
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:31,139
...very lucky...

413
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:36,236
...to be together on this happy day,
taking into account there's a war on

414
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:40,116
and civilisation happens to be trembling
on the edge of an abyss.

415
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:42,369
- There, now.
- What did you say, Kath?

416
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,874
I only said, "There, now."

417
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,539
Well, don't say it again.
You know it only puts me off.

418
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:51,089
What are you giggling about, Freda,
if I may make so bold?

419
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,839
Nothing, really. It's just the way you talk.

420
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:58,217
What you young flibbertigibbets don't realise
is that this is a very important war indeed.

421
00:37:58,267 --> 00:38:02,347
War or no war, you certainly like listening
to the sound of your own voice.

422
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:04,769
Oh, let him get on with his speech, Kath.

423
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,643
Try and stop him.

424
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:10,394
I will treat these paltry interruptions
with the contempt they deserve,

425
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:14,148
and go on to propose the health
of one who is very dear to me.

426
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:18,579
She's a creature of many moods
and fads and fancies.

427
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:25,374
She is, to coin a phrase, very often uncertain
and coy and hard to please.

428
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:30,169
But I'm devoted to her
with every fibre in my being,

429
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,048
and I hereby swear to be true to her
in word and deed, so help me God.

430
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:38,679
Ladies and gentlemen, HMS Torrin.

431
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,806
ALL: HMS Torrin.

432
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:43,777
(Tapping on table)

433
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,896
Ladies and gentlemen, the King.

434
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,199
ALL: The King.

435
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,784
- We can smoke now, can't we?
- Yes, of course.

436
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,908
You promised to pull the first one with me.

437
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,916
Come on. Take a strong grip and pull.

438
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,159
Come on, old girl.

439
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,883
- Enjoying yourself?
- Very, very much.

440
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:06,923
That cap's absolutely wizard.
You ought to have a hat made like it.

441
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,679
Doesn't the tree look sweet?

442
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,179
Alix and I spent hours fixing it.

443
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,599
This is the best Christmas I've ever had.

444
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,722
- Is it?
- Stop whispering, you two.

445
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:18,525
You really oughtn't
to have put them next to each other.

446
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:20,857
We ought to drink to them.
Come on, everybody.

447
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:22,149
To the newly betrothed.

448
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:23,739
ALL: The newly betrothed.

449
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:30,865
- What's betrothed, Daddy?
- The beginning of the end, my boy.

450
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,626
On behalf of my fiancée and myself,
thank you very kindly.

451
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:40,622
As Flags and Maureen are so bashful,
I think that you should make a speech, Alix.

452
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:43,880
- Oh, no, honestly, I couldn't.
- Come on, Alix. I'll support you.

453
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,552
Oh, Teddy, I shall never forgive you for this.

454
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,011
Oh, dear!

455
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,517
- What am I to say? Just you wait.
- Happy Christmas.

456
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,189
Come on, now. Silence, everybody.

457
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:54,806
The Lady Mayoress
is about to declare the bazaar open.

458
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,734
Don't let him get you down, Alix.

459
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,730
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll begin by taking my husband's advice...

460
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:05,162
- Hooray!
...and wishing you all a very happy Christmas.

461
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:08,575
I'm sure Elizabeth and June will back me up

462
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:12,707
when I say I am going to deliver,
on behalf of all wretched naval wives,

463
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,879
a word of warning to Maureen,

464
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,499
who has been unwise enough
to decide to join our ranks.

465
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:18,584
Hear hear!

466
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:21,924
Dear Maureen,
we all wish you every possible happiness,

467
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:25,759
but I think it only fair to tell you in advance
exactly what you are in for.

468
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:26,844
Shame, shame.

469
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:30,563
Speaking from bitter experience,

470
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,690
I can only say that the wife of a sailor
is most profoundly to be pitied.

471
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:39,651
To begin with, her home life,
what there is of it, has no stability whatever.

472
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,661
She can never really settle down.

473
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,707
She moves through a succession
of other people's houses,

474
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,578
flats and furnished rooms.

475
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:49,713
She finds herself having to grapple
with domestic problems

476
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,796
in Bermuda, Malta or Weymouth.

477
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,757
We will not deal with the question of pay.
That is altogether too painful.

478
00:40:57,808 --> 00:41:02,186
What we will deal with
is the most important disillusionment of all.

479
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,350
- And that is...
- Stop her, somebody. This is rank mutiny.

480
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,939
And that is, that wherever she goes,

481
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:12,199
there is always in her life
a permanent and undefeated rival.

482
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:15,070
Her husband's ship.

483
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,611
Whether it be a battleship or a sloop,

484
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:19,657
a submarine or a destroyer,

485
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,282
it holds first place in his heart.

486
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:25,920
It comes before wife, home,
children, everything.

487
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:30,632
Some of us try to fight this
and get badly mauled in the process.

488
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,428
Others, like myself,
resign themselves to the inevitable.

489
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,395
That is what you will have to do,
my poor Maureen.

490
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:42,935
That is what we all have to do
if we want any peace of mind at all.

491
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,527
Ladies and gentlemen,

492
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:47,656
I give you my rival.

493
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:53,320
It's extraordinary
that anyone could be so fond...

494
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,500
...and so proud of their most implacable enemy.

495
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,549
This ship.

496
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,801
God bless this ship, and all who sail in her.

497
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,620
Well... she did her stuff, sir.

498
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,541
Best ship I ever served in, sir.

499
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:41,135
That goes for me too, sir.

500
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:44,677
It makes one feel sort of lost, doesn't it?

501
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:47,925
A very happy and a very efficient ship, sir.

502
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:51,230
Thank you.

503
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:56,269
(Snivels)

504
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:02,485
Wipe your face, Edgecombe.
You don't want oil fuel in your eyes.

505
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:03,994
Aye aye, sir.

506
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:11,294
Well... do you know what I'd like now?
Anice hot cup of tea.

507
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,916
I'd like a nice beer myself.

508
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,373
Look out! Here come the bastards back again.

509
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,719
Keep your heads down, get as low as you can!

510
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,600
Missed, butterfingers!

511
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,193
Blimey. I spoke too soon.

512
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,879
- Aargh!
- Did it get you badly?

513
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:57,807
Don't rightly know, sir.

514
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,309
Knife, somebody.

515
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,479
Cut his sleeve carefully.

516
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,502
Hit a mother with a baby in her arms, you would.

517
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:24,213
Oh, look, boys.

518
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,750
Shot through the heart.

519
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:31,544
- I always did hate the sight of blood.
- Give us a rag, somebody.

520
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,853
What's your name? What's your name?

521
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:44,811
What's your name? What's your name?

522
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,104
What's your name? What's your name?

523
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:51,034
What's your name?

524
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:52,952
Quite a loving cup, isn't it?

525
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:56,865
You never know your luck.
I always say travel broadens the mind.

526
00:44:56,918 --> 00:45:00,252
Now then, saucy.
You keep your hands to yourself.

527
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,124
- Want a drop, dear?
- No, thanks.

528
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:03,669
Come on. It won't hurt you.

529
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:06,423
I'd rather not, thanks all the same. I don't like it.

530
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:10,006
Oh, fancy that, now! Ever so sorry, I'm sure.

531
00:45:10,058 --> 00:45:12,680
If she doesn't want it,
she doesn't have to have it.

532
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:16,228
Who do you think you are, anyway?
Father Flanagan?

533
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:20,652
Here, play a hymn, there's a dear.
I didn't know we was in Sunday school.

534
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:23,069
Some people don't know
when they've had enough.

535
00:45:23,116 --> 00:45:24,824
What was that you said?

536
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:26,695
You heard. You ain't got cloth ears.

537
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:28,821
Here, miss, you change places with me.

538
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:32,918
- It's all right, really.
- You'll be more comfortable in the corner.

539
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:39,801
I'd be ever so much obliged, I'm sure,
if you'd change places with me, too.

540
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:42,513
My mother always warned me
never to sit next to sailors.

541
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:45,805
Pity she didn't warn you
about a few other things while she was at it.

542
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,258
Ah, shut up arguing, pal. Here, have a fag.

543
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,770
Life's too short.

544
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:56,144
# If you were the only

545
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:59,150
# Girl in the world

546
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,158
# And I was the only boy

547
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:11,287
# Nothing else would matter in the world today

548
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,710
# We could go on loving...

549
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:15,216
Comfy?

550
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:18,461
Yes, thanks.

551
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:21,930
What's your name?

552
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:25,140
Freda. Freda Lewis.

553
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:28,273
Freda? It's a pretty name, isn't it?

554
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:30,108
- Is it?
- Do you mind if I smoke?

555
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,611
Of course not.

556
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:35,441
- Have one?
- I don't mind.

557
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:39,075
These are special, HM ships only.
We get'em in the canteen.

558
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,371
My uncle by marriage is in the Navy.
He's on a destroyer.

559
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,954
Isn't that a coincidence, now? So am I.

560
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,461
There, now.

561
00:46:49,883 --> 00:46:53,169
He's a petty officer.
They call him by a funny name.

562
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,296
We often call petty officers funny names.

563
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:57,755
- It begins with a B.
- It generally does.

564
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:59,636
Oh, you are awful!

565
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,394
What's his ship?

566
00:47:01,438 --> 00:47:04,522
I'm not supposed to tell you that, am I?
It's careless talk.

567
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:07,058
You can tell me.
I'm in the same firm, as you might say.

568
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:09,685
Well, chief buffer, that's what he's called.

569
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:11,281
He's on the Torrin.

570
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:15,445
Well, it's a small world, and no error!
Here, Joey.

571
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:18,248
Our chief buffer's her uncle by marriage.

572
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,915
Makes you sort of Siamese twins.

573
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:22,367
This is my friend Joey Mackeridge.

574
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,665
Miss Lewis.

575
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:26,798
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure

576
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:28,301
What's your name?

577
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,617
- Funny us meeting like that, wasn't it?
- Yes.

578
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,874
- Sort of... unexpected.
- Yes.

579
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:42,718
That long train, all them people in it,
and I had to pick on that one carriage.

580
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:45,968
- It's fate, I shouldn't wonder.
- Yeah, I feel that way, too.

581
00:48:46,018 --> 00:48:50,182
- I suppose we ought really to be going now.
- Yeah, I suppose we ought.

582
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:53,232
Your family will be wondering
what's happened to you.

583
00:48:53,276 --> 00:48:55,898
- Well, I'm wondering that myself.
- How can you?

584
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:58,484
Does er... Does your aunt let you go out much?

585
00:48:58,532 --> 00:49:01,106
She doesn't mind,
so long as I don't get back too late.

586
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,912
What about tomorrow?
We might go to the Palais de Danse.

587
00:49:03,955 --> 00:49:05,414
- Do you like dancing?
- Yes.

588
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:08,992
Well, that's a date, then.
6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.

589
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:11,500
You don't waste much time, do you?

590
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:15,415
- I can't afford to. I've only got weekend leave.
- That's not long.

591
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:28,607
Well, here we are.
Come in and meet my mum and dad.

592
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,150
No, not now. I'd really rather not.
I've got to be getting along.

593
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:36,739
- And they wouldn't want a stranger butting in.
- You're not a stranger, not any more.

594
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:39,192
Ah, but to them I would be.

595
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:41,119
Give me that bag, there's a dear.

596
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:43,952
Not until you say it's OK about tomorrow night.

597
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:48,082
- Oh, you are awful!
- 6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.

598
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:49,626
All right.

599
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:51,549
Cross your heart and hope to die?

600
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:54,553
I cross my heart and hope to die.

601
00:49:57,976 --> 00:50:00,467
- So long, Freda.
- So long, Shorty.

602
00:50:46,865 --> 00:50:48,194
(Clattering)

603
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,698
(Whistles) Mum.

604
00:50:55,418 --> 00:50:56,877
Shorty Blake!

605
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:01,583
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
and no mistake.

606
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:05,797
Your telegram only arrived half an hour ago.
You never said what time you was coming.

607
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:08,801
I'm here, aren't I? Sound in wind and limb.
You can't grumble.

608
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,388
Oh, you bad boy, you!

609
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,725
May, Shorty's home!

610
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,681
Dad! Dad!

611
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:17,984
Doesn't he look well?

612
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:20,732
How's the war going, son?
See any submarines?

613
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,150
Hundreds. Sunk 14 last week,
and a couple of cruisers thrown in.

614
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:26,692
Oh, Mum, he's fibbing, isn't he?

615
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:29,201
In the last war, I was in a convoy once.

616
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:30,956
Put a sock in it, Fred.

617
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,666
We've heard quite enough
about all what you did in the last war.

618
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:37,085
- Dad?
- Yes, old man?

619
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:38,876
Where did you first meet Mum?

620
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:42,542
Why, whatever made you think of asking that?

621
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:45,088
We was in a train coming back from Herne Bay.

622
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,927
Well, it's a small world, and no error!

623
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:51,478
Mum, can I leave my bridge out
while Shorty's home?

624
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:53,066
It was fate, wasn't it?

625
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,145
You drink your tea up, my lad,
and don't talk so soft.

626
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,735
They're coming over again.

627
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,577
Get down. Keep your heads low.

628
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,281
(Aircraft flies over)

629
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:15,459
# MENDELSSOHN:
Wedding march

630
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:28,105
Now, nice and still, everybody, please.
Steady. A nice smile.

631
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,775
(Sobs)

632
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:32,689
It seems only yesterday he was in his pram.

633
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,949
Hold it!

634
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:39,743
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Goodbye, Shorty.

635
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:43,122
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
- Good luck, old man.

636
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,093
Goodbye, Shorty.

637
00:52:55,848 --> 00:52:57,307
Goodbye, Kath.

638
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,154
Here's your little lot.

639
00:53:14,203 --> 00:53:17,739
Now, then. Cheerio... Mrs Blake.

640
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,999
Oh, it does sound funny, doesn't it?

641
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:22,420
You'll get used to it.

642
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:25,963
There's one thing I shall never get used to,
and that's you going away.

643
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:28,002
It's your own fault for marrying a sailor.

644
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:30,295
That's fairly asking for trouble, that is.

645
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,838
Can't trust any of'em an inch.
Wives in every port.

646
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:36,142
Coming home unexpected
and catching you having tea with the lodger.

647
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:39,521
I'm the one that will be the lodger
if I'm going to live with Kath.

648
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:44,145
That isn't for a whole week yet. Think of it.
Seven whole days of glorious life.

649
00:53:45,448 --> 00:53:47,524
You'll like being with Kath, won't you?

650
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:49,034
Of course I shall.

651
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:52,992
It's you being away and me wondering
what's happening to you that I won't like.

652
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,949
Proceed with the following operations:

653
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,871
1: Give us a kiss.
2: Chuck us another of Mum's sandwiches.

654
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,503
3: Cheer up and remember this a honeymoon.
And 4: Give us another kiss.

655
00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:03,708
Now, then, ship's company...'shun!

656
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,382
Oh, lay off, Shorty! You're crushing my blouse.

657
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,304
- Someone will see us.
- Who cares?

658
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:10,009
(Door opens)

659
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,929
Hello, Blake. What are you doing here?

660
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:16,978
- I'm on my honeymoon, sir.
- That's splendid. Congratulations.

661
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:20,111
Thank you, sir. This is my wife, Mrs Blake.

662
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:22,860
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

663
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:26,324
Alix, come and meet my shipmate and his wife.
They've just been married.

664
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,447
Ordinary Seaman Blake, Mrs Blake - my wife.

665
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,701
- How do you do? I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thanks ever so.

666
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:35,584
But we're old friends. He practically
saved my life when I came on board.

667
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:39,250
My foot slipped on the gangway,
and I nearly fell overboard. Do you remember?

668
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,425
- Yes, ma'am.
- Will you live in Plymouth?

669
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:43,962
Yes... that is, when he goes to sea again.

670
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,721
Chief Petty Officer Hardy's
her uncle by marriage, sir.

671
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,390
She's going to live at their place for the duration.

672
00:54:49,438 --> 00:54:52,226
But we're spending the next few days
in Torquay.

673
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:56,487
Very nice, too. You begin as you intend
to go on, Mrs Blake. Keep him in order.

674
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,982
My wife rules me with a rod of iron.
It's been quite successful so far.

675
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,035
Don't talk such nonsense.
I'm never allowed to have my own way.

676
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:05,155
Well, we won't interrupt you any longer.

677
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:07,080
Report him to me if he doesn't behave.

678
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:09,795
- Goodbye. The very best of luck.
- Thanks very much.

679
00:55:09,837 --> 00:55:12,328
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye for the present, sir.

680
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:17,380
- Have a good time. Enjoy your leave.
- Thank you, sir.

681
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,351
Coincidence them going to Torquay
for their honeymoon.

682
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:24,429
I thought that at the time,
but I didn't want to go on about it.

683
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:26,271
That first quarrel we had, remember?

684
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:30,147
When you went stamping off
to listen to the band and came back in tears.

685
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,982
It was only because they were playing
The Blue Danube.

686
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,569
That always makes me feel
pent-up and emotional.

687
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:38,287
That wasn't why you were in tears.
Don't pretend it was.

688
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:41,413
If I was in tears at all, which I hotly deny,

689
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:46,084
it was because that was when I discovered
what a disagreeable character you have.

690
00:55:46,129 --> 00:55:48,751
Still, it was a good honeymoon,
as honeymoons go.

691
00:55:50,342 --> 00:55:51,801
It went awfully quickly.

692
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:56,134
(Whistles The Blue Danube)

693
00:55:56,182 --> 00:56:01,225
Stop it, Teddy. I refuse to be made sentimental
in the middle of a Great Western lunch.

694
00:56:01,272 --> 00:56:04,558
Eat up your delicious piece of railway fish
and behave yourself.

695
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:08,320
- Damn!
- What's the matter?

696
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:11,482
That thing positively haunts me.

697
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:15,491
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a show like that.

698
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,116
Never mind, darling.

699
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,870
There'll be lots of other shows and
lots of other chances before the war's over.

700
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,506
(Wind howls)

701
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:44,151
Some damned poet at some time or other

702
00:56:44,197 --> 00:56:48,242
wrote a very appealing little piece
about "the tiny feet of the rain".

703
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:51,120
There's a man I'd like to meet. I'd kill him.

704
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,864
Well, I'm going down to the wardroom.
Keep a stiff upper lip, old boy.

705
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:56,198
(Laughter)

706
00:56:56,252 --> 00:56:58,790
Five on six,

707
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:01,508
two on three,

708
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:04,551
and ten - just what the doctor ordered.

709
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,671
The Doctor hasn't ordered a damn thing,

710
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:12,228
apart from a few doses of Cascara
and one splint since the ship commissioned.

711
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:16,351
That, I may say,
is what's getting the Doctor down.

712
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,857
Years of expensive medical training
resulting in complete atrophy.

713
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,816
The doctor wishes he was dead.

714
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:25,741
Someone give the Doctor a drink.

715
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:28,740
- Mitchell, a glass of port for the Doctor.
- Thank you.

716
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:30,747
There, just the girl I wanted.

717
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:34,625
- You do have the damnedest luck.
- Skill, old boy, sheer undiluted skill.

718
00:57:34,672 --> 00:57:36,464
The usual triumph of mind over matter.

719
00:57:36,508 --> 00:57:38,999
- It's a stinking awful night.
- Hello, No.1.

720
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:41,460
Mitchell, a gin for the First Lieutenant.

721
00:57:41,513 --> 00:57:42,711
Thanks, Torps.

722
00:57:42,765 --> 00:57:45,766
The sea is getting up
and I've got the middle watch.

723
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:48,135
Hey, stop. You should put the ten on the nine.

724
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:50,430
I never noticed the damn thing!

725
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:55,109
Here's peace, peace, perfect peace,
with loved ones far away.

726
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,284
- Feeling all right, old man?
- Yes. Why?

727
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,580
- Sure you're not running a temperature?
- No, of course not.

728
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,829
First time you haven't been late for a watch
since we commissioned.

729
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:13,545
- You're two minutes early.
- I'm sorry, sir. It won't occur again, sir.

730
00:58:13,592 --> 00:58:15,501
Bearing green 3-0, vessel on fire.

731
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,302
(Bell)

732
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:28,013
Yes?

733
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:31,816
- Captain, vessel on fire, bearing green 3-0.
- Press the alarm rattlers.

734
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:32,894
(Rings)

735
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:48,715
Come on.

736
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,834
I was dreaming I was in a Turkish harem

737
00:58:50,885 --> 00:58:53,756
and some fathead
has to go and sound off action stations.

738
00:58:53,805 --> 00:58:55,882
I wondered why you was pinching me.

739
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,264
Report to TS
when closed up and cleared away.

740
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,333
Looks like a line of destroyers.

741
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:04,379
Number one gun cleared away.

742
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:06,552
Number two gun cleared away. Bore clear.

743
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:08,591
Number three gun cleared away.

744
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:11,643
All guns closed up and cleared away.
Communications tested.

745
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:13,810
All quarters closed up to action stations.

746
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:17,356
- Very good. Open fire.
- Open shutter. Star shell commence.

747
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:20,771
Open shutter.
Star shell commence, commence, commence.

748
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:25,490
Well done, guns. We've beaten them to it.

749
01:00:25,536 --> 01:00:28,656
(Rapid gunfire)

750
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:29,738
(Horn)

751
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,171
They've fired now.

752
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,012
Train right a little.

753
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,014
Hold the leading destroyer.

754
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,683
Right, four stars.

755
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:47,758
Go on!

756
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:52,603
They've gone over.

757
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:54,728
(Guns pound)

758
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,699
(Explosion)

759
01:01:09,004 --> 01:01:11,495
Go on. Stack'em up.

760
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:27,607
Go on!

761
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,643
Don't go to sleep down there. Come on.

762
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:41,205
Get it up

763
01:01:46,505 --> 01:01:48,581
Layer on!

764
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:50,709
Ready

765
01:01:57,392 --> 01:01:59,351
We've hit. Keep it up.

766
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:01,435
- Stop star shell.
- Stop star shell.

767
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:03,889
Star shell check, check, check.

768
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:06,987
We've hit again.

769
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,902
(Explosion)

770
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:19,407
(Explosion)

771
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:23,954
(Explosion)

772
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:28,125
(Explosion)

773
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,172
(Explosion)

774
01:02:37,147 --> 01:02:38,606
(Explosion)

775
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:44,903
Torpedo tracks starboard, sir.

776
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:54,033
Stop, boys, midships.

777
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:57,749
Close all watertight doors. Jettison top weight.
Keep those guns firing.

778
01:02:57,796 --> 01:03:00,916
Flags, make to Tremoyne.
Take over. Continue chase.

779
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:02,425
The power's off, sir.

780
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:07,929
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing.

781
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:18,190
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing

782
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:33,376
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing

783
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:44,053
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing.

784
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,867
Number one mounting, carry on firing.

785
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:51,463
- Let me know when you're ready.
- Trainer on.

786
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:54,003
Look out. Here she comes.

787
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,312
What's the damage, No.1?

788
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:03,973
Mess deck bulkheads are being shored up.
It looks as if they're all right.

789
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,102
But there's a good deal of damage aft.

790
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,691
We'll be a nice sitting target when it gets light.

791
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,080
Is Captain D alive?

792
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:26,750
Yes, old chap. You haven't succeeded
to the command of this flotilla yet.

793
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:28,879
- What did you do to Jerry?
- Sunk one.

794
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:32,880
The rest escaped in a smoke screen
and one was badly damaged.

795
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:34,927
Not too bad.

796
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:37,018
Tell Tancred to take me in tow.

797
01:05:37,064 --> 01:05:38,523
Aye aye, sir.

798
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:41,067
How far are we from home, Pilot?

799
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,985
About 120 miles, sir.

800
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:46,944
Snotty, ask the First Lieutenant
if he's all ready to tow for'ard.

801
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:51,489
- We have all the guns working in hand, sir.
- Good. We shall need'em, I expect.

802
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:02,501
Well, Blake. Don't move.

803
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:03,963
How are you feeling?

804
01:06:04,012 --> 01:06:05,720
Fine, sir, thank you.

805
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:07,389
Got concussed a bit, didn't you?

806
01:06:07,432 --> 01:06:08,927
Yes, sir. I think I did, sir.

807
01:06:08,976 --> 01:06:10,470
The First Lieutenant tells me

808
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:13,686
that you stood by the gun
even when most of the crew were knocked out.

809
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:16,935
Well, sir... somebody had to do it, sir.

810
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:21,066
- You did damn well. I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you, sir.

811
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:23,688
I want to see my captain.

812
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:26,200
It's all right, old man. I'm here.

813
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:28,536
Don't try to talk. Just rest.

814
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:36,664
(Explosion)

815
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,355
(Rapid gunfire)

816
01:06:56,656 --> 01:06:58,530
Are the bulkheads holding all right?

817
01:06:58,575 --> 01:07:00,782
Yes, sir, they're taking it very well.

818
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,579
How far have we made good the last two days?

819
01:07:04,624 --> 01:07:06,498
We're about halfway there, sir.

820
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,279
The RAF ought to be here soon.

821
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:35,739
A nice nippy little fighter squadron,
that's what we want.

822
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,241
- I wish they'd get a move on.
- Give'em time, old boy.

823
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:41,408
I'm sick of wallowing about here
like a sitting duck.

824
01:08:00,063 --> 01:08:03,148
Hurray! Bravo!

825
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:05,268
(Cheering)

826
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:21,836
Bravo!

827
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,911
Hooray!

828
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:28,169
(Cheering)

829
01:08:33,685 --> 01:08:36,805
Make yourselves comfortable.
We're all pretty tired.

830
01:08:36,855 --> 01:08:38,933
There are one or two things I want to say.

831
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,229
First...

832
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:44,364
First, I'll hold
a short memorial service next Sunday

833
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:47,194
for our 36 shipmates who lost their lives,

834
01:08:47,243 --> 01:08:51,822
and return thanks that the old ship
came through with so many of her complement.

835
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:56,002
I expect that Hitler is conferring the Iron Cross
on the man who claims to have sunk us.

836
01:08:58,047 --> 01:09:01,214
Secondly, I want to tell you
that you all did pretty well

837
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:03,667
in the trying time we've been through.

838
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,591
When a torpedo hits
so small a ship as a destroyer,

839
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,807
the result is bound to be fairly devastating,
if not fatal.

840
01:09:09,852 --> 01:09:12,688
And I can understand
the tremendous temptation

841
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:16,065
to think of your own skin first
and the ship and your shipmates second.

842
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:21,567
I suppose, in a way, it's gratifying to feel
that out of a ship's company of 244 men,

843
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:25,696
243 have behaved
as I hoped and expected they would.

844
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,620
One man, however, did not.

845
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:34,665
That man has been charged
with leaving his post without permission.

846
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:38,582
I needn't tell you how serious
an offence of this nature is in time of war,

847
01:09:38,635 --> 01:09:41,423
nor how drastic is the punishment
that normally follows.

848
01:09:41,472 --> 01:09:46,182
You will be surprised, therefore, to learn
that I have let him off with a caution.

849
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:48,980
Or perhaps I should say with two cautions -

850
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:51,941
one to him, and one to me.

851
01:09:51,985 --> 01:09:54,690
For in a way,
I feel that what happened was my fault.

852
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:58,901
This man has only been in the Navy
for six months.

853
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:01,240
He has only been in this ship for two months.

854
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:04,953
Even so I feel that in that time
I should have been able to make it clear to him

855
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,500
that I did not expect
and would not tolerate such behaviour.

856
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:13,541
I feel I should have been able to get at least
that much of my creed across, but I failed.

857
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:20,589
I will not punish a man for an action
for which I must hold myself largely to blame.

858
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:26,599
But I should like you all to know
that after this, there will be no more cautions.

859
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:28,983
The next time we run into trouble -

860
01:10:29,027 --> 01:10:32,860
and as leader of a striking force,
this ship's bound to be in more scraps -

861
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:37,653
I know that, come what may,
no-one will fail to do his duty to the very end.

862
01:10:39,956 --> 01:10:42,874
Thank you all for making my task so easy,

863
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:45,410
and the Torrin a ship to be so very proud of.

864
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:49,045
- Carry on, No.1.
- Aye aye, sir.

Look here, I've got to close up now.
It's no use your staying on any longer.

868
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:51,075
You can't have any more to drink.
It's after hours.

869
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:53,115
What's the matter with having some music?

870
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:55,871
If you've got a penny, you can have it.
If not, you can't.

871
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:57,249
I have.

872
01:11:57,297 --> 01:12:00,713
Well, put it in the slot, then.
That's what it's there for.

873
01:12:00,759 --> 01:12:02,004
I will.

875
01:12:15,985 --> 01:12:19,070
Will you be requiring anything more
before we close?

876
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:23,491
Look here, miss. Judging by all
I've had tonight, I ought to be drunk, see.

877
01:12:23,535 --> 01:12:25,078
I want to be drunk.

878
01:12:27,164 --> 01:12:31,245
I want to be drunk more than
I've ever wanted anything in my whole life.

Well... goodbye, Walter.

909
01:14:55,294 --> 01:14:58,130
Goodbye, Freda.
Don't go overexerting yourself, now.

910
01:14:58,172 --> 01:14:59,916
- Cheerio, Kath.
- Be good.

911
01:14:59,966 --> 01:15:03,300
Go on, Freda. Go on up to the gate with him.
I'll wait here.

912
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,270
You shouldn't have come. It's bad for you.

913
01:15:14,316 --> 01:15:17,852
Don't be silly.
It would be much worse sitting at home.

914
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:20,574
Besides, we've had an extra half-hour together.

915
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:23,368
It doesn't seem so bad this time, somehow.

916
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,285
Perhaps I'm getting used to it.

917
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,450
Come on, give us a kiss and hop it.
No sense hanging about.

918

All right.

Now, then. None of that.

Go on. Be a good boy. Don't get your feet wet.

921

I won't forget about having the mower mended.

922
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:04,532
That's right. And if things do get bad,
you can always go to Dorothy's.

before I do that.

- Cheerio.

with all your Packards and all your Cadillacs.

Time marches on, you know.

928
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:43,001
- What does the King have?
- A Daimler.

929
01:16:43,044 --> 01:16:45,037
I suppose you think that's old-fashioned.

930
01:16:45,088 --> 01:16:48,090
Well, so it is,
compared to a snappy 1940 Packard.

931
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:51,669
You couldn't have the King
whizzing along the streets in a flash roadster.

932
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:53,513
Who said anything about roadsters?

933
01:16:53,556 --> 01:16:56,807
I said before, and I'll say it again,
there is nothing on land or sea

934
01:16:56,852 --> 01:16:59,224
to touch a good old conservative British make.

935
01:16:59,271 --> 01:17:00,647
Give me a Daimler every time.

936
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:04,937
You wanted a Rolls-Royce just now.
You can't have both. Looks like profiteering.

937
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:07,109
- Look here, old man...
- Oh, give it a rest.

938
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,187
I will.

939
01:17:12,578 --> 01:17:14,452
How do you spell porpoise?

01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:17,831
P-O-R-P-O-U-S, I suppose. Why?

941
01:17:17,876 --> 01:17:21,292
I've told my missus
we've been escorting a convoy of'em.

942
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:40,274
Anybody seen the Chief
after the royal raspberry he got this morning?

943
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,605
- Poor old Chiefy.
- He hasn't been in to lunch yet.

944
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:46,860
- Hello, Chief. We were just talking about you.
- Damned nice of you.

945
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,244
- Made any more filthy vapours?
- Shut up, Guns. I've had enough of that.

946
01:17:50,289 --> 01:17:54,786
I thought it looked very attractive, all that
dense black smoke belching from the funnel.

947
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,671
- I'll thank you all to lay off it.
- Never mind, Chiefy.

Old Tremoyne went one better
at about ten o'clock.

949
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,088
- I thought she was on fire.
- Bring me some food, Mitchell.

950
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,973
Have your sparkers picked up any titbits
about the war?

951
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,889
Not since yesterday. Pretty bad show.

952
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,268
My young brother's in the BEF.
He wasn't far from GHQ in Arras.

953
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:14,350
- God knows where he is now.
- The whole thing's been a lash-up.

954
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:21,195
You all know what we've got to do,
don't you?

955
01:18:21,241 --> 01:18:24,527
The whole British Expeditionary Force
is falling back on Dunkirk.

956
01:18:24,578 --> 01:18:28,742
Now, in peacetime, as you know, there's
a lot of leg-pulling between the services.

957
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,868
But the soldiers are our brothers in arms

958
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:33,956
and it's up to us to get'em off
so they can live to fight again.

959
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:38,634
Let them see how much we admire
the way they fought. And don't forget,

960
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:42,926
the success of our evacuation is measured
by the smallness of the military casualties,

961
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:44,434
not the naval ones.

962
01:18:45,478 --> 01:18:49,690
The soldiers are our guests,
and their lives will be in our hands.

967
01:19:11,842 --> 01:19:15,009
Gangway. Here we are. Excuse me.

968
01:19:15,054 --> 01:19:16,252
Mind your backs.

969
01:19:16,305 --> 01:19:19,509
Here you are, cock.
Wet and warm. Don't examine it too closely.

01:19:21,186 --> 01:19:23,973
Here you are, mate.
Try dipping the biscuit in the cocoa.

972
01:19:24,022 --> 01:19:26,478
You can't hurt the cocoa
and you can save your teeth.

973

The champagne will be along in a minute.
That'll be hot, too.

974
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:32,155
Come on, Joey, up this way.
Mind your backs, please.

975
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:34,487
A woman's work is never done.
Here you are, mate.

976
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:38,611
Coming up. Here you are.
Here, don't you want none?

977
01:19:38,664 --> 01:19:41,453
Can't hold it, son. My hand's gone wonky.

978
01:19:41,502 --> 01:19:44,752
Half a mo. Here, Joey,
give us a couple of them biscuits.

979
01:19:52,139 --> 01:19:55,888
- Here, don't gulp it, now. You'll choke yourself.
- Thanks, son.

983

Why did we never think of this for elevenses
in the mess? It's damned good.

984

Port 20.

987
01:20:14,748 --> 01:20:18,793
How's the old country looking now?
I feel as if I've been away for years.

988
01:20:18,836 --> 01:20:21,125
We've been away quite a while, too.

989
01:20:21,172 --> 01:20:23,544
We put in up north every now and again
to refuel.

990
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:26,712
The country's looking much the same as usual
the last time I saw it.

991
01:20:26,762 --> 01:20:30,214
Gentle, you know. Not exactly smug,
but not exactly warlike, either.

992
01:20:30,266 --> 01:20:31,890
There'll always be an England, eh?

993
01:20:31,934 --> 01:20:34,141
S u bboso t h at's as good a convv ct o n as a ny

994
01:20:34,187 --> 01:20:36,678
- A good deal better than most, sir.
- What?

995
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:40,183
A good deal better than most...
(Drowned out by dive bomber)

996
01:20:44,282 --> 01:20:46,607
Here you are, chum.
Here's a nice cup of cocoa.

997
01:20:46,659 --> 01:20:48,369
Want a biscuit?

998
01:20:48,412 --> 01:20:50,702
Go on, leave it. He might fancy it later.

999
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:55,749
I never thought I'd be so glad
to see a cup of cocoa.

1000
01:20:55,796 --> 01:20:57,540
That's right, chum, have another go.

1001
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,499
Come on, it's better with your boots off.

1002
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,839
What a swallow! Lovely. Have some more.

1003
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,056
We're getting quite close.
Good old white cliffs of Dover.

1004
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:09,101
Look better with the sun on them.
Still, can't have everything.

1005
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:11,470
- Damned lucky to see them at all.
- Quite right.

1006
01:21:11,522 --> 01:21:15,271
Haven't had a chance to thank you, Kinross.
The Navy's put up a fine show.

1007
01:21:15,318 --> 01:21:17,276
I hope you don't think we're not grateful.

1008
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,156
- Perhaps you'd care to dine one night.
- Thanks. I'd love to.

1009
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:23,153
We'd better get below, Jasper,
and start lining up the troops.

1010
01:21:23,202 --> 01:21:25,954
I expect you'll be wanting to push off
as soon as possible.

1011
01:21:25,997 --> 01:21:27,705
You've struck rather a busy day.

1012
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,750
- Goodbye for the present.
- Forgive me for not coming down.

1013
01:21:30,794 --> 01:21:34,709
- Goodbye, sir. Thanks very much.
- Goodbye. Good luck.

1014
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:38,590
- Just ordinary Bovril and sherry?
- Just ordinary Bovril and sherry.

1015
01:21:38,637 --> 01:21:40,179
Good. Thanks.

1016
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:38,855
Battalion... sling your arms.

1017
01:23:45,492 --> 01:23:46,523
Battalion...

1018
01:23:47,661 --> 01:23:49,488
...'shun!

1019
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:52,623
Turn to the left in threes.

1020
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,871
Left... turn.

1021
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,083
By the right, quick march.

1022
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:02,127
Left, right, left, right.

1023
01:24:10,063 --> 01:24:14,939
If I wasn't so tired, I'd give them a cheer.
And that's no error.

1024
01:24:40,598 --> 01:24:42,887
Ready to slip, No.1?

1025
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:44,262
All ready, sir.

1026
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:46,395
Let go aft.

1027
01:24:47,314 --> 01:24:49,022
Hold on to your spring, for'ard.

1028
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:50,690
Slow ahead, Starboard Pilot.

1029
01:25:08,129 --> 01:25:09,956
You'd never think there was a war on.

1030
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:12,924
But there isn't. Not just for a minute, that is.

1031
01:25:12,968 --> 01:25:14,761
We've got five more whole days.

1032
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:18,759
Flat calm.

1033
01:25:18,809 --> 01:25:20,517
Looks like a piece of grey silk.

1034
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:22,186
My auntie had a dress that colour,

1035
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:25,682
and she sent it to the cleaner's
and it come back all spotty.

1036
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:32,531
Funny to think this is such a little island,
isn't it?

1037
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:36,193
Mm.

1038
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:47,795
He's got France now,
and France is only 20 miles from England.

1039
01:25:49,052 --> 01:25:50,594
Makes you think, don't it?

1040
01:25:53,599 --> 01:25:56,221
Mummy, Trafalgar won't eat sausage roll.

1041
01:25:56,269 --> 01:25:58,842
That's because you spoil him so dreadfully.

1042
01:25:58,897 --> 01:26:01,470
Look, Bobby. That one diving is a Hurricane.

1043
01:26:04,778 --> 01:26:08,824
No, it isn't, Dad. It's an ME 109,
like the one they brought down last Tuesday.

1044
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:10,824
Don't speak with your mouth full.

1045
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:18,999
What a perfectly lovely day it's been.

1046
01:26:20,464 --> 01:26:21,923
Lovely for us, I mean.

1047
01:26:21,966 --> 01:26:25,086
- I suppose that's very selfish of me, isn't it?
- Extremely.

1048
01:26:25,136 --> 01:26:28,968
I can't believe it's so dreadfully wrong
to forget the war now and again...

1049
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:30,474
when one can, just for a little.

1050
01:26:30,517 --> 01:26:35,394
I think it's very clever of you, with all hell
breaking loose over our defenceless heads.

1051
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,485
I made the most tremendous effort
and pretended it wasn't real at all.

1052
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,315
They were toys having a mock battle
just to keep us amused.

1053
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,449
That's the most shameful confession.
Sheer escapism.

1054
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:46,952
I don't care.

1055
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:50,410
It has been a lovely day.

1056
01:26:50,457 --> 01:26:55,618
The sun's been shining and the country
looks so green and sweet and peaceful.

1057
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:59,539
And you are on leave,
even if it's only till the day after tomorrow.

1058
01:27:00,677 --> 01:27:04,176
Teddy, I wonder where we shall all be
this time next year.

1059
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:07,307
A lot might happen between now
and this time next year.

1060
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,849
(Guard's whistle)

1061
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:14,892
Take care of yourself, my darling.

1062
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:17,232
It was a good honeymoon while it lasted.

1063
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:39,136
Tweedledee smiled gently and began again.

1064
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:45,141
The sun was shining on the sea,
shining with all his might.

1065
01:27:45,187 --> 01:27:49,019
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright.

1066
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:59,526
This cocoa gets thicker and thicker every night.

1067
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:01,867
It's warming, anyhow, sir. Lines the stomach.

1068
01:28:01,914 --> 01:28:03,907
Well, it's practically porridge.

1069
01:28:05,502 --> 01:28:07,162
There goes another lot, sir.

1070
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:12,760
Looks as if poor old Plymouth's
going to get it again.

1071
01:28:15,972 --> 01:28:18,214
Well, I will say one thing for that bit of fish.

1072
01:28:18,266 --> 01:28:20,972
There may not have been much of it,
but it was tasty.

1073
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,641
It's that Mr Morgan. He always favours us.

1074
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:25,481
It's Freda that gets round him.

1075
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:29,440
The moment we got into the shop,
up he comes with a chair as if we was royalty.

1076
01:28:29,488 --> 01:28:32,489
Oh, he's all right,
if only he wasn't quite so nosy.

1077
01:28:32,533 --> 01:28:35,025
- How are you feeling, dear?
- Fine, thank you.

1078
01:28:35,078 --> 01:28:36,988
Did that letter from Shorty cheer you up?

1079
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,373
I wish he was home,
and I wish that ship would get a bit damaged,

1080
01:28:40,418 --> 01:28:44,961
not so that anyone was hurt, mind you,
but just so as he could get a little bit of leave.

1081
01:28:45,006 --> 01:28:48,257
Never mind, dear.
Men must work and women must weep.

1082
01:28:48,302 --> 01:28:49,926
That's what I always say.

1083
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:53,221
That sink's stopped up again.
It never rains but it pours.

1084
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,725
We'd better get Mr Luton in.

1085
01:28:54,767 --> 01:28:57,971
He was blitzed out last week.
Don't know where he's moved to.

1086
01:28:58,021 --> 01:29:01,106
- Anybody seen my scissors?
- Yes, I've got them. Here they are.

1087
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:02,561
(Air-raid siren)

1088
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:04,650
Oh, here they are again!

1089
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:07,815
Bit later than they were last night.

1090
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:12,737
(Siren continues)

1091
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:25,666
I wish you'd go down to the shelter, Freda.

1092
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,878
Please don't start all that again, Auntie.

1093
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:31,181
You know I hate being shut up down there.
It makes me feel sick.

1094
01:29:31,226 --> 01:29:33,349
I'd much rather stay up here, I would really.

1095
01:29:33,395 --> 01:29:35,602
But in your condition, I honestly think...

1096
01:29:35,648 --> 01:29:37,854
It's no use, Mother. Leave her alone.

1097
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,274
It's all very fine you being calm and collected,

1098
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:44,864
but I'll tell you one thing here and now,
my nerves won't stand much more of this.

1099
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:47,946
You can go down to the shelter.
Nobody's stopping you.

1100
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:52,208
Try as I may, I can't understand why
you won't shut up the house and evacuate.

1101
01:29:52,251 --> 01:29:54,659
I've told you why till I'm blue in the face.

1102
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:57,001
(Footsteps outside)

1103
01:29:57,048 --> 01:29:59,421
When you could go away somewhere quiet,

1104
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:02,303
it seems just plain silly to sit here and ask for it.

1105
01:30:02,346 --> 01:30:05,347
Could go away! Where, I should like to know?

1106
01:30:05,391 --> 01:30:08,807
Well, there's Dorothy for a start.
She's got a spare room.

1107
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:10,763
Thank you for nothing. I've slept in it.

1108
01:30:10,814 --> 01:30:12,723
It may be a bit poky, but it's safe.

1109
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:16,523
Once and for all, Mother, will you
do me a favour and shut up about this?

1110
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,610
I've told you how I feel and that's that.

1111
01:30:18,656 --> 01:30:22,785
This is Walter's home, and he expects
to find me in it when he comes back on leave.

1112
01:30:22,828 --> 01:30:25,497
What do you suppose he'd think
if he turned up unexpected

1113
01:30:25,539 --> 01:30:28,624
and found the house locked up
and me hiding in the country?

1114
01:30:28,668 --> 01:30:31,337
He might only have a few hours.
That'd be a nice thing.

1115
01:30:31,379 --> 01:30:33,917
You could let him know where we were,
couldn't you?

1116
01:30:33,965 --> 01:30:37,299
Oh, it's "we" now, is it?
I thought there was a catch in it.

1117
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:41,508
Kathleen Hardy, how can you say such a thing
to your own mother?

1118
01:30:41,557 --> 01:30:43,016
(Bomb whistles)

1119
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:52,607
Well, I'm sorry,
but you make me tired sometimes.

1120
01:30:52,654 --> 01:30:55,739
I'm sure I'm only trying to be sensible.

1121
01:30:55,783 --> 01:31:00,077
What about the garden and Walter's bulbs
that he's so proud of? Who'd look after them?

1122
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:04,072
Bulbs don't need any looking after.
They just come up.

1123
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,373
(Bomb whistles)

1124
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:09,454
(Explosion)

1125
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:13,837
Come on, Freda. Under the stairs you go.
Your chair's all ready for you.

1126
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:15,547
Oh, I'm all right here, Kath.

1127
01:31:15,597 --> 01:31:18,089
Just do as you're told, there's a good girl.

1128
01:31:18,142 --> 01:31:21,392
We'll leave the door open like we did before
so you won't feel lonely.

1129
01:31:21,437 --> 01:31:24,522
- Oh, Kath!
- Come on. I'll bring your sewing.

1130
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:26,559
The light's quite good in the hall.

1131
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:35,486
(Rumbling)

1132
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:36,996
(Explosion)

1133
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:39,992
That sounds like a land mine.

1134
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:44,372
No, just an ordinary HE.
Land mines make more of a rumble.

1135
01:31:44,422 --> 01:31:46,415
(Rumbling)

1136
01:31:46,466 --> 01:31:49,088
I don't like it, Kathleen.
It's no use pretending I do.

1137
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:50,963
I know you don't, Mother. Nobody does.

1138
01:31:51,013 --> 01:31:53,719
But there's no use in making a fuss, is there?

1139
01:31:53,767 --> 01:31:57,302
Cheer up, there's a dear.
Are you all right, Freda?

1140
01:31:57,354 --> 01:31:58,599
Yes, thanks.

1141
01:31:58,647 --> 01:32:01,565
If you're cold, I can run up
and get you an eiderdown

1142
01:32:01,609 --> 01:32:03,234
I'm quite warm.

1143
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:06,896
We'll have some tea in a minute, anyway,
just to keep us going.

1144
01:32:06,949 --> 01:32:09,950
(Bombs whistling)

1145
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,825
(Explosion)

1146
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:37,600
Right you are. Back.

1147
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,813
Carefully, now.

1148
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,438
Whoa. Back. Slow.

1149
01:32:40,487 --> 01:32:42,231
Whoa. Whoa.

1150
01:32:51,792 --> 01:32:53,749
(Explosion)

1151
01:32:54,795 --> 01:32:56,871
(Explosion)

1152
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,312
Tell Walter...

1153
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:14,563
Tell him I didn't want to leave the house.

1154
01:33:28,877 --> 01:33:30,537
(Footsteps)

1155
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:34,549
Nurse?

1156
01:33:36,218 --> 01:33:37,250
Nurse!

1157
01:33:40,515 --> 01:33:42,307
Is it all over?

1158
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,011
Yes, dear.

1159
01:33:44,061 --> 01:33:46,386
It's all over. Don't worry.

1160
01:33:46,438 --> 01:33:48,230
Mother and child doing well.

1161
01:33:56,533 --> 01:33:58,610
(Air-raid siren)

1162
01:34:16,933 --> 01:34:20,717
This is the fourth time in three months
we've put into this dead-and-alive hole.

1163
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:22,977
Don't worry, cock. We'll be off again tonight.

1164
01:34:23,023 --> 01:34:26,689
I know. There's no need to rub it in.
But I'm chock-a-block with this place.

1165
01:34:26,736 --> 01:34:29,144
Well, where could you go
if you could get ashore?

1166
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:34,358
Look at it. Nowt but sheep and seagulls.
Not even a tree.

1167
01:34:34,411 --> 01:34:37,365
What do you expect in the north of Scotland?
A blinkin' casino?

1168
01:34:37,414 --> 01:34:41,329
There must be one bottle of beer in Scotland.
Just one wonderful bottle of beer.

1169
01:34:41,377 --> 01:34:43,251
Well, here comes Posty, anyway.

1170
01:34:44,422 --> 01:34:48,290
Edgecombe, Blake...
There you are, Shorty. Hollett.

1171
01:34:48,344 --> 01:34:50,752
Stick it on the table, will you?
My hands are wet.

1172
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:53,640
- I expect it's a bill from my tailor.
- Mackeridge.

1173
01:34:53,683 --> 01:34:55,261
- Only one?
- That's right.

1174
01:34:56,311 --> 01:34:57,770
It's from my young sister.

1175
01:34:57,813 --> 01:35:01,431
After months on the North ruddy Sea,
all I get is a letter from my young sister.

1176
01:35:01,484 --> 01:35:03,441
Shut up grumbling for a bit, can't you?

1177
01:35:03,486 --> 01:35:05,111
Cheer up. It may be bad news.

1178
01:35:05,154 --> 01:35:07,112
- Oh, dear, more trouble.
- What's up?

1179
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:10,242
Some fathead left the coal hole open.
My old woman fell down it.

1180
01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:12,078
(Laughter)

1181
01:35:12,122 --> 01:35:13,865
Joey! Joey!

1182
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:18,369
It's come. The baby's come.
It weighs 7lb and it's a boy.

1183
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,164
Here, listen to what she says.

1184
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,338
"It was born in the middle of a blitz..."

1185
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,924
What's the matter?

1186
01:35:31,853 --> 01:35:33,133
Kath Hardy.

1187
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:35,475
Kath and her mother.

1188
01:35:36,316 --> 01:35:39,567
- The whole house went and they got killed.
- Mrs Hardy?

1189
01:35:41,113 --> 01:35:43,818
Yes. My missus was living with them,
you know.

1190
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:49,287
I wonder if anybody's told him.

1191
01:35:50,374 --> 01:35:52,367
They hadn't got any kids, had they?

1192
01:35:53,753 --> 01:35:55,496
No, they ain't got no kids.

1193
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:00,332
Well...

1194
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:04,551
I suppose I'd better go and see if I can find him.

1195
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:49,942
Hello, Shorty.

1196
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:56,115
I er... just popped along
to see if you had any news from home.

1197
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:59,362
Not so much as a postcard,
but that's Kath all over.

1198
01:36:59,412 --> 01:37:03,161
All the years we've been married,
I've never known her get a post right yet.

1199
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:05,166
Have you heard from Freda?

1200
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:06,871
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?

1201
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:10,215
She's all right.

1202
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:15,088
Why, what's the matter?

1203
01:37:16,807 --> 01:37:18,266
It's Kath, Walter.

1204
01:37:18,309 --> 01:37:19,851
She and Mrs Lemmon.

1205
01:37:21,312 --> 01:37:22,688
You see...

1206
01:37:23,815 --> 01:37:27,980
They was all in the house together and...
it got blitzed.

1207
01:37:28,697 --> 01:37:30,357
What do you mean?

1208
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:33,158
Kath got killed.

1209
01:37:33,202 --> 01:37:35,029
Both of them did.

1210
01:37:37,081 --> 01:37:38,825
Freda was all right. She...

1211
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:41,500
She was under the stairs.

1212
01:37:46,884 --> 01:37:48,343
Oh, I see.

1213
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:51,711
So, er...

1214
01:37:52,974 --> 01:37:57,139
I thought I'd better come along and tell you,
seeing that...

1215
01:37:57,188 --> 01:38:00,308
Thanks, son. I'm much obliged.
I'm much obliged.

1216
01:38:05,614 --> 01:38:07,903
I think I'll just go out on deck for a bit.

1217
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:10,233
Righto.

1218
01:38:17,044 --> 01:38:20,994
- I'm glad Freda's all right.
- Yes, she's fine. We er...

1219
01:38:22,175 --> 01:38:23,633
We've got a son.

1220
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,715
I'm glad.

1221
01:38:28,223 --> 01:38:29,552
Congratulations.

1222
01:38:41,781 --> 01:38:43,324
(Seagulls cry)

1223
01:39:18,782 --> 01:39:20,324
She's going, sir.

1224
01:39:25,331 --> 01:39:27,823
Three cheers for the ship.

1225
01:39:28,877 --> 01:39:30,953
Hip, hip, hooray!

1226
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:34,707
Hi hi hooray!

1227
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:36,338
(Aircraft approaches)

1228
01:39:36,385 --> 01:39:38,463
Look out. They're coming again.

1229
01:40:25,443 --> 01:40:29,275
Dark object floating off starboard bow, sir.
Looks like a raft.

1230
01:40:29,322 --> 01:40:31,860
You're right, Yeoman.
Stand by to pick up survivors.

1231
01:40:31,908 --> 01:40:33,367
Aye aye, sir.

1232
01:40:37,456 --> 01:40:39,533
(Coughing and spluttering)

1233
01:40:45,675 --> 01:40:48,795
Keep up your spirits.
I believe they've arrived at last.

1234
01:40:48,845 --> 01:40:50,922
(All shout)

1235
01:40:52,099 --> 01:40:54,851
Looks like one of the old flotilla.

1236
01:40:56,646 --> 01:40:57,677
(Cheering)

1237
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:00,518
(Joey plays Roll Out The Barrel)

1238
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:03,355
# We'll have a barrel of fun

1239
01:41:04,446 --> 01:41:07,234
# Roll out the barrel

1240
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,488
# We've got the blues on the run

1241

(Cheering)

1242
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:17,369
(Ship's siren)

1243
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,135
Thank you.

1244
01:41:34,022 --> 01:41:36,644
- I'm damned glad to see you, sir.
- Thanks, No.1.

1245
01:41:36,692 --> 01:41:38,850
Captain sends his compliments, sir.

1246
01:41:38,903 --> 01:41:43,731
Thank you. Tell him from me, I warned him.
He won't get command of this flotilla yet.

1247
01:41:43,783 --> 01:41:46,025
It was an extraordinary bit of luck finding you.

1248
01:41:46,077 --> 01:41:48,830
The Chief Yeoman spotted you.
We were about to give up.

1249
01:41:48,872 --> 01:41:52,824
- How many of my men have you picked up?
- 90, sir. Some are badly knocked about.

1250
01:41:52,878 --> 01:41:54,538
- Where are they?
- Between decks.

1251
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:57,376
- The dive-bombing's been pretty incessant.
(Alarm)

1252
01:41:59,177 --> 01:42:02,178
Here we go again. Anybody got any Flit?

1253
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:06,172
- Anybody happen to know where we're going?
- Alexandria, I expect.

1254
01:42:06,227 --> 01:42:07,935
Join the Navy and see the world.

1255
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:10,221
Looks to me as if it's going to be the next world.

1256
01:42:12,609 --> 01:42:14,187
It's all right. Don't move.

1257
01:42:14,236 --> 01:42:16,312
(Dive bomber approaches)

1258
01:42:21,327 --> 01:42:23,700
- Glad you're OK, sir.
- Thanks, Fisher.

1259
01:42:24,873 --> 01:42:27,080
We were getting a bit worried about you, sir.

1260
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:30,411
- Nothing like a good swim before breakfast.
- That's right, sir.

1261
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:42,464
Snotty, give me a piece of paper and a pencil.

1262
01:42:49,776 --> 01:42:52,813
It's... No.17.

1263
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,320
Just as you turn out of...
turn out of the high street.

1264
01:42:59,914 --> 01:43:03,698
All right. I've got the address straight.
I'll let her know.

1265
01:43:04,794 --> 01:43:06,040
Thank you, sir.

1266
01:43:31,325 --> 01:43:32,784
All right, son.

1267
01:43:42,921 --> 01:43:45,495
Try it a little louder, son. I can't quite hear.

1268
01:43:48,344 --> 01:43:54,099
24... Gr... Greek Street.

1269
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:06,067
All right. Don't worry.
I'll write and tell them they can be proud of you.

1270
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:15,492
(Bomb whistles)

1271
01:44:15,543 --> 01:44:17,536
(Explosion)

1272
01:44:17,587 --> 01:44:22,084
Of all the persistent bastards!
You'd think they'd get tired, wouldn't you?

1273
01:44:22,134 --> 01:44:25,717
I'll tell you something -
strictly between you and I -

1274
01:44:25,763 --> 01:44:28,433
I'm scared stiff,
and it's no good pretending I'm not.

1275
01:44:28,475 --> 01:44:30,551
If I could be at a gun, I shouldn't mind,

1276
01:44:30,602 --> 01:44:33,971
but this sitting about and asking for it
is beginning to get me down.

1277
01:44:34,023 --> 01:44:38,068
- Brace up. Remember Nelson.
- Yeah, look what happened to him.

1278
01:44:38,111 --> 01:44:40,234
(Bomb whistles down)

1279
01:44:41,406 --> 01:44:44,822
(Barrel organ plays
If You Were The Only Girl In The World)

1280
01:45:00,803 --> 01:45:01,835
(Doorbell)

1281
01:45:04,975 --> 01:45:07,051
(Sobbing)

1282
01:45:11,108 --> 01:45:12,139
(Doorbell)

1283
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,651
Oh, all right!

1284
01:45:22,704 --> 01:45:25,492
- Name of Blake?
- Yes, name of Blake.

1285
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:27,332
- Here you are, then.
- Thanks.

1286
01:45:37,805 --> 01:45:39,845
There's no answer.

1287
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:40,922
(Sobs)

1288
01:45:42,227 --> 01:45:44,552
Freda! Dad! Freda! May!

1289
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:47,226
He's safe! He's all right! He's safe!

1290
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:51,019
He's safe, Freda! He's safe!

1291
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:52,612
He's all right! He's safe!

1292
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:56,944
- What is it? It's not...
- It's from him.

1293
01:45:56,993 --> 01:45:59,829
He's sent a telegram. It's from him himself.

1294
01:45:59,872 --> 01:46:03,288
He's all right. My boy's all right.

1295
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:06,122
But the ship went down.
It said so in the papers.

1296
01:46:06,171 --> 01:46:07,202
Ook

1297
01:46:13,054 --> 01:46:15,046
OK... love.

1298
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:25,900
There, there, dear.
There isn't nothing to cry about no more.

1299
01:46:28,781 --> 01:46:30,441
Shall I wait for an answer?

1300
01:46:30,491 --> 01:46:33,065
Oh... Just a minute, I'll see.

1301
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,361
Can we go down to the village after tea,
Mummy?

1302
01:46:35,413 --> 01:46:37,952
- I want to go on my bicycle.
- I want to go on mine, too.

1303
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,413
- You can't. You've got a flat tyre.
- But I'm going to pump it up again.

1304
01:46:42,463 --> 01:46:44,836
The girl's waiting for an answer, ma'am.

1305
01:47:03,446 --> 01:47:04,988
There's no answer.

1306
01:47:06,866 --> 01:47:10,366
Tell Mrs Bates and John it's from the Captain
and everything's all right.

1307
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:14,161
- I'm so glad, ma'am.
- Thank you, Emily.

1308
01:47:20,757 --> 01:47:22,465
Darlings, it's from Daddy.

1309
01:47:23,678 --> 01:47:26,050
He was picked up and taken to Alexandria.

1310
01:47:27,099 --> 01:47:28,474
He's quite safe.

1311
01:47:28,517 --> 01:47:31,055
Oh, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!

1312
01:47:45,203 --> 01:47:46,827
Ship's company...'shun!

1313
01:47:47,705 --> 01:47:49,782
Ship's company present, sir.

1314
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,289
Thank you, Torps. Stand them easy, please.

1315
01:47:52,336 --> 01:47:54,958
Ship's company, stand at ease!

1316
01:47:56,048 --> 01:47:57,507
Stand easy.

1317
01:48:04,516 --> 01:48:06,177
Come a little closer.

1318
01:48:15,362 --> 01:48:18,779
I have come to say goodbye
to the few of you who are left.

1319
01:48:20,451 --> 01:48:23,239
We've had so many talks, and this is our last.

1320
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,072
I've always tried to crack a joke or two before,

1321
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,792
and you've all been friendly
and laughed at them.

1322
01:48:30,839 --> 01:48:33,924
But today, I'm afraid I've run out of jokes,

1323
01:48:35,803 --> 01:48:39,007
and I don't suppose any of us
feels much like laughing.

1324
01:48:41,435 --> 01:48:43,593
The Torrin has been in one scrap after another,

1325
01:48:43,645 --> 01:48:49,186
but even when we had men killed, the majority
survived and brought the old ship back.

1326
01:48:51,571 --> 01:48:53,564
Now she lies in 1500 fathoms...

1327
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:57,441
...and with her, more than half our shipmates.

1328
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:02,322
If they had to die, what a grand way to go.

1329
01:49:03,835 --> 01:49:06,920
For now they lie all together
with the ship we loved,

1330
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:08,921
and they're in very good company.

1331
01:49:08,966 --> 01:49:13,379
We've lost her, but they're still with her.

1332
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,972
There may be less than half the Torrin left,

1333
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:24,516
but I feel that we'll all take up the battle
with even stronger heart.

1334
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:29,945
Each of us knows
twice as much about fighting,

1335
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:32,826
and each of us
has twice as good a reason to fight.

1336
01:49:35,038 --> 01:49:39,119
You will all be sent to replace men
who have been killed in other ships.

1337
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:44,381
And the next time you're in action,

1338
01:49:44,424 --> 01:49:45,883
remember the Torrin.

1339
01:49:51,766 --> 01:49:53,558
I should like to add...

1340
01:49:55,395 --> 01:50:02,194
...that there isn't one of you that I wouldn't be
proud and honoured to serve with again.

1341
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:07,231
Goodbye.

1342
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:10,031
Good luck.

1343
01:50:12,623 --> 01:50:15,197
And thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

1344
01:50:25,638 --> 01:50:27,216
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1345
01:50:29,976 --> 01:50:31,008
Goodbye.

1346
01:50:32,563 --> 01:50:34,639
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1347
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:36,972
Goodbye, sir.

1348
01:50:37,026 --> 01:50:38,604
Goodbye, Rawlings.

1349
01:50:40,322 --> 01:50:41,899
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1350
01:50:43,576 --> 01:50:44,905
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1351
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:48,533
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1352
01:50:50,334 --> 01:50:52,742
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thanks, Harris. Goodbye.

1353
01:50:53,796 --> 01:50:56,085
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1354
01:50:57,467 --> 01:50:59,045
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1355
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:02,547
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1356
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:04,556
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

1357
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,392
Goodbye, sir. The very best of luck.

1358
01:51:08,188 --> 01:51:09,848
Thanks, Roach. Goodbye.

1359
01:51:10,816 --> 01:51:13,853
- The very best of luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1360
01:51:13,903 --> 01:51:16,061
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Fisher.

1361
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,900
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Moran.

1362
01:51:19,951 --> 01:51:22,656
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Hollett.

1363
01:51:22,704 --> 01:51:25,457
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Edgecombe.

1364
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,251
Goodbye, sir. Bon voyage.

1365
01:51:29,295 --> 01:51:30,754
Thanks, Brodie.

1366
01:51:31,756 --> 01:51:34,462
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mackeridge.

1367
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,549
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, Blake.

1368
01:51:36,595 --> 01:51:38,138
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

1369
01:51:39,182 --> 01:51:41,174
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Hardy.

1370
01:52:35,914 --> 01:52:38,666
Here ends the story of a ship,

1371
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:41,082
but there will always be other ships,

1372
01:52:41,128 --> 01:52:43,536
for we are an island race.

1373
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:48,798
Through all our centuries,
the sea has ruled our destiny.

1374
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:53,598
There will always be other ships
and men to sail in them

1375
01:52:54,936 --> 01:53:00,015
It is these men, in peace or war,
to whom we owe so much.

1376
01:53:01,152 --> 01:53:05,780
Above all victories, beyond all loss,

1377
01:53:05,824 --> 01:53:09,110
in spite of changing values
in a changing world,

1378
01:53:10,246 --> 01:53:13,698
they give, to us, their countrymen,

1379
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:16,420
eternal and indomitable pride.

1380
01:53:19,173 --> 01:53:21,213
(Cheering)

1381
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:25,346
Open fire!

1382
01:53:28,225 --> 01:53:32,555
God bless our ships, and all who sail in them.
