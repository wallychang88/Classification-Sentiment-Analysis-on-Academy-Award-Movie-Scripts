6
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:27,383
? Marching in the winter?

7
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:31,220
? Marching in the fall ?

8
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,181
? Marching in the summer ?

9
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,642
? But spring is best of all ?

10
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:41,230
? 'Cause then it's March, March,
March, April, May, June ?

11
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,525
? June, June, June, July,
August, September ?

12
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:48,446
? Sept, Sept, September,
October, November, December ?

13
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:53,159
? January, February, March,
March, March, April, May, June ?

14
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,330
? June, June, June, July,
August, September ?

15
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,708
? Sept, Sept, September,
October, November, December ?

16
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:05,755
? January, February, March,
March, March, April, May, June ?

17
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:09,425
? June, June, June, July,
August, September ?

18
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:12,803
?Sept, Sept, September,
October, November, December ?

19
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,555
? January, February ?

20
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:18,267
? Marching in the winter ?

21
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:21,896
? Marching in the fall ?

22
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,899
? Marching in the summer ?

23
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:31,405
? But home is the best of all ??

24
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,662
Hey!

25
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,955
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Rover Boys.

26
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,541
- Hiya, Tim!
- How are ya?

27
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,543
Aren't you guys
ever gonna grow up?

28
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,837
Is this any way to greet
your American heroes?

29
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,673
C'mon, don't spoil
our last day together.

30
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,341
Yeah, give us
a pleasant smile.

31
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,385
We've been over there
cutting the German lines

32
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,178
protecting your right
to cut your scotch.

33
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:56,764
- We've been gone for two years.
- Haven't you missed us?

34
00:02:56,973 --> 00:03:00,101
Sure, I missed you. I got a tab
here exactly two years old.

35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,602
Take care of it, banker.

36
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,938
$75.80. Fork up
or no liquor.

37
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,023
Oh, you're a sentimentalist
at heart, Tim.

38
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,067
Listen, this is a bar,
not a barbershop.

39
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,069
What do you got there?
Hey, Silvio!

40
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:12,363
You guys act as if
you own the joint.

41
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:15,616
Hey, Silvio!
Hey! Hi!

42
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:17,118
- Silvio!
- Hi. How are you?

43
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,536
- Silvio!
- Silvio!

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,584
- What's he going to make?
- 3 ham sandwiches. Great cook.

45
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,379
Come on, Tim, set 'em up.
Put 'em on a tab.

46
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:29,755
No more tabs.

47
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:32,842
Cash. You're civilians now.
You owe me a buck for this.

48
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:35,636
- I think you're over tipping.
- What do you mean? We can't-

49
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:38,514
I just wanted you
to know I didn't forget it

50
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:40,641
and you can't put
anything over on me.

51
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:42,184
Keep the dough.

52
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:44,145
- You're going to need it.
- Gee, Tim--

53
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,439
Tim, I'd like to leave you
a little remembrance

54
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:49,525
because we're all bustin' up
and going home. This is for you.

55
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:52,319
Take it, save it, frame it.
Put it over the bar.

56
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,988
Someday it'll
be worth millions.

57
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:55,990
- What is it?
- An original Douglas Hallerton.

58
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,658
Security for your old age.

59
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,035
I'm trying to attract patrons,
not scare them away.

60
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,205
This saloon will be famous one
day 'cause this painting's here.

61
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,875
Yeah! Like places that say
George Washington slept here.

62
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,293
- Like that.
- Yeah, like that.

63
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,586
Coming up!

64
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,213
Oh, that's a pretty picture.
Look like a pizza pie.

65
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,758
We call it the picture
you eat with a spoon.

66
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,886
Stand back, Silvio. Just
a little room. Huh! Hoo! Huh!

67
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:21,557
Ted, got some mail for you.

68
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,059
I hope it's the one.
It is!

69
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,728
- A dame?
- The future Mrs. Riley!

70
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,397
Wife of one of the future
lawmakers of the US.

71
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:29,732
- This no-goodnik?
- No-goodnik?

72
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,066
Head man in his school.

73
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:32,860
President of the Pittsburgh
Junior Debating Society.

74
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,653
- Phi Beta Kappa.
- Student of English literature.

75
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:36,947
- A born leader!
- Vote for Riley!

76
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,574
'Dearest Ted'

77
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:41,243
'I've missed you so terribly and
worried about you constantly'

78
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,788
'so far away and in such
danger all the time.'

79
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:46,081
'You know there is
no one in the world'

80
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,917
'nearer and dearer
to me than you.'

81
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,835
'I know you'll have
a brilliant career'

82
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,504
'when you finish law school.'

83
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,798
'But we haven't seen
each other in several years'

84
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,800
'and people grow up and change.'

85
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,385
'Ted, I hope it makes no
difference in our friendship'

86
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:00,679
'just because I happened
to get married last month.'

87
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,182
'Joe is the most
wonderful guy in the world.'

88
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,385
Hey!

89
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,013
Ah, back again.

90
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:37,933
- C'mon, Tim, give us a drink.
- Set up a little harmless--

91
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,727
Alright, alright.
One more and that's it.

92
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,729
It's closing time.
It's four o'clock.

93
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,565
- Closing time?
- Where's the clock?

94
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,859
Well, we got to help
old Tim close up.

95
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:48,360
Well, of course.

96
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,570
Come on.

97
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,285
Hey! Watch that!

98
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:57,828
- Sorry.
- The war's over.

99
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,329
People don't love
drunk civilians

100
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,873
like they love
tipsy soldiers.

101
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:03,250
Hey! We're civilians now!

102
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:18,807
? Oh, the time has
come for parting ?

103
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:24,605
? And the marching music ends ?

104
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:31,361
? No matter where
our lives may lead us ?

105
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:37,993
? In our hearts,
we'll still be friends ?

106
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:43,457
? Though the time
has come for parting ?

107
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:49,755
? And the future lies unknown ?

108
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:55,928
? Although the years
may come between us ?

109
00:11:56,137 --> 00:12:02,726
? We will never feel alone ?

110
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:08,857
? For friends we are now ?

111
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:15,155
? And friends we'll stay ?

112
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:22,079
? Until we meet again ?

113
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:29,169
? One wonderful day ?

114
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:51,733
? Although the time
has come for parting ?

115
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,362
? We'll be friends ?

116
00:12:55,571 --> 00:13:02,202
? Until we die ??

117
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:07,582
Stop, you guys. What're
you kidding yourselves for?

118
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,377
A month from now, you won't even
remember each other's names.

119
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,045
- What?
- Sure, you're buddies now.

120
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:15,382
I've seen it before. It's like
a girl you met at the Catskills.

121
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,926
Never see her again
when you get to the city.

122
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:19,469
Hey, what're you
talking about?

123
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,513
This is different.
We've been together four years.

124
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:24,099
The war's over, kids.
In a month from now...phew.

125
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:26,101
Alright, Tim.
You give us one month, huh?

126
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:29,438
Well, I say we're friends for
life and nothing can change it.

127
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,440
Five years, ten years.

128
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,442
Look, Tim, I'll make you a bet.

129
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,402
Ten years from today

130
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:38,989
October 11, 1955,
at 12 o'clock noon

131
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,326
no matter where we are or what
we're doing, the three of us

132
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,620
are gonna walk right through
that door and meet here.

133
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,289
- Right, guys?
- Right.

134
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,624
- You're crazy.
- You want to bet a $1,000?

135
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:50,959
- Please.
- Alright, then.

136
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,962
A buck from each of us
against one buck from you.

137
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,964
- Enjoy. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

138
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,966
Got a pen, Tim?

139
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,803
Not to be opened till 1955.

140
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,180
In the safe.

141
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,974
I'm making a little memo
here for ourselves.

142
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,520
- October 11, 1955.
- You said it.

143
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,315
Well, good luck, guys. I'll
probably never see you again.

144
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,317
- But good luck anyway.
- You'll see us.

145
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,819
You got a date
October 11, 1955.

146
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,905
Twelve o'clock noon.

147
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,867
You start chilling a bottle
of champagne right now.

148
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,125
You sure you're gonna
be alright, Ted?

149
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,503
Sure. Sure.

150
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,672
Well...so long.

151
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,436
Alright, you can
get dressed now.

152
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:57,437
Kid Mariacchi.

153
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:59,814
Go ahead, Kid.

154
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,858
Nashby, Sports Herald.
Do you manage the kid?

155
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,236
- Yeah. Hiya, rocky.
- What do you say, sport?

156
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,322
Might give him a little squib?
Bring him to Stillman's at four.

157
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:08,740
- We'll shoot glamour stuff.
- Thanks.

158
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,534
- You new in the fight racket?
- Yeah.

159
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,620
Didn't know I was gonna be in it
until eight months ago.

160
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,957
I won him in a game.
A crap game. No credit to me.

161
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,001
I couldn't get anything with him
if I tried to hock him

162
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,045
so I tried to do
something with him.

163
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:25,382
You did something with him. He's
no punk. 8 knockouts in a row.

164
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,217
- Number nine tonight, huh, Kid?
- Yeah.

165
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,678
- Mr. Nashby, Sports Herald.
- You look great, Mariacchi.

166
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,680
- Best of luck tonight.
- Thanks.

167
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,682
- How you feeling, Kid?
- I'm okay.

168
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:36,518
Get some sleep, then meet me
at Stillman's Gym at four.

169
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,311
The newspapers
want some pictures.

170
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:40,188
I don't need
no pictures.

171
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:42,816
Any pictures.
And you do need pictures.

172
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,360
Give me something
for a cab, will you? A fin?

173
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,530
A fin? I got exactly two dollars
and some loose change.

174
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:50,198
Here, take it all.

175
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,200
Hey, what's this?
Confederate money?

176
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,702
Hey, give me that.

177
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,996
October 11, 1955.

178
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,540
- Hey, that's today.
- Today? That..

179
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,670
Oh, Doug and Angie.

180
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,675
Uh, what am I talking about?

181
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:10,969
If I go over there,
nobody will show up.

182
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,971
I'm the biggest
sucker of all time.

183
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,975
- Where do you have to go?
- Tim's bar on third avenue.

184
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,977
It's a long way
from here.

185
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:21,688
You're nuts.
It's ten minutes.

186
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:24,149
Nah.

187
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,192
It's ten years.

188
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,041
What can I do
for you?

189
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,668
Oh, could I just have
a glass of water, please?

190
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,932
Say, uh,
when did you get this?

191
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,477
An ex-GI, gave it
to me a long time ago.

192
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,771
Funny thing. Lots of
people ask me about it.

193
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,190
He went off to Europe
to paint or something.

194
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,582
Uh, long distance, I'd like
to place a call to Chicago.

195
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,001
Long beach 1-0-8-8-0.

196
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,003
Mrs. Douglas Hallerton, please.

197
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:30,256
'Tune in tonight
at 11 o'clock for'

198
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,550
Miss Mop-up, Miss Mop-up,
Miss Mop-up.

199
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,637
Don't forget tonight
Miss Mop-up presents

200
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:38,890
'''Midnight With Madeline,''
brought to you by Klenzrite.'

201
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,559
Channel 89 at 11 o'clock.

202
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,189
K-I-e-n-z-r-i-t-e spells
Klenzrite!

203
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:55,573
Hello? Hello, Dorothy?
This is Doug.

204
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,575
I'm in New York.

205
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:01,204
No, no, not on business.
Something much more important.

206
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:05,291
Dorothy, what is this number
where they reached you?

207
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,585
Oh, your lawyer's.

208
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:10,213
Well, Dorothy, look.

209
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,882
Do you have to go
through with it?

210
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:16,511
Well, I know, but if you
love me, why a divorce?

211
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,431
Well, we've been over this
a thousand times.

212
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:23,435
What do you mean, I've changed?

213
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:27,063
What's changed about me?

214
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:29,566
Dorothy, I don't know
what you're driving at.

215
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,701
- Hi, Tim!
- Well, chum, what'll you have?

216
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,953
Hey, don't you know me, Tim?
I'm Angie!

217
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:44,706
Angie Valentine,
United States Infantry.

218
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,209
A lot of fellas come
and go in here, buddy.

219
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,253
Yeah, I guess they do.

220
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,339
Have you seen
two other fellas today?

221
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,383
I wouldn't be doing
such a good business

222
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,385
if I hadn't seen
two fellas all morning.

223
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:59,012
Sure.

224
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,739
Should've known.

225
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,200
Number one sucker of all time.

226
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:30,418
- Doug.
- You're Ted.

227
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:32,128
- Hey!
- Hey!

228
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,964
Ah, you made it!
You made it! We made it!

229
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,966
You haven't
changed much, Doug.

230
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:40,303
Except for the brush. Get a load
of that brush, will you, Ted?

231
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,597
- Ha ha ha!
- Where'd you come from, Doug?

232
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:45,391
- Chicago. How about you?
- Schenectady. Same old place.

233
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,936
- How about you, Ted?
- I've been here the whole time.

234
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:50,271
I didn't know you'd been
here all this time.

235
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,440
Yeah.

236
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,817
Well..

237
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:56,027
Yeah, well.

238
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:57,362
- Hey, Tim!
- Tim!

239
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:59,405
- Tim, we made it!
- We made it, Tim!

240
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:02,116
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Rover Boys.

241
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,744
He didn't even know me
when I first came in.

242
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,288
You said we'd never make it
and here we are.

243
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:09,874
You got no faith, that's.
Come on, set them up.

244
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:12,252
Got to break open
a fresh bottle for this.

245
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,254
- I can't handle a drink, Ted.
- What?

246
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,548
I'm not fit digestion-wise.
Bit of a nervous stomach.

247
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:17,549
Oh.

248
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,551
Well, come to think of it

249
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,887
I haven't had a drink at noon
in a lot of years myself.

250
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,974
Maybe I could handle one. I'll
take a couple of these pills.

251
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,268
Okay by me. I'm game.
Boy, this is great.

252
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,478
- Well, to us.
- To us.

253
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:35,149
- Oh, hey.
- Cut that out, will you?

254
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,694
- The sacroiliac.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:39,696
Boy, if Connie could
only see me now..

256
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:42,073
...drinking in the middle
of the afternoon.

257
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,993
Hey, I got some pictures here
of Connie and the kids.

258
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,327
Very nice.

259
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:48,329
You kept pretty
busy these ten years.

260
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,582
Yeah. How about
you guys? You married?

261
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,584
- Yes, I'm married.
- Pictures of the kids?

262
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,210
No. We don't
have any children.

263
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,629
Well, I'll lend you
a couple of mine!

264
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,341
And how about you, Ted?
You married?

265
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,010
No, thank you.

266
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,012
Well, let's have
another drink.

267
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:07,891
Yeah, let's have another drink.
Boy, this is great. Great.

268
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,184
Hey, you know what?
Let's drink to old Bootsie.

269
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:11,936
- Who?
- Who's old Bootsie?

270
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,771
You know. Don't you
remember? Bootsie!

271
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:16,566
That kid in our outfit who was
always tripping over everything.

272
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,694
From the south. We always
used to toast old Bootsie.

273
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:21,863
Don't you remember?
It was good luck.

274
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:24,198
And then we always
used to laugh.

275
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:25,742
Why?

276
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,744
I don't know.

277
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:29,746
Oh, sure, come on, Doug.
Old Bootsie.

278
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,831
No, I couldn't
handle another one.

279
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,000
- Alright, Angie. Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

280
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,004
- Here you are, Tim.
- No, here. Let me get this.

281
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,548
No, no, I'm the host here.
This is my hometown.

282
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,926
- Hey, 50 bucks.
- You're doing alright, Ted.

283
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,720
- But I always knew you would.
- I'm doing swell.

284
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,764
I borrowed it from
my barber this morning.

285
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,017
It's strictly temporary.
I'll be in the chips tomorrow.

286
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:55,563
Gee, I got to call Connie
and tell her about this.

287
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:57,690
She didn't believe
you guys would show up.

288
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,735
She's a great girl, Connie.
Sometimes a little bit jealous.

289
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,779
Guess you know what
that's like, huh, Doug?

290
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,781
Oh, sure.

291
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,824
Look, I'll tell you
what we'll do.

292
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:09,619
We'll have a few more drinks
and go somewhere for lunch?

293
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:10,703
- Yeah.
- Florio's.

294
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:12,455
Florio's. Veal parmesan lasagna.

295
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,374
I couldn't handle
that heavy food.

296
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,417
I have to be a little careful
restaurant-wise

297
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,086
and go where they know me.

298
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,630
Why don't I take you two
chaps to the Turquoise?

299
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,839
- The Turquoise?
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:23,257
- Whoo.
- I'll handle it.

301
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:26,094
- No, I can handle it.
- No. I wouldn't think of it.

302
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,096
I'll just put it
on the expense account.

303
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:30,682
I'll charge this whole day off
as a business trip.

304
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,767
Oh, that's just swell.

305
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:46,447
Doug, you never did get back
to Europe to paint, did you?

306
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:49,117
No, career-wise,
it didn't seem practical

307
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:51,786
but I've been creative
in the advertising line

308
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:53,788
with Little Miss Mop-up
for Klenzrite

309
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,290
and Jolio, the gelatin man.

310
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,835
No. I don't miss
<i>la vie Boheme</i> one bit.

311
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,837
Little Miss Mop-up.
You did that?

312
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:03,631
- Mm-hmm
- Well, what do you know?

313
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:05,633
Hey, if you're ever up
Schenectady way

314
00:25:05,843 --> 00:25:07,677
you have to drop in
at my place.

315
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,679
Real red meat
at the Cordon Bleu.

316
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,681
- At the what?
- The Cordon Bleu.

317
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,683
That's the name
of my hamburger joint.

318
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,685
Ha ha ha! That's rich.

319
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,979
Ha ha ha. That is priceless.

320
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:19,480
What's so funny?

321
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,774
As far as names go,
it seems to me

322
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:24,068
Little Miss Mop-up
and Jolio, the gelatin man

323
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:25,737
are pretty priceless
themselves.

324
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:27,488
- Oh, well, I--
- Oh, come on.

325
00:25:27,698 --> 00:25:28,990
Jolio, the gelatin man.

326
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,658
Your call to
Schenectady, sir.

327
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,744
Gee, thanks.

328
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:38,166
Hello? Connie?

329
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,876
Hey, it's me.

330
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,712
I'm talking to you
from a table at the Turquoise.

331
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,839
What a swanky dump.

332
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,508
Hey, what do you know?
They both showed up.

333
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,594
Oh, it's great.
Like old times.

334
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:52,013
How are the kids? Good.

335
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:54,974
How did Johnny do in the
Columbus Day School Pageant?

336
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:58,853
Huh? He forgot
''Oh, Columbus, we salute you?''

337
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:01,564
Went over that line
a thousand times with him.

338
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:06,444
Look, Connie,
I'll call you back later.

339
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:09,113
Tell you when I'm coming home.
Miss you too.

340
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:11,157
Yeah. Goodbye.

341
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,204
Well, Ted, how about you?

342
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,206
Law school
and the political arena?

343
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, the midtown arena
is about the only arena I know.

344
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,045
Which reminds me, I have to
get up to Stillman's Gym later

345
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:25,379
and look at my fighter.

346
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,381
Racketeers in
the fight game, huh?

347
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,509
Glad I'm in
a respectable business.

348
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:44,565
? I shouldn't have come ?

349
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:46,776
? I shouldn't have come ?

350
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:50,279
? This thing's a mistake ?

351
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:54,283
? An awful mistake ?

352
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:56,536
? That guy's such a snob ?

353
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,498
? And who is that hick? ?

354
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:04,293
? Can these be the guys
I once thought ?

355
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:07,004
? I could never live without? ?

356
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,758
Who do you think
will win the world series?

357
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,052
Well, uh, both teams
look pretty good to me.

358
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:14,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

359
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,764
Well, may the best team win.

360
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,356
? This thing is a frost ?

361
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,401
? I'd like to get lost ?

362
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,445
? Old pals are the bunk ?

363
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:34,448
? This guy's a cheap punk ?

364
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:37,493
? And that one's a heel ?

365
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,371
? And I'm a Schlemiel ?

366
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:44,208
? Can these be the guys
I once thought ?

367
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:47,420
? I could never live without? ?

368
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,021
? This thing's a bad dream ?

369
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,231
? Why can't I just scream? ?

370
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,402
? Oh, why did I fly ?

371
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:14,488
? To New York from Chi? ?

372
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:17,325
? To drink scotch at noon ?

373
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:20,119
? With a hick and a goon ?

374
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:23,456
? Can these be the guys
I once thought ?

375
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:26,709
? I could never live without? ?

376
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,502
? This guy is a punk,
a punk, a punk ?

377
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:30,546
? This guy is a snob,
a snob, a snob ?

378
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,340
? This guy is a dope,
a hick, a square ?

379
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,175
? I shouldn't have come
I'm in despair ?

380
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:36,093
? Our dreams are dustin'
down the drain ?

381
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:37,762
? This thing is a bust
and I'm insane ?

382
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:41,349
? Oh, why did I come?
Oh, why am I here? ?

383
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:43,059
? A hick, a square,
a snob, a punk ?

384
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:44,685
? A hick, a square,
a snob, a punk ?

385
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:47,021
? Hah-hah-hah-hah
Ho-ho-ho-ho ?

386
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:48,940
? A hick, a square,
a snob, a punk ?

387
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:50,358
? A hick, a square,
a snob, a punk ?

388
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:54,070
? Why did I come?
Why am I here? ?

389
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,989
? Why? ??

390
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,834
Good afternoon, Miss Leighton.
This way, please.

391
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,675
Thank you, Carl.

392
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:19,929
Thank you.

393
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,014
Scotch old-fashioned,
please, Carl.

394
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:25,059
That's what I like.
An old-fashioned girl.

395
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,728
I'm an old-fashioned
boy, myself.

396
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,398
Here we are, gentlemen.

397
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,400
Salisbury steak medium
for you, sir.

398
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:33,859
Thank you.

399
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:36,237
Medium rare for you,
Mr. Hallerton.

400
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:37,571
Thank you.

401
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,782
And well done
for you, sir.

402
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:42,243
Thank you.

403
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,996
Hey! You call this a hamburger?
For four bucks?

404
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,247
Angie, shh, please.

405
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:48,291
Ted, you taste it.
You know about horses.

406
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,876
I tell you this hamburger
ran in the Kentucky derby.

407
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:51,877
Forget it, Angie.

408
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,421
If I served
stuff like this

409
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,965
I'd be run out of Schenectady
on the third rail.

410
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,508
- Shut up.
- What did you say?

411
00:29:57,718 --> 00:29:59,427
I said be quiet.
This is embarrassing.

412
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:02,221
Angie, don't act like a yokel.
We're in a high-class place.

413
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:04,765
Didn't stop you from trying
to make a quick pickup.

414
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,600
I've picked up dames
at better places.

415
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,935
I doubt that!

416
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:10,521
You crumbs couldn't get in
such a place without me.

417
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:11,814
- Who's a crumb?
- You are.

418
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:13,899
- You cheap snob!
- Why, you..

419
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:19,697
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

420
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,158
So am I.

421
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,160
Well, I guess we've had it.

422
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:25,494
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

423
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:26,829
Waiter? Check please.

424
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,164
'Hey, Hallerton.'

425
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,791
- Well, well, well.
- Oh, Mr. Fielding.

426
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:32,793
I didn't know
you were in town.

427
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,628
- Just for the day.
- How's the missus?

428
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,672
- Oh, fine, thank you.
- Is she with you?

429
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,507
No, not this trip.

430
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,801
Oh, Mr. Fielding,
these are two friends of mine.

431
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:43,387
- Mr. Valentine and Mr. Riley.
- How are you, Mr. Fielding?

432
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:46,182
We were in the war together.
We're having a little reunion.

433
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,225
We haven't seen each other
in ten years.

434
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:51,020
It must be fun getting together
to talk about old times.

435
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:52,813
- Mr. Fielding, excuse me.
- Oh, Miss Leighton.

436
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,857
I've been calling you
and couldn't reach you.

437
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,275
It's very important.

438
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:58,319
I want you to meet
Hallerton of Chicago.

439
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,863
He's one of our Executive
Vice Presidents out there.

440
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:03,324
He's responsible
for the Miss Mop-up campaign.

441
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:04,909
Oh, you're the one.

442
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:08,496
Miss Leighton is one of our best
idea men...I should say women.

443
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:09,997
You certainly should.

444
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:11,999
You know, she's
the program coordinator

445
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,794
on our biggest Klenzrite TV
show, ''Midnight With Madeline.''

446
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,462
Well, what do you know?

447
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,506
Uh, Doug, aren't you
going to introduce us?

448
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:19,840
Oh, certainly.

449
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,843
Miss Leighton, this is
Mr. Valentine and Mr. Riley.

450
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:24,845
- How do you do?
- Ted Riley.

451
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:27,890
I suggest we skip lunch and get
right to Madeline's rehearsal.

452
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,184
- You know how she is.
- Oh, sweetie, I can't.

453
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,186
I'm waiting here
for Stamper and Trasker.

454
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:35,773
- And Donner and Blitzen.
- We'd really better go.

455
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:37,108
Well, alright.

456
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,110
Doug, come along
and have a look-see.

457
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,112
We're rehearsing over
at the Fontainebleau.

458
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,697
Oh, I-I'd like that very much.
Well, so long, fellas.

459
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:45,699
- Bring your friends along.
- No!

460
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:47,701
I mean, we're just about
through here lunch-wise

461
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:49,703
and I'm sure they're
very busy appointment-wise.

462
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:52,039
Not at all, Doug.
We'd love to come along.

463
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:55,626
I've got an hour to kill before
I have to be at Stillman's Gym.

464
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:58,421
You see, I own a plug-ugly
who's going to be engaged

465
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,714
fisticuffs-wise tonight
and I have to stop by

466
00:32:00,924 --> 00:32:02,716
and put the lead weights
in his gloves

467
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,718
and wise him up, wise-wise.

468
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,263
Sure, sure, come along.
You, too, Mr., uh..

469
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,557
I'd sure like to meet
Madeline in the flesh.

470
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,559
Maybe get her autograph
to take home.

471
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,895
Yes, you could hang it on
the wall of your hot dog stand.

472
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:16,730
- Hamburgers!
- Hamburgers, of course.

473
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,774
How crude of you, Douglas,
shall we go?

474
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,359
Ha ha ha.

475
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,364
'Say, Fielding.'

476
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,366
- Oh, Stamper and Trasker.
- Hello, Fielding.

477
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:31,579
We're just on our way over to
the Fontainebleau and this is..

478
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:34,415
The Fontainebleau, please. Seven
of us couldn't fit in one cab.

479
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:36,709
- Of all the nerve--
- Uh-uh-uh. Now, don't get mad.

480
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:40,296
I-I had a crazy notion you and I
should get better acquainted.

481
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,672
I see.

482
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:43,174
Besides, uh..

483
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,926
...I think you're about the
prettiest program coordinator

484
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,095
I've ever seen.

485
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:50,681
You know, a fella's
not safe alone in a cab

486
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,683
with a girl, these days.

487
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:54,727
Alright.

488
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,566
Okay?

489
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,568
Satisfied? I just
couldn't face the boredom

490
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:04,570
of fighting you off
for ten blocks.

491
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,572
It's the simplest method,
my own invention.

492
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:08,574
Remove the initiative
from the brute male

493
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:10,576
and he'll retire in confusion.

494
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,703
Now, while you
retire in confusion

495
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:14,705
I'll do a little work.

496
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:17,124
Hey, what kind
of a screwball are you?

497
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,668
To save you the strain
of trying to understand me

498
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:21,670
I'll give you
the salient facts.

499
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,465
Graduate of Barnard,
summa cum laude, career girl.

500
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,467
I'm fairly pretty,
which is a nuisance.

501
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:30,054
I attract a lot of men at first,
but I always find a way

502
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:32,640
of getting rid of them. Then
everybody's happy all around.

503
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:36,018
In short, I can always
scare them off.

504
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:38,020
I don't scare easy.

505
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,022
- No?
- No.

506
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:42,024
Did you ever hear of Planck

507
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:44,026
who discovered the quantum
theory in 1895?

508
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:46,028
Without that
and Maxwell's field theory

509
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:47,821
there'd never be
a theory of relativity.

510
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:49,657
And did you ever hear
of Magadization

511
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,034
the pre-medieval musical system
of voices singing or playing

512
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:54,078
octaves apart?
And did you ever--

513
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:57,498
Time. Did you ever
hear of Kid Mariacchi?

514
00:33:57,707 --> 00:34:00,292
- Kid Mariacchi?
- Yeah.

515
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:02,461
Middleweight, fighting tonight.

516
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:05,673
Height 5 foot 9.
Weight 165.

517
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,842
Chest norm- 39.
Expand- 42.

518
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:10,844
Eight straight
knockouts in a row.

519
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:13,138
Good chance of flattening
Helden tonight.

520
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,016
You're flattening me
right now.

521
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:18,310
Oh, it's just a trick.
It doesn't mean anything.

522
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,312
It has nothing to do
with intelligence.

523
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:23,190
But men do find it
an awful bore.

524
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,527
And I'll tell you something,
I don't care.

525
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:29,822
Because as Shakespeare said
in The Tempest, Act 2, Scene 7

526
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:34,410
''Most friendship is feigning,
most loving...mere folly.''

527
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:41,125
''Most friendship is feigning,
most loving mere folly.''

528
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:45,754
Well...in some ways, you and me
and Shakespeare see eye to eye.

529
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:49,049
I got my diploma
this afternoon.

530
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:52,052
- You and your war buddies?
- Yeah, you saw it.

531
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,054
We met at our old
wartime hangout.

532
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,599
A little place
called Tim's Bar.

533
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,977
We expected to pick up where
we left off ten years ago.

534
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:03,856
What a laugh.

535
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:11,530
Never mind,
it's on Klenzrite.

536
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,326
See? You didn't bother me in the
least on the rest of the trip.

537
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:16,994
My own invention.

538
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:20,789
That invention's gonna explode
in your face someday, Einstein.

539
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,250
Well, so long.

540
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,669
Aren't you gonna say
goodbye to your pals?

541
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:28,589
We said goodbye
a long time ago.

542
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:31,175
But don't let that worry you.
You'll see me again.

543
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,469
Just take the male initiative
and pick me up

544
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,471
at Stillman's Gym
about four o'clock.

545
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,222
I wouldn't bet on that.

546
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:40,267
You know, there are a lot of
things you shouldn't bet on.

547
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:42,603
Like that Shakespeare
quote, for instance.

548
00:35:42,812 --> 00:35:45,439
It ain't The Tempest
Act 2, Scene 7.

549
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:48,609
It's As You Like It,
Act 2, Scene 7.

550
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:52,112
''Hey-ho, sing hey-ho
unto the green holly

551
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:56,909
most friendship is feigning,
most loving mere folly.''

552
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,122
Oh, uh...I'm around
Stillman's all the time.

553
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:14,593
'Quiet, Quiet, please.
Rehearsal.'

554
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,597
''Klenzrite presents..''

555
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,935
''...Midnight With Madeline,
starring..''

556
00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:26,230
...Madeline!

557
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:29,566
? Music is better than words ?

558
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:33,028
? You break the spell
when you start to speak ?

559
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:36,740
? That technique is all wrong ?

560
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,078
? Just forget about words
and sing her a song ?

561
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,834
? Music was made for romance ?

562
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:50,379
? Love and a sweet song
go hand in glove ?

563
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,174
? Every lover knows this ?

564
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:56,343
? And the sweeter the song ?

565
00:36:56,553 --> 00:37:00,681
? The sweeter the kiss ?

566
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,642
? When you're
without love you cry ?

567
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:07,688
? And your song is the blues ?

568
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:10,566
? But when you've
got love you're high ?

569
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:14,486
? And your song
is a gay refrain ?

570
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:20,033
? A happy strain
that sings out the news ?

571
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,412
? Don't let the night
go to waste ?

572
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:26,874
? Looking for ways
to say I love you ?

573
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,335
? Take your cue from the birds ?

574
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:33,005
? Music ?

575
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:38,135
? Music is better ?

576
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,970
? Music is better ?

577
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,935
? Than words ??

578
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,856
Applause, applause, applause.

579
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:53,484
And now, you dear ladies
and gentlemen

580
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:56,612
we come to the part of the
program which is my favorite

581
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,739
because it means something.

582
00:37:58,948 --> 00:38:03,410
Because it means this big,
cold canyon we call New York

583
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,078
really has a heart.

584
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:08,457
And if you listen very hard...
you can hear it throb.

585
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,589
The throb of Manhattan.

586
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:18,300
Last week we brought you
Thomas W. Jackwood

587
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,636
reunited right here with
his wife and children

588
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,096
after 30 years in jail.

589
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:26,183
Tonight again, our surprise
guest or guests

590
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:28,185
are somewhere
in this room.

591
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:30,229
Spotlight.

592
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:34,608
Could it be you?

593
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:37,569
Yes! Yes, it's you, Mr. Kebbner.

594
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,446
This, ladies and gentlemen

595
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,490
is Donald W. Kebbner
of The Bronx.

596
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,992
One of the last army
of little gray men

597
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:47,496
struggling along from day to day
gallantly making ends meet.

598
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:50,249
Everyone has a dream,
ladies and gentlemen.

599
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,292
Such a one is Mr. Kebbner.

600
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:54,962
A simple man with a dream
of visiting the Orient

601
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:57,130
in its unparalleled splendor.

602
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,925
But all his life he has
spent in his candy store

603
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:03,178
on Superior Avenue, where he has
brought the Orient to him

604
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,681
by constructing, for 16 years

605
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,393
a complete table-sized
model of the Taj Mahal

606
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:13,313
executed entirely
in chewing-gum wrappers.

607
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:16,525
No!

608
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,735
No, no, no!

609
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:22,364
I will not have this on my show!
It's terrible!

610
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,700
Jackie, what are you
trying to do? Ruin me?

611
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:27,995
Madeline, it's the best we could
do as a last-minute substitute.

612
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:29,997
Ah! We had something
so wonderful.

613
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,000
A totally reformed drunkard was
going to share inspiring story.

614
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,668
Yes, but he got drunk.

615
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:37,254
You geniuses will just have
to put your heads together.

616
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:40,048
I won't do the show tonight,
I just won't go on.

617
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:43,385
I want 40 million people
to sit home and cry and love me.

618
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,178
Hey, Sam, get me a club sandwich

619
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:48,015
a double order of French fries
and two cans of beer.

620
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,683
- Make it three!
- Madeline, your diet.

621
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:52,477
You know what happens to your
figure when you start eating.

622
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,271
Who cares about
my diet or figure?

623
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,856
I'm unhappy.
I want to eat.

624
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,900
Now, now, here's a nice
pimento cheese sandwich.

625
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,902
I don't want
a pimento cheese sandwich.

626
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:01,987
Yeah, but, sweetie,
it took you so long

627
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:03,530
to take off those 20 pounds.

628
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,866
You mustn't give up
the battle of the bulge.

629
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:08,869
Look who's talking, fatso.

630
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:10,203
You didn't get that corporation

631
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:11,872
on lettuce and tomato
sandwiches.

632
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:14,917
But, sweetie, nobody pays to
look at me in an evening gown.

633
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,669
Who cares? I'm not
going on tonight!

634
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:18,712
Madeline, wait a minute.

635
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:22,049
This chewing-gum
man has no sympathy!

636
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:23,884
- Sweetie, you got to..
- I don't care.

637
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,677
- You always..
- You'll put on 20 pounds..

638
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,387
Calm down, everybody.

639
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,723
I think I've got the spot
solved for tonight.

640
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,516
It's the foulest notion
I've had yet.

641
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,560
After all, it's for
the glory of Klenzrite.

642
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,646
- The show must go on.
- What is it?

643
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:37,606
It's human.
It's up to the minute.

644
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,399
It's guaranteed
to tear your guts out.

645
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:40,776
Yes, yes.

646
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,111
It'll take coordination.
Everybody pitching in, even you.

647
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:46,031
- Well, darling, what is it?
- The three war buddies.

648
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,617
They met today,
for the first time in ten years

649
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:51,203
at their old hangout,
a little place called Tim's Bar.

650
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:54,915
You mean Hallerton and what's
his name and what's his name?

651
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:55,999
Right.

652
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:57,751
And tonight,
much to their surprise

653
00:40:57,961 --> 00:41:00,087
they'll meet again
at 11 o'clock and be interviewed

654
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:02,005
by Madeline
on ''Throb Of Manhattan.''

655
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:04,675
Oh! It's beautiful! Beautiful!

656
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:07,886
Our boys and me and the whole
nation watching and weeping.

657
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,597
That's very good. You think
we oughta talk to Hallerton?

658
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,641
No, this has to be
a surprise show.

659
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,435
Something tells me these three
pals wouldn't want to do this.

660
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:18,522
Take care of Hallerton, get him
to the theater by 11 o'clock.

661
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:20,315
Madeline, you take care
of Mr. Schenectady.

662
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:21,858
How am I gonna take care--

663
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:25,195
Don't let him out of sight. Take
him wherever he wants to go.

664
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:27,280
- To dinner?
- Yes, eat your head off.

665
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,117
That's Hallerton and Valentine

666
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:33,829
and I guess, I'll have to be
responsible for number three.

667
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:41,878
Get that.

668
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:44,381
- Okay, that's enough.
- Hey, what's eating you?

669
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,967
Huh? Oh, nothing. I was just
thinking about the fight.

670
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:48,802
- Ted.
- Thanks, Nashby, so long.

671
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:52,139
- You mad at me about something?
- Why would I be mad at you?

672
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:53,807
Riley. Someone to see you.

673
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:57,144
Someone about six foot four, a
broken nose, an IOU in his hand?

674
00:41:57,353 --> 00:41:59,354
No, about five foot five,
neat little nose

675
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:01,898
and ''I love you'' in her eyes.

676
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:04,526
Hey, lady.
Come in.

677
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:08,697
Hello.

678
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:18,874
Wow.

679
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:24,004
Well, well, well.
Right on the dot.

680
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:26,006
Are you always this prompt?

681
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:28,133
Yes, I'm just a machine.

682
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:30,802
Good, I love to tinker
with machinery.

683
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:33,847
I had a few hours off and I
remembered your kind invitation.

684
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:36,683
I thought I'd drop in
and see all you colorful folk

685
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:38,518
of the world
of fisticuffs in action.

686
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:41,313
- Oh, a sort of research, huh?
- In a manner of speaking.

687
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:42,856
Well, you're just in time

688
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,817
for a nice hot cup of
rubbing alcohol and crumpets.

689
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:49,071
Miss Leighton, this is, as if
you didn't know, Kid Mariacchi.

690
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,447
- How do you do?
- Hello.

691
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,824
Okay, Kid, get dressed,
you'll be great tonight.

692
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:55,410
- And Lefty Louie.
- Delighted.

693
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,038
- Butch McSween.
- Charmed.

694
00:42:58,247 --> 00:42:59,206
Boys, Miss Leighton.

695
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:00,832
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

696
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,876
Miss Leighton is here
to do some research.

697
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,212
She says she wants to see
the colorful folk

698
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:07,839
of the world
of fisticuffs in action.

699
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:09,758
- I'm sure, you'll oblige.
- 'Hey, Ted.'

700
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:13,011
I'll be delighted to escort
Miss Leighton until your return.

701
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,805
Louie, you're a gentleman
and a scholar.

702
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:17,224
- It's a pleasure.
- I'll be right back.

703
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:19,476
Fellow colleagues,
do your stuff.

704
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:21,061
Yeah!

705
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,439
- Look at me, I'm shadow boxing.
- He's got a glass jaw.

706
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:27,609
This is a headgear.
It protects me.

707
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:29,277
Sucks wind in the third round.

708
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:32,531
''One, two, button my shoe.
Three, four, shut the door..''

709
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,824
Good counter-puncher.

710
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:36,743
Well, charming little place
you have here.

711
00:43:36,953 --> 00:43:40,247
Charming little place?
Lady, this is an institution.

712
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:43,834
It's been like a mother to us
and to our fathers before us.

713
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:46,378
Why, these old walls
are as steeped in tradition

714
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:48,713
as the ivy-covered
walls of Harvard.

715
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:56,429
? Over on New York's ?

716
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,266
? Eighth avenue ?

717
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:01,351
? Stands a building ?

718
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:05,063
? Gray and grim ?

719
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:06,857
? It's the home ?

720
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:10,569
? Of broken noses ?

721
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:13,071

722
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:17,784

723
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:20,912
? Though the plastered walls ?

724
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:23,790
? Are peeling ?

725
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,544
? And it looks a mess ?

726
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:30,630
? To some ?

727
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,800
? We point with pride ?

728
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,054
? To that spot
on the Northwest side ?

729
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:39,639
? Mmm ?

730
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,142
? Where John L. Sullivan ?

731
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:48,607
? Always parked his gum ?

732
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,318
? Stillman's Stillman's ?

733
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:52,986
? Rah rah rah ?

00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:57,073
? Hit 'em in the breadbox uh uh
Hit 'em in the breadbox uh uh ?

739
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:09,002

? Home of famous fighting men ?

741
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:14,925
? For you dear old Stillman's ?

742
00:45:15,134 --> 00:45:17,928
? I lay me down
for the count of ten ?

743
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:19,179
? Rah rah rah ?

744
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:21,932
? Stillman's

745
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:25,185
? We worship at your shrine ?

746
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:28,521
? For you dear old Stillman's ?

747
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:32,150
? I'd get me up
at the count of nine ?

748
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:40,825
? As we think
of Stillman's graduates ?

749
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:44,162
? Our eyes begin ?

750
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:47,165
? To mist ?

751
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:50,210
? For the fighting game ?

752
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:53,922

I see you're quite a hit

00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:01,067
Thanks, if I'm staying
with you for dinner

815
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:03,153
I've calls to make.
My office, for instance.

816
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:05,071
- Dinner?
- Oh, don't you want me to?

817
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:07,323
Look, I hate to curb
your male initiative

818
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,909
but a guy likes to ask
once in a while.

819
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,953
Well, then ask me.

820
00:49:12,163 --> 00:49:14,038
Miss Leighton, would you
do me the honor--

821
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:16,082
Yes, come on.

828
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:46,279
Have we any cute military
outfits around?

829
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:50,074
Oh, well, listen...

00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:57,040
What do you say, sport?

832

You look pretty smart,

835
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:10,595
I mean, you're cagey,
you know what I mean?

836
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:14,682
- No, what do you mean?
- Why..

837
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:18,102
I mean, you're so cagey, you
won't even discuss it with me?

838
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:21,731
- What's in on it?
- In on what?

839
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:25,443
- On it.
- Oh, on, uh..

840
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:29,531
- The fix.
- Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah, the fix.

00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,284
Sure. You don't have to worry
about nothing, Ted.

842
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:35,286
Uh...Charlie Culloran,
set it up great.

843
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:37,580
Yeah, Charlie Culloran's pretty
good at that sorta thing.

844
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,416
Oh, yeah, we've been rehearsing.
We got it down perfect.

845
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,878
- You and, uh?
- Me and Mar..

846
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:45,755
Me and Mariacchi.

847
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:50,677
Rocky, don't you think you ought
to run over it once again?

848
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:53,137
- Just to make sure?
- No.

849
00:50:53,347 --> 00:50:55,807
I got it down pat...uh..

850
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:59,143
In the fourth round,
me and the kid, we come out

851
00:50:59,353 --> 00:51:01,396
and we dance around
a little bit, you know.

852
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:04,232
And all of a sudden,
I throw a beautiful left hook

853
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:06,317
catches the kid right
on the button.

854
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,611
He does a neat
half gainer into the canvas

855
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:12,282
and swims the length
of the ring. Huh?

856
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:14,284
Sounds prettier
than the Russian ballet.

857
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:18,538
Yeah, well...it'll bring us
maybe, not fame..

858
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:21,040
...but fortune.

859
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,834
Listen, Rocky,
play it cagey, will you?

860
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:25,128
I mean, don't go around
shooting your mouth off

861
00:51:25,337 --> 00:51:27,714
to somebody who might
not be in on the fix.

862
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:31,509
That would be,
shall we say...silly?

863
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,430
What...what do you,
what do you take me for?

864
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:37,807
I'm...she-e-e.

865
00:51:40,894 --> 00:51:42,353
Uh..

866
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:45,356
I'll see you at Charlie
Culloran's after the fi..

867
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:46,816
I mean, the fight.

868
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:56,284
- Sorry, I need the phone.
- Call you back.

869
00:51:56,493 --> 00:51:57,827
- Come on, come on.
- Well, really!

870
00:51:58,037 --> 00:52:00,413
- Get me a load of dimes.
- Who do you think--

871
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:01,998
Hurry up!

872
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:11,549
Well, that's that.

873
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,343
You've been on that
phone for years.

874
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:15,678
I'm sorry, baby. Last-minute
changes, urgent business.

875
00:52:15,888 --> 00:52:19,057
But now, we'll concentrate on
you. We'll go to some nice--

876
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:22,101
I've gotta do something. I must
go to the Grove Costume Company

877
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,187
and see about some changes
for tonight's show.

878
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:27,148
- Do you mind coming along?
- What have I got to lose?

879
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,526
Oh, what a day.

880
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:33,321
The end of old friendship's
beautiful dream and a frame up.

881
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,822
- Taxi!
- What?

882
00:52:35,032 --> 00:52:38,159
They tried to pull a fast one
on me, but I outsmarted them.

883
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:39,619
Who?

884
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:42,205
Just found out that sweet kid
you met inside, Mariacchi

885
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:44,082
is taking a dive tonight.

886
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,625
- What?
- Yeah, the fight's fixed.

887
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:48,711
- The big fat combine behind it.
- Oh, that's awful.

888
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:49,796
Taxi!

889
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:51,631
Is that what you
were phoning about?

890
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,466
Did you tip off
the boxing commission?

891
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:54,801
Did I tip off..

892
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,387
You think I want to get
my head bashed in

893
00:52:57,596 --> 00:52:59,097
in a dark alley some night?

894
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,683
Oh, no. I played dumb,
took a lot of doing

895
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:04,769
but I managed to get all my
bets switched to Rocky Helding.

896
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,313
I should make a pile
of dough out of it.

897
00:53:07,523 --> 00:53:09,774
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh.

898
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:15,321
Now, situation-wise
and saturation-wise

899
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,116
I think this fiscal year
is going to top them all.

900
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:20,118
- What do you think, Hallerton?
- What wise?

901
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:21,661
I said situation-wise.

902
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,663
Oh, excuse me I thought
you said saturation-wise.

903
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:26,499
I did. I said, situation-wise
and saturation-wise.

904
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:27,625
Oh, definitely.

905
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:29,961
Mr. Fielding, I've gotta get
home. I wanna see Dorothy.

906
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,547
- I'm just beginning to see--
- Nonsense, you can't leave now.

907
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,841
You've got to stay and see
that program tonight.

908
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,635
And Celia's expecting you for
dinner. Trasker, where were we?

909
00:53:37,845 --> 00:53:40,012
Well, sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise

910
00:53:40,222 --> 00:53:42,640
we've nosed out every
other brand from coast to coast.

911
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,726
That's consumer-wise
and housewife-wise.

912
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:47,478
'Soft-spot-wise and danger-wise
we've got to keep our eyes'

913
00:53:47,688 --> 00:53:49,355
on November, December
January, and February.

914
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:52,692
? I think this fiscal year
is going to top them all ?

915
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:54,360
? And sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise ?

916
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,447
? We've nosed out every other
brand from coast to coast ?

917
00:53:57,656 --> 00:53:58,990
? But situation-wise
and saturation-wise ?

918
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,326
? I think this fiscal year
is going to top them all ?

919
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:04,370
? And sales-resistance-wise
and competition-wise ?

920
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,499
? We've got to keep our eye on
We've got to keep our eye on ?

921
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:10,585
? November, November
December, December ?

922
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,045
? November, November
December, December ?

923
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:14,589
? January, February ?

924
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,383
? March, March, March
April, May, June ?

925
00:54:17,593 --> 00:54:20,261
? June, June, June.. ??

926
00:54:23,223 --> 00:54:25,099
Oh, excuse me.

927
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:28,269
I-I have a little bit
of a headache.

928
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:31,606
Pardon me. I'll just step
outside here for a minute.

929
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:33,357
I'll be here.

930
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:53,127
- Okay, Madeline, that's all.
- Girls.

931
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,922
- Over to Grove's Costume.
- Oh, Schenectady!

932
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:58,466
Meet you in the lobby
as soon as I change.

933
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:01,511
Don't forget, you're
taking me to dinner.

934
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,222
I'll be there. Well, bye, girls.

935
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:06,516
Thanks a lot for showing me
everything and everything.

936
00:55:06,725 --> 00:55:07,934
Oh, you're welcome.

937
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:10,770
Can't wait to see the show and
watch Donald Kebbner's face

938
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:13,105
when he finds he's
a surprise guest.

939
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:15,274
Boy, they really keep
it secret, don't they?

940
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:17,735
That's the whole fun.

941
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:19,737
Hey, look at that.

942
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:21,781
I always dreamed
of having things like that

943
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,783
in my restaurant in Schenectady.

944
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:26,327
Oh, do you own a place
like this?

945
00:55:26,537 --> 00:55:29,664
Well, it's not
exactly like this.

946
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:32,583
It's only, uh, it's more modern.

947
00:55:32,793 --> 00:55:35,545
- Oh, bye.
- Bye.

948
00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:59,652
Oh, there you are. It's late,
come on, girls, line up.

949
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:01,904
I know, Max, I'm terribly sorry.
Sorry, girls.

950
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:04,490
Oh, Max, the hats are all wrong.

951
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,492
It's supposed to be America,
not Mauritania.

952
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:08,536
Well, we'll have to do
something about them.

953
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,830
Let me see, get me those
little overseas cap

954
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,832
number 9-7-6-4-J
in your catalog.

955
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,876
- Come on, girls.
- Okay, girls, follow me.

956
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:17,169
I'll be right back, Ted.

957
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,609
? When the time has come ?

958
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,153
? For parting ?

959
00:56:42,362 --> 00:56:44,155
? And the marching ?

960
00:56:44,364 --> 00:56:47,408
? Music ends ?

961
00:56:47,618 --> 00:56:49,535
? No matter where ?

962
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:53,456
? Our lives may lead us ?

963
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,918
? We'll be friends ?

964
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:01,881
? Until we die ?

965
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:07,511
? Once upon a time ?

966
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:10,097
? I had two friends ?

967
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:24,737
? Once upon a time ?

968
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:29,033
? I thought that friendship
never ends ?

969
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:41,796
? Once I had a dream ?

970
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:44,715
? What a joke ?

971
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:51,597
? Gone is that dream ?

972
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:54,225
? Up in smoke ?

973
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:23,105
? Once I had a dream ?

974
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:25,608
? What a joke ?

975
00:59:28,528 --> 00:59:32,865
? Gone is that dream ?

976
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:36,202
? Up in smoke ?

977
00:59:38,038 --> 00:59:43,375
? Gone is that dream ?

978
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:46,712
? Up ?

979
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:50,674
? In ?

980
00:59:50,884 --> 00:59:54,345
? Smoke ?

981
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,521
Ted?

982
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,397
Ted, shall we go?

983
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:09,568
Look, lady, you're excused

984
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:12,530
you don't have to hang around
with me all evening.

985
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,157
I wish I didn't have
to hang around with myself.

986
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:18,661
Oh, we were going to have dinner
and go to the fights, remember?

987
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:24,083
I don't get you.

988
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:27,378
First it was strictly no dice,
for which I can't blame you..

989
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:30,673
And now, you..

990
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:32,758
I don't figure
a broad like you.

991
01:00:32,968 --> 01:00:34,635
I don't get you.

992
01:00:34,845 --> 01:00:37,763
You talk like
a mug, or you try to.

993
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:40,808
But, obviously, well,
that Shakespeare quote..

994
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:44,270
I used to have quite a fondness
for useless information.

995
01:00:44,479 --> 01:00:45,563
Just ask Angie and Doug.

996
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,606
I don't have to ask
Angie and Doug.

997
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:49,441
You know something?

998
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:52,528
Those two used to think
I was greater than Babe Ruth

999
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:55,072
Justice Holmes and Dick Tracy
rolled into one.

1000
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:58,200
What did they think you were
going to turn out to be?

1001
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:02,246
Oh, nothing much.
Just a great man.

1002
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:07,418
I have a sneaking feeling I've
let them down, just a wee bit.

1003
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,962
If they knew about my,
shall we say

1004
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:12,840
helpful attitude
towards this fix

1005
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:15,843
the boys would be
real proud of me.

1006
01:01:16,052 --> 01:01:18,262
Don't you think so?

1007
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:20,431
Don't look for
any sermons from me.

1008
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,059
I've been involved
in some fixes myself.

1009
01:01:24,269 --> 01:01:27,479
I suppose everybody's
in some racket or other.

1010
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:31,025
Say, what is this
tough-woman-of-the-world

1011
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:33,068
pose of yours?
What's your problem?

1012
01:01:33,278 --> 01:01:35,863
- Some man done ya wrong?
- Oh, really?

1013
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:40,201
No, you'd never let anyone
get near enough.

1014
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:44,955
And you think you know
all the answers.

1015
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:48,334
You take the initiative, you..

1016
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:51,503
Actually, you're just plain
inhibited, that's your problem.

1017
01:01:51,713 --> 01:01:54,632
Look. Don't give me any two-bit
snap psycho-analysis

1018
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:57,134
anyone can do it.
Case of Ted Riley.

1019
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,178
Ten years ago,
fresh out of the army.

1020
01:01:59,387 --> 01:02:01,180
You were going to
amount to something.

1021
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,848
But, you had a disappointment.

1022
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:06,435
Don't know if it was a small
blonde one, or a tall dark one.

1023
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:09,521
But since then, you're taking it
out on the world and yourself.

1024
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,274
That'll be 25 cents, please.

1025
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:19,073
That was no snap analysis, lady,
that was my life.

1026
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:24,286
- I'm sorry.
- Na, that's alright.

1027
01:02:24,496 --> 01:02:27,373
You were terrific, doc.
You hit it square on the nose.

1028
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:33,545
Speaking of snap analysis,
I owe you 25 cents.

1029
01:02:33,755 --> 01:02:34,755
Hm?

1030
01:02:36,383 --> 01:02:39,009
You hit it square on
the nose about me, doc.

1031
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,894
Sorry, gotta lock up.

1032
01:02:49,104 --> 01:02:50,938
Oh, we were just going.

1033
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,111
Here, uh, go get
yourself analyzed.

1034
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,745
The Chicago concert season
sounds just divine.

1035
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:08,747
Yeah, Mrs. Hallerton and I
have subscription tickets

1036
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:11,917
to everything, but she always
has to go with her cousin Minnie

1037
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,503
because ol' fatso over there
keeps me working too long.

1038
01:03:14,713 --> 01:03:18,173
Who? Oh, ha ha ha.

1039
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:20,426
How is dear Mrs. Hallerton?

1040
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:22,720
How should I know?
I'm married to her.

1041
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,848
Does she still have
those awful headaches?

1042
01:03:26,057 --> 01:03:27,808
Yes, and she's
tried everything.

1043
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:32,062
Pills, analysis, astrology,
witchcraft. Nothing helps.

1044
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:35,232
It's very simple, she's dying.
I'm boring you to death.

1045
01:03:35,442 --> 01:03:36,442
Ha ha ha.

1046
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,777
She has a certain look
when she's with me.

1047
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:42,281
It's a combination of
boredom, disgust and pity.

1048
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,743
I saw that same look on Ted
and Angie's faces today.

1049
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:49,538
You know who's looking at me
right now, with that same look?

1050
01:03:49,748 --> 01:03:53,250
- Not...me?
- No, not you, four eyes. Me.

1051
01:03:54,627 --> 01:03:56,503
Hey, Garcon! Hey!

1052
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:01,717
I wouldn't have any more
of those if I were you, Doug.

1053
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:03,802
I-I counted three martinis.

1054
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:07,639
And I sneaked five on the side.
That makes eight. Hey, you!

1055
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:11,143
Oh, ha ha ha. You've got to stay
in shape tonight, my boy.

1056
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,520
You're coming to Madeline's
program, you know? Ha ha.

1057
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:17,524
Do I have to witness
that maudlin, disgusting junk?

1058
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:20,027
See some poor, helpless,
surprised guest

1059
01:04:20,236 --> 01:04:22,029
make an idiot of himself?

1060
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:23,572
Well, ha ha ha.

1061
01:04:23,782 --> 01:04:27,159
There must be some more
dignified way to sell Klenzrite.

1062
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:31,705
Like you taking a bath
stark-naked in Macy's window.

1063
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:33,332
Well, why don't you fire me?

1064
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:36,168
Oh, what? I wouldn't dream
of it, my boy. Ha ha.

1065
01:04:36,378 --> 01:04:39,505
I just want you to stay in shape
tonight, that's all. Ha ha.

1066
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:43,133
Where do you get off owning
paintings like these?

1067
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:47,346
Picasso, Braque,
Rouault, Renoir?

1068
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:49,973
What do you know of painting
anyway, you old goof?

1069
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,309
Your art appreciation ended
with Mutt and Jeff.

1070
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:53,685
Ooh.

1071
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,690
Do you have any idea what
it takes to be a great artist?

1072
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,734
Or even an inferior one?

1073
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:04,363
The dedication, the sacrifice,
the time?

1074
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:06,698
Oh, come on, meathead, fire me.

1075
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:11,787
Well...speaking of meatheads,
that reminds me, dinner will--

1076
01:05:11,996 --> 01:05:14,081
Just a second, just a second.
Just a second!

1077
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,874
Oh, now, Doug, uh, Doug!

1078
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:18,001
This is a surprise
for Ted and Angie.

1079
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:24,258
Ha ha ha. I-It's a surprise
for Ted and Angie.

1080
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:37,354
Voila! No Mustache!

1081
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:40,691
Huh? Ted and Angie
would know me now.

1082
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,569
Oh, Doug, I'm glad you're down.
We're a little late dinner-wise.

1083
01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:47,281
Dinner-wise? Gee, I wish
I would've said that-wise.

1084
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:50,576
Whoop! Drink-wise! Drink-wise.

1085
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,036
Drink..sorry-wise.

1086
01:05:54,622 --> 01:05:56,290
I apologize.

1087
01:05:58,251 --> 01:06:02,921
Sorry-wise. Apologize.
Sorry-wise. Apologize.

1088
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:07,050
? Sorry-wise apologize
Sorry-wise apologize ?

1089
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,635
? Sorry-wise
and apologize-wise ?

1090
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:10,929
? Apologize-wise
and sorry-wise ?

1091
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,223
? Apologize-wise
and sorry-wise wise ?

1092
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:17,519
? Situation-wise saturation-wise
competition-wise ?

1093
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:19,771
? Sales-resistance-wise
television-wise ?

1094
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:22,649
? Meathead-wise fatso-wise
and wise and wise ?

1095
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,485
? Pa-dam-pa-dam-pa-dam ?

1096
01:06:24,694 --> 01:06:28,447
? Situation-wise saturation-wise
saturation-wise situation-wise ?

1097
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:32,284
? Drink-wise pill-wise ?

1098
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:36,330
? Audio-wise and video-wise and
video-wise and audio-wise ?

1099
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,917
? Audio-video-wise and
video-audio-wise ?

1100
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:45,172
? I dream of Jeannie
with her light brown hair ?

1101
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:47,299
? Situation-wise ?

1102
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:49,426
? Saturation-wise ?

1103
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:53,138
? Situation-wise and
saturation-wise and si.. ?

1104
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:59,144
? Be my love for no one else
can end this yearning ?

1105
01:06:59,354 --> 01:07:03,273
? For you I'll make
the sweetest music ?

1106
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:14,117
? Time for the party-wise ?

1107
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:19,456
? Do-do-do-do-huh ?

1108
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,041
? Doo-doo-hoo-hah ?

1109
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:23,418
? Woo-hoo-ooh-ooh ??

1110
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,403
Sound retreat!

1111
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:51,405
Damsel in distress!

1112
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:54,700
Charge! Follow me
over the moat!

1113
01:07:58,955 --> 01:08:02,457
Dinner-wise. I'm with you
Jerry-Lewis-wise

1114
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:12,676
Stand back. My old trick!

1115
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:15,804
Nothing up my sleeves.
No mustache, deceive.

1116
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:34,364
- Max.
- Think he'll win?

1117
01:08:34,574 --> 01:08:36,366
- Sure.
- Ted

1118
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:38,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

1119
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:39,911
Well, if it isn't Ted Riley.

1120
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:41,663
Well, if it isn't
Charlie Culloran.

1121
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:43,957
What a nice surprise.
What're you doing here, Charlie?

1122
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,043
Just came over
to say hello to you.

1123
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:49,087
- And to wish the kid good luck.
- That's swell of you, Charlie.

1124
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:50,756
- Kid looks great.
- Thanks.

1125
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:53,550
When I lost him to you,
I thought he was nothing.

1126
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,094
- You've done wonders with him.
- Thanks again, Charlie.

1127
01:08:56,304 --> 01:08:58,388
I'll see you around.
Few things I wanna talk.

1128
01:08:58,598 --> 01:09:00,432
- Sure thing, Charlie.
- You should come by house.

1129
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:03,518
I'll have my wife cook us a nice
chicken dumpling dinner.

1130
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:05,687
And, uh, bring the young lady.

1131
01:09:05,897 --> 01:09:07,898
- Sure thing, Charlie.
- Good luck.

1132
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:10,233
Thanks.

1133
01:09:10,443 --> 01:09:12,486
Who is that?

1134
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:15,405
That's little miss fix-it
and his crowd of debutantes.

1135
01:09:15,615 --> 01:09:16,782
Oh.

1136
01:09:16,991 --> 01:09:18,033
Hiya, Kid.

1137
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,035
Hey, where were you?
You're late, Ted.

1138
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,953
- Oh, I get it.
- Good luck, tonight.

1139
01:09:22,163 --> 01:09:23,455
- Thanks.
- Okay, George.

1140
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:25,624
You're finished here,
wait outside. Thanks.

1141
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,210
- You get a good rest?
- Sure, I feel swell.

1142
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:30,253
I'm glad, because I got
everything I own

1143
01:09:30,463 --> 01:09:31,922
riding on you
tonight, kid, but..

1144
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:34,466
...I know I'm a cinch
to clean up on you.

1145
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:37,052
- Yeah.
- You seem a little nervous.

1146
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:38,720
Who, me? Uh-uh.

1147
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,514
You got nothing
to be nervous about.

1148
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:42,099
Well, it's a big night.

1149
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:44,351
Yeah, it was a
big day today, too.

1150
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,978
Remember that date I had to
keep at twelve o'clock?

1151
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:48,939
- Yeah?
- Well, that wasn't with a girl.

1152
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:50,982
Turned out to be a date
with myself.

1153
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:52,401
Huh?

1154
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:55,195
First time I met up with
myself in about ten years.

1155
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:56,822
You sound nuts.

1156
01:09:57,031 --> 01:10:00,659
Well, I'm glad I got you, kid.
You're my one accomplishment.

1157
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:01,993
Yeah, you're right.

1158
01:10:02,203 --> 01:10:04,830
The boys are real proud of you.

1159
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,332
Huh? What did you say?

1160
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:11,044
Well, I said the boys
are real proud of you.

1161
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:12,629
The boys.

1162
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:19,845
Remember what I told you
about keeping your hands down?

1163
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:21,763
Come here.

1164
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:23,598
See, you got them
down like this.

1165
01:10:23,808 --> 01:10:25,058
You're all relaxed.

1166
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,776
'Come on, Kid!
They're waiting for you.'

1167
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:38,196
Okay, go ahead,
he'll be right up.

1168
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:40,198
Come on, let's get
out of here.

1169
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:43,493
You go on, Georgie,
I'll bring him right up.

1170
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:44,870
Come on.

1171
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,042
Taxi.

1172
01:10:51,252 --> 01:10:53,462
530 east, 48th street.

1173
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:58,341
Ted, you idiot, what did you do?
Those men are gonna kill you.

1174
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:00,886
Between the two of us,
we can handle anybody.

1175
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:02,888
But Ted, aren't you
in terrible danger?

1176
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:06,057
Yeah, I'm in terrible danger.

1177
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:10,187
I'm in danger of believing
that look on your face.

1178
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:12,314
You know, ten years ago

1179
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:15,400
I told myself, I'd never
let this happen again.

1180
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,277
And then..

1181
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:22,491
Oh!

1182
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,368
That's nothing, darling,
it's only the car.

1183
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:27,871
No, it isn't, remember?

1184
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,749
It's my own invention..

1185
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,751
...exploding in my face.

1186
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,674
- How's he coming, Swenson?
- Fine, Mr. Fielding.

1187
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:41,760
I'll have him shipshape
in half an hour.

1188
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,554
Good, we have to leave
for the telecast at 10:30.

1189
01:11:44,764 --> 01:11:47,349
I'll give him deep massage,
and he'll be good as new.

1190
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,142
Mmm.

1191
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:50,936
Somebody stole my moustache.

1192
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,522
Fielding, I want that moustache
returned, every hair in place.

1193
01:12:06,536 --> 01:12:08,954
Oh, Miss Leighton,
what on earth are you upto?

1194
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:10,038
Hm?

1195
01:12:10,248 --> 01:12:11,957
You've been living
here two years.

1196
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,125
You know our simple,
steadfast rules.

1197
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,545
- No men beyond this line.
- Oh.

1198
01:12:16,754 --> 01:12:18,588
Couldn't you make
an exception in my case?

1199
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,507
- I'm a traveling salesman.
- I'm sorry.

1200
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,093
And, Miss Leighton what're you
doing here at this hour?

1201
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:25,136
You're usually at your
broadcast by this time.

1202
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:26,555
Oh, the broadcast!

1203
01:12:26,764 --> 01:12:29,641
Ted, will you please wait here?
I'll be down in ten minutes.

1204
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:31,935
And, something about the program
I've gotta tell you.

1205
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:33,979
- I'll tell you on the way.
- About what?

1206
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:35,772
Oh, it's ridiculous.
I'm sick of it.

1207
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:37,774
I'll explain it on the way over.

1208
01:12:37,984 --> 01:12:40,402
- I'll hurry.
- I'll be here.

1209
01:12:51,372 --> 01:12:53,623
- Have you a side entrance here?
- Yes, there.

1210
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:56,293
Look, tell Miss Leighton,
I'll meet her at the broadcast.

1211
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,169
Thank you, good-bye.

1212
01:15:24,984 --> 01:15:29,112
? Why am I feeling so good ?

1213
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:33,324
? Why am I feeling so strong ?

1214
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:37,328
? Why am I feeling
when things could look black ?

1215
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:42,667
? That nothing could
possibly go wrong ?

1216
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:49,174
? This has been
a most unusual day ?

1217
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,385
? Love has made me
see things ?

1218
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:57,807
? In a different way ?

1219
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:04,189
? Can it be ?

1220
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:07,442
? I like myself ?

1221
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:09,652
? She likes me ?

1222
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:14,574
? So I like myself ?

1223
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:19,204
? If someone wonderful
as she is ?

1224
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:22,373
? Can think I'm wonderful ?

1225
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:26,544
? I must be quite a guy ?

1226
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:29,380
? Feeling so ?

1227
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:33,051
? Unlike myself ?

1228
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,804
? Always used to ?

1229
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:39,849
? Dislike myself ?

1230
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:41,392
? But now my love ?

1231
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:45,730
? Has got me riding high ?

1232
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,942
? She likes me so ?

1233
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:52,278
? So do I ?

1234
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,302
? She likes me so ?

1235
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,555
? So do I ??

1236
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:31,437
Ladies and gentlemen.

1237
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:34,941
In just 3 minutes, Midnight
With Madeline will start.

1238
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,069
Now, don't forget, we have
a battery of television cameras

1239
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:40,029
cleverly concealed.

1240
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,365
So, be careful what you
say to your neighbor.

1241
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:43,658
Or how affectionate you are

1242
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:45,410
with your partner
of the evening.

1243
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:46,869
Because remember

1244
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:50,206
you may be on TV.

1245
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:00,425
What am I doing here?

1246
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:03,803
If you stand over here at the
bar, you can see everything.

1247
01:20:04,013 --> 01:20:06,931
'If you look up to the
right of the monitor'

1248
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,141
'You'll see the word applaud..'

1249
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,101
Right this way, Mr. Valentine.

1250
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:12,895
'Each time you see
the applause sign go on..'

1251
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:16,107
- Yes, sir, what is it?
- I want to see Miss Leighton.

1252
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:18,901
- I'm sorry, but--
- Oh, Mr. Riley, I'm Trasker.

1253
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,195
The show's just going on,
please, step over here.

1254
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,948
- She'll see you right after it.
- Oh, thank you.

1255
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:27,994
Yes, yes, yes, it's 11:00
and the makers of Klenzrite

1256
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,788
Doze-rite, Is-rite,
and Was-rite.

1257
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,958
Also manufacturers of H2O Cola

1258
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:36,753
that effervescent cola,
that's pure as water

1259
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:38,796
as nonfattening as water.

1260
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,965
But oh, boy, that cola taste

1261
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:43,134
that zooms you up to the skies

1262
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:44,177
presents

1263
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:47,972
Midnight With Madeline, starring

1264
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:49,265
Me.

1265
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:50,975
May I come in?

1266
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:56,939
? Remember ?

1267
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,943
? That Klenzrite is
the only washing soap ?

1268
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:03,154
? For you ?

1269
01:21:03,364 --> 01:21:05,907
? Remember ?

1270
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:07,909
? That Klenzrite is the soap ?

1271
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:11,079
? That washes things so new ?

1272
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:15,458
? Please remember ?

1273
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:21,547
? The many things
that only Klenzrite can do ?

1274
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,967
? Remember ?

1275
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:29,055
? To call your grocer
to send you ?

1276
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,015
? Klenzrite ??

1277
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:42,693
And now you dear
ladies and gentlemen

1278
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:44,862
guess what I'm going to do.

1279
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:48,241
I'm going to
sing you a song.

1280
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,869
It's my latest recording,
and I do hope you just love it.

1281
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,580
But even if you don't,
I don't really mind

1282
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:58,501
as...long as you love me.

1283
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:14,767
? I'm watching and waiting ?

1284
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:18,187
Hello, Sam.

1336

Now, ladies and gentlemen,
our weekly featurette

1337
01:25:42,559 --> 01:25:44,560
The Throb Of Manhattan.

1338
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,608
Dear ladies and gentlemen.

1339
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:53,653
We come to the part of the
program which is my favorite.

1340
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:55,613
Because it means something.

1341
01:25:55,822 --> 01:26:01,285
Because it means this big cold
canyon we call New York

1342
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:03,245
really has a heart.

1343
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:05,164
Somewhere in this room

1344
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:08,292
is the surprise guest
or guests for this evening.

1345
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:10,294
Could it be you?

1346
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:24,975
Yes, boys, you're on television!

1347
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:29,897
? Oh the time has come
for parting ?

1348
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:31,691
? And the marching music ends ?

1349
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,651
? No matter where
our lives may lead us ?

1350
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,611
? In our hearts
we'll still be friends ?

1351
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:38,489
? For friends we are now
And friends we'll stay ?

1352
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,783
? Until we meet again
one wonderful day ?

1353
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:44,328
? Let a million miles divide us
Let the years go rolling by ?

1354
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:46,664
? Although the time
has come for parting ?

1355
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:48,666
? We'll be friends
until we die ??

1356
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:50,876
Ladies and gentlemen.

1357
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:53,963
Ten years ago,
these three G.I. Joes

1358
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:55,673
returning from the war

1359
01:26:55,882 --> 01:26:58,551
made a solemn pledge
to meet again today.

1360
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,679
They had their glorious
reunion at noon

1361
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:06,183
proving true friendship
never dies.

1362
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,728
Yes, friends, this is Ted Riley

1363
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:11,689
Angelo Valentine,
and Douglas Hallerton.

1364
01:27:11,898 --> 01:27:14,775
Boys, this reception
is also being given to you

1365
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,861
by millions of people
sitting in their homes

1366
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:20,865
all over the country
and I know that just like me

1367
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:24,034
they are all feeling
a wee bit misty.

1368
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:25,703
Bless you.

1369
01:27:25,912 --> 01:27:28,497
Oh, look, little Angelo
is blushing.

1370
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,042
Bless him, isn't this wonderful?

1371
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:34,879
Isn't this
a great surprise?

1372
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:37,047
Oh, it certainly is
for me though I..

1373
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:39,175
...think I was about
to be tipped off.

1374
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:44,972
So, this is why you spent
every minute of the day with me.

1375
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:47,099
I should have smelled a rat.

1376
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:51,187
Hey, Connie, if you're
watching, nothing happened.

1377
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:54,231
Connie, ladies and gentlemen
is little Angie's wife

1378
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:57,735
who is watching the show
from Schenectady.

1379
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:02,490
And this is
Douglas Hallerton, everyone

1380
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:04,241
who knew nothing about it

1381
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:07,661
even though he is one of our
own executive vice presidents

1382
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,830
from Chicago.

1383
01:28:12,626 --> 01:28:13,793
Now, really, Doug.

1384
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,420
Isn't this
a great moment for you

1385
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,548
being the surprise guest
on one of your own shows?

1386
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:22,426
Madeline, sincerely,
I deserve every bit of it.

1387
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:26,680
It's truly a fitting climax
to 10 years of self-degradation.

1388
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:28,516
And if anyone
interested is watching

1389
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:31,894
I know what she meant,
change-wise, that is.

1390
01:28:32,103 --> 01:28:35,272
Uh, yes, yours is a true
success story, Doug.

1391
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:38,359
But not all of us can reach
the top, ladies and gentlemen.

1392
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:41,403
Some of us sometimes
need a helping hand.

1393
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:44,114
Take Mr. Valentine,
for instance.

1394
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:47,618
Now, Mr. Valentine
is a sweet, simple person

1395
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:49,912
one of the vast army
of little gray men

1396
01:28:50,121 --> 01:28:51,914
who struggle along
from day to day

1397
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:53,833
gallantly making ends meet.

1398
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,211
Angie, we are going to
give you, absolutely free

1399
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,173
a Klenzrite washing machine,
plus a five year supply

1400
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:03,676
of Fishmayers non-scuffle shoes

1401
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:06,387
for your poor,
dear little kiddies.

1402
01:29:06,596 --> 01:29:08,097
Bless you.

1403
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,099
Here's your Klenzrite guarantee

1404
01:29:10,308 --> 01:29:13,143
and Mr. Fishmayers
personal certificate.

1405
01:29:13,353 --> 01:29:15,312
Thanks a lot.

1406
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:16,897
But no, thanks.

1407
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:18,899
I'm not looking
for any handouts.

1408
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:22,194
And I'm not one of any
vast army of little gray men.

1409
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:25,531
I'm doing alright and I can
take care of my own family.

1410
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,866
Thank you.

1411
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:29,326
Isn't that wonderful,
ladies and gentlemen?

1412
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,078
And you, Mr. Riley.

1413
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:34,707
I understand that you're engaged
in the world of sports.

1414
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:36,667
Tell us about
yourself, won't you?

1415
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:38,711
Oh, there's nothing
to tell. I'm a bum.

1416
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,087
- Hm?
- A bum.

1417
01:29:40,297 --> 01:29:42,047
You know,
a small-time operator.

1418
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:44,925
I'm mixed up with some of
the shadiest characters in town.

1419
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,052
As a matter of fact,
knowing the inspiring

1420
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,263
uplifting work you do
on this program

1421
01:29:49,472 --> 01:29:51,932
I-I feel terrible
about showing my face

1422
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:54,059
in decent homes
all over the country.

1423
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:57,980
Boys, don't be like me,
live clean, use Klenzrite.

1424
01:29:58,189 --> 01:30:00,399
Uh, why, thank you.

1425
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:02,568
And now tell us about
your glorious reunion.

1426
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:04,612
The three of you
walked into Tim's bar--

1427
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,197
Madeline, I'd like
to help you out and give you

1428
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:10,117
all the phony sentiment
and corn you want but..

1429
01:30:10,327 --> 01:30:13,537
...I'm afraid, I'll
have to disappoint you.

1430
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:17,082
When the three of us met today
in Tim's bar for the big moment

1431
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,084
it was horrible.

1432
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:21,086
The years had..

1433
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:23,881
...the years had
made us strangers.

1434
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:27,051
We hated one another.

1435
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,553
I know now why I hated them.

1436
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,639
It's because I hated myself.

1437
01:30:31,848 --> 01:30:34,475
But I'm glad it happened.

1438
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:36,477
Because I'd like
the guys to know

1439
01:30:36,686 --> 01:30:39,146
that whatever they think of me,
I-I don't blame them.

1440
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:41,190
And I'd give
several arms and legs

1441
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:45,653
to win their friendship
and respect again.

1442
01:30:45,862 --> 01:30:49,323
I'll try and spend the next
ten years winning it back.

1443
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:51,992
Good night, Madeline,
it's been swell.

1444
01:30:57,415 --> 01:31:01,919
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Klenzrite Cakewalkers.

1445
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:17,643
Hello, Riley.

1446
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:19,687
Charlie Culloran.

1447
01:31:19,896 --> 01:31:22,481
- Hi, Rocky.
- Dirty crook.

1448
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:24,775
Oh, I'm sorry you
feel that way, Rocky.

1449
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:29,029
We hate to interrupt your
evening of nightclubbing.

1450
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:31,115
Nightclubbing?
Why, this..

1451
01:31:31,324 --> 01:31:32,533
Oh, yeah?

1452
01:31:32,742 --> 01:31:35,369
Yeah, but we'd like to have
you come along with us.

1453
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:37,496
To your house for
that chicken dumpling dinner?

1454
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:39,790
Ted, I'm afraid you
won't be able to enjoy

1455
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,126
a chicken dumpling dinner
for three or four years.

1456
01:31:42,335 --> 01:31:44,086
Cover Ted Riley
with number 3 camera.

1457
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:46,213
Get that mic closer
and keep it there.

1458
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,677
Maybe after five or six months

1459
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:54,430
you can take a little
clear broth.

1460
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:01,687
- Oh, really?
- I'm afraid so.

1461
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:04,356
Well, why this
attitude, Charlie?

1462
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:07,192
Well, of course you know, Ted,
there was no fight tonight.

1463
01:32:07,402 --> 01:32:09,194
When the kid
regained consciousness

1464
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,238
he told us how
you'd knocked him out.

1465
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,240
When Charlie Culloran
fixes a fix

1466
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:15,159
he wants it to stay fixed.

1467
01:32:15,368 --> 01:32:16,994
What was that, Charlie?

1468
01:32:17,203 --> 01:32:20,205
'I said when I fix them,
I want them to stay fixed.'

1469
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:22,207
Oh, fixed? Oh, thank you
very much.

1470
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:25,419
Yes, I can understand pride
in one's work, Charlie.

1471
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:27,212
'I kind of felt
that tonight, too.'

1472
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:30,299
I was a little annoyed at the
kid for wanting to throw

1473
01:32:30,508 --> 01:32:32,593
the fight after all the
hard work we'd done.

1474
01:32:32,802 --> 01:32:35,679
So, I thought the best thing to
do was to incapacitate him

1475
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,514
and prevent the fight
from going on.

1476
01:32:37,724 --> 01:32:40,559
Of course, if it was just
me being upset, I'd forget it

1477
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,728
but there are several
other gentlemen involved

1478
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:45,022
and, they'd like to have
a chat with you.

1479
01:32:45,231 --> 01:32:46,607
Oh, who could they be?

1480
01:32:46,816 --> 01:32:48,734
Barney Gaber, Larry Treadman,
Zeb O'Flair--

1481
01:32:48,943 --> 01:32:51,695
Barney, Larry, Zeb,
they're all in on the, uh, fix?

1482
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:54,615
Yes, and I think it'd be
rude to keep them waiting.

1483
01:32:54,824 --> 01:32:58,494
I have a couple of boys
here to escort us out.

1484
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:01,622
Say, Charlie, have you
ever been on TV?

1485
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:03,624
- What?
- Have you ever been on TV?

1486
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:05,918
You know, Charlie, you got
a beautiful full face

1487
01:33:06,127 --> 01:33:08,712
but let's see your profile, you
know, it's is very important

1488
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:12,049
'for love scenes and so forth,
that's very very nice.'

1489
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:14,718
Rocky, don't you think
Charlie would be good on TV?

1490
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:17,262
I'll tell you the truth,
I never thought about it.

1491
01:33:17,472 --> 01:33:19,389
But on the screen,
there's an actor there

1492
01:33:19,599 --> 01:33:21,058
who ain't no prettier
than Charlie.

1493
01:33:21,267 --> 01:33:24,394
If I dinn't want to be deemed
crazy, I'd say it was Charlie.

1494
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:27,481
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, Charlie, you're on TV.

1495
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:29,483
You've just given a nice,
clear statement

1496
01:33:29,692 --> 01:33:31,693
before about 60 million people.

1497
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:35,239
Why, you..

1498
01:33:39,577 --> 01:33:41,912
- Ted, you alright?
- Angie.

1499
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,247
Cover me!

1500
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:45,124
- Ready on the right.
- On the left.

1501
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,416
Ready on the firing line.

1502
01:33:46,626 --> 01:33:47,918
- Charge!
- Charge!

1503
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,882
Bombs away!

1504
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:12,776
Hit the dirt!

1505
01:34:15,613 --> 01:34:17,489
Ringolevio.

1506
01:34:22,495 --> 01:34:23,996
- Yay!
- Yay!

1507
01:34:54,152 --> 01:34:55,903
Fire one!

1508
01:35:15,298 --> 01:35:17,090
I'm coming, Angie!

1509
01:35:27,435 --> 01:35:29,353
Ha! Whoo! Ha!

1510
01:35:29,562 --> 01:35:31,563
Look out..

1511
01:35:45,203 --> 01:35:48,080
- Ha ha.
- Ringolevio.

1512
01:35:49,832 --> 01:35:51,041
Hey, look.

1513
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,091
Let's get out of here before
they ask a lot of questions.

1514
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:08,141
'Ladies and gentlemen, your
Madeline has done it again.'

1515
01:36:08,351 --> 01:36:11,270
'You've witnessed not only the
reunion of the three ex G.I's'

1516
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:13,355
'but also our additional
surprise guest'

1517
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:17,234
'Charles Z. Culloran,
notorious racketeer and gambler'

1518
01:36:17,443 --> 01:36:20,279
'making a spontaneous
and unrehearsed confession'

1519
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:22,364
'which will doubtless
send him up the river'

1520
01:36:22,573 --> 01:36:25,117
'for 50 or 60 years!'

1521
01:36:25,326 --> 01:36:28,078
'All this on our weekly
human-interest featurette'

1522
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:30,998
'The Throb Of Manhattan.'

1523
01:36:36,879 --> 01:36:40,257
? A March a March a March
April May June ?

1524
01:36:40,466 --> 01:36:43,760
? June a June a June July
and August September ?

1525
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,262
? Sept, Sept.. ??

1526
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:48,390
Well, well, what happened
to the rover boys?

1527
01:36:48,599 --> 01:36:50,392
We've been on television.

1528
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:53,937
- Come on, Tim, set 'em up.
- Got to hand it to you guys.

1529
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:56,273
Ten years and the same old pals.

1530
01:36:56,482 --> 01:36:58,233
Nothing changed.

1531
01:37:01,654 --> 01:37:04,281
- Tim, we love you.
- You got a sharp eye.

1532
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:06,491
Hello, Dorothy?
It's me, Doug.

1533
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:08,618
Yeah, I just wanted to tell--

1534
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:12,456
What? Oh, you saw the program?

1535
01:37:12,665 --> 01:37:14,958
Oh, you do?

1536
01:37:15,168 --> 01:37:17,794
Yeah, well, so do I.

1537
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:20,839
Listen, darling, I don't know
how you stood me up till now.

1538
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:23,216
Yes, I am.

1539
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:25,510
But now I've got
a chance to show you..

1540
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,679
Li-listen, Dot.

1541
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:29,806
I know we can make it.

1542
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:32,017
Yeah, I..

1543
01:37:32,226 --> 01:37:33,518
Well, I..

1544
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:36,021
...I can't say
any more right now.

1545
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,814
Just..

1546
01:37:38,024 --> 01:37:40,484
I love you.

1547
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:41,902
Bye.

1548
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:53,038
- To Dorothy.
- Dorothy.

1549
01:37:56,334 --> 01:37:58,835
- One for Connie and the kids.
- And the Cordon Bleu.

1550
01:37:59,045 --> 01:38:01,713
No. No more Cordon Bleu.

1551
01:38:01,923 --> 01:38:03,757
From now on,
it's just gonna be plain

1552
01:38:03,966 --> 01:38:07,427
Angie and Connie's
Roadside Diner.

1553
01:38:07,637 --> 01:38:08,845
Well.

1554
01:38:09,055 --> 01:38:11,348
Hey, I remember old bootsie.

1555
01:38:11,557 --> 01:38:13,892
The kid from the south, always
tripping all over himself?

1556
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:15,227
His name was George
something..

1557
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:16,436
- Bootsie.
- Brown?

1558
01:38:16,646 --> 01:38:17,771
No, no, George Barry.

1559
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,022
- Barry!
- Barry, that's it!

1560
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:21,066
We were always toasting him.
Was good luck..

1561
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:22,526
- Why?
- I don't know.

1562
01:38:22,735 --> 01:38:25,070
I remember, when we landed
at Anzio on the beachhead?

1563
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:29,199
He fell down and we followed
thinking it was orders

1564
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:32,577
Yeah, the machine guns opened
up, but we were down flat.

1565
01:38:32,787 --> 01:38:37,165
That's right, that idiot
saved our lives.

1566
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:38,625
Gee.

1567
01:38:38,835 --> 01:38:39,960
Old bootsie.

1568
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:41,378
- Bootsie.
- Bootsie.

1569
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:46,675
Hey, you remember
Corporal Zimmerman?

1570
01:38:48,678 --> 01:38:50,762
Alright, alright!
One more, and that's all.

1571
01:38:50,972 --> 01:38:52,722
I got a license here, remember?

1572
01:38:52,932 --> 01:38:55,559
Closing time, it's late
we all got homes to go to.

1573
01:38:55,768 --> 01:38:58,228
Pay up and let's go,
that'll be four bucks even.

1574
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:00,230
- I got it.
- I got it.

1575
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,898
Hey, hey!

1576
01:39:02,108 --> 01:39:04,192
Wait a minute.
The safe!

1577
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:05,902
- The safe.
- The safe.

1578
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,487
There it is.

1579
01:39:11,742 --> 01:39:12,909
- Four even.
- Wow..

1580
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,453
Four bucks.

1581
01:39:14,662 --> 01:39:17,205
Well, Tim, that about
wraps it up.

1582
01:39:17,415 --> 01:39:19,416
'Not quite.'

1583
01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:23,253
There's a little
unfinished business.

1584
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:34,931
I think everything's going
to be alright with you, too.

1585
01:39:35,141 --> 01:39:38,018
- What do you think, Angie?
- Vote for Riley.

1586
01:39:38,227 --> 01:39:43,857
? Though the time
has come for parting ?

1587
01:39:44,066 --> 01:39:48,528
? And the marching music ends ?

1588
01:39:48,738 --> 01:39:51,281
? No matter where our lives ?

1589
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:53,992
? May lead us ?

1590
01:39:54,202 --> 01:39:59,706
? In our hearts
we'll still be friends ?

1591
01:39:59,916 --> 01:40:05,337
? Though the time
has come for parting ?

1592
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:10,800
? And the future lies unknown ?

1593
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,677
? Although the years ?

1594
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:17,641
? May come between us ?

1595
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,310
? We will never ?

1596
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,648
? Feel alone ?

1597
01:40:24,857 --> 01:40:27,651
? For friends ?

1598
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:30,111
? We are now ?

1599
01:40:30,321 --> 01:40:35,659
? And friends we'll stay ?

1600
01:40:35,868 --> 01:40:38,662
? Until ?

1601
01:40:38,871 --> 01:40:41,998
? We meet again ?

1602
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:48,171
? One wonderful day ?

1603
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:50,840
? Let a million miles ?

1604
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:53,343
? Divide us ?

1605
01:40:53,553 --> 01:40:55,220
? Let the years ?

1606
01:40:55,429 --> 01:40:59,015
? Go rolling by ?

1607
01:40:59,225 --> 01:41:01,017
? Although the time ?

1608
01:41:01,227 --> 01:41:06,356
? Has come for parting ?

1609
01:41:06,566 --> 01:41:09,359
? We'll be friends ?

1610
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:13,405
? Until ?

1611
01:41:13,614 --> 01:41:15,407
? We ?

1612
01:41:15,616 --> 01:41:18,827
? Die ??
