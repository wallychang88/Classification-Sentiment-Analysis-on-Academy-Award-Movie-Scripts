1
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,452
<i>God, she's beautiful.
She's got the prettiest eyes.</i>

2
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,039
<i>She looks so sexy in that sweater.</i>

3
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,501
<i>I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her,</i>

4
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,713
<i>and tell her how much I love her,
and take care of her.</i>

5
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,758
<i>Stop it, you idiot.
She's your wife's sister.</i>

6
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,470
<i>But I can't help it. I'm consumed by her.</i>

7
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>It's been months now. I dream about her.</i>

8
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,559
<i>I think about her at the office.</i>

9
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,436
<i>Oh, Lee...</i>

10
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,230
<i>...what am I gonna do?</i>

11
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,235
<i>I hear myself mooning over you
and it's disgusting.</i>

12
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway</i>

13
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,575
<i>and I smelled that perfume
on the back of her neck,</i>

14
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,287
<i>Jesus, I thought I was gonna swoon.</i>

15
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,082
<i>Easy. You're a dignified
financial adviser.</i>

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,668
<i>It doesn't look good for you to swoon.</i>

17
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,923
Elliot, have you tried these?
These are wonderful.

18
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,259
Holly and her friend made them.

19
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,721
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

20
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,599
I know. She has all the cooking charm.

21
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,643
- No, you've got talent.
- I've eaten five.

22
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,146
Holly, why don't you open
your own restaurant?

23
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,606
We practically are.

24
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,777
Not a restaurant, but April
and I are gonna do some catering.

25
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,322
- You're kidding!
- No, we decided.

26
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,948
Perfect.

27
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,117
We like to cook for our friends.

28
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,954
Until an acting job comes
we could do parties.

29
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,458
- Great. That's where your talent lies.
- I know.

30
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,628
Can I speak to you privately?

31
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,172
I'm her husband. She tells me anything.

32
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,508
I have to borrow more money.
Don't get upset.

33
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,679
- I never get upset.
- This is the last time, I promise.

34
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,641
- Don't insult me.
- I'll pay it all back.

35
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,478
- I know. How much do you need?
- Two thousand dollars.

36
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,774
April and I have this catering idea.
It'll be great.

37
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,651
You admit we're great cooks.

38
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,905
There's things I have to buy
and some old debts.

39
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,824
Are we talking about cocaine again?

40
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,870
I swear. We've already got
requests to do a few parties.

41
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,040
Obviously, I'm not gonna
be a caterer forever.

42
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,669
We still audition.
Something could come up.

43
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:18,840
My days are free for my acting class.
I haven't done drugs in a year.

44
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:23,303
<i>♪ A whimpering, simpering child again ♪</i>

45
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:28,392
<i>♪ Bewitched, bothered and bewildered... ♪</i>

46
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,145
Mom and Dad are floating down
memory lane again.

47
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,899
Have you tried the shrimp?
You've outdone yourself.

48
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,696
I need an antihistamine for Mom's
asthma. She's turning into "Camille."

49
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,907
- She's always Camille.
- At least she isn't drinking.

50
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,578
- Doesn't she look great?
- She knows it too. She's flirting.

51
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,333
Maybe when she's 80, she'll stop
straightening her garter belt.

52
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,546
- Where's the antihistamine?
- Ask Elliot. He's got them.

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,550
- Frederick didn't come with her.
- Does he ever?

54
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,178
He's such an angry... such a depressive.

55
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,640
I thought she was moving out.

56
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,226
<i>♪ A pill he is ♪</i>

57
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,563
<i>♪ But still he is ♪</i>

58
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,065
<i>♪ All mine and I'll keep him ♪</i>

59
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,778
<i>♪ Until he is bewitched... ♪</i>

60
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:26,158
- Watch out, you guys.
- The kids are so adorable.

61
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,243
It gets so lonely on holidays.

62
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,747
Oh, gosh. That's why
I invited Phil Gamisch.

63
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,042
- Hannah, he's such a loser!
- He's not a loser.

64
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,754
- He's a headmaster.
- He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.

65
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,548
His Adam's apple jumps when he's excited.

66
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,967
He's better than your ex-husband.

67
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,970
- He's not a dope addict.
- Give me a break.

68
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,765
Am I interrupting any sister talk?

69
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,226
There are no interesting single men here.

70
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,853
It's terrible!

71
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,440
Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil, tall guy.

72
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,735
I met Phil. He looks like Ichabod Crane?

73
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,323
- I love that. That's my type.
- I don't believe it.

74
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,367
We mustn't get discouraged.

75
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,913
Hannah will invite some men over
who don't look like Ichabod.

76
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,665
Maybe at Christmas or New Year's.

77
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,252
If not this New Year's,
maybe next New Year's. Ouch!

78
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,171
Must be here someplace.

79
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,216
I love that book, <i>The Easter Parade.</i>

80
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,135
You were right. It had meaning for me.

81
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,098
- How's Frederick? He didn't come.
- One of his moods.

82
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,643
Although it wasn't a bad week.
He sold a picture.

83
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,146
One of his better drawings,
a beautiful nude study.

84
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,608
It was of me.
It's a funny feeling to know

85
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,486
you're hung naked in a stranger's home.

86
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,448
But you can't tell it's me...
You're turning all red.

87
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,659
Really?

88
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,497
- What else? What are you up to?
- My unemployment's running out.

89
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,625
I thought of taking
some courses at Columbia.

90
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,961
- Like...?
- I don't know exactly.

91
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,549
Sociology, psychology.
I might like to work with children.

92
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,927
I always have clients
who are furnishing places.

93
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,348
Some might be interested
in buying art. Shall I call you?

94
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,768
Frederick would be grateful for a sale.

95
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,478
Guys? Dinner's ready.

96
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,981
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?

97
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,943
I bumped into your ex-husband.
He's crazy as ever.

98
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,820
He was getting a blood test.

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,866
Mickey's such a hypochondriac.
Could he handle real illness?

100
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,492
Let's go have dinner.

101
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,914
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Dad.

102
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,667
- Dad!
- No, now...

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,879
- We're starving.
- This is a toast.

104
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,714
This is a toast.

105
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,050
You know, this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner

106
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,512
was all prepared by Hannah.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,057
A little help from Mary,
also Holly and April.

108
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,768
No, you did it.

109
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,982
And we drink to her,
and we all congratulate her

110
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,028
on her wonderful accomplishment
during this last year,

111
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,198
her great success <i>in A Doll's House.</i>

112
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,910
- Hooray!
- Bravo!

113
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:19,873
I played Nora, I hate to tell you
what year, and it's difficult

114
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,584
to behave like Torvald's
"little chipmunk"

115
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,171
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

116
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,800
I think that Ibsen would've
been damn proud of our Hannah.

117
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,719
Speech!

118
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,514
No, I've been very, very lucky.

119
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,391
When I had the kids, I stopped working

120
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,229
and devoted myself to the family.

121
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,899
But I've always hoped
that some little gem

122
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,236
would tempt me back on the stage.

123
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,071
I got that out of my system

124
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,616
and I can go back
to what makes me happiest.

125
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,451
Bravo!

126
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,426
<i>Is it my imagination,
or does Elliot have a crush on me?</i>

127
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,846
<i>It's funny. I've had that thought before.</i>

128
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,474
<i>He pays a lot of attention to me.</i>

129
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,978
<i>And he blushed tonight
when we were alone.</i>

130
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,397
<i>I wonder if he and Hannah are happy.</i>

131
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,986
<i>It's funny. I still feel
a little buzz from his flirting.</i>

132
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,159
Want some coffee or tea?

133
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,411
No, thank you.

134
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,664
- How about something to eat?
- No, nothing.

135
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,458
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

136
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,044
What am I gonna do with you? God...

137
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:54,426
And why didn't you come?
We all had a terrific time.

138
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,972
I'm going through a period
where I can't be around people.

139
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,685
- I didn't want to abuse anyone.
- You wouldn't. They're so sweet.

140
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,896
You are the only person I can be with,

141
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,524
who I look forward to being with.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,028
You're too harsh with everyone,
you know that.

143
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,283
- Isn't it enough that I can love you?
- You're such a puzzle.

144
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,204
So sweet with me
and so contemptuous of everyone else.

145
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,708
There was a time when you
were happy to be only with me.

146
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,545
You wanted to learn
about poetry, about music.

147
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:35,008
Have I taught you everything
I can give? I don't think so.

148
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,724
Elliot might have
a couple of clients for you.

149
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,561
I'm sure those morons
have deep feelings for art.

150
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,565
You never know.
He's just trying to do the nice thing.

151
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,734
- Because he likes you.
- Me?

152
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,403
Yeah, Elliot lusts after you.

153
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,405
Based on what? You never see him.

154
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,658
Based on whenever you see him

155
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,245
you come home
with books he's recommended.

156
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,831
No, he's my sister's husband.

157
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,752
If you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him.

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,922
He's a glorified accountant,
and he's after you.

159
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,761
And I prefer to sell my work
to people who appreciate it.

160
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,098
You understand?

161
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,360
- They won't let us do the sketch?
- It's too dirty.

162
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,780
But we showed it to them in rehearsal.

163
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,865
Mickey, half-hour to air.

164
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,786
- The show's five minutes short.
- How can it be short?

165
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,957
- Now we'll be ten minutes short.
- They can't do that.

166
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,627
- Our ratings are low.
- I have such a migraine.

167
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,296
We better go to Ronnie's dressing room.

168
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,800
He must've taken quaaludes.
He can't do the show.

169
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,887
Why me, Lord? What did I...?
Standards and Practices?

170
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,142
- Why is the sketch dirty?
- Child molestation is touchy.

171
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,060
Half the country's doing it.

172
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,355
- But you name names.
- No, we say "the pope."

173
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,150
That sketch cannot go on the air.

174
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,111
Who changed my sketch about the PLO?

175
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,198
- I had to cut four lines.
- The premise is ruined.

176
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,034
You're crazy. It's not so delicate.

177
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,913
I don't want anyone tampering
without telling me.

178
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,416
You want them cut, I'll cut them myself.

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,171
Listen, instead of the molestation
sketch, why don't we repeat

180
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,048
the Cardinal Spellman/Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?

181
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,592
I don't feel good.

182
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,386
What did you do, swallow a drugstore?

183
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,846
I lost my voice.

184
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,058
Ronnie, you have to go on in 25 minutes.

185
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,187
Does anybody got a Tagamet? My ulcer.

186
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,314
You want a quaalude?

187
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,692
<i>This show's ruining my health.</i>

188
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,195
<i>My ex-partner moves to California.</i>

189
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,365
<i>Every stupid show he produces
turns into a big hit.</i>

190
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,202
<i>What am I gonna do with my life?</i>

191
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,456
<i>I gotta remember to see
my ex-wife tomorrow.</i>

192
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,588
Hi! Glad you could put in an appearance.

193
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,548
I got two minutes.

194
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,552
The show's killing me.
I got a million appointments.

195
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,223
- I gotta see...
- Two minutes on your sons' birthday.

196
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,558
Happy birthday, fellas.

197
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,353
Guys, look. Daddy brought presents.

198
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,480
A little hug? What is this?

199
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,233
How about some action? How is everything?

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,068
Everything's good.

201
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,530
Open the presents.
Let me get some reaction.

202
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,281
- How's Elliot?
- He's fine.

203
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,743
I'm trying to convince him
to produce a play.

204
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,328
That'll be terrific.

205
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,082
I like him, he's a sweet guy.
Isn't that a great mitt?

206
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,002
Because he's a loser.
He's awkward and clumsy like me.

207
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,005
I always like an under-confident person.

208
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,423
He wanted a mitt.

209
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:07,512
- You've had good taste in husbands.
- Thanks. That's a beauty.

210
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,430
Go over there. Come on, hurry.

211
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,642
Go out by the Sung vase and catch this.

212
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,060
Watch the picture!

213
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:19,607
<i>Hannah's sweet.
Although sometimes I still do get angry.</i>

214
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,235
<i>At least I'm not paying child support.</i>

215
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,281
<i>I hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me.</i>

216
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,449
What's the problem this time?

217
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,036
This time I really think
I have something.

218
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not like that adenoidal thing,
where I'd had them out.

219
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:41,337
I saw your father.
He complained of chest pains.

220
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,799
This guy's the real
hypochondriac of the family.

221
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,512
- You mentioned you'd had dizziness.
- Yes, and I'm developing

222
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,223
a hearing loss in my right ear. Left ear.

223
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,935
Sorry, my right...
Right or left. I can't remember.

224
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,270
Let's take a look.

225
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:23,046
You have had a significant drop
in the high decibel range.

226
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,505
Really?

227
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,926
You been exposed
to a loud noise or a virus?

228
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,513
I've been perfectly healthy.
I always imagine I have things.

229
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,891
When did you first notice this?

230
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,602
About a month ago. What do I have?

231
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,148
You've had dizzy spells.
What about ringing and buzzing?

232
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes, now that you mention it,
I have buzzing and also ringing.

233
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,699
- Ringing and buzzing. Am I going deaf?
- It's just one ear.

234
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,453
Is it healthier
to have problems in both ears?

235
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,125
Make an appointment
at the hospital to run some tests.

236
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,378
The hospital? What kind of tests?

237
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,797
Don't get alarmed.

238
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,218
These are just more
sophisticated tests. It's nothing.

239
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,055
Then why go to the hospital? I hear fine.

240
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,308
So I'm weak in the high decibels.

241
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,062
Don't panic. I just wanna
rule out some things.

242
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,066
- Like what?
- It's nothing. Will you trust me?

243
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,236
Hello, Dr. Wilkes? This is Mickey Sachs.

244
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,530
I wanna ask you a question.

245
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,407
Sure. What's up?

246
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,159
If you have a hearing loss in one ear

247
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,621
and it's not from a virus
or a loud noise,

248
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,040
what are the possibilities?

249
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,043
Anything. Often it's hereditary.

250
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,046
Flu, even a small noise will do it.

251
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,923
Right, but nothing worse?

252
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,928
I guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumor.

253
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,640
Really?

254
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,060
- Here's the new pages.
- Did Cards get these?

255
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,521
- Not yet.
- Let's hope it's good.

256
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,900
Yeah, really.
We'll be down in a minute, OK?

257
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,820
Mickey, what's the matter with you?

258
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,948
I feel dizzy. I don't feel well.

259
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,784
Do you hear a ringing?
Is there a ringing?

260
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,204
- Yeah, I hear it. Hello?
- Not that.

261
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,959
Yeah, we're gonna be working late.
No, we'll order out.

262
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,129
If I have a tumor,
I don't know what I'll do.

263
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,673
He didn't say you had a tumor.

264
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,341
They don't tell you.

265
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,136
Sometimes the weaker ones will panic.

266
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,390
- But not you.
- Oh, God. You hear a buzzing?

267
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,893
Come on, we got a show to do.

268
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,313
- I can't focus.
- But there's nothing wrong.

269
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,775
Then why does he want more tests?

270
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,610
He has to rule out things.

271
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,613
- Like what?
- I don't know. Cancer.

272
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,325
Don't say that.
I don't wanna hear that word.

273
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,327
But you don't have symptoms.

274
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,371
I got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumor.

275
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,500
Two months ago
it was a malignant melanoma.

276
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,337
The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

277
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,841
- It was on your shirt.
- How was I to know?

278
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,219
We've got to make decisions.

279
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,806
I can't think.
This morning I was so happy.

280
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,935
- I don't know what went wrong.
- You were miserable.

281
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,814
We got bad reviews.
The sponsors are furious.

282
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,234
I was happy,
but I just didn't realize I was.

283
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,740
These are delicious! What are they?

284
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,993
Those are quail eggs. Aren't they good?

285
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,664
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

286
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,542
- That looks good.
- I make those.

287
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,754
Excuse me. Thank you.

288
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,716
- The stroganoff is ready.
- We're a hit!

289
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,052
In this. Yesterday, I auditioned.

290
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,265
- That wasn't a hit.
- You'll get five jobs next week.

291
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,060
- Are there any more clams?
- A few. You like them?

292
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,646
- I can't resist.
- How flattering.

293
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,401
- Did you try the shrimp?
- You're too attractive to be caterers.

294
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,903
- We're actresses.
- Your first job?

295
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,447
- Is the food that bad?
- Not at all.

296
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,201
We need more sauce for the lasagna. Hi.

297
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,996
You're an actress
with a flair for shrimp.

298
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,250
The shrimp puffs are Holly's.
I do the crepes caviar.

299
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,253
And the quail's responsible for the eggs.

300
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,256
I stole you a couple of extra clams.

301
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,759
- Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.
- April Knox, hi.

302
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,219
You're Holly.

303
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,055
We're the Stanislavski Catering Company.

304
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,602
I'll tell you the truth.
I was bored stiff by the party.

305
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,729
We're more interesting?

306
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,024
I'll listen to <i>Aida</i>,
if I'm not in your way.

307
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,400
Not at all.

308
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,988
We saw Pavarotti in <i>Ernani</i>
at the Met, and I cried.

309
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,281
I cry at the opera.

310
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,618
I go limp in the last scene
in <i>La Traviata</i>.

311
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,579
Me too. I have a private box at the Met.

312
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,917
I bring my bottle of wine,
I watch and I cry. Disgusting.

313
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,502
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.

314
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,463
What do you build?

315
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,965
- Are you really interested?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,426
What time do you get off?

317
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,556
- It's the red one?
- It's magnificent.

318
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:30,561
The design's noncontextual, but
I wanted to keep the street atmosphere

319
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,731
on the proportions and the material.

320
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,151
- That's unpolished red granite.
- Is it?

321
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,738
- It has an organic quality.
- Right.

322
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,450
Entirely interdependent,
if you know what I mean.

323
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:49,288
I can't put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

324
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,000
April, people pass by vital
structures all the time.

325
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,294
They never appreciate them.

326
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,838
You tune into your environment.

327
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,509
- It's important.
- What are your favorite buildings?

328
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,885
You wanna see some?

329
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,388
Well, let's do it.

330
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:53,894
It's just so romantic.
I wanna open the French doors...

331
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,148
- It's French.
- It is. It's romantic.

332
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,777
And it's got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it.

333
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,948
Your eye goes along,
lulled into complacency, and then...

334
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,534
- That's just...
- Look at this.

335
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,786
That's really terrible.

336
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,622
- And it ruins everything else.
- It does.

337
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,375
We've seen a lot of stuff today.

338
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,794
We should think about going home.

339
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,504
- Yeah.
- OK.

340
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,759
- Who gets dropped first?
- Gee, I don't know.

341
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:29,055
- I live downtown.
- We both live downtown.

342
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,767
It depends on what way you wanna go.

343
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:37,730
I know. If we took Fifth,
then we'd get to your house first.

344
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,483
- We could do that.
- But Fifth is jammed.

345
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,652
- I mean...
- Well, sometimes.

346
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,072
You live in Chelsea, don't you?

347
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,617
If you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

348
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,827
- OK.
- And then April.

349
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,079
Great.

350
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,463
<i>Naturally, I get taken home first.</i>

351
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,715
<i>Obviously, he prefers April.</i>

352
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,635
<i>Of course, I was so tongue-tied
all night.</i>

353
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,388
<i>I can't believe I said that
about the Guggenheim.</i>

354
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,683
<i>My stupid roller-skating joke.
I should never tell jokes.</i>

355
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,812
<i>Mom can tell them, and Hannah,
but I kill them.</i>

356
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:23,776
<i>Where did April come up
with terms like "organic form"?</i>

357
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,154
<i>Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis.</i>

358
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,491
<i>She doesn't know
what she's talking about.</i>

359
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,161
<i>Could you believe the way
she was calling him David?</i>

360
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:38,040
<i>"I feel that way too, David.
Marvelous space, David."</i>

361
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,793
<i>I hate April. She's pushy.</i>

362
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,339
<i>They'll dump me, and she'll
invite him up. I blew it.</i>

363
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,676
<i>And I really like him a lot.</i>

364
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,554
<i>Screw it. I'm not gonna get upset.</i>

365
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,558
<i>I've got reading to do.
I'll get into bed early</i>

366
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,601
<i>and take an extra Seconal.</i>

367
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,939
- My goodness.
- Elliot! What are you doing here?

368
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,609
- I'm looking for a bookstore.
- In this section?

369
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,946
I'm killing time.
I have a client near here.

370
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,449
- How about you?
- Well, I live...

371
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,451
- You live near here.
- I do.

372
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,913
- Where are you headed?
- To my AA meeting.

373
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,958
Why do you still go?
You never touch alcohol.

374
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,709
You didn't know me before Frederick.

375
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,630
I'd start with a beer
at ten in the morning.

376
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,801
- You must've been very unhappy.
- Unhappy and fat.

377
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,387
I still find the meetings comforting.

378
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,808
I'll never understand it.
You're so bright and beautiful.

379
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,562
I think to myself,
"What problems could she have?"

380
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,606
Don't let me get started on my childhood.

381
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,485
You know what?
There is a bookstore near here.

382
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,404
You'd really love it.

383
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,155
- Yes?
- You would.

384
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,366
- If you have some free time...
- Sure.

385
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,826
Thank you.

386
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,163
Isn't this great? They have everything.

387
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,833
- Wonderful.
- What book did you want?

388
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,918
- What?
- You wanted a book?

389
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,006
No, I'm killing time.
I just want to browse.

390
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,591
You picked the right place.

391
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,677
You can stay all afternoon and just read.

392
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,264
Unless you have time.
We could get some coffee.

393
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,392
- I don't have time.
- I understand.

394
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,353
No problem. You're busy. I...

395
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,690
You seem tense. Everything all right? No?

396
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,192
- Yes.
- Everything's OK?

397
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,403
Yeah. How are you?

398
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,363
I'm all right.

399
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,657
- How's Frederick?
- Fine.

400
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,410
We went to the Caravaggio exhibition.

401
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:06,373
It's such a treat to go with Frederick.
You learn so much.

402
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,044
- Do you like Caravaggio?
- Yes, who doesn't?

403
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,296
Look.

404
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,884
E.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.

405
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,844
I can't let you get me that.

406
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,014
- I'd like to very much.
- I don't think so.

407
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,100
I read a poem of you
and thought of his last week.

408
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,812
A poem of his and thought of you.

409
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,731
You'll be fine.

410
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,192
This is great. I love e.e. cummings.

411
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,444
I'd love to get you this.

412
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,239
And maybe we could discuss it sometime.

413
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,207
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks for showing me the bookstore.

414
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,585
You could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

415
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,380
- I'd love to see it.
- You'd love it.

416
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,758
It's really entertaining.
You'd have a good time.

417
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,261
And don't forget the poem on page 112.

418
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,098
- It reminded me of you.
- Really?

419
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,978
Page 112.

420
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,147
- Bye.
- Bye!

421
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,492
<i>"Your slightest look
Easily will unclose me</i>

422
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,286
<i>Though I have closed myself As fingers</i>

423
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,540
<i>You open always Petal by petal myself</i>

424
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,460
<i>As spring opens
Touching skillfully, mysteriously</i>

425
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,462
<i>Her first rose</i>

426
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,468
<i>I do not know what it is about you
That closes and opens</i>

427
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,179
<i>Only something in me understands</i>

428
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:49,309
<i>The voice of your eyes
Is deeper than all roses</i>

429
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,021
<i>Nobody, not even the rain</i>

430
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,566
<i>Has such small hands"</i>

431
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,082
I wasn't too happy with your ENG results,

432
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,876
or your BSER either.

433
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:01,215
That's why I sent you to tomography,
all that stuff rolling around.

434
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,217
See this gray area here?

435
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,971
That area's what I had
hoped we wouldn't run into.

436
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,059
I'd like you to come in Monday
for a CAT scan.

437
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,730
- A brain scan?
- Let's take one step at a time.

438
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,109
We won't make any decisions
until we have all the information.

439
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,574
<i>OK, take it easy.</i>

440
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,077
<i>He didn't say you had anything.</i>

441
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,997
<i>He just doesn't like
the spot on your X-ray.</i>

442
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,252
<i>Doesn't mean you have anything.
Don't jump to conclusions.</i>

443
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,420
<i>Nothing's gonna happen to you.</i>

444
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,298
<i>You're in New York City.
This is your town.</i>

445
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,593
<i>You're surrounded by traffic
and restaurants.</i>

446
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,098
<i>God! How can you just, one day, vanish?</i>

447
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,018
<i>Keep calm. You're gonna be OK.</i>

448
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,229
<i>Don't panic.</i>

449
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:02,943
<i>I'm dying! I know it!
There's a spot on my lungs!</i>

450
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:07,155
<i>Take it easy. It's not on
your lungs. It's on your ear.</i>

451
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,076
<i>It's the same thing, isn't it?
I can't sleep.</i>

452
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,830
<i>God, there's a tumor in my head
the size of a basketball.</i>

453
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,458
<i>I keep thinking I can feel
it every time I blink.</i>

454
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,962
<i>Jesus! He wants me to do a brain scan</i>

455
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,673
<i>to confirm what he already suspects.</i>

456
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,135
<i>I'll make a deal with God.
Let it just be my ear.</i>

457
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,762
<i>I'll go deaf and blind in one eye.</i>

458
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,639
<i>I don't want a brain operation.</i>

459
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,351
<i>I'll wind up like the guy
with the wool cap</i>

460
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,896
<i>who delivers for the florist.</i>

461
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,400
<i>Your whole life you run to doctors.
The news is always fine.</i>

462
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,612
<i>That's not true. What about years ago?</i>

463
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,365
I'm sorry to say
that you cannot have children.

464
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,288
- Gee.
- Is there no chance?

465
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,291
You can have a normal sex life,

466
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,669
but his tests indicate
that he is infertile.

467
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,547
Small sperm volume and infertile.

468
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,841
Anything I can do? Pushups?

469
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,802
- I'm afraid not.
- I need a second opinion.

470
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,555
- This is the second opinion.
- A third.

471
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,849
I realize this is a blow.

472
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,769
In my experience, many fine marriages

473
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,855
become unstable and are destroyed

474
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,858
by an inability to deal with this.

475
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,862
I hope you won't make too much of it.
One can adopt,

476
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,783
and there are artificial
methods of fertilization.

477
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,868
I'm so humiliated. I don't...

478
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,787
Did you ruin yourself?

479
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,041
- How could I ruin myself?
- Excessive masturbation?

480
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,837
You gonna knock my hobbies? Jesus.
Maybe we can adopt a child.

481
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,257
- What about artificial insemination?
- What?

482
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,135
- I'd get implanted from...
- A stranger?

483
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,263
They have banks
where they keep them frozen.

484
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,184
- A defrosted kid?
- I want to experience childbirth.

485
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,146
- With a stranger?
- Think about it. That's all I ask.

486
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,025
I think that's the best show
you two ever wrote.

487
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:11,446
The funniest show we did
was the one we won the Emmy for.

488
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,658
I think as far as laughs,

489
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,160
that was probably
the best thing we ever did.

490
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,707
But the show about the Frenchmen,
that was funny and warm.

491
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,126
We got that idea on that Paris trip.

492
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,005
Remember that?
Hannah had jet lag for six weeks.

493
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,758
But it was... I guess we had fun
when we were there.

494
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,052
Sorry. Coffee?

495
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,972
Listen, you guys, we... Want some more?

496
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,019
We had something we really
wanted to discuss with you.

497
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,771
Jesus, this is very delicate

498
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,774
and I only bring this up amongst friends.

499
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,652
I mean, this is...

500
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,613
This shouldn't go further than this room.

501
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,284
I'm all ears.

502
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,495
Hannah and I can't have any children.

503
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,791
I don't want to get into whose fault
it is... It's my fault.

504
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,919
And the details are
too embarrassing to...

505
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,964
We decided after a lot of discussion

506
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,092
that we'd try artificial insemination.

507
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,887
I'm not so sure I like that idea myself.

508
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,724
I didn't really want
to go to a sperm bank,

509
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,394
have some anonymous donor.
I wouldn't want that.

510
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,482
If we were gonna do it,
we'd like somebody we knew

511
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,276
and was warm and bright.

512
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:36,448
You can say no. We realize
it has all kinds of implications.

513
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,160
The point we're making
is that we need some sperm.

514
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,831
Gee.

515
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,419
Well, my first reaction
after the initial shock

516
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,838
is flattered that you'd ask.

517
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,093
I'd be the father.
You'd just masturbate into a cup.

518
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,302
I can handle that.

519
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,347
Obviously, we wouldn't have intercourse.

520
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,435
Gosh, I've gotta tell you the truth.
I'm uneasy about this.

521
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,978
It's a lot to ask.

522
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,941
I feel for you, I do. I'm gonna cry.

523
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,152
You want my husband
to have a child with you?

524
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,904
Don't answer now.

525
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,699
Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

526
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:25,163
I gave blood before,
and clothing to the poor.

527
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,083
I wanna talk about this at home.

528
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,795
I think it's a matter
for your analyst and mine.

529
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,588
And maybe my lawyer.

530
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,174
We understand completely

531
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,636
if you feel you'd rather not.

532
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,891
I didn't mean to spoil the evening.
Let's move on.

533
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,854
<i>So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins.</i>

534
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:53,567
<i>Maybe that caused trouble,
but we were drifting apart anyhow.</i>

535
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,862
<i>Instead of man and wife
we're good friends.</i>

536
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,532
<i>Boy, love is really unpredictable.</i>

537
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,713
Lee, Frederick, say hello to Dusty Fry.

538
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,298
- Hi, Dusty.
- Hi.

539
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,385
Dusty has bought a house
in Southampton. He's decorating it.

540
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,095
It's a weird place.

541
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,140
A lot of wall space. How you doing, man?

542
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,143
I told him about your work. He's excited.

543
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,313
I got an Andy Warhol and a Frank Stella.

544
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,650
It's very beautiful.
Big, weird, you know.

545
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:21,321
If you stare at that Stella,
the colors seem to float.

546
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,657
You decided to become a collector?

547
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,203
Yeah, I got a lot to learn, though.
I wasn't into art as a kid.

548
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,624
- Do you appreciate drawings?
- Yeah.

549
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,836
Oh, hey. Wow, she's beautiful.

550
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:42,050
But, really, I need something...
I'm looking for something big.

551
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,178
- Show him the oils.
- They're in the basement.

552
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,431
Frederick's done this
new series you'd love.

553
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,976
- Are they big?
- Some of them, yeah.

554
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,019
I got a lot of wall space.

555
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:58,525
- I don't sell my work by the yard.
- Oh, Frederick.

556
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,740
How's everything?

557
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,577
Oh, you know.
I talked to Hannah this morning.

558
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,372
You two might be going to the country.

559
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,624
She loves to go out in the woods.

560
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,251
But I go nuts.

561
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,378
It's a conflict.

562
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,009
- I have to get my teeth cleaned.
- That's nice.

563
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:30,515
- I figured I'd get them together.
- That's really nice.

564
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:35,061
This kid's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got six gold records.

565
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,733
Oh, I bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

566
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,902
The man showed me another one you'd love.

567
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,406
It's another Bach, Second Movement.

568
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,866
- You have that one?
- Yeah.

569
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,576
I would love to hear it.

570
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:54,331
Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

571
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,251
That's nice. I'd love to see her
wind up settled.

572
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,463
She's a tense one.

573
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,931
Isn't that beautiful?

574
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,725
I know this.

575
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,396
Bach F Minor Concerto.
It's one of my favorites.

576
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,279
Did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?

577
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,907
Yes, he's just adorable.

578
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,496
They have a large gay clientele
where I get my teeth cleaned.

579
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:38,291
All the hygienists now wear gloves.
They're afraid of AIDS.

580
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,502
Right.

581
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:47,092
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 112?

582
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,138
Yes, it made me cry.
It was so beautiful, so romantic.

583
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,559
<i>I want so badly to kiss her.</i>

584
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,313
<i>Not here. You've got to get
her alone someplace.</i>

585
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,984
<i>But I've got to proceed cautiously.
This is a delicate situation.</i>

586
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:10,323
<i>Ask her if you can see her
for lunch or a drink tomorrow.</i>

587
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,786
<i>Make light of the offer
if she's unresponsive.</i>

588
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,206
<i>This has to be done
skillfully and diplomatically.</i>

589
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,334
Did you ever read this one?

590
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,089
- Elliot, don't!
- Lee, I'm in love with you!

591
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,384
What are you doing?

592
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,929
I'm sorry, I have to talk to you.

593
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,724
I've been in love with you so long...

594
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,186
I don't have an interest in selling it.

595
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,565
I ask for some puce,
you fly off the handle!

596
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,985
I'm not interested in what
your decorator thinks.

597
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:51,489
I can't commit to anything
without consulting her first.

598
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:56,161
You don't buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa.

599
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,788
It's not a sofa. It's an ottoman!

600
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,542
God, forget it.
Let's just get out of here.

601
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,046
What a weirdo that guy is. Paranoid.

602
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,217
- What's the matter?
- I'll be OK.

603
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,304
- Not that big a deal.
- You go on ahead.

604
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,556
You're sweating.

605
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,142
I just need fresh air. Something I ate.

606
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,769
I'll walk, you go ahead. You go.

607
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,249
Hello. Hello?

608
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,211
Hello!

609
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,804
I was looking for you.

610
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,599
I must apologize. I'm so mixed-up.

611
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:04,229
- How do you expect me to react?
- But I'm in love with you.

612
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,607
- Don't say those words.
- I know it's terrible.

613
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,985
- You know the situation.
- I know. I realize.

614
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:15,156
- What do you expect?
- Hannah and I are in the last stages.

615
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,284
She's never said anything,
and we're very close.

616
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,288
She's crazy about me,
but somewhere along the line

617
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,957
I fell out of love.

618
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,292
- Not because of me?
- No.

619
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,585
Yes, I love you!

620
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,797
I can't be the cause
of anything between you...

621
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,632
It was inevitable.

622
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,842
- Why?
- For a million reasons.

623
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,094
But not over me?

624
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,138
We were both going
in different directions.

625
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,057
- Poor Hannah.
- How about you?

626
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:45,311
Do you share any of my feelings,
or is this unpleasant?

627
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,646
I can't say.

628
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,399
Be candid. I don't want you to feel bad.

629
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:54,028
Yes, I have certain feelings for you.
Don't make me say more.

630
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:58,491
OK, you've said enough.
I will work things out.

631
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,412
Don't do anything on my behalf.
Hannah and I are close.

632
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,998
But you do care about me?

633
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:10,211
I can't be a party to this.
I'm racked with guilt talking to you.

634
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,464
Your guilt is because you feel the same.

635
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,843
I have to go.
I have to get my teeth cleaned.

636
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,806
I have my answer. I have my answer.

637
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,183
I'm walking on air.

638
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,745
Hi. How's she doing?

639
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,081
She's in the kitchen.
It's the same thing.

640
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,209
She promises. It's all lies.

641
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:54,088
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

642
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:58,009
Let me get you some coffee.
What triggered it?

643
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:02,513
We were making a commercial.
There was this young salesman.

644
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:07,226
Your mother was throwing herself
at him in a disgusting way.

645
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:12,440
When she found she was too old
to seduce, that he was embarrassed...

646
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,067
Liar! Liar!

647
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,278
And at lunch she got drunker and drunker.

648
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,489
Finally, she became Joan Collins!

649
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,409
All my life I've put up with insults
from this nonperson.

650
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,205
This haircut that passes for a man.

651
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,332
He could never support us.

652
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,126
I'm glad we had a talented daughter.

653
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,879
I can only hope that she was mine.

654
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,841
With you as her mother, her father
could be anybody in Actors' Equity!

655
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,594
She's talented.
It's unlikely she's yours.

656
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,306
Dad, could you please stay
in the other room?

657
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:50,520
You never know when
she's gonna fall off the wagon.

658
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,272
Here, Mom. Drink this.

659
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,567
You're awful. You probably were flirting.

660
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,154
No, I like to joke around and have fun.

661
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,032
He gets angry because
I get the attention.

662
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,121
He's gotten sour, and I've tried
to stay young at heart.

663
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,456
You promised to stay on the wagon.

664
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,875
The sacrifices I've made.

665
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,421
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering...

666
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,550
- ...his mediocrity.
- OK, stop being so dramatic.

667
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,303
He's the one that's laid
every ingénue in stock!

668
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,308
They wanted me for a screen test,
but he'd get up there

669
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,353
and he'd flounder around
with his expensive haircuts,

670
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,148
hairdos and clothes.

671
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,316
He's all show!

672
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:41,821
How could you act when there's
nothing inside to come out?

673
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,712
<i>She was so beautiful
at one time, and he was so dashing.</i>

674
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,217
<i>Both of them just full of promise
and hopes that never materialized.</i>

675
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:08,681
<i>And the fights and the infidelities
to prove themselves</i>

676
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,435
<i>and blaming each other... it's so sad.</i>

677
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:17,398
<i>They loved the idea of having us.
Raising us didn't interest them.</i>

678
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,817
<i>But it's impossible
to hold it against them.</i>

679
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,737
<i>They didn't know anything else.</i>

680
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,199
Of all of us in the family,

681
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,285
you're the one blessed
with the true gift.

682
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,705
My true gift is luck.
I've had a lot of luck.

683
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:37,418
From my first show. I thought Lee
was destined for great things.

684
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:41,214
She's lovely,
but she doesn't have your spark.

685
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:46,093
She knows it. She worships you.
She wouldn't dare get up on stage.

686
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,513
Now, Holly's not shy.

687
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,765
Holly's game for anything.

688
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,850
- Holly takes after me.
- True.

689
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,228
I'd have been a great dope addict.

690
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,731
Remember this, Hannah?

691
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,776
Mr. Sachs, I'm afraid
the news is not good.

692
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,781
If I can show you where the tumor is

693
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,744
and why we feel that surgery
would be of no use.

694
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,706
- See...
<i>- It's over.</i>

695
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,418
<i>I'm face to face with eternity.</i>

696
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,504
<i>Not later, but now.</i>

697
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:50,718
<i>I'm so frightened,
I can't move or speak or breathe.</i>

698
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,515
You're just fine.
There's nothing here at all.

699
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,601
And your tests are all fine.

700
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:04,231
I admit, I was concerned,
given your symptoms.

701
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,526
What caused this hearing loss,
we'll never know.

702
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,905
But whatever it was,
it's not anything serious.

703
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,531
I'm very relieved.

704
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:34,553
What do you mean, you're quitting?
Why? The news is good.

705
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,515
You don't have cance... the thing.

706
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,893
Do you realize what a thread
we're hanging by?

707
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,604
Mickey, you're off the hook. Celebrate!

708
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,692
Can you understand
how meaningless everything is?

709
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,778
Our lives, the show, the whole world.

710
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,655
But you're not dying.

711
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:57,243
I'm not now. When I ran
out of the hospital, I was so thrilled

712
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,828
'cause they told me
I was gonna be all right.

713
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,664
I'm running down the street
and then it hit me.

714
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,876
So I'm not gonna go today, not tomorrow.

715
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,546
But eventually I'm going to.

716
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,715
You're realizing this now?

717
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,134
I know it all the time,

718
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,302
but I stick it in the back of my mind.

719
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:20,641
It's a horrible thing to think about.
Can I tell you something?

720
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,894
- Yes, please.
- A week ago I bought a rifle.

721
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,815
If I had a tumor,
I was gonna kill myself.

722
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,026
The thing that might've stopped me is

723
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,445
my parents would be devastated.

724
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:37,283
I would've had to shoot them also.
And my aunt and uncle.

725
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,746
Well, eventually, it is going
to happen to all of us.

726
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,707
But doesn't that ruin everything for you?

727
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,959
It takes the pleasure away.

728
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,213
You'll die, I'll die,
the audience, the network...

729
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,549
- I know, and your hamster.
- Yes.

730
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,011
Listen, kid,
I think you snapped your cap.

731
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,764
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda.

732
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,640
Or go to a whorehouse.

733
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,809
I can't stay on. I need answers.

734
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,938
Otherwise, I'm gonna
do something drastic.

735
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,377
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I almost didn't.

736
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,091
- I didn't sleep all night.
- No, I'm sure.

737
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,053
What are we doing in a hotel room?
It's terrible.

738
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,181
I couldn't think where to invite you.

739
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,185
I didn't want this to happen
till you were living alone.

740
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,145
I was so torn when you called.

741
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,525
I wanted to call every day
since I told you how I felt.

742
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,194
I resisted so many times.

743
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,824
Don't think badly of me.

744
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,662
This is not an easy situation.

745
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,664
I know it isn't.

746
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,767
That was just perfect.

747
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,436
You've ruined me for anyone else.

748
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,273
I don't want anyone else to have you.

749
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,485
I worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.

750
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,070
Oh, my God!

751
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,741
- You really do have those thoughts?
- All the time.

752
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,369
She must be a passionate person.

753
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,872
Yes, she's very warm and giving.

754
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,624
But I want to be giving to you.

755
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,335
I wanna do things for you.

756
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,880
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

757
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,467
I'm being presumptuous.
Not that you need me.

758
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,429
I want you to take care of me.

759
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,349
And I love when you do things to me.

760
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,963
You're late.

761
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,508
I didn't realize how late it had gotten.

762
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,639
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz.

763
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,557
More gruesome film clips.

764
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,645
And more puzzled intellectuals
declaring their mystification

765
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,648
over the systematic murder of millions.

766
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,234
They can never answer the question,

767
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,946
"How could it possibly happen?"
is that it's the wrong question.

768
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:06,158
The question is,
"Why doesn't it happen more often?"

769
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,244
Of course, it does, in subtler forms.

770
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,704
I have a headache from this weather.

771
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,003
It's been ages since I sat
in front of the TV,

772
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,923
changing channels to find something.

773
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,342
You see the whole culture.

774
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,635
Nazis...

775
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,679
...deodorant salesmen...

776
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,180
...wrestlers...

777
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,683
...beauty contests, the talk show.

778
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,645
Can you imagine the mind
that watches wrestling?

779
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,065
But the worst are
the fundamentalist preachers.

780
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,858
Third-rate con men

781
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,570
telling the suckers
that they speak for Jesus

782
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,241
and to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

783
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,620
If Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name,

784
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,205
he'd never stop throwing up.

785
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,041
Frederick, could you please lighten up?

786
00:54:56,209 --> 00:55:00,671
I'm not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society.

787
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,590
You've been nervous lately.

788
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,551
I can't take this anymore.

789
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,679
I'm only completing
an education I started.

790
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,223
I'm not your pupil. I was.

791
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:15,060
When you leave the nest,
I want you to be ready.

792
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,063
- We have to make some changes.
- Like what?

793
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:22,067
- You know. I'm suffocating.
- This conversation again?

794
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:26,989
Yes, this conversation again.
I have to leave, I have to move out.

795
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,616
- Why?
- Because I have to.

796
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,702
What'll you use for money?

797
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,372
I thought maybe I'd move
in with my parents.

798
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,250
I always told you you would leave me.

799
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,419
Does it have to be now?

800
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,714
Maybe it'll be temporary.
But I have to try.

801
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,760
Lee, you're my whole world.

802
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,432
Good God. Have you been kissed tonight?

803
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,560
- No...
- Yes, you have.

804
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,396
- You've been with someone!
- Stop accusing me!

805
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,940
I'm too smart. You can't fool me!

806
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,776
- You're turning red!
- Leave me alone!

807
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,820
Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?

808
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,783
I'm sorry.

809
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,660
Couldn't you say something?
You slither...

810
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,829
I'm saying it now!

811
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,873
So you met somebody else?

812
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,628
Yeah. You knew that was going
to happen sooner or later.

813
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,672
- I can't live like this.
- Who is it?

814
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,343
- It's just somebody I met.
- Where did you meet him?

815
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,262
It doesn't matter. I have to move out.

816
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,890
You're my connection to the world.

817
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,977
That's too much responsibility
for me. It's not fair.

818
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,146
I want a less complicated life.

819
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,024
I want a child, before it's too late.

820
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,360
Jesus. Jesus!

821
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,279
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.

822
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,452
What do you get out of me,
anyway? I mean...

823
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,623
It's not sexual anymore.

824
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:04,503
It's certainly not intellectual.
You're so superior to me.

825
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,672
Don't patronize me!

826
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:13,178
God! I should have married you...
years ago when you wanted to.

827
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,430
I should've agreed.

828
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,683
Don't you know? It never would've worked.

829
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:23,272
I told you one day you'd leave
me for a younger man.

830
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,743
<i>What passion today with Lee.</i>

831
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,121
<i>She's a volcano.</i>

832
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,542
<i>It was totally fulfilling,
just as I'd dreamed it'd be.</i>

833
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,918
<i>That's what it was.</i>

834
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:49,298
<i>It was like living out a dream,
a great dream.</i>

835
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,093
<i>Now I feel very good and cozy
next to Hannah.</i>

836
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,804
<i>Hannah is very real and lovely.</i>

837
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:00,350
<i>She gives me a very deep feeling
of being part of something.</i>

838
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,563
<i>She's a wonderful woman,
and I betrayed her.</i>

839
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,274
<i>She changed my empty life,</i>

840
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,236
<i>and I paid her back
by banging her sister.</i>

841
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:15,240
<i>God, I'm despicable!
What a cruel and shallow act.</i>

842
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,076
<i>I have call her now and tell her
what we did was crazy.</i>

843
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:22,331
<i>It can't ever happen again.
I value Hannah too much.</i>

844
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:26,418
<i>I love my wife. Now I betrayed her.
Oh, God!</i>

845
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,920
Where are you going?

846
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:32,424
I've gotta get a phone number.
I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

847
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,552
- It's late.
- Yes, I can't believe I forgot.

848
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,763
What if he answers?

849
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,264
I'll hang up.

850
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,768
I'll say we can't communicate
until I'm divorced.

851
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,521
It's immoral. Then time will pass.

852
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,106
I won't call, and she'll understand.

853
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,318
I've gotta stop before I get in too deep.

854
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,530
I'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

855
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,365
It's1:30.

856
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,369
She can't have a conversation
with me, with him around.

857
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,329
I'm getting hysterical.

858
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,957
I'll call her in the morning.

859
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,708
I'll call her at 6:00.

860
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,294
Frederick goes jogging at 6:00.

861
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,923
She'll be alone. I'll call
and nip it in the bud.

862
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,259
I've got it! I've got it!

863
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,052
Hello.

864
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,304
Mel!

865
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,849
I'd have hung up if you hadn't answered,

866
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,018
but I had to tell you...

867
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:29,147
...I feel very close to you tonight.
Very, very close.

868
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,983
Good night.

869
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,625
<i>Millions of books written
on every conceivable subject</i>

870
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,460
<i>by all these great minds,</i>

871
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,463
<i>but none of them knows anything more</i>

872
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,592
<i>about the big questions
of life than I do.</i>

873
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,635
<i>I read Socrates.</i>

874
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,847
<i>He used to knock off little Greek boys.</i>

875
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,516
<i>What the hell's he got to teach me?</i>

876
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,478
<i>And Nietzsche, with his theory
of eternal recurrence.</i>

877
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,357
<i>He said the life we live,
we'll live over and over,</i>

878
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,735
<i>the same way for eternity.</i>

879
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:18,697
<i>Great. I'll have to sit
through the Ice Capades again.</i>

880
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,532
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

881
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,160
<i>And Freud, another great pessimist.</i>

882
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,705
<i>I was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.</i>

883
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,207
<i>My poor analyst got so frustrated,</i>

884
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,210
<i>the guy finally put in a salad bar.</i>

885
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,212
<i>Look at these people jogging,</i>

886
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,216
<i>trying to stave off
the inevitable decay of the body.</i>

887
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,886
<i>It's so sad what people go through</i>

888
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,222
<i>with their stationary bike
and their exercise.</i>

889
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,434
<i>Oh, look at this one. Poor thing.</i>

890
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,103
<i>She has to tote all that fat around.</i>

891
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,065
<i>She should pull it on a dolly.</i>

892
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,943
<i>Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the answer.</i>

893
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,447
<i>I was in love with Hannah.
That didn't work out.</i>

894
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,949
<i>I even took her sister out. Remember?</i>

895
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,952
<i>Years ago when Hannah and I got divorced</i>

896
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,747

You didn't have to talk
while he was singing.

- You don't deserve Cole Porter.

- And you snort so much cocaine!

944
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:14,182
- Do you carry a kilo around?
- This crowd was too embalmed to know.

945
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,562
I'm glad Hannah got us together.
She's got great instincts.

946
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,273
I'm sorry. It's probably my fault.

947
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,899
I've been depressed.

948
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:26,278
I had fun. It was like
the Nuremberg Trials.

949
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,947
I'll see myself home!

950
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,243

951
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,996

953
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,587
<i>She was polymorphously
insensitive, I think.</i>

954
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,964
<i>Too bad too.</i>

955
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,301
<i>I always had a little crush on her.</i>

956
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:27,005
Read the instructions.
You set one of these and you can

957
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,840
take pictures underwater.

958
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,509
We'll try it in the lake.

959
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,638
- Can I try?
- Yeah. OK.

960
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,523
Are you in a bad mood?

961
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,360
I don't know. I'm just antsy.

962
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,655
The last few weeks,
you haven't been yourself.

963
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:55,033
And tonight at dinner,
you were curt with me.

964
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,202
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

965
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,205
When I brought up the idea
of having a baby,

966
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,915
you jumped down my throat.

967
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,126
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Why not?

968
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,879
It's the last thing we need right now.

969
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,966
Why? Is there something wrong?

970
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,010
- I don't know.
- Should I be worried?

971
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,304
Well, you got four children.

972
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,139
I want one with you.

973
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:22,394
I think we should wait
till things settle.

974
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,688
What does that mean?

975
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,358
We've been married four years.
How settled can it get?

976
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,445
You have set plans on how
your life should be structured:

977
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:36,282
a house, kids, certain schools,
a home in Connecticut.

978
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,743
It's all very preconceived.

979
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,247
Yeah, but I... I thought you needed that.

980
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,833
You said your life was chaos.

981
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,253
But there's got to be some give and take.

982
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,881
I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about.

983
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,968
- Are you angry with me?
- No.

984
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,763
Do you feel...? Are you disenchanted
with our marriage?

985
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,015
I didn't say that.

986
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,766
Is there someone else?

987
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,186
What is this? The Gestapo? No.

988
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,188
What are you not telling me?

989
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,523
What kind of...?

990
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,317
Supposing I said I am disenchanted.

991
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,195
- I am in love with someone else.
- Are you?

992
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,613
No.

993
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:20,702
You keep asking these questions.
It's like you want me to say yes.

994
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,622
What are you saying?
Of course not. I'd be destroyed.

995
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,709
<i>For chrissake, stop torturing her.</i>

996
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,628
<i>Say you want out and get it over with.</i>

997
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,297
<i>You love her sister.</i>

998
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,632
<i>You didn't do it on purpose.</i>

999
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,761
<i>Be honest. It's always the best way.</i>

1000
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,472
How can I help you?

1001
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,350
If you're suffering over something,
share it with me.

1002
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,938
You know how much I love you.

1003
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,736
I should have my head examined.
I don't deserve you.

1004
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,706
I wanna look good,
but I don't want to be overdressed.

1005
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:11,669
- How about this?
- I think it's a pretty color on you.

1006
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:15,131
Ever think you'd see me
going to the opera?

1007
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,467
It's great. I want to meet him.

1008
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,971
He's married. And
his wife's schizophrenic.

1009
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,974
Sometimes she just breaks down.

1010
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:28,228
When his daughter
goes to college next year,

1011
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,230
he'll split permanently.

1012
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:33,900
His wife helped put him
through architecture school.

1013
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,361
You found all this out on one date?

1014
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,864
I think he was dying
to open up. It's so sad.

1015
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:43,034
Now what should I wear to my audition?

1016
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,954
I've got an audition
for a Broadway musical.

1017
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,288
I'll never get it.

1018
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,250
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

1019
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,045
I mean, why not? What have I got to lose?

1020
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,547
No, I just...

1021
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,842
No, I didn't know you sang.

1022
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,470
You think everybody
in musicals sings well?

1023
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,723
No, it's just that they sing.

1024
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,892
Well, you know.

1025
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,729
I sing a little. I mean, you know.

1026
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,399
I know. No, I know.

1027
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,651
Don't say it that way.

1028
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,405
- Confidence isn't my strong point.
- I didn't mean that.

1029
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:24,367
I think I can fake my way
through a song. Easily.

1030
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,331
- Why? You don't think it's realistic?
- No, I didn't... No.

1031
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,919
No, I just hate to see you
put yourself in a position

1032
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,421
where you get hurt.

1033
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,840
You take every single rejection

1034
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,594
as confirmation that you have no talent.

1035
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,305
- Well, maybe I'll get it.
- I hope.

1036
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,931
Boy...

1037
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,601
- ...you know how to cut me down.
- What?

1038
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,769
Can't I say anything?

1039
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:55,315
I sing. For chrissake, you heard me sing!

1040
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,900
OK, I...

1041
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,361
What happened? We were having a nice time

1042
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,698
and suddenly everything
went to bad feeling.

1043
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,451
Nobody but you can do that to me.

1044
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,746
Look, everything's going your way.

1045
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,248
You're right.

1046
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,000
I'm happy.

1047
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:18,004

spoil everything?

You sounded great. You may be surprised.

01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:45,717
I'm just glad we have
a catering job this week.

1067
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:49,804
We have Mr. Levine's 80th
birthday on Riverside Drive.

1068
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,974
Or the chapel, depending on his health.

1069
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,685
Listen. David called me up.

1070
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,896
- What?
- David called me last night.

1071
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,482
He wants to take me to the opera.

1072
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,276
I didn't know what to say.

1073
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,527
You're joking.

1074
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,904
No, he called late last night.

1075
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,992
I'm very surprised.

1076
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,786
He wants to take me <i>to see Rigoletto.</i>

1077
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,830
And you're going.

1078
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:19,459
I didn't know what to say.
At first I said no.

1079
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:24,088
He said he'd taken you once,
and he really wanted to invite me.

1080
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,801
- But I'm seeing him.
- I know. I said that...

1081
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:32,388
...but he said he really wanted to do it.

1082
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,935
I don't know what to say.

1083
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:42,523
It's just an evening at the opera.
Did I do wrong in accepting?

1084
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,817
Huh?

1085
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:53,993
Why would you like to convert
to Catholicism?

1086
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:58,748
I have to believe in something
or else life is just meaningless.

1087
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,250
But why did you make the decision

1088
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,711
to choose the Catholic faith?

1089
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:07,965
First of all, because it's
a very beautiful religion.

1090
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,385
It's strong and well-structured.

1091
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,179
I'm talking about the against
school prayer,

1092
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,889
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.

1093
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,225
So you don't believe in God?

1094
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,268
No, and I want to.

1095
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,438
I'll do anything. I'll dye Easter eggs.

1096
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:25,817
I need some evidence. I gotta have proof.

1097
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:29,028
If I can't believe,
life isn't worth living.

1098
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,030
It's a very big leap.

1099
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,366
Yes, well, can you help me?

1100
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,122
I don't understand.
I thought you'd be happy.

1101
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,832
How can we be happy?

1102
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:44,127
Because I'm giving God serious thought.

1103
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:49,674
- Catholicism? Why not your own people?
- I got off on the wrong foot there.

1104
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,551
I need a dramatic change.

1105
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:55,513
- You'll believe in Jesus Christ?
- I'm gonna try.

1106
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,142
- We raised you as a Jew.
- I was born that way...

1107
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:02,353
- I'm older now.
- But why Jesus Christ?

1108
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,605
Why not become a Buddhist?

1109
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,691
That's totally alien to me.

1110
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,152
Aren't you afraid of dying?

1111
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,653
Why be afraid?

1112
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,405
- You won't exist.
- So?

1113
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:17,034
- That doesn't terrify you?
- I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'm dead.

1114
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,870
Aren't you frightened?

1115
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:22,248
- I'll be unconscious.
- But never to exist again?

1116
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,293
- How do you know?
- It doesn't look promising.

1117
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,044
Who knows what'll be?

1118
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,797
I'll either be unconscious, or I won't.

1119
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,259
If not, I'll deal with it then.
I won't worry now.

1120
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,594
Mom, come out.

1121
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:39,015
Of course there's a God, you idiot.
You don't believe in God?

1122
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,143
Then why is there so much evil
in the world?

1123
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,021
On a simple level, why were there Nazis?

1124
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,397
Tell him, Max.

1125
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,232
How the hell do I know?

1126
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,943
I don't know how the can opener works.

1127
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:19,657
- Hi. Where's Holly?
- She's auditioning for a commercial.

1128
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:24,203
- How's she doing?
- You know Holly when she's depressed.

1129
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,747
It's good that we invited her to lunch.

1130
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,708
Tell her it was your idea.

1131
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,003
When I try to help, she gets defensive.

1132
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,256
She's just embarrassed in front of you.

1133
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,300
- So how are you?
- I'm OK.

1134
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,093
Do you miss Frederick?

1135
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,138
Elliot and I must know someone for you.

1136
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,058
How are you? How's Frederick...

1137
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,352
He's fine. I guess he's fine.

1138
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,441
He's been moody the last few months.
I don't know what it is.

1139
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,942
He's kind of distant.

1140
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,862
I try talking...
He says everything's fine.

1141
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,823
Automatically, I think the worst.

1142
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,493
- He's seeing someone else.
- No, everyone thinks that.

1143
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:09,415
I just came from an audition which
I did not get. So what's new?

1144
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:13,711
They said I was too offbeat-looking,
whatever that means.

1145
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,631
- But guess who's auditioning?
- April?

1146
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:21,385
I was very polite. I maintained
my poise. I said hello.

1147
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:24,680
I never trusted her.
Eyes in the back of her head.

1148
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:30,019
She and an architect are now
a definite item, which I can't believe.

1149
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,481
Though it's put an end
to the catering company.

1150
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:38,611
Which is why I have to speak to you.
I have to borrow more money.

1151
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:42,239
- That's fine.
- I decided to do some writing.

1152
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:44,075
I've had it with acting.

1153
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:48,579
These meaningless auditions.
I can't handle another rejection.

1154
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:53,250
Let's face it. I have to latch
on to something in my life,

1155
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:57,004
something with a future.
I'm not16 anymore.

1156
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,756
It's just crazy.

1157
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:03,803
But I've got an idea for a story,
more than one,

1158
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:07,598
and I just need a few months
or a year even.

1159
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:11,394
I learned about dramatic
structure from acting class.

1160
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:16,774
That's good. It just seems to me
that six months or a year,

1161
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,778
- if you spend it more productively...
- Like what?

1162
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,738
Well, I don't know.

1163
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:27,159
Didn't mom mention something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1164
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,914
- That's clerical.
- Didn't she say it's in publicity?

1165
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,292
- It can lead to other things.
- You're discouraging.

1166
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,628
No, I'm trying to be helpful.

1167
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,630
A person doesn't say,

1168
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,800
"I'm done as an actress.
Now I'm a writer."

1169
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,594
- Not at my age.
- Please. Let's have lunch.

1170
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:48,597
Right. Forget it.

1171
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:52,935
I just want a salad.
You really think I'm a loser.

1172
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,396
- You're being ridiculous.
- You are.

1173
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,815
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

1174
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:01,318
You have no faith.
You undercut my enthusiasm.

1175
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:02,486
Not so.

1176
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,071
I've been very supportive.

1177
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:09,076
I give you honest, constructive
advice. I help you financially.

1178
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,872
I introduce you
to interesting, single men.

1179
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,499
- All losers.
- You're too demanding.

1180
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:19,086
Who you fix me up with
says what you think of me.

1181
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,505
- That's not true.
- I'm mediocre.

1182
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:25,009
Stop attacking Hannah.
She's going through a lot.

1183
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,763
- Why are you so upset?
- You keep picking on her.

1184
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,182
Leave her alone. I'm suffocating.

1185
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,518
Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?

1186
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,854
Look, you wanna write, write.

1187
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,273
Let's just drop it.

1188
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,027
Take a year. Take six months,
whatever you want.

1189
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,822
Who knows? Maybe you'll be
sitting with a good play.

1190
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,785
What's the matter?
You look pale. Are you OK?

1191
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:55,247
Yeah. You know,
I just got dizzy all of a sudden.

1192
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:58,209
I think we need to eat.

1193
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,477
I can't seem to take action.

1194
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,897
I'm like Hamlet unable to kill his uncle.

1195
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,859
I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.

1196
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:28,614
And in no other area
am I a procrastinator.

1197
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,575
<i>Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.</i>

1198
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:35,287
<i>She's taking courses
at Columbia, but just randomly.</i>

1199
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:40,793
<i>I try not to call her, but then
she calls me, and then I call,</i>

1200
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,880
<i>and we try to resist meeting,
but sometimes we meet.</i>

1201
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:48,634
<i>Sometimes we argue because
I can't split my marriage.</i>

1202
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:53,681
<i>Sometimes we wind up making love,
and we both feel terrible.</i>

1203
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,933
But it's my fault.

1204
01:20:57,435 --> 01:21:01,772
For all my education, accomplishments,
and so-called wisdom,

1205
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,192
I can't fathom my own heart.

1206
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,157
You'd like to become a Hare Krishna?

1207
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,451
I'm not saying I wanna join,

1208
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:18,038
but you believe in reincarnation,
so I'm interested.

1209
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,665
What's your religion?

1210
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,794
I was born Jewish,
but last winter I tried Catholicism.

1211
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:29,008
It didn't work for me.
I studied and tried, but for me it was,

1212
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:30,718
"Die now, pay later."

1213
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,763
- I just couldn't get with it.
- You're afraid of dying?

1214
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,766
Yeah, naturally. In reincarnation,

1215
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:40,811
does my soul pass to another human?

1216
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,647
Or would I come back as an aardvark?

1217
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:47,985
Take our literature, read it over,
and think about it.

1218
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:51,822
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

1219
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:58,078
<i>Who are you kidding?
You're gonna be a Krishna?</i>

1220
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:02,166
<i>You're gonna shave your head
and dance around at airports?</i>

1221
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,376
<i>You'd look like Jerry Lewis.</i>

1222
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:07,212
<i>Oh, God, I'm so depressed.</i>

1223
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,017
<i>The nights are really getting cooler.</i>

1224
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,561
<i>Summer went so quickly.</i>

1225
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,897
<i>Soon it'll be fall.</i>

1226
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,026
<i>My literature professor really likes me.</i>

1227
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,862
<i>It was fun being out with him last night.</i>

1228
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:36,367
<i>I feel like I'm betraying
Elliot, but that's ridiculous.</i>

1229
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:40,079
<i>Why shouldn't I see Doug?
Elliot's not free.</i>

1230
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,832
<i>Just go one step at a time.</i>

1231
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,211
<i>Let's see what the next few months bring.</i>

1232
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,172
Hannah? Hi!

1233
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,010
You'll be happy to know that
your money hasn't gone to waste.

1234
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:59,473
I have an actual first rough draft
of something I wrote.

1235
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,058
Yeah.

1236
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,353
I showed it to Lee.
She gave me some pointers.

1237
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:08,607
I'm pretty near where you live.
Could I just drop it off?

1238
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:11,068
And when you have time, read it,

1239
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,487
and we'll talk over Thanksgiving.

1240
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,449
OK? All right. Wait. Listen!

1241
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:20,411
Lee met an interesting guy at Columbia.

1242
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,998
Yeah, yeah. Well, he sounds really nice.

1243
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,084
All right. We'll talk at Thanksgiving.

1244
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,585
Bye-bye.

1245
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,716
Here's a song that Norma sang

1246
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:36,927
on that trip we made
to the show in Buffalo.

1247
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,763
Oh, was she beautiful that night!

1248
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:40,931
Come on.

1249
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,892
You were. Don't you remember that night?

1250
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,729
She was so beautiful...

1251
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,231
...that when men saw her walking,

1252
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:52,568
they'd drive their cars
up on the sidewalk.

1253
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:54,486
That right, honey?

1254
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:58,032
A slight exaggeration, but only slight.

1255
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:28,645
- You've been very cold to me tonight.
- No!

1256
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,814
Is something wrong?

1257
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,443
Not here. There are too many
people around.

1258
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,072
Hey, Hannah?

1259
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,492
I think Lee's serious
about her new boyfriend.

1260
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,994
He sounds really nice.

1261
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,830
I'm happy for her. I think she's in love.

1262
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,415
What's wrong?

1263
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,001
I'm upset about what you wrote.

1264
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,211
My script?

1265
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,922
- It's based on Elliot and me.
- Loosely.

1266
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,842
Not loosely. Real specifically.
Is that how you see us?

1267
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:02,554
Can I not accept gestures
and feelings from people?

1268
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:04,348
Do I put people off?

1269
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,934
- It's a made-up story.
- No, it's exact.

1270
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,770
The situations, the dialogue, everything.

1271
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,606
It's full of details about Elliot and me,

1272
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:16,026
which I don't see how
you could know about.

1273
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,362
Our conversation about adoption?

1274
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,863
Lee mentioned that to me.

1275
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:24,618
Obviously, you told her.
I just blew it up into drama.

1276
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,413
How would Lee know?
We don't talk about everything.

1277
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,415
I guess I hit a nerve.

1278
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:35,129
You make it out like I have no needs.
Am I too self-sufficient?

1279
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,756
That's not what I meant.

1280
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,134
Everybody relies on you for so much.

1281
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,844
It's not a criticism.

1282
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:45,305
- We're grateful.
- Grateful, but you resent me.

1283
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,100
I don't wanna have this conversation.

1284
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:52,479
I didn't do anything wrong.
You said you were having problems.

1285
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,232
Problems that are my business,

1286
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,860
which I don't see how you know.

1287
01:25:58,027 --> 01:26:01,655
How does Lee know about these things?
They're private.

1288
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,032
Why don't you share them with us?

1289
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,370
- I don't want to bother everyone.
- I'd like to be bothered.

1290
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:12,249
I don't see how you could know
unless Elliot told you.

1291
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,126
No, he hasn't.

1292
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,670
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

1293
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:22,217
It's over, Elliot.
I can't be any clearer.

1294
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:25,053
- I deserve this...
- I'm at fault too.

1295
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,222
I have such feelings...

1296
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,892
To be honest, I've met someone else.

1297
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:34,605
- What do you mean?
- I said I wasn't gonna wait forever.

1298
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,565
It hasn't been forever.

1299
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,527
It's been a year and you're
still married to my sister.

1300
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:43,947
And I'm sure you're more
in love than you know.

1301
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:47,993
- But we made so many plans.
- In a way, you led me on.

1302
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,954
I believed you were unhappy with Hannah.

1303
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,707
I would never have
let myself be drawn in.

1304
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:57,419
I was weak. So were you.
Now I've met someone else.

1305
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,256
Dinner soon?

1306
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:05,052
- About15 minutes.
- Good.

1307
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,722
- You're in love overnight?
- I care a lot about him.

1308
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,642
It's over, Elliot. I mean it. It's over.

1309
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:19,399
Sweetheart, I loved your script.
It was so clever.

1310
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,444
You're my mother.
Not everybody's a sucker.

1311
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:25,572
I really liked the character
of the mother.

1312
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,617
A boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.

1313
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,828
- I'm so proud.
- Oh, Mom. Thanks.

1314
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,331
A toast to Thanksgiving!

1315
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:37,084
Are we supposed to have beer? Yeah!

1316
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,293
Let me hear it!

1317
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:40,254
How's that, Fletcher?

1318
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,548
Now to Thanksgiving.
Here's a little toast.

1319
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:44,716
Bottoms up!

1320
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:49,346
Have you been talking to Holly
or Lee about our personal life?

1321
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,098
Me? Of course not.

1322
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,350
There's things in Holly's script

1323
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:56,353
that could only have come from you.

1324
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,231
Look, I don't like being accused.

1325
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:03,735
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.
Do you find me too giving?

1326
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:05,570
Too competent?

1327
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:08,740
- Too disgustingly perfect or something?
- No.

1328
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:12,202
What's come between us?
How have I alienated you?

1329
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,914
- My head is throbbing.
- You never want to talk about it.

1330
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:19,668
When I bring it up,
you change the subject.

1331
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:22,838
We communicate less.
You sleep with me less.

1332
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:25,882
Hannah, I am very mixed-up! Please!

1333
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:29,594
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back?

1334
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,805
They seem to know so much.

1335
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,933
Maybe I've asked advice or made a joke.

1336
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:38,895
Do you talk to Holly? Lee?
Or what? Do you phone them?

1337
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:40,981
Leave me alone, can you?

1338
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:44,276
Jesus, I told you.
I need someone I can matter to.

1339
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,737
You matter to me. Completely.

1340
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:51,074
I can't be around someone who
gives so much yet needs so little.

1341
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:52,784
I have enormous needs.

1342
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:56,121
I can't see them,
neither can Lee or Holly.

1343
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,810
It's so pitch-black tonight.

1344
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,814
I feel lost.

1345
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:06,691
You're not lost.

1346
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,745
I love you so much.

1347
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:10,547
You may not remember,

1348
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,383
but we shared the worst night of my life.

1349
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,051
I remember you.

1350
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,554
You recall? I saw you in here.

1351
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,224
- I thought we could replay...
- We didn't hit it off.

1352
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:24,102
We did everything but exchange gunshots.

1353
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,314
- How are you?
- Good. You look wonderful.

1354
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,108
You do. It was a terrible evening.

1355
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,195
Remember slamming
the cab door in my face?

1356
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:38,283
You came very dangerously close
to emasculating my nose.

1357
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,286
That was a long time ago. People change.

1358
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,872
- I hope you've changed.
- You too.

1359
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,125
Your personality left something
to be desired,

1360
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,294
namely a personality.

1361
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:52,047
How are you? What are you doing?

1362
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:56,092
Nothing much.
A little of this, a little of that.

1363
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,888
Was that an embarrassing question?
You're out of work?

1364
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,682
- I've been trying to write.
- Have you?

1365
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,976
- Yeah.
- What kind of stuff?

1366
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:09,105
- You're not interested in this.
- You can tell me. I am.

1367
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,108
You must always hear,
"I wrote something."

1368
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,277
- Nobody ever said it.
- Really?

1369
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:17,739
Would you be willing
to read something I wrote?

1370
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:22,035
If it would mean anything to you.
I don't know why it would.

1371
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,956
- You've always hated my taste.
- No, I haven't.

1372
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:29,459
I think it might be
a great television script,

1373
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,795
and since you're so active...

1374
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,506
I haven't been in television for a year.

1375
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:36,299
You're kidding me.

1376
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:39,010
I may have to get back into it.

1377
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:41,638
I'm running out of dollars.

1378
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:45,809
But I dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

1379
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,478
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1380
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,938
- How are you?
- Fine.

1381
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,314
So, your script?

1382
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:54,693
If you'd read it, I'd value your opinion.

1383
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,655
But remember while you're reading
and cursing my name,

1384
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:01,825
it's my first script. Well, not really.

1385
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:04,869
My first was about
Hannah and her husband.

1386
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:07,914
But Hannah read it and got really angry.

1387
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,166
Can't imagine what you wrote.

1388
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:13,461
It wasn't anything bad.
She... I don't know.

1389
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:16,673
So I threw it out,
but I have this other one.

1390
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,093
If you want me to, I'll read it.

1391
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,179
Could I come over and read it to you?

1392
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:27,225
Come over and read it to me?
You must be joking.

1393
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:30,478
I've done my own reading since I was 40.

1394
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:33,690
I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.

1395
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,442
What about me?

1396
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,903
I have this sensation that I should have

1397
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:42,282
kept walking and not begun
this conversation.

1398
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:46,202
"We all play with the hand we're dealt."

1399
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,539
And what hand were you dealt?"

1400
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,250
I'm two high pair.

1401
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,336
Maybe even aces up.

1402
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:57,631
The problem is, you've got three deuces."

1403
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:00,383
That's the end.

1404
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,721
No, you can tell me straight. It's OK.

1405
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,057
Just tell me what you think.

1406
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,808
It's great.

1407
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,435
I... I'm...

1408
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:13,396
I'm speechless. I was...

1409
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:17,442
I was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1410
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:21,279
I don't know what to say.
I'm moved. I laughed.

1411
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:24,908
I was on the edge of my seat.
I think it's wonderful.

1412
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,576
I'm totally stunned.

1413
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,913
This is not an insult.
I'm amazed you can...

1414
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,207
I just thought it was great.

1415
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,417
- Really?
- Yes, I was...

1416
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:37,629
What made you think of that climax scene,

1417
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:41,675
where the architect is
with his actress girlfriend

1418
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:45,428
and the schizophrenic ex-wife
stabs him to death?

1419
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:49,432
- It just came to me one day.
- Well, it was fabulous.

1420
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,434
You really think I can write?

1421
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:54,938
There's maybe one or two things
I'd do differently,

1422
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,942
but who cares? It was fabulous.

1423
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,277
I mean it. I'm so impressed.

1424
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:03,446
I am. You made my day.

1425
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,989
It was great.

1426
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:07,450
I was set to be bored stiff.

1427
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:09,786
Would you like to have lunch?

1428
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,497
I'd love to talk about that script.

1429
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,874
We could do something with it.

1430
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:19,129
And I'd like to hear what made
you suddenly drop out of life.

1431
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,673
- Who cares?
- No. I care.

1432
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,467
You used to be so ambitious, and...

1433
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:27,178
God, you really liked it?

1434
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:52,162
Gosh, you really went through a crisis.

1435
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:53,997
How did you get over it?

1436
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:57,500
When I ran into you,
you seemed perfectly fine.

1437
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:59,502
You seem fine now.

1438
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,004
Well, I'll tell you.

1439
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:04,799
One day, a month ago,
I really hit bottom.

1440
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:07,343
<i>I just felt that in a godless universe,</i>

1441
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:09,512
<i>I didn't want to go on living.</i>

1442
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,641
<i>I happen to own this rifle,
which I loaded, believe it or not,</i>

1443
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:15,268
<i>and pressed it to my forehead.</i>

1444
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,479
<i>I thought, "I'm gonna kill myself."</i>

1445
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,356
<i>Then I thought, "What if I'm wrong?</i>

1446
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,860
<i>What if there is a God?
Nobody really knows."</i>

1447
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:27,530
<i>Then I thought,
"No. Maybe is not good enough.</i>

1448
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,949
<i>- I want certainty or nothing."</i>

1449
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,244
<i>I remember clearly,
the clock was ticking,</i>

1450
01:36:33,412 --> 01:36:36,664
<i>and I was sitting there frozen,</i>

1451
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,708
<i>debating whether to shoot.</i>

1452
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,921
<i>All of a sudden, the gun went off.</i>

1453
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:46,800
<i>I was so tense, I inadvertently
squeezed the trigger.</i>

1454
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:48,802
<i>But I was perspiring so much,</i>

1455
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,429
<i>the gun slid off my forehead
and missed me.</i>

1456
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:55,517
<i>Suddenly, neighbors
were pounding on the door</i>

1457
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:59,229
<i>and the whole scene was just pandemonium.</i>

1458
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:00,939
<i>I ran to the door.</i>

1459
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:04,984
<i>I didn't know what to say.
I was embarrassed and confused.</i>

1460
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,695
<i>My mind was racing a mile a minute.</i>

1461
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:11,866
<i>I just knew one thing...
I had to get out of that house.</i>

1462
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:15,745
<i>I had to get out
in the fresh air and clear my head.</i>

1463
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,748
<i>And I remember, I walked the streets.</i>

1464
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:22,085
<i>I didn't know what
was going through my mind.</i>

1465
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:25,964
<i>It all seemed so violent
and unreal to me.</i>

1466
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:28,925
<i>I wandered on the Upper West Side.</i>

1467
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,760
<i>It must have been hours.</i>

1468
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:34,222
<i>My feet hurt, my head was pounding.</i>

1469
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,767
<i>I went into a movie.
Didn't know what was playing.</i>

1470
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:42,146
<i>I just needed a moment to gather
my thoughts and be logical</i>

1471
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:45,859
<i>and put the world back
into rational perspective.</i>

1472
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,619
<i>I went up to the balcony,</i>

1473
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:58,329
<i>and I sat down.</i>

1474
01:37:58,497 --> 01:38:02,125
<i>The movie was one I'd seen
many times in my life</i>

1475
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,628
<i>since I was a kid, and I always loved it.</i>

1476
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:08,256
<i>I'm watching the screen,</i>

1477
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,551
<i>and I started getting hooked on the film.</i>

1478
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:16,806
<i>"How can you think of killing yourself?</i>

1479
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,224
<i>Isn't it stupid?</i>

1480
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,810
<i>Look at all the people on the screen.</i>

1481
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:24,314
<i>They're funny, and what if
the worst is true?</i>

1482
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:28,109
<i>There's no God, you only
go around once, that's it.</i>

1483
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:31,905
<i>Don't you want to be
part of the experience?</i>

1484
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,740
<i>It's not all a drag."</i>

1485
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:37,744
<i>And I'm thinking,
"I should stop ruining my life</i>

1486
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:40,204
<i>searching for answers</i>

1487
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:43,333
<i>and just enjoy it while it lasts."</i>

1488
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,501
<i>And after, who knows?</i>

1489
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:47,629
<i>Maybe there is something.</i>

1490
01:38:47,796 --> 01:38:51,716
<i>I know "maybe" is a slim reed
to hang your life on,</i>

1491
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,927
<i>but that's the best we have.</i>

1492
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,596
<i>And then I started to sit back</i>

1493
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,682
<i>and I actually began to enjoy myself.</i>

1494
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:03,227
<i>♪ Hail, Freedonia
Now don't you cry for me</i>

1495
01:39:03,395 --> 01:39:05,438
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm coming
around the mountain...</i>

1496
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:11,194
There's something
that's been bothering me,

1497
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,197
and I thought I'd tell you what it was

1498
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:16,991
and clear the deck, and that's this...

1499
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:21,871
I've always regretted the way
I behaved that evening we went out.

1500
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,083
I really made a fool out of myself.

1501
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,710
No, don't be ridiculous. I was...

1502
01:39:27,878 --> 01:39:29,879
You know, it was my fault.

1503
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:34,050
So you want to go out to dinner again?

1504
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,719
- You have any interest?
- Sure.

1505
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:40,139
- Are you free this evening?
- Yeah.

1506
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:51,317
- I want ice. Who's got some...
- It's on the table, Dad.

1507
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:52,986
Where's Holly? She's late.

1508
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:56,489
Did you read the last thing
Holly wrote? It's great.

1509
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,700
She writes good dialogue.

1510
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:01,411
Can I say that you're playing Desdemona?

1511
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:04,956
- Mom, it's only television.
- It's public television.

1512
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:08,084
Shakespeare doesn't get
better than <i>Othello</i>.

1513
01:40:08,293 --> 01:40:11,129
You with some big black stud. I love it.

1514
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:12,714
Oh, honey!

1515
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:41,492
<i>Oh, Lee, you are something.</i>

1516
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,454
<i>You look very beautiful.</i>

1517
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,373
<i>Marriage agrees with you.</i>

1518
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:51,210
<i>Everything that happened between us</i>

1519
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,380
<i>seems more and more hazy.</i>

1520
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:57,425
<i>I acted like such a fool.</i>

1521
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,886
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

1522
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:04,057
<i>The complete conviction
that I couldn't live without you.</i>

1523
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:07,060
<i>What I put us both through.</i>

1524
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:10,146
<i>And Hannah, who, as you once said,</i>

1525
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:13,149
<i>I loved much more than I realized.</i>

1526
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,531
Happy Thanksgiving!

1527
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,911
Daisy. I didn't miss dinner, did I?

1528
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:27,497
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving.

1529
01:41:27,664 --> 01:41:29,457
- Hello.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1530
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,833
Thank you.

1531
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,730
Looks beautiful.

1532
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:40,361
It's just your husband.

1533
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:44,949
- Hi. When did you get here?
- Just a few minutes ago.

1534
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,326
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

1535
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:51,080
I was telling your father
that it's ironic

1536
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:54,584
I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah

1537
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:58,129
and I never thought
I could love anybody else.

1538
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:00,006
Here it is years later.

1539
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:03,885
I'm married to you and
completely in love with you.

1540
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:07,597
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

1541
01:43:07,764 --> 01:43:10,016
It really is.

1542
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,728
Guy marries one sister.

1543
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:15,146
Doesn't work out.

1544
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:19,650
Then years later, he winds up
married to the other sister.

1545
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:22,778
How are you gonna top that?

1546
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:26,991
- Mickey?
- What?

1547
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:29,535
I'm pregnant.
