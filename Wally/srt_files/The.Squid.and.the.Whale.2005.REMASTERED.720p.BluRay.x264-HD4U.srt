1
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,384
(rackets hitting balls)

2
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,764
BOY: <i>Mom and me versus you and Dad.</i>

3
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,267
- Long.
- That looked pretty good.

4
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,519
- It was out.
- It did look good.

5
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,188
- Frank, it was out.
- It's my call. Out.

6
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:06,192
If you can, try and hit it
at your mother's backhand.

7
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,069
- It's pretty weak.
- Got it.

8
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,453
- Yes!
- Don't gloat, Walt.

9
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,747
Five games to three, us.

10
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,172
Fuck! Come on, Bernard.

11
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:30,550
- WOMAN: Bernard, don't curse.
- I'm cursing at myself.

12
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,974
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,202
- WOMAN: Walt, watch out.
- It's part of the game, Mom.

14
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,394
Fifteen-love.

15
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,944
Ow!

16
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,824
(chuckling) Joan, I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

17
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,416
You gotta get a second serve.

18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,920
(no audible dialogue)

19
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,793
JOAN: Frank!

20
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,255
Did you just put that peanut up your nose?

21
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,257
Cashew, yes.

22
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,844
Pickle. That is such an idiotic,
stupid thing to do.

23
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:58,721
(sniffs) No, it's out. I got it.

24
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,432
We're reading <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
in English. Is that any good?

25
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,936
Mmm. It's minor Dickens.
Popular in schools.

26
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,399
But I think <i>David Copperfield</i>
or <i>Great Expectations</i> is much richer.

27
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:14,112
What is it about high school that you read
all the worst books by good writers?

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,866
You should read it yourself
and see what you think of it.

29
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,285
I don't wanna waste my time.

30
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,791
(springs creaking)

31
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,710
What are you doing?

32
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,170
Just fixing up the couch.

33
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:34,924
- Did you sleep there?
- Yeah. Our bed is hurting my back.

34
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,635
Isn't the couch worse
than the bed for backs?

35
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,888
No. This — This is better.

36
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,975
When does Mom's story
come out in the magazine?

37
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,352
It's not a magazine.
It's a literary journal.

38
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,479
Next month, I think.

39
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,899
It'll be weird having two writers
as parents.

40
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,319
Yeah, well, Dad influenced her.
She never wrote before she met him.

41
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,654
I haven't read any of Dad's books.

42
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,990
I've looked at them.
They're great. They're very dense.

43
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,701
He needs a new agent.
It's been too long since his last book.

44
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:05,747
But the publishing world isn't receptive,
always, to real literary talent.

45
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,666
Maybe Mom will be famous instead.

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,168
No, Dad's the writer.

47
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,961
Maybe Mom is better.

48
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,923
No, that's way off base, Frank.
That's way off base.

49
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,259
FRANK: Ivan hit with Arthur Ashe once.

50
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,803
Wasn't he ranked, like, 402 or something?

51
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,640
Ivan could've been a champion,
if he hadn't hurt his knee.

52
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,434
Okay, my brother,
let's see some ground strokes.

53
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,022
(chuckles)

54
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,024
You gotta ease up, my brother.

55
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,109
Jimmy Connors hits everything
as hard as he can.

56
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,862
But we can't all get away with that, right?

57
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,989
All right, let's see the backhand.

58
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,493
Two hands. Two hands.

59
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:47,455
Hey, my brother, who taught you
these junkyard strokes, huh?

60
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,124
My dad. He's self-taught.

61
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,250
I heard that.

62
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,505
Hey, Bernard, you teaching my brother here
these junkyard chip shots?

63
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,633
One-handed backhand is an elegant stroke.

64
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,219
My brother here doesn't want
a weak chip shot for a backhand.

65
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,012
I don't care.

66
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,349
It's McEnroe's stroke.
He's the master of the chip game.

67
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,519
(chuckles)
All right, fellas, that's it for today.

68
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,396
Ivan, you wanna hit a little?

69
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,607
I got a few minutes.

70
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,028
Frank, you and Carl hang out.
Give me your racket.

71
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,469
- Are you interested in any arts?
- I wouldn't mind being a pro.

72
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,097
It's very hard to be a professional player.

73
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,391
As good as even someone like Ivan is,

74
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,435
he's not in a league
with McEnroe or Connors.

75
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,812
Oh, I don't mean a pro like that.

76
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,399
I mean, like a pro at the bubble.
Like Ivan.

77
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,484
You don't wanna be a pro.

78
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,364
I'm sure I've lost my parking space.
We're gonna have to drive around.

79
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,742
- Can you drop me off?
- No.

80
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:09,078
I picked you up. The least you can do
is ride around with me.

81
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:13,958
- ♪♪ (stereo: guitars)

82
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,629

- Walt, did you write that song?
- Yes.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,962
Well, Frank had some good ideas too.

95
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,798
BERNARD: Very dense. Very interesting.

96
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,592
I signed up for the talent thing
they have at school.

97
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,052
Great.

98
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,722
- Just make sure you practice a lot.
- Mom, I'll be fine.

99
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,391
Just remember, you're gonna
be in front of a lot of people.

100
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,393
Mom, don't ruin the whole thing for me.

101
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,021
You'll win. And if you don't win,
something's wrong with 'em.

102
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,982
Which is probably the case, actually.
People can be very stupid.

103
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,318
- (phone rings)
- I'll get it.

104
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,157
Walt, you wanna come to my class
tomorrow after school?

105
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,284
- Yeah.
- Could I come?

106
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,828
- JOAN: Hello?
- You have tennis.

107
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,580
You're gonna be doing that,
which is its own thing.

108
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:36,499
(chuckles) Look how young Dad looks.

109
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,335
(chuckles) That's funny.
Dad, can I have this?

110
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,838
- Okay.
- Would you write something in it?

111
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,348
JOAN (faint): Yeah.

112
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,189
Thanks.

113
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,485
GIRL: <i>"I absorb sex indiscriminately,</i>

114
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,237
numb and impartial.

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,239
I suck men of their interiors.

116
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,492
A fuck that unites
John, Dan, Scott, whomever,

117
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:15,246
in the popular lust
and paternal hunt for my possession.

118
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,124
He was a large man,
though his arms were thin.

119
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,669
The upper part soft, but not fleshy,
like a young woman's.

120
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,798
He had long, delicate fingers
and plump palms similar to a raccoon's.

121
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:29,135
With what is best described as finesse,
he plied the meat from a crab claw

122
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,137
and sucked oysters from their shells."

123
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,807
She's a very risky writer, Lili.
Very racy.

124
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:38,519
I mean, exhibiting her cunt
in that fashion is very racy.

125
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,355
I mean, Lili has her influences
in postmodern literature,

126
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,482
a bit derivative of Kafka.

127
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,610
But for a student, very racy.

128
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,987
- Did you get that it was her cunt?
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,114
- Did you like it?
- Yeah. A lot.

130
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,825
You'd like Kafka, one of my predecessors.

131
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,578
- Particularly <i>The Metamorphosis.
- Metamorphosis?</i>

132
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,039
No fucking spaces.

133
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:01,125
- I'll keep you company while we look.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,712
Dad, what were your wives like before Mom?

135
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,132
"Wife," really. The first one was annulled.
I was 19.

136
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,968
- What was she like?
- The annulled one?

137
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:14,055
No, the one you'd call a wife.

138
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,265
Difficult.

139
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,648
That's Mom.

140
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,109
Yeah, that's Mom.

141
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,905
What was she wearing?

142
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,408
No, I guess I've seen that before.

143
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:39,288
(typing)

144
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,342
What are you writing?

145
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,553
I'm working on the Peugeot story.

146
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:59,267
Did you take my note about the ending?

147
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,559
Some of it.

148
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,770
- Does he still die?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,022
Then you didn't take my note.

150
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,774
(phone ringing)

151
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:16,242
(Bernard, Joan shouting, faint)

152
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,497
(shouting continues)

153
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,671
Um, boys, make sure you
come home right after school.

154
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,924
- Why?
- We're having a family conference.

155
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,261
- What's that?
- A talk. Just... come home.

156
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,306
- What about?
- We'll go over it tonight.

157
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,349
- Can't you give us a hint?
- No, just —

158
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:44,020
Tonight. We'll go — Everything.
We'll go over it tonight.

159
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,500
(no audible dialogue)

160
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,432
Just waiting for your mother.

161
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,226
(toilet flushes)

162
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,937
- Oh, Mom.
- Sorry.

163
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,193
- Okay.
- Okay, all set?

164
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,861
Yes.

165
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,613
Okay.

166
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,573
Your mom and I...

167
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,160
Okay, yeah. Uh, Mom and I are going...

168
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,499
We're going to separate.

169
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:50,461
- You're not gonna be leaving either of us.
- We're gonna have joint custody.

170
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,090
Frank, it's okay. I've got an elegant
new house across the park.

171
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,716
FRANK: Across the park?

172
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,387
- Is that even Brooklyn?
- It's only five stops on the subway.

173
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,556
It's an elegant block,
the fillet of the neighborhood.

174
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,892
- We'll have a Ping-Pong table.
- I don't play Ping-Pong.

175
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,079
- We'll both see you equally.
- WALT: How would that work?

176
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:10,481
- We're splitting up the week, alternating days.
- Why?

177
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,204
'Cause I love you, and I wanna see you
as much as your mother does.

178
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,693
- But there's seven days.
- Right.

179
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,029
So how will you split evenly
with seven days?

180
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,615
I've got you Tuesday,
Wednesday and Saturday

181
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,783
and every other Thursday.

182
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,369
- Every other?
- That's how we each have you equally.

183
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,287
That was your father's idea.

184
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,540
Don't do this.

185
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,417
How will I get to school?

186
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,003
There's a subway four blocks from the house.
Four or five. No more than six blocks.

187
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,131
And wh-what about the cat?

188
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,799
Shit. The cat.

189
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,884
We didn't discuss the cat.

190
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:42,805
Your father will pick him up on those days
when you're switching houses.

191
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,057
I'll have to drive here
two additional times a week?

192
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:47,518
You got a place on
the other side of the park.

193
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,621
If you'd gotten a place near here,
it wouldn't be a problem.

194
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,325
This neighborhood's gotten very expensive.

195
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,275
It's very painful for me to stay in
this neighborhood. You know that.

196
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,068
Don't be difficult. I feel banished.

197
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,320
Oh, Pickle.

198
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,781
So, Dad, what will happen with the cat?

199
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,700
We'll figure something out.

200
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,373
Is it 'cause Dad isn't
as successful as he used to be?

201
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,585
Now that you're publishing and he isn't?
Is that it?

202
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,129
- That's not nice —
- Because this is a great family.

203
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,299
- I don't know why you're screwing it up.
- If we could avoid it, I would.

204
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,610
Why are you doing this now?
You've been together 16 years.

205
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,595
Seventeen.

206
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,680
Can't imagine living
with you guys like this.

207
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,726
Don't most of your friends
already have divorced parents?

208
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,644
Yeah, but I don't.

209
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,646
Well, now you do.

210
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,026
I think you're doing
a foolish, foolish thing.

Listen, Chicken, I understand
how unhappy you are. I'm unhappy too.

00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:44,450
And I don't want you or Frank
to blame yourself for any of this.

226
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,718

My parents didn't wanna

236
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,261
So we stayed in the house
and they both took separate apartments

237
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,037
and switched off coming to us.

238
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:15,749
And then my mom met Dexter.
My dad freaked out.

239
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,671

- I think it has very little to do with me.

337
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,912
- FRANK: Mother — Shit! Fucker!
- IVAN: Frank!

338
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,606
She could never make up her mind.

339
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,776
She'd pull away, and then she'd get angry
at me for not being more aggressive.

340
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,281
Her affair with that man Richard made it
difficult, finally, for me to save the marriage.

341
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,700
- It became a fait accompli.
- Affair?

342
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,911
- With Richard.
- Who's Richard?

343
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,621
A man from the neighborhood.

344
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,831
She met him at one
of Frank's Little League games.

345
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:51,001
A shrink.
Seems sort of like an ordinary guy.

346
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,753
Not an intellectual.

347
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,714
- How long was she having the affair?
- Mmm, about four years.

348
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,717
- You're kidding.
- No. I thought you knew this.

349
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,178
No. No.

350
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,598
Fuck that cock shit!

351
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,559
Frank. (chuckles)
You gotta relax, my brother.

352
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,604
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honeys.

353
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,523
- FRANK: What are you doing?
- Just changing things around a bit.

354
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,817
I've come by to tell you
I'm not staying here anymore.

355
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,028
- Why?
- You know why.

356
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,030
- No, I don't.
- Frank, do you know why?

357
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,823
- No.
- Why don't you tell me, Walt?

358
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,784
Because you cheated on Dad.

359
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,496
How'd you hear that?

360
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,375
- Your father told you.
- Yeah.

361
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,168
He told me.

362
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,587
Why did you, Mom?

363
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,466
I was having a hard time.

364
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,052
Where were we during all this?
Did you bring men home?

365
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,762
Not while — Not...

366
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,432
Not when your father was in town.

367
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:51,269
You actually met Richard, both you boys.

368
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,522
He came over for takeout once.

369
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,233
You talked about the Stones.

370
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,651
Oh, God.

371
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,320
Under our noses, like a brothel.
Men coming in and out.

372
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,031
- FRANK: Walt, shut up.
- If you want me to explain, I will.

373
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,550
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- I do.

374
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,511
Well, Walt doesn't,
so I'm not gonna say anything.

375
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,287
- Walt can leave.
- You disgust me.

376
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,289
You weren't even a writer until recently.

377
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,935
You just bailed on Dad 'cause he's not
as successful as he used to be

378
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,520
and hasn't gotten
the recognition he deserves.

379
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,814
- You sound like your father.
- I'm glad I sound like him.

380
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,215
- You disgust me.
- You're being a shit, Walt!

381
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,431
- I'm taking the cat.
- You can't have him. It's his night here.

382
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,684
<i>Okay, you can kiss me now.</i>

383
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,186
<i>- No, the moment's ruined.</i>

- JANET: <i>It's not her birthday.</i>

386
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,694
She also had an affair
with some therapist.

387
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,154
I don't wanna know.

388
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,780
<i>And Otto's father, Don.</i>

389
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,742
- Otto's father?
<i>- Yeah, but it's over.</i>

390
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,995
She said the affairs have
kind of been miserable for her.

391
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,247
<i>She's dating now, but nothing serious.</i>

392
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,000
She's crazy. She should keep
her affairs to herself.

393
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,711
<i>- I'm not going back to Mom's.</i>
- You have to. Joint custody.

394
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,464
- Fuck joint custody.
- (phone: can opens)

395
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,549
- Is Mom letting you drink soda?
<i>- Beer.</i>

396
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:06,053
<i>- Since when do you drink beer?</i>
- Since recently.

397
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,477
- You think Don and she did it?
- God, I don't wanna think about it.

398
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,104
Imagine Don's dick in Mom's mouth.

399
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,773
Who are you? Stop it.

400
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:22,611
Do you think they do that?
Do you think she has anal sex from Don?

401
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,489
Stop, okay? It's disgusting.

402
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,159
Don't.

403
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,625
- FRANK: <i>We have the same bone structure.</i>
- JOAN: <i>No.</i>

404
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,460
You have your dad's features.

405
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,630
- Really?
- Mmm.

406
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,632
- Fuck it.
- Frank.

407
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,843
- I thought I had your bone structure.
- No.

408
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,016
You're ugly.

409
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,771
Pickle, why would you say that?

410
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,066
Because I think it's true.
I think Carl thinks you're ugly.

411
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,195
I'm not though, sweetie.

412
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:55,287
- I found out something last night.
- What's that?

413
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,206
That your dad was fucking my mom.

414
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,875
- What?
- You heard me.

415
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,670
Supposedly going on for a year or so,
about two years ago.

416
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,007
(groans)

417
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,467
I'm so horrified by this.

418
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,262
- Thanks.
- No, I don't mean by your mom.

419
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,014
She's very attractive.

420
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,851
It was just an affair. A fuck.
We're not gonna be brothers or anything.

421
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,478
She said your dad's
pretty fucked up with women.

422
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,523
- Why'd she sleep with him then?
- I don't know.

423
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,693
Because she's an asshole?

424
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,363
Oh, I read <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>
You were right. It's great.

425
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,741
- Oh?
- Yeah. I mean, so bizarre.

426
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,994
What do you think is happening
at the end, with the sister?

427
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,205
Oh, yeah, I think she's, um...

428
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,415
- I mean, that's ambiguous, really.
- Yeah.

429
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:45,045
It's gross when he turns into the bug,
but I love how matter-of-fact everything is.

430
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,589
Yeah, it's very Kafkaesque.

431
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,425
'Cause it's written by Franz Kafka.

432
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,843
Right.

433
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,471
- No, I mean, clearly.
- Yeah, it would have to be.

Um, you're, uh —

435
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,730
- You're shoving the whole tongue in me.
- Oh. Sor —

436
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,192
No, it's okay. Just do it a little.
Like, little licks.

437
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,863
- Like this?
- Yeah.

438

Ivan is fine, but he's not a serious guy.
He's a Philistine.

470

What's a Philistine?

471
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,395
It's a guy who doesn't care about books
or interesting films and things.

472
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,731
Your mother's brother Ned
is also a Philistine.

473
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,816
Then I'm a Philistine.

474
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,320
No, you're interested in books and things.
You liked <i>The Wild Child</i> when we saw it.

475
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,073
Lots of people liked that movie.

476
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,368
No. I'm a Philistine.

When am I going to meet the famous Sophie?

00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:33,380
I don't know.
She's not gorgeous, but she's cute.

479
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:36,508
You have plenty of time

00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,694
When my first novel came out,
I had a lot of opportunities.

483
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,448
I was with your mother,
so I didn't partake.

484
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:04,077
And I've never had an affair with a student,
though many have come on to me.

485
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,288
That's why you might not wanna
be attached at your age.

486
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,332
But it sounds like Sophie's good for now.

487
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,709
- Why'd you yell "goddamn it"?
- I burned myself.

488
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,379
Cutlets are great.
Dad, did you hear from that agent?

489
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,172
Mmm. Not yet.

490
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,675
But if he likes your novel,
then you get it published, right?

491
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,759
Basically.

492
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,346
- What happened to your old agent, Fred?
- Pissed me off.

493
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,391
He made a disparaging remark
about the Knicks at a party.

494
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,354
Said they played like thugs.
I found it really offensive. Kind of a jerk.

495
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:37,402
I think it was important to your mother that
I achieve some sort of commercial success.

496
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:41,156
And when I didn't meet
her expectations in that area...

497
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,538
What you're going to witness
is a Greenberg family tradition —

I hope you're prepared.

- Hey.
- Hey.

500
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,214
- Uh, why'd you let go of my hand?
- What?

501
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,383
When we passed Wendy, you let go.

502
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,844
I didn't realize.

503
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,681
Walt, is there anything special
you'd like to order?

504
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,350
No, I'm just happy to have
the same amount of dishes as people.

505
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,978
In my family, it's always one dish
less the number of people.

506
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,314
That's our family tradition —
not ordering enough food.

507
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,107
(laughs) That's funny.

508
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,194
- Oh, he's funny, Sophie.
- I know.

509
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,658
(doorbell rings)

510
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,706
- You're early.
- Hi, Joan.

511
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,920
- Don't feed him the generic stuff.
- What?

512
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:40,590
Frank says you're feeding the cat generic food.
Get Purina. It's what he likes.

513
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,343
- It's the same damn thing, Joan.
- Okay, it's not, but...

514
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,428
He's my cat too, you know.

515
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,766
You remember when he got stuck in a wall
in New Hampshire, and I rescued him?

516
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,393
- I know how to handle him.
- It was a radiator.

517
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,687
- What?
- He got stuck in a radiator.

518
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,818
You trimmed your beard.

519
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,613
Yeah, it was starting to get a little feral.

520
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,242
- You look well.
- Yeah?

521
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,454
- Thanks.
- Things are good here.

522
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,831
Teaching is going well.

523
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:17,001
I'm playing the best tennis of my life.

524
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:21,214
Maybe that's an illusion,
but... feels that way.

525
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,508
That's good.

526
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,428
Hey, I was thinking we should sit together
at Walt's performance next month.

527
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,763
Okay.

528
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,683
I think it'd be nice for him
if we were both there together.

529
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,269
Maybe we could all go out afterwards.

530
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,814
I don't know. Maybe.

531
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,607
Okay. Maybe.

532
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,194
I think he's getting good at guitar.

533
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,737
I know.

534
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,240
The stuff he's writing is really wonderful.

535
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,701
- Have you met his girlfriend?
- N-No.

536
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:53,246
- He talks about her... with me though.
- Good.

537
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,334
I'd appreciate it if you didn't...

538
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,755
tell him about things like Richard.

539
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,014
My father told me you called him.

540
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,808
I did, yeah.

541
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,351
He said you, uh...

542
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,270
- Said you were upset.
- Yeah.

543
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,982
I wanted to...

544
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,902
I like him.

545
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,155
You know that.

546
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,282
I just wanted to say — I don't know.

547
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,411
I just wanted to say hello.

548
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,665
He called me right after, and he said,
"Bernie, I think you can save your marriage."

549
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,503
I told him...

550
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,592
I didn't think there was
anything else I could do.

551
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,973
I did try everything.

552
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,441
Bye, Bernard.

553
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,408
Bernard?

554
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,953
I was wondering
if you knew of any apartments.

555
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,997
I'm being kicked out of my sublet.

556
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,042
Unless I, I don't know, blow the super,
I'm out on my ass.

557
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,710
Oh, I don't. No.

558
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,088
I... guess you don't know either, huh?

559
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,548
Oh, uh, no.

560
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:31,803
Actually, I have an extra room in my house.
You could stay there till you find something.

561
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,888
You wouldn't have to blow your super.

562

Oh.

564
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,645

00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:27,301
Pickle, your dad and Walt are here,
and they're gonna take you back to Bernard's.

670
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,011
I'll be right out.

671
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:33,766
I'm sorry about... I'm sorry about
your seeing Ivan like this.

672
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,769
I would've liked to have told you
before you saw him.

673
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,128
Your mother.

674
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:05,297
I wanted to tell you about Ivan
so you didn't hear it from anyone else.

675
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,925
<i>Frank may have already said something.</i>

676
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,635
Yeah, he did.

677
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,887
<i>I've been seeing him a short time.</i>

678
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:15,724
But I like him, and I thought
you guys should know that.

679
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,561
<i>And do you have any questions?</i>

680
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:19,854
No.

681
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:23,232
<i>Um, there was something else
I was going to say.</i>

682
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,026
Oh. I ran into Celia,
Lance's mother, on the street,

683
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,613
and she was telling me
how wonderful she thinks you are.

684
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,782
How polite and funny and...

685
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,826
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

686
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,996
<i>She said you did something
with the salt and pepper shakers.</i>

687
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,374
<i>- A little play or something.</i>
- Yeah. It was kind of stupid.

688
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,918
I said I already know
all those things about him,

689
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,754
but it's nice to hear it.

690
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,132
<i>Oh, I remember what else
I was going to say.</i>

691
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:52,136
<i>I wanted to know if you'd be interested
in coming to dinner Saturday</i>

692
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,846
<i>because I'm having the Dicksteins over.</i>

693
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,765
No. I'm going to a party on Saturday,
and I'm sleeping at Jeffrey's.

694
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,018
That's okay.

695
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,603
<i>I'm gonna go to bed.</i>

696
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,814
<i>Okay. Good night, Chicken.</i>

697
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:05,566
Night.

698
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:10,362
♪ Kyrie Eleison down the road
that I must travel ♪

699
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:15,284
♪ Kyrie Eleison
through the darkness of the night ♪

700
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:20,247
♪ Kyrie Eleison
Where I'm going, will you follow? ♪

701
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:24,752
♪ Kyrie Eleison
on a highway in the light ♪

702
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,338
- You think she likes you?
- I get a feeling, yeah.

703
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,257
- What about Sophie?
- If I can lose it to Lili, I'll do it.

704
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,259
I mean, I bet she's great in bed.

705
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:35,012
She can probably move her pussy muscles
just the right way,

706
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,097
so you blow your load in, like, seconds.

707
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,100
- Yeah. It'd be pretty great.
- Maybe do 'em both.

708
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,977
Why not?

709
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,272
Hey, brother.

710
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,066
How's the grip?

711
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,944
- Do you think you and I are Philistines?
- Frank!

712
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,738
What's a Philistine?

713
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:57,243
Someone who doesn't like books
or interesting movies or things.

714
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:01,914
You're still here. It's my night with him.

715
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:05,000
I know. I just thought I'd watch him hit.

716
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:15,219
- You married?
- No.

717
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,639
The whole thing's very complicated.

718
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,226
(seat belt latches)

719
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,938
Mom's dating Ivan.

720
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,648
Really?

721
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:30,442
- Ivan back there Ivan?
- Yeah.

722
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:33,946
Are you sure?

723
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,031
Why didn't you say something?

724
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,455
Why is your mother dating all these jocks?

725
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:47,626
- Very uninteresting men.
- Ivan is very interesting.

726
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,171
Ivan's not a serious possibility
for your mother.

727
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,507
I think he is.

728
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,634
I don't want to bad-mouth Ivan.

729
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,972
But I don't know what Joan is thinking.

730
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:03,517
- I think Ivan is —
- Frank.

731
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,811
- Ow. Ow.
- Sorry. Was that too hard?

732
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,771
Yeah, a bit.

733
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,356
Okay.

734
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,276
Is that better?

735
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,321
Yeah.

736
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:17,031
Yeah. (chuckles)

737
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:19,241
Yeah, that's good. That's —

738
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,410
Oh.

739
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,995
Um —

740
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:27,374
Um... I — I guess, uh —

741
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:31,128
I don't know — I don't know what...

742
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,047
why that happened.

743
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,175
I mean, it's okay. Yeah. It's okay.

744
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:37,760
Okay.

745
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,105
Shit. Sorry.

746
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:52,858
- Don't be sorry.
- I don't know why I didn't last longer.

747
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,235
- I usually go for much longer.
- It's okay.

748
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,654
I guess I can take it as a compliment.

749
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:03,869
Did you take your shirt off
for Nelson Barton?

750
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,622
- I don't want to talk about it, Walt.
- Please, it's important.

751
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,625
- Why is it important?
- 'Cause I need to know what happened.

752
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,670
Well, he felt me up and I touched him.

753
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,631
- Down his pants?
- Walt, yeah.

754
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:21,178
I just...
From what I can tell, not an intellectual.

755
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,429
I'm a virgin.

756
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,891
So am I.

757
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:31,772
- When's your next book coming out?
- Soon, I hope. Soon.

758
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,607
Who's publishing it?

759
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,068
Well, I'm looking for a new agent first.

760
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,445
A friend of mine's
an agent with Binky Urban.

761
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,990
- If you like, I'll show it to him.
- Oh, that'd be great.

762
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,328
(phone ringing)

763
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:48,664
Hello.

764
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,500
Um, could I stay the night at Sophie's?

765
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,460
Thanks for doing that.

766
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:55,546
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

767
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:57,798
<i>Or Tuesday. I'll see you Tuesday.</i>

768
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:00,968
- You don't need me home for anything?
- No. Everything's fine.

769
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:08,517
If you're interested, Walt and I are
taking a road trip to SUNY Binghamton

770
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,686
in a couple of weekends.

771
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,604
I'm giving a reading,

772
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:15,607
and, uh, an ex-student of mine,
now friend, Jeb Gelber,

773
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:17,651
is feting me with a dinner.

774
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,278
Excellent.

775
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,531
You should read the cathedral scene
from <i>Under Water.</i>

776
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:26,827
Oh. I've done that one a lot.
I thought I'd do something new.

777
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,746
But, uh, okay. Well, maybe.

778
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,331
(chuckles)

779
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,800
Sorry. My nose is running.

780
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:44,261
I'm your teacher.

781
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:47,848
I've wondered for a long time
what it would be like to fuck you.

782
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,933
I think we should wait.

783
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:55,063
Really?

784
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:58,233
Yeah. Yeah, let's wait.

785
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,047
(applause)

786
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,601
Okay. Up next, Walt Berkman,

787
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,103
who is going to play us a song.

788
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:37,940
(applause)

789
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:41,985
Thank you.

790
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:46,990
I'm going to play lead guitar
and do vocals on a song I wrote.

791
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:53,622
♪ Hey you, out there in the cold,

- Oh. Thank you.

799
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:28,156
- Oh, Dad, you remember Sophie?
- Mm-hmm.

800
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,158
- And Lili.
- Hi.

801
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:33,036
- How much did you win?
- Hundred bucks.

802
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,665
Come by my room tonight before you go to bed.
I want to show you something.

803
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:40,377
Okay. Oh, and this is
my mom and Frank and Ivan.

804
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,170
Hi.

805
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:44,590
- Some song, brother.
- Thanks.

806
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:47,217
Hi, Bernard.

807
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:57,311
I thought we'd all have dinner.
Ivan suggested Gage and Tollner.

808
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,479
We could celebrate my book and your song.

809
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,189
I'm going to go with Dad.

810
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:03,609
Well, your Dad and I
talked about all of us going.

811
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,360
I don't want to do that. See ya.

812
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,198
Ivan and I came to see your show.
Don't treat us that way.

813
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:15,871
You think you hate me,
but I know you don't.

814
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:28,884
SOPHIE: <i>Where'd you come up
with some of those lyrics?</i>

815
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,802
They were very dreamlike.

816
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,929
Reminds me of my second novel,
<i>End of the Line.</i>

817
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:35,474
- There's a rock star character in that.
- I love that novel.

818
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:39,227
Classic. The scenes with the baby
in the middle are based on me as a baby.

819
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:41,772
That's right.
It's Mailer's favorite of my books.

820
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:45,275
I loved your wife's piece
in <i>The New Yorker.</i>

821
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,571
Really? In <i>The New Yorker?</i>
Did you know about this?

822
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:51,990
- I guess I did.
- How'd that happen?

823
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,743
- It's an excerpt.
- She's getting a novel published.

824
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,453
Really?

825
00:49:56,536 --> 00:50:00,165
Walt showed it to me.
It was kind of sad, but really good.

826
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:05,545
The portions are very big here.
You only need half an order.

827
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:07,130
Okay.

828
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:11,843
Jesus. Fifteen dollars for parking.

829
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,262
What do you think
I should do about Sophie?

830
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,848
You'll make the right decision.

831
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:22,813
I regret sometimes I wasn't more
of a free agent when I was younger.

832
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:25,774
There was a woman who approached me
at a party at George Plimpton's

833
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,484
after my first book.

834
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:30,696
She was very sexy.
I could've gone home with her.

835
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:33,448
- Why didn't you?
- I was with your mother.

836
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:35,951
Oh, right. Of course.

837
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,537
You should've probably done it.
It didn't stop her.

838
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,584
Maybe you should sleep with her once.

839
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:46,795
See if you like it.

840
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,297
It doesn't mean
you can't see other women too.

841
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,592
I don't know if Sophie will go for that.

842
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:58,014
Well, after your performance tonight,
things might change for you.

843
00:50:58,098 --> 00:50:59,933
Do you want to go to my house?

844
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,352
Jesus, you really want to do it,
don't you?

845
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,146
I don't know.

846
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,356
What's the obsession with sex?

847
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,901
It's not an obsession.
I'm not so sure I want to do it either.

848
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,028
- I'm scared too.
- Scared is not the issue.

849
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:14,906
It's just everything
is so serious suddenly.

850
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,801
- We're not getting married.
- What are you saying?

851
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,244
Nothing. I just don't want to feel
this pressure from you.

852
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,913
Do you like someone else?
Your dad's girlfriend?

853
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:24,291
No. No. Why?

854
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:27,335
No! And she's not his girlfriend.

855
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:30,589
My father said you had a weak handshake,
which is a sign of indecision.

856
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:32,924
His hands are so huge.
I can't get a good grip.

857
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:35,886
And my mother said you don't have
a very good model for relationships

858
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,471
because of your parents.

859
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:41,266
What? Your mother doesn't know anything.

860
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,186
I thought it went well.
You told me she said I was hilarious.

861
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:49,900
Don't be difficult. Please.

862
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:55,989
You want a beer?

863
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:00,368
I couldn't take relying
on your Dad's shopping habits anymore.

864
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,413
You can have anything you want whenever.

865
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:04,998
Thanks.

866
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,418
I'm going to read you
a draft of my new story.

867
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:12,339
I want to hear your thoughts first.
Then I'm going to show it to your dad.

868
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,135
- You like Pink Floyd, huh?
- What?

869
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,681
Don't worry. I used to hand in
Lou Reed lyrics in my poetry class

870
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:23,475
and pass them off as my own.

871
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:26,061
Although I hope you don't get caught.

872
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,146
I always did.

873
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:35,862
Do you —

874
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:38,031
- Oh! Fuck!
- Sorry.

875
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:41,868
- Shit!
- Lili, sorry.

876
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:45,747
It's okay. It's just a bloody nose.

877
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:47,457
I'm sorry.

878
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:03,723
I might take a bath. Okay?

879
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,559
Oh. Okay.

880
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,645
- Okay.
- Good night.

881
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,317
- Hey.
- Hey.

882
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,281
(knocking)

883
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,868
- When's Bernard coming to get you?
- In an hour.

884
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,578
Plan on 30 minutes.

885
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:28,039
He's always early to get you
and late to bring you back.

886
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,460
- I wish I could come with you guys.
- I heard that, brother.

887
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:35,964
I know. But Dad's got you on Saturdays.

888
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:40,218
- Do you like his girlfriend?
- Is she his girlfriend?

889
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:43,096
I thought so. She lives with you.

890
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:44,806
- He doesn't say?
- No.

891
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,183
I think Walt loves her.

892
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,771
- So, they like the same women now too.
- What?

893
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,357
It's nothing. You got our number in Maine.

894
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:57,569
- Remember to lock up.
- I will.

895
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:00,655
- See you next week, Pickle-oo.
- Just Pickle, please.

896
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,159
I'll see you next week, Just Pickle.

897
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:13,501
- Good grip, brother.
- You too, brother.

898
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:16,588
(car doors closing)

899
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,965
(engine starts)

900
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:30,352
- (answering machine beeps)
- Dad, it's me.

901
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:32,854
Are you there?

902
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:34,439
Pick up.

903
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,025
Shit.

904
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,533
- WOMAN: <i>♪ One times eight is eight ♪</i>
- (no audible dialogue)

905
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:48,244
<i>♪ Two times eight is 16 ♪</i>

906
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:51,039
<i>♪ Three times eight is 24 ♪</i>

907
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,458
<i>♪ Four times eight is 32 ♪</i>

908
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,044
<i>♪ And five times eight is 40, you know ♪</i>

909
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,712
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

910
00:54:57,796 --> 00:55:00,799
<i>- ♪ Figure eight is double four ♪</i>
- It had been an emotionally draining

911
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,093
day and night for the itinerant alienist —
(continues)

912
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:06,388
<i>♪ Figure four is half of eight ♪</i>

913
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:11,643
<i>♪ If you skate, you would be great ♪</i>

914
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,521
<i>♪ If you could make ♪</i>

915
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:17,232
<i>♪ A figure eight ♪</i>

916
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:21,820
I'm sorry about the turnout.
A lot of the kids go home early for Passover.

917
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:23,530
They seemed to like it.

918
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,909
(gags)

919
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,835
(sneezes)

920
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:32,098
WOMAN:
I mean, masturbating is his own issue.

921
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:35,435
But Hector witnessed the locker incident,

922
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,980
and then later semen
was found in the library.

923
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,356
Who's Hector?

924
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:45,236
How do you know they were both Frank's?

925
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,824
Well, I suppose it's possible
other kids are masturbating

926
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:53,495
and spreading their semen
around the school as well.

927
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:56,748
It's possible, but, uh, somewhat unlikely.

928
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,125
Oh, it happens, I'm sure,
much more than we know.

929
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,628
Bernard, have you ever done
anything like this?

930
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,588
I'm not going to answer that.

931
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:07,509
Has anything been going on at home
that might've provoked this behavior?

932
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:12,514
Well, Bernard left him behind
for three days last week.

933
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,266
And, of course, Frank's mother
divorced me earlier this year,

934
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,560
which might also have
something to do with it.

935
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,232
Ms. Berkman, I read your story
in <i>The New Yorker.</i>

936
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:24,818
I thought it was quite moving.

937
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,611
Thanks.

938
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,696
Thanks a lot.

939
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:32,575
<i>You're living with a 20-year-old.</i>

940
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:36,663
- It's none of your business, Joan.
- It's my business when you have our kids.

941
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:38,623
It's confusing for them.

942
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:41,292
Frank says Walt's in love with her.

943
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:44,129
Walt has a girlfriend.

944
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:48,675
Fuck off, Joan.
I don't ask about you and Ivan.

945
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,386
Stay out of my life.

946
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,763
I can't believe you'd talk to me like this.

947
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:56,850
You left all those fucking ticket stubs
and letters lying around.

948
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,601
You wanted me to know.

949
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:01,980
It was fucking torture, Joan!

950
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,149
Fucking torture!

951
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,410
MAN: <i>♪ Hey you ♪</i>

952
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:19,122
<i>♪ Out there in the cold,
getting lonely, getting old ♪</i>

953
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:21,374
<i>♪ Can you feel me? ♪</i>

954
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,924
He made his own interpretation.

955
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:32,719
Well, he's still going to have
to give the prize money back.

956
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:36,514
But obviously, it's a bigger problem.
He isn't doing any of his schoolwork either.

957
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:39,184
His paper on <i>Gatsby</i>
was quite brilliant, I thought.

958
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:40,894
It's one of his favorite books.

959
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:44,022
That may be,
but I don't believe he's read it.

960
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:46,232
You both should talk to him.

961
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:48,443
I think Bernard has to do it.

962
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:53,489
<i>♪ But it was only fantasy ♪</i>

963
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,411
<i>♪ The wall was too high ♪</i>

964
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,331
- He wants you to see a therapist.
- I don't need that.

965
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:05,710
That's what I said. Does Simic know both
your parents have PhD's in literature?

966
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,087
- I've mentioned it.
- I think he's full of shit.

967
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:12,634
These public schools tend to hire well-meaning,
but ultimately unsophisticated bureaucrats.

968
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,719
Yeah. I don't like him.

969
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:18,765
But you might have to do it
just to please the school.

970
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:20,767
- I don't need it.
- I know.

971
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:25,146
And unfortunately, probably a guy
with a BA in psychology.

972
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,065
Not a real shrink.

973
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:31,903
I have an MA in Developmental Psychology
from the Yale Child Studies Program.

974
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,948
- Did you get a PhD?
- No, an MA is a masters.

975
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,617
Uh-huh. Right.

976
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,619
Have any thoughts
about why you're here, Walt?

977
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,663
Not really.

978
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,998
You said you wrote the song
you played in assembly.

979
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,750
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

980
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,336
- I don't know.
- Did you have a reason?

981
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:51,756
- I felt I could've written it.
- Okay.

982
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,841
But you didn't.

983
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:56,177
It was written by Roger Waters
of Pink Floyd.

984
00:59:56,261 --> 00:59:58,805
- I think you know that.
- Yes, but I felt I could've,

985
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:02,308
so the fact that it was already written
was kind of a technicality.

986
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:03,935
I see.

987
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:07,522
I can imagine this is a little uncomfortable
for you to talk about.

988
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,566
I guess. It's hard to explain.

989
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,278
I wonder how you're feeling right now.

990
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,862
I don't know.

991
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:18,491
Why don't you tell me
about something less uncomfortable.

992
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:20,535
Like a nice memory, maybe.

993
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,704
Isn't that kind of a stock question
for a shrink?

994
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:25,915
Yes. That's more or less how this works.

995
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,334
- I can't think of anything right now.
- Just think.

996
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:31,587
- Come on.
- Just something.

997
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:33,548
Meet me halfway here.

998
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:36,050
Um, let's see.

999
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:43,224
Okay. Uh, when I was around six,
my mom and I...

1000
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:45,727
She and I ducked out
of Julie Glynn's birthday party

1001
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,563
to watch <i>Robin Hood</i> together on our TV.

1002
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,649
- That sounds like a nice memory.
- I liked Errol Flynn.

1003
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:54,527
Errol Flynn. That's all?

1004
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:59,490
And I was glad she let me leave
the party early to watch the movie.

1005
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:02,327
She and I...
She and I loved that movie.

1006
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,246
It's like...

1007
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,916
It's like we were pals then
and we'd do things together.

1008
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,838
We'd look at the knight armor at the Met,
the scary fish at the Natural History Museum.

1009
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,466
I was always afraid
of the squid and the whale fighting.

1010
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:20,553
I could only look at it
with my hands in front of my face.

1011
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,141
When we'd get home, after my bath,

1012
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:28,603
she'd go through all the different things
we saw that day at the museum.

1013
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,522
And we'd get to the squid and the whale,

1014
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:33,858
and she'd describe it for me,

1015
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:39,655
which was still scary,
but it was less scary.

1016
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:43,743
Anyway, it was fun.
It was fun to hear about it.

1017
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:49,082
Did your dad live at home back then?

1018
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:50,666
Yeah. Why?

1019
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,960
You didn't mention him.

1020
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:55,129
Where was he during all of this?

1021
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,591
He was...

1022
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:04,472
I don't know exactly. He was...
He was downstairs maybe.

1023
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:09,394
He'd never come to the museum.
This was before my brother was born.

1024
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:11,312
It was before...

1025
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,690
It was earlier.

1026
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,905
- (door closes)
- Hello.

1027
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,787
Hello.

1028
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,752
- LILI: Not now, Bernard.
- BERNARD: Why not?

1029
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:37,505
Just not, okay?

1030
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:39,882
- Put me in your mouth.
- Walt!

1031
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,511
- Hi.
- Hey, Walt.

1032
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,515
- Hi.
- I'll be right out.

1033
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:51,185
We can, uh, hang out.

1034
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,782
(doorbell ringing)

1035
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:11,289
Hi. Is Walt here?

1036
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:12,999
No.

1037
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:16,085
Oh. I'd like you to come to my house.

1038
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:20,840
- Isn't it Mom's night?
- Yeah, but I'd like you to come over.

1039
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,343
Um, I have to put on my shoes.

1040
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:27,472
Come in, I guess.

1041
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,436
- (door closes)
- Place looks different.

1042
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,397
She got some new furniture in Maine.

1043
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:40,067
- That was my TV. I bought that TV.
- Uh-huh.

1044
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,075
That's my <i>Jude the Obscure.</i>

1045
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,161
- Want to take it?
- No.

1046
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,665
She still has some of the books you wrote.

1047
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:01,631
Dad, why are you taking me
to your house on Mom's night?

1048
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,429
Just a minute.

1049
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:10,139
(door opens)

1050
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,521
- Oh.
- Hi.

1051
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:19,440
Uh, Frank let me in.

1052
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,401
- I didn't realize you were here.
- I'm here. It's Monday.

1053
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:24,487
I'd like to take him for just tonight.

1054
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,698
I'll give you two Thursdays in a row
or something.

1055
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:30,076
- Mom.
- It's my night. He wants to stay.

1056
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,121
Be careful. That's an antique.

1057
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:39,794
- Where's Walt?
- I don't know where Walt is.

1058
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,963
He's not up there. Bernard!

1059
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:44,090
He doesn't come here.

1060
01:04:45,258 --> 01:04:47,385
You should go. You'll see him tomorrow.

1061
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:52,640
Tell Walt to call me.

1062
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,836

1074
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,084
I dunked my head in that pond in the park.

1075
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:05,171
The one near the zoo?
Oh, sweetie, that's filthy!

1076
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:08,549
- I hope you didn't drink any of it.
- Some may have gotten in my mouth.

1077
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,259
I tried not to swallow.

1078
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,349
I shouldn't have broken up with Sophie.

1079
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:21,020
- Why did you?
- I thought I could do better.

1080
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,232
Better how?

1081
01:06:26,442 --> 01:06:28,653
I don't know.

1082
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,073
That's good, you miss her.

1083
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,909
But I don't see myself
as a person who's in this situation.

1084
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,160
I just don't.

1085
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:40,039
I don't see myself this way.

1086
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:42,833
Well, this is how it is.

1087
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,294
Did you ever love Dad?

1088
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,546
'Cause if you didn't,
why did you ever marry him?

1089
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,633
If you were going to leave him,
why did you put us all through this?

1090
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:54,136
It wasn't planned.
When we first met, he was unlike anyone.

1091
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:58,140
In Columbus,
there was no one like your dad.

1092
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:01,268
I had had an affair with a man
before your father.

1093
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:04,313
He worked at the college bookstore.
We used to make love in the stockroom.

1094
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:07,441
Mom, I don't want to hear
about your affairs, please.

1095
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:10,778
I'm sorry.

1096
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,988
I don't know what I can say to you.

1097
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:16,075
You have a way of saying things
that are a way I don't want to hear them.

1098
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,910
I know, Chicken.

1099
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:20,996
It's something I do. It's a bad habit.

1100
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:25,835
Do you remember
when we watched <i>Robin Hood?</i>

1101
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,508
- He knocked on my window.
- Bernard, what are you doing?

1102
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:36,303
Joan, let me ask you something.
All that work I did at the end of our marriage —

1103
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:38,240
making dinners, cleaning up,
being more attentive.

1104
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:41,183
It never was gonna make a difference.
You were leaving no matter what.

1105
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:44,353
- You never made a dinner.
- I made burgers the time you had pneumonia.

1106
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,313
Only after I insisted.

1107
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:48,899
If I had made more dinners,
would that have made a difference?

1108
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:52,486
I was ready to leave a long time ago.
I just didn't know it then.

1109
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:56,282
I've been giving it some thought.
You called my father at the last minute.

1110
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:59,869
You said something. Whatever you said,
he thought I could save the marriage.

1111
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,204
You felt I wasn't aggressive enough.

1112
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:04,373
I'll make more of an effort to do stuff.

1113
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:06,584
I've been cooking
and doing chores at my house.

1114
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,961
I make veal cutlets, which the boys love.

1115
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:14,925
Why don't we all have dinner
and talk more about this?

1116
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:22,558
(laughing continues)

1117
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,980
I'm sorry.

1118
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:31,734
It's just... burgers.

1119
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:40,826
I'll sue you, Joan. You know I will.

1120
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:44,038
You had an affair for four years
with that fucking shrink

1121
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,081
that ruined our marriage,
and I can get the kids.

1122
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:50,419
I talked to Eddie Goodman,
who works on these cases all the time,
and I have an open-and-shut case.

1123
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:55,090
- Frank, Walt, get in the car!
- Sue me? That's... I can't...

1124
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:59,678
You only wanted joint custody
'cause you'd pay less child support that way.

1125
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:02,890
Because it's cheaper for you!

1126
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,434
- Walt, Frank!
- I don't want to go.

1127
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:08,479
I don't give a shit!
Frank, get in the car! Frank!

1128
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,774
- Hey, hey. Let him stay. Let him stay.
- I'm just asking this one thing.

1129
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:14,485
- Look, he wants to stay. Let him. I'll go.
- Fine.

1130
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:17,404
- (door opens)
- FRANK: Hold on.

1131
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:24,328
- You want him tonight?
- Okay.

1132
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,163
Thanks.

1133
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:28,249
That's all right, my brother.

1134
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:32,211
- (yowls)
- JOAN: The cat!

1135
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:37,633
I got him. Joan, I got him.

1136
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:41,554
- I got him!
- (meows)

1137
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:45,140
- (police radio chatter)
- Goddamn it!

1138
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,309
- (meows)
- Dad! Did you see him go?

1139
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:49,228
- I'm moving it!
- (horn honks)

1140
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,523
Fuck off. (panting)

1141
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:59,530
- IVAN: Whoa. Bernard!
- You all right?

1142
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,907
- I had him.
- Joan, call an ambulance!

1143
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:06,495
Walt, get in the car.

1144
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:11,250
(police radio chatter)

1145
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,389
<i>- Dégueulasse.</i>
- What?

1146
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:30,394
It means "bitch." Don't you remember?

1147
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,438
- You're calling me a bitch?
- No.

1148
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:35,858
Don't you remember the last line
of Godard's <i>À Bout de Souffle?</i>

1149
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,694
Belmondo calls Seberg a bitch.

1150
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:41,822
<i>Dégueulasse.</i>

1151
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:45,743
We saw it at the Thalia with the Dicksteins.
I got you in for the children's price.

1152
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:47,661
You were pregnant with Walt.

1153
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:52,499
- Like six weeks.
- I still got you in for a children's ticket.

1154
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:54,710
You told me you didn't like Godard.

1155
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,046
You thought the jump cuts were —

1156
01:10:57,129 --> 01:11:01,091
I'd check for the cat behind the ash cans
under the Golodner's stoop!

1157
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:02,259
Okay.

1158
01:11:04,762 --> 01:11:08,098
(doors closing)

1159
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:09,934
(siren wailing)

1160
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:12,770
I didn't write it.

1161
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:16,315
- I know.
- Pink Floyd did.

1162
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:19,735
Do you think we'll find him?

1163
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:21,737
I hope so.

1164
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:26,325
Do you think one day
we could go to the Galápagos?

1165
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,120
I don't know, Pickle.

1166
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:35,334
Ivan and I could take you to the country
on Saturday to see some real turtles.

1167
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:42,341
Saturday's Dad's day.

1168
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:48,430
- There's my son.
- Hey.

1169
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,266
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1170
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:55,187
Thought it was a heart attack,
but... I think I'm just exhausted.

1171
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,731
Doctor said I'm exhausted.

1172
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:00,651
- Too many veal cutlets?
- (chuckles) Maybe.

1173
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:04,238
Is that a good book?

1174
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,490
Oh, this is pulp. It's not serious.

1175
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,826
It's hard to read a good book
in the hospital.

1176
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,744
But this isn't bad of its kind.

1177
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:13,831
Leonard is the fillet of the crime genre.

1178
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:20,254
I'd like you to stay here for the day.
I need the company.

1179
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,007
Okay.

1180
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:25,968
Lili moved out.

1181
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:33,392
Do me a favor.
Go out in the hall, get me another pillow.

1182
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,102
My neck is hurting.

1183
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:47,614
Maybe we could even things out a bit
and I could stay at Mom's a few extra nights

1184
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:49,175
'cause I've been staying more at yours.

1185
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,453
It's not a good time. I'm not going
to be a hundred percent for a while.

1186
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:55,622
- I'd like you around.
- I don't think I want to come for a while.

1187
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:58,459
It's not up to you, Walt.
You're a minor. You're in my custody.

1188
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,169
My home is your home too.

1189
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,631
I'm not coming.

1190
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:06,258
Why?

1191
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:09,178
That hurts my feelings.

1192
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:15,392
Don't be difficult.

1193
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:19,104
If you like, we can get you some more posters,
make your room better.

1194
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:20,731
Paint it a different color.

1195
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:30,699
(crying)

1196
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:34,578
I can lend you my first edition
of <i>The Naked and the Dead.</i>

1197
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,580
As a present.

1198
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,416
Let me get you a pillow.

1199
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:56,892
You used to be very emotional
when you were younger.

1200
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:06,485
Did I look pretty silly out there,
falling on the concrete?

1201
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:10,364
- Yeah.
- (laughing)

1202
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,699
What? What are you laughing at?

1203
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:14,868
That was funny how you said, "Yeah."

1204
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:17,663
- Good comic timing.
- Thanks.

1205
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,460
Why don't we get some breakfast?

1206
01:14:23,544 --> 01:14:25,963
See if you can find a nurse out there.

1207
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:31,927
Try to get the blonde.
She looks like a young Monica Vitti.

1208
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:34,555
Excuse me.

1209
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:37,182
The man in that room
wants to order some breakfast.

1210
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:38,767
Okay.
