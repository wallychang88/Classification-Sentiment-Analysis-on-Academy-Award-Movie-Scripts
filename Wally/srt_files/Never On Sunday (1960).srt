1
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,140
There's Illia.
- Hello, Illia.

2
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,359
You're lucky. Your first day here,
you see one of our legends.

3
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,459
Who is she?
- A whore.

4
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,359
But she makes no prices,
and only goes with you if she likes you.

5
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,600
There are those who work
and those who swim.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,355
If you weren't a slave, you'd come in, too.

7
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,899
Here I come.

8
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,640
A Greek is a Greek
because he'll accept any dare.

9
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,395
There's a man. You up there are all slaves.

10
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,119
Hey, Captain...

11
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,420
...that one next to you,
he's a man or a mouse?

12
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,060
Beg your pardon.

13
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,120
Illia, this is Tonio.
He's from Corfu. He's half ltalian.

14
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,639
We won't hold that against him.

15
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,819
I'm told you pick and choose.
Do I have a chance?

16
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Maybe.
- Tonight? 9:00?

17
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,700
At 9:00, the baker.

18
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,200
10:00?
- Sorry. 10:00, the fruit man.

19
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,034
And the butcher?
- At 11:00.

20
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,034
ls she kidding me?
- Oh, no.

21
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,871
Her life is perfectly organized.

22
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:11,480
She has arrangements
with all those clients.

23
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,255
You like boat rides?
- Anything you say, my little bird.

24
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,659
Let's go.

25
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,280
Where is the American? The intellectual?
He should see this. Call Mr. Thrace.

26
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,000
Mr. Thrace, they are calling you.
There is something amusing down there.

27
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,899
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

28
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,060
There is the purity that was Greece.

29
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Play, Taki. Play and never stop.

30
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,359
Pretty?

31
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,459
Yes.

32
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,614
Thank you very much. Thank you.

33
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Please?

34
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,759
Here's a man who wants to pass.
- Thank you.

35
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,324
Good evening.
- How do you do?

36
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:09,460
Good night.
- Good evening.

37
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,880
How did you know I was American?
- What you take?

38
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,980
Coffee, please.

39
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,295
American coffee?
- Greek coffee.

40
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,360
Waiter....

41
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,350
What is everybody drinking?
- Ouzo.

42
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Is what men drink.

43
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,859
What are you looking at, friend?

44
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
I beg your pardon.

45
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,259
Thank you.

46
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,119
What are you applauding for?

47
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,599
You're making a mistake.
Your dance was beautiful.

48
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,959
If you threw money,
there'd have been a massacre.

49
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,800
Why are you angry? I was applauding.

50
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,999
You'd better go to a fancy cabaret,
or your mother will wear black.

51
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,959
I don't like to be shaken.

52
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,099
I know you're big.

53
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,979
You're going to make me hit you.

54
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,139
Please. I don't want to fight with you.

55
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,230
I came here with love. I love you.

56
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,889
I love you, and I'm fighting with you.

57
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,429
Doesn't anyone here speak English?

58
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,119
I do.
- lllia.

59
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,460
I speak English.

60
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,759
I was dancing, bothering no one...

61
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,759
...and he applauds me as
if I were a ballerina.

62
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,240
Would you please explain to him
that I loved his dance. I was applauding.

63
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,760
Careful, he's a brute.

64
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,420
Jorgo, he's an angel.

65
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,580
My most old client.

66
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,960
I was enjoying, bothering no one--
- Shut up, now.

67
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,359
Jorgo is angry because
you have applauded.

68
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,920
In Greece, when a man dances,
it's for himself.

69
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,519
It makes him feel better in his....
How you say in English?

70
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,740
Soul.
- That's it.

71
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,680
It is for his soul.

72
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,799
He is angry
because you think he is an entertainer.

73
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,599
Come on, Jorgaki.
He applauded because he liked your dance.

74
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,674
Shake hands and be friends.
- Go on.

75
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:52,080
All right, boys, back to your tables.

76
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,475
Go on. Go enjoy yourselves.

77
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,039
Would you please tell him
that I'm sorry about his nose.

78
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,160
He's sorry he punched you in the nose.
- Wait till he sees his eye tomorrow.

79
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,640
He says,
'Wait to see tomorrow morning your eye.'

80
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,920
I thought so.
Please have a drink with me. You too, sir.

81
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Okay.
- This is lllia.

82
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,840
My name is Armathis.
- Everybody calls him Captain.

83
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm very happy to meet you both,
and at the right moment.

84
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,760
My name is Homer Thrace.
- Homer?

85
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,559
My father loved everything Greek.
- A Grecophile.

86
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,519
How well you speak English.
- Eight years in Brooklyn.

87
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,159
Brooklyn? You're kidding.
- The Navy Yard.

88
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,560
Now I work in the yard here, in Piraeus.

89
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,360
Beer.
- Two beers.

90
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,020
I would like three bires.

91
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,385
You are rich?
- No, I'm very poor.

92
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Hey, you are a writer?

93
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,080
I was just making some notes.
- What you are?

94
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,144
Well, I'm an amateur philosopher.

95
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:52,999
You stay long in Greece?

96
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:56,559
Maybe. I'm looking for something in Greece.

97
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,359
What?

98
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,400
You won't laugh?
- Why? You look for something funny?

99
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I came to Greece...

100
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,059
...to find the truth.

101
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,159
Our world is unhappy.
Why? Where did it begin to go wrong?

102
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,724
Might not the traces be here?

103
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,800
No society ever reached the heights
that were attained by ancient Greece.

104
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,479
It was the cradle of culture.
It was a happy country.

105
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,459
What happened? What made it fall?

106
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,640
Historians don't satisfy me. Wars, politics....

107
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,140
Something's missing, something personal.

108
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,410
I want to walk where Aristotle walked.

109
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,380
Socrates.... I can't explain it.

110
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:44,280
I don't know.
I have a feeling I'll find something.

111
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,479
In the camera you look more beautiful.

112
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,619
Your nose is not so big.

113
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,119
Thank you.

114
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:57,319
It's certain that the old philosophers
often walked around this port.

115
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,839
How thrilling.

116
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:03,720
Why, that means that Aristotle
might have stood on this very spot.

117
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,840
Yes.

118
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,360
Did you ever think of that, lllia?
- Every day.

119
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,440
I don't think lllia
would have much sympathy for Aristotle.

120
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,790
His opinion of women was rather low.
- He was sick.

121
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Aristotle, sick?

122
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:23,639
Your eye begins to be pink.
I go to see my friend's nose now.

123
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,719
Very glad to meet you, Homer.
- Likewise.

124
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,079
You're very pretty.

125
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,984
Homer. Bye, Captain.
- Bye, lllia.

126
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,619
Light of my eyes.
- Who can dance like lllia?

127
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,319
The little fellow beat you up?

128
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,499
If I'd really hit him,
they'd close up the place.

129
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,440
Hello, sister. So you are lllia.
- Hello, brother. I am lllia.

130
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,920
Are you busy?
- I don't know.

131
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,939
All right, how much?

132
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,819
I make no prices.

133
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,654
60 drachmas?
- I'll give you 80.

134
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,039
60 drachmas will be fine.

135
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,519
I offered 80.
- I don't care if you offered 180.

136
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,799
Why?
- Because I don't like you.

137
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:19,124
I don't make it a condition that you like me.
- I make it a condition that I like you.

138
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,899
ls she....
- She is.

139
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,639
How is it possible?

140
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:32,219
That lovely, gracious....

141
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,474
Captain, maybe that's what I'm looking for.

142
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,280
What luck.

143
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,039
Illia.

144
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,139
The symbol of my quest.

145
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
The personification.

146
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,230
In her, the answer to the mystery.

147
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:56,834
The personal equation
of the fall of ancient Greece.

148
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,079
Sorry, miss. I'm terribly sorry.

149
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,920
It's not that you.... I think you're beautiful.

150
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,845
And I liked so much
what you did in that cafe.

151
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,420
I wanted so much to be with you.

152
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
But, I don't know.

153
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,139
I'm nervous.

154
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,579
And you are very nice.

155
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
If you don't mind...

156
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,260
I'll just go now.
- I don't mind.

157
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,215
But first we smoke a cigarette.

158
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,475
You give me English cigarette, yes?

159
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,379
Of course.

160
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Do you like music?

161
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,500
This is Greek. Bouzouki music.

162
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Men like this music.

163
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,620
You like?
- Yes...

164
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,720
...and I like you.

165
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,200
When your boat goes away?
- Tomorrow.

166
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,800
You will come back to Piraeus sometime?

167
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,360
I don't know. Maybe.
- Then you come to see me.

168
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,095
I certainly will. The first....

169
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,645
The words of this song are beautiful.

170
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,989
'With such a moon, how can I sing?

171
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,434
'With such a moon,
how make away my sadness?

172
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,120
'Chase away your sadness, palikari.'

173
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,299
'Palikari' is a strong young man.

174
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,420
'And together we go the moon.'

175
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,799
Homer.

176
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:02,160
The Captain told me where you lived.
- I was sleeping. It's too late.

177
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm so excited.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,959
You are the beauty that was Greece.

179
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:14,414
You are the reason I came to Greece.
- All right, come tomorrow.

180
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,820
Homer Thrace of Middletown, Connecticut.

181
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
This may be important.

182
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,780
Think clearly.

183
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,899
See clearly.

184
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,619
Be prepared.

185
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,219
Let's go.

186
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,680
What's your hurry?
- You've got to go back to work.

187
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,370
Thanks for worrying about me.
- Let's not be nasty now.

188
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,119
I don't like you to look at your watch.
- Why not?

189
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,939
Because when we are together....

190
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,679
Bravo.

191
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,560
Usually when a man is ridiculous,
he doesn't know it.

192
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,900
But when he falls on his behind,
he knows it.

193
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,200
Of all people,
the ltalians are the most impulsive.

194
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,500
And my family...

195
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,000
...is the most ltalian of them all.

196
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,350
But you're half Greek.
- With you I am all ltalian.

197
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:43,639
My father came to Corfu for one day.
A baptism.

198
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,159
He took one look at Corfu and said,
'This is for me.'

199
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,079
He never went back to ltaly.

200
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,409
I had an aunt. She went to the movies.

201
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,299
Rudolph Valentino.

202
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,320
She took one look at him and said,
'That's the man for me.'

203
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,480
She never looked at another man.
She died an old maid.

204
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,620
I have the same blood.

205
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,079
I was going to tell you that I like you.
I feel good with you.

206
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,519
That I want you only for me,
that I don't want you to see other men.

207
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,160
Then you fell on your behind.
- I don't like to be laughed at.

208
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,880
I like you. But if you hurt me,
I'll hit you on the head.

209
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,180
I'd bet you would.
- You'd win.

210
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:27,380
Then I let go.
- Now we understand each other.

211
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:31,434
lllia....
- That Sunday voice again.

212
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,899
All right. Let's go.

213
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Where are you going?

214
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,879
None of your business.
- I was just being friendly.

215
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:53,634
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.

216
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,400
Listen, tomorrow is Sunday.
- I invite you to my house every Sunday.

217
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,560
We'll have the whole day.
- Let me finish.

218
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,825
Every Sunday is open house
for my special friends.

219
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,215
And tomorrow is not an ordinary Sunday.

220
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,539
It's my birthday.

221
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,160
I've been looking everywhere.

222
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,119
Homer.

223
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:24,534
That's my friend Tonio.
- How do you do?

224
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,640
How do you do?

225
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,300
You hurt your eye.
- You speak English.

226
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,280
I studied with record, two months.

227
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,480
I invite you both
to my open house tomorrow.

228
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,200
The day after--
- No, the day after begins the festival.

229
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,440
What festival?

230
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,480
Theater. The Greek
tragedy. I go every night.

231
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,359
You like the Greek tragedies?

232
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,160
It's the most beautiful thing there is.

233
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
I die.

234
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,560
Bye.

235
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,020
Extraordinary.

236
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
How do you do?

237
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,879
You're a heathen.

238
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:08,579
Your grandfather, your father...

239
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,820
...you, and the children to come.

240
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:25,120
Do I have to put on a skirt for you to stop?

241
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,739
Even then you wouldn't.

242
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:32,489
Because you are a mule.
Take this so I owe you nothing.

243
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,119
You love the ancient Greek theater.

244
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,159
Are you follow me?
- I can't get over it.

245
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:45,160
Are you follow me?
- Yes.

246
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,399
I don't like that you follow me.

247
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,839
If you like the Greek tragedy,
you like me. I mean....

248
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:53,560
I know every one
that was ever written. Almost.

249
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,280
I like you very much.

250
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,440
Then may I ask you a question?
- Ask.

251
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,699
How did you become a....

252
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,920
How did you get into your profession?
- One moment.

253
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,680
The only clients
that I permit to ask such questions--...

254
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm not a client.
- That's right, you are not.

255
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,079
You would have big problems
with your morals.

256
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:15,360
Also, your nose is too big.

257
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,585
That's a deal, no client.

258
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,400
How did you become a....

259
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,559
University boys,
I permit to ask me such questions.

260
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:29,840
We smoke cigarettes,
I make up for them sad stories.

261
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,020
They give me advices,
and all that is very sweet.

262
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:36,679
But they are University boys.

263
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,860
Not old boy scout...

264
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,240
...with dirty eye.

265
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,359
I guess I deserved that.
I embarrassed you. I'm sorry.

266
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:46,459
You? Me?

267
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,479
Say, that's French, isn't it?
- Yes.

268
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,579
It means don't be jerk.

269
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,739
French, English, Greek.

270
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,225
ltalian, a little Spanish.
- That's extraordinary.

271
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,744
Where did you learn all those languages?
- ln bed.

272
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,499
So long.

273
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:19,899
Hello, lllia.

274
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:25,334
You live a good life.
Fresh air. You make music.

275
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
People give you money.

276
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,060
Thank you. Goodbye.

277
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:32,979
Hey. Why you follow me?

278
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,240
Because I want you to stop being....
- Why?

279
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,479
Because you are the whole world.
Beautiful and corrupt.

280
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,579
You are very crazy.

281
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,840
Good day, lllia.
- Go away, Garbage.

282
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,800
You know who's in that car?

283
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,215
It's the boss. He wants to talk to you.

284
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,899
Don't say I said so.

285
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,679
I think he'd give you an apartment
at half price.

286
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,779
Tell him to drop dead.

287
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:06,809
No one has ever seen the boss's face.
He will reveal it to you.

288
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,424
I don't have to see his face.
I can spit anywhere.

289
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,259
You looking for a scar?

290
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,595
ls he being disagreeable?
- He's just an errand boy.

291
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,465
Homer, you are wonderful.

292
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,964
Who's the man in the big car?

293
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,439
He owns all a street of apartments.

294
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,039
All the girls in the profession
live in these apartments.

295
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:45,240
He oblige them to pay enormous rents.
- All the girls?

296
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,280
Except lllia, and he doesn't like that.

297
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,400
Why?

298
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,639
Because I am an independent.

299
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,600
It gives the other girls ideas.

300
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,379
Good day.
- Good day.

301
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Goodbye, Homer.

302
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,199
Something is very funny.
Mr.'No Face' and you.

303
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,699
You both want to put me out of business.

304
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:11,739
What will you have, sir?

305
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,080
Ouzo.

306
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Order one ouzo.

307
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,880
Happy birthday, and a hundred more.

308
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,000
Thank you.

309
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,000
All this just for me?
- Strange, it's the first Sunday that....

310
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,560
We're going to have a fight.
- Why?

311
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,165
Nobody's coming.
I told them you called off the party.

312
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,455
And the reason?
- Because I want you for myself.

313
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,979
Out.
- Make me get out.

314
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,179
Out. How dare you send my friends away?

315
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,099
I told you. No other man.

316
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,859
No other you.
Not if you were the last man in Piraeus.

317
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,179
I am the last man.

318
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,739
The best man, the handsomest man...

319
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
...and the strongest.

320
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,819
Happy birthday. Many happy returns.

321
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,859
Darlings.

322
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,219
A hundred more, lllia.

323
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,210
You've been invited to lllia's open house?
That makes you very special.

324
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,740
I'm gonna report her.

325
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:15,739
Now we can eat.

326
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,799
Garbage forgot something.

327
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,899
For me?
- No.

328
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,680
Health, lllia.
- Health, little bird.

329
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,300
You know, I could have seen the boss's
face.

330
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:44,479
You should have.

331
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:49,399
He's the marble merchant.
- Moron. He's the insurance broker.

332
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,960
If you really want to know who he is....

333
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,339
Whoever he is, he stinks.

334
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,920
Illia, I wanted--

335
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,920
Is the American going to give you
the flowers or keep them?

336
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,505
This vice king.... Might he not hurt you?

337
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,179
He thinks that No Face would hurt lllia.

338
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:09,559
No, she has too many friends.

339
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,800
They would tear his house down.
- Brick by brick.

340
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,840
Yet, I think I'll have a look at No Face
after the festival.

341
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,920
Good idea.

342
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,485
You want to see my new dress?

343
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:24,254
lllia, what's playing tomorrow?
- Medea.

344
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,160
lllia, how many times have you seen it?
- Fifteen.

345
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,759
That's extraordinary.

346
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:33,439
Especially when she has no idea
of what the play is about.

347
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,120
Whatever in the play is unpleasant,
she changes.

348
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,839
How?
- ln her head.

349
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,319
She just rejects anything that to her is ugly.

350
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,419
You like my dress?

351
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,019
Listen to me, Homer.

352
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:50,479
If you promise not to interrupt,
I'll get her to tell the story of Medea...

353
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,879
...as lllia sees it. But you....
- I promise.

354
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,979
All right, go sit down.

355
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,559
Listen, I know how much you like
to hear lllia tell the stories...

356
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:04,480
...of the ancient tragedies--
- I'm ready.

357
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,439
Today, in honor of our American friend...

358
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,959
Illia is going to tell
the story of Medea in English.

359
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:15,020
English is impossible.
- Please.

360
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,220
Is not possible.

361
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,779
Okay.

362
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:38,839
Medea is a beautiful play,
but for you men, is not much compliments.

363
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:43,019
The play is about
what a woman suffers for a man.

364
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,959
Once upon a time,
there was a princess from far away.

365
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,119
Her name is Medea.
- That's the best one.

366
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,420
Beautiful, long black hair.

367
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,720
A Greek, he comes.
And right away, Medea crazy for him.

368
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,880
She will listen to nobody. She wants him.

369
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,805
She fights with her father,
her whole country.

370
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:11,479
Medea was very sweet,
but sometimes she has a bad temper.

371
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:15,639
Sweet? She was a vicious character.
She was a murderess.

372
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:19,359
Anyhow, she goes to Greece
to marry this man.

373
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,920
He is a prince.

374
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,699
His name is Jason.

375
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,079
She is good to him.
She gives him two beautiful children.

376
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:31,179
But he....

377
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,600
Right away,
with a blonde princess in Athens....

378
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
You know what.

379
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,600
This Jason is not even a gentleman
to tell Medea lies. No.

380
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,440
He says right to her face
that he wants that other blonde...

381
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,279
...because she is a princess.

382
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:51,459
And Medea cries and says,
'l am a princess, too.'

383
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,624
Beautiful, how she cries.

384
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,600
Everything she does for Jason.
Even she gives presents to the blonde.

385
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,240
She sends gifts that were poisoned.

386
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,740
But everybody says bad things about her.

387
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,820
They say she is a witch.

388
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,359
There are 12 rich ladies
in beautiful dresses.

389
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:13,000
But they say bad things about her, too.

390
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,245
Twelve rich ladies? The Greek chorus?

391
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:18,339
And Medea cries.

392
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,630
I tell you, she breaks your heart.

393
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,000
She is afraid.

394
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,670
She takes the children and she hides them.

395
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,539
But in the end,
Jason sees how much Medea loves him...

396
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,360
...and they get a wonderful chariot.

397
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,720
And she gets the children...

398
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,080
...and they all go to the seashore.

399
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,640
No. The Greek tragedy.
She gives it a happy ending.

400
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,919
She doesn't say Medea killed her children.
- She changed that, too.

401
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,479
Illia's happy. She worked out a way
of living. Let her alone.

402
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:54,129
I make mistakes in my English?

403
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,500
Not at all.

404
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,080
Sometime I'd like to hear
you tell Oedipus Rex.

405
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,159
I don't like this story. Is very mean.
One thing is very nice.

406
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,680
Always Oedipus is
talking about his mother.

407
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,120
I never saw such a good son
who loves so much his mother.

408
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,385
All right. I tell to my friends now
Oedipus Rex...

409
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,079
...in Greek.

410
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,999
In Greek?

411
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,960
Once upon a time,
there was a Prince from Thebes.

412
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,879
It's impossible. A whore can't be happy.
A whorish world can't be happy.

413
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:28,720
I'd like to reach her mind.

414
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,159
What do you want to put in her mind?

415
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,639
Reason, in place of fantasy.

416
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:36,539
Morality, instead of immorality.

417
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,339
I've got to educate her.

418
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,679
To transform her.

419
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:46,239
Remember what happened to Pygmalion.
- I wouldn't make that mistake.

420
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:47,800
Illia is lovely.

421
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,800
But for me, she's not a woman,
she's an idea.

422
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
She's an outlaw. Yes.

423
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:55,799
Law must be re-established everywhere.
Don't you see, Captain?

424
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,200
I see you'll have black eyes all your life.

425
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,560
...but let's forget all those bad things.

426
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,460
They hurt his eyes, the poor thing.

427
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:09,020
But in the end he finds his family...

428
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,860
...and they all go to the seashore.

429
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,475
'And they all go to the seashore'?
- They always go to the seashore.

430
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:49,929
Boris, Greece is capitalist country, no?
- Yes.

431
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,360
So how in capitalist country
they close up business to go to the theater?

432
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,359
This is explained in a chapter...

433
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:02,454
...of Karl Marx's
Contradictions In Capitalism.

434
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,935
There is lllia's bus to Athens.

435
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,400
Illia. Who is she? Joan of Arc?

436
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,840
She's got courage,
which some of us do not have.

437
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,079
She's doing fine.
What does she care about us?

438
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:19,199
She's got heart, which some of us don't.

439
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,660
Hello. What are you doing here, girls?

440
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,599
We're looking for husbands.

441
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:28,099
And I thought you came to talk to lllia.

442
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,639
It's a democracy, no?

443
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:33,759
We don't like you to associate with lllia.

444
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:35,859
She's a bad influence.

445
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,774
Hello, slaves. Hello, Garbage.
Careful, the garbage man.

446
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:53,259
lllia.
- Not today.

447
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,935
Adonis.
- I brought you some sandwiches.

448
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:04,660
Have a good time.

449
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,619
Kiss Medea for me.

450
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,720
Good trip.

451
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,740
Are you courting me?
- Seriously.

452
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,080
Something else for you.

453
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,520
The stone seats in the theater are hard.

454
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,340
I'll sit on it and think of you.

455
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,719
Homer. Where are you going?
- With you, if you don't mind.

456
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:35,519
Wonderful.
- I want us to see Medea together.

457
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,619
That's nice.

458
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,340
All right, girls. Let's go.

459
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
I had a dream.

460
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,055
I married a man. He had a little money.

461
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,740
He was 94 years old.

462
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
What a relief.

463
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,319
Why are we running? We're early.
We're the first ones here.

464
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:06,904
If I'm not the first one here, I am late.

465
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:33,760
But I tell you that Medea killed her children.
- Homer, don't be stupid.

466
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
But it's easy to....

467
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
She killed them.

468
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,399
Medea herself, does she not say,
'l killed my children'?

469
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:57,499
And you believe her?

470
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,000
You don't understand the women.

471
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,720
Medea loves her husband, yes?
- Yes.

472
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,080
Her husband is interested
in another woman?

473
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,239
Yes?
- Yes.

474
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:12,279
So she said to her husband
that she has killed her children...

475
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:14,800
...to frighten him, to get him back.

476
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,079
No.
- Yes.

477
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,999
She gets him back,
and everybody go away...

478
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,119
...and everybody is happy
and they go to the seashore. And that's all.

479
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:27,239
If I show you that everything
that was ever written about Medea...

480
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:29,040
...talks of her killing her children....

481
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,640
If you ask 10 out of 10 people
who saw the play...

482
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,520
...and they tell you it's true,
then by simple logic....

483
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,720
You're a Greek, you should be logical.
- Why?

484
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,479
Because the greatest Greek of them all,
Aristotle, invented logic.

485
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:42,680
He said--
- Who?

486
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Aristotle--
- Aristotle.

487
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,574
The one that the Captain said thinks...

488
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,479
...men are everything
and women are nothing?

489
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,280
I don't care what he said, Aristotle.

490
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,960
Look around you, lllia.

491
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,970
Greek art was the most harmonious
in the world.

492
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,219
What happened?

493
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:03,339
What happened to you?

494
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,700
All evil is disharmony.

495
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,720
You are in disharmony with yourself.

496
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,660
You have beauty, grace...

497
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,760
...and you are....

498
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,199
I, American boy scout,
will bring you back to harmony.

499
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:24,760
Bring me back to Piraeus.
I want to go to sleep.

500
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,345
I'm fighting for your soul. Listen to me.

501
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,760
You make me unhappy.

502
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,079
If what you say
about the Greek tragedy is true...

503
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:36,039
I don't like the Greek tragedy.
- lf you would only....

504
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,439
And I don't like you...

505
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:42,979
...because before I met you,
I was crazy about the Greek tragedy.

506
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,744
Is lllia coming for a swim today?

507
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,700
Good day, Captain.

508
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,799
Hello, ladies. How are you, Despo?

509
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:15,534
Terrible. Is lllia around?
- No.

510
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,360
Hello, Captain. Did you see lllia today?

511
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,639
Who is not looking for lllia, today?

512
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,679
Mr. Thrace, this is Despo, a friend of lllia's.

513
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:34,020
Mr. Thrace is a writer.

514
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:36,700
How do you do, darling?

515
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,959
You are friend of lllia. Tell her to help us.

516
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,319
Only for her the girls have respect.

517
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,520
If lllia talks to them, they will listen.

518
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,240
Talk about what?
- lllia can make all the girls say no.

519
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,910
Then he would make
rents not so expensive.

520
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,820
Who?
- Mr. No Face.

521
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,479
Please.

522
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,660
Darling, you are a writer.

523
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,140
You write this in the newspaper?

524
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:06,280
What?

525
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,845
180 drachmas we pay for rent.

526
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,880
And if a girl try to move out...

527
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,359
No Face make it
you don't move in anywhere else.

528
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:19,140
You write this in the newspaper?

529
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,420
Yes?

530
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,880
I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, darling.

531
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,840
Captain, please tell lllia I was here.

532
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
Yes, Despo.
- Bye.

533
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,440
There is some more research for you.

534
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,080
Yes.

535
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,719
Captain, did you see lllia today?

536
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,639
Early this morning, briefly.

537
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:42,459
She was not in a very good mood.

538
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,340
Hello, my weakness.

539
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,365
The most beautiful knee in Piraeus.
- Leave me alone. Bring me a beer.

540
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,359
What's wrong?
Did Piraeus lose the soccer game?

541
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:59,499
I offer you my very own.

542
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:05,500
Hello, Captain, all.

543
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
No coffee.

544
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,199
Stay far from me.
- lf you'll just--

545
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:19,124
If you come,
I break that bottle on your head.

546
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,080
She would, too, wouldn't she?
- Come, let's have a drink.

547
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,180
When she gets mad...

548
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,620
...she certainly lights up, doesn't she?

549
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,960
He's improvising.
He's from Crete. They're good at it.

550
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,080
Two ouzo.

551
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,419
Illia has fire in eye

552
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,740
There is thunder in her hand

553
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,899
Don't look

554
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,599
Don't look at her

555
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:56,900
Or you will be struck blind...

556
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,919
What?
- 'lllia has fire in her eyes.

557
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:02,419
'Don't look at her or she'll blind you.'

558
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,780
Look darkly at all men

559
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:20,780
Give poison to them all

560
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,300
Refuse yourself to all men

561
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,860
Except your sweet...

562
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,059
...sweet Jorgaki...

563
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,995
'She says no to everyone,
except her sweet Jorgaki.'

564
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,619
I can't stand honest women

565
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:54,660
If ever I took a wife

566
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,540
I would want...

567
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,540
...the beautiful...

568
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,400
...the doll...

569
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,819
...the miraculous

570
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:13,420
Illiaki...

571
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,519
'For him, no honest, no good women.'

572
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:22,889
What does that mean?
- Whenever he wanted love, he paid for it.

573
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,290
Bravo. You brought back lllia's smile.

574
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,860
Taki, God bless your hands.

575
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:35,759
Now that you feel better, may I join you?

576
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,240
You, go.

577
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,520
I want to help you. I'm your friend.
- Don't help me. Be an enemy.

578
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,510
Why? Because I told you the truth?

579
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:48,279
If you don't go away, I'll call Jorgo
and he'll make you another dirty eye.

580
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,879
Call him. I can tell him something.

581
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,599
His song was charming,
but most revealing.

582
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:55,600
The truth can free him, too.

583
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,600
Don't free him.
- He's a man with a deep problem.

584
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,680
Again, problems?

585
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes, all his life he has associated
only with a certain kind of woman.

586
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,279
Know why?
- He likes--

587
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,759
No. The real reason is
that he hates all women.

588
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,639
Jorgaki?

589
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:10,999
Jorgaki.

590
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,120
And I've no doubt where that stems from.

591
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,515
It's elementary psychiatry.

592
00:48:15,939 --> 00:48:17,939
He hated his mother.

593
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,400
That's true?

594
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
You want tell him that?

595
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:26,259
It might help him.

596
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,639
You are right.

597
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,949
I think you must tell him.

598
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,479
Jorgaki...

599
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,359
...come here, my little bird.

600
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:35,459
Pull up a chair.

601
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,195
Our friend, who is very educated...

602
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,480
...has studied you.

603
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,580
Go on, Homer.

604
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,849
All your life, you have known only....

605
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,380
No other women.

606
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,620
Tell him why, Homer.

607
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,700
There's a profound inner reason.

608
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:10,034
By having relations
only with such women...

609
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:14,469
...you are obeying an irresistible need...

610
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,419
...to degrade all women.

611
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,625
A subconscious revenge
against all women.

612
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:29,840
Where does it come from?

613
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Why?

614
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,780
You hated...

615
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:38,699
...your mother.

616
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,620
Hold your hats.

617
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
Again.

618
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
You heard him.

619
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:55,420
He said I hated my mother.

620
00:49:57,979 --> 00:49:59,979
Let him come.

621
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:02,184
He's a sucker for a left.

622
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:08,509
I don't know what he's saying,
but I don't like it.

623
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,059
Give him harmony.

624
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,080
What are you doing?

625
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,320
One moment.

626
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,970
Let me cut his throat, please.

627
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,339
And don't catch cold.

628
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:29,619
Thank you.

629
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:40,739
My mother. I put her on a throne.

630
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:44,044
'Little Madonna,' I used to call her.

631
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,615
Why are you crying? You were a warrior.

632
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:36,859
Homer, go home.

633
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:40,280
I will.

634
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,380
You're barbarians.

635
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,755
You don't need a philosopher,
you need a missionary.

636
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,060
I'm leaving.

637
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,300
Bye-bye, Homer.

638
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
Bye-bye.

639
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:29,679
I'm sorry you're going home.

640
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,180
Why?
- Because it's a defeat.

641
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,380
For you and for me, too.

642
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,975
Have we met?
- You may call me Mr. Face.

643
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,780
I'm in real estate.

644
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,619
Mr. Face?

645
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,880
And are your houses let only to girls?
- Yes.

646
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,999
I have a proposition to make.
May I sit down?

647
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:53,099
Sure.

648
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:55,519
You needn't run away.

649
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,119
I, too, exist in the scheme of things.

650
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,400
You can't ignore me.

651
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,320
I don't have to do business with you.
- Of course you do...

652
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,399
...and I'll tell you why.
- Why?

653
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:08,020
We both would like lllia to retire.

654
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:11,640
Of course, for entirely different reasons.

655
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,600
You can have an influence on her. I cannot.

656
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,040
So I have my reasons to offer you help,
and you to accept.

657
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,140
Accept what?

658
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,060
Money.

659
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,789
You think you can buy lllia?
- No, I've tried that.

660
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,800
Me?
- The money will be for lllia's time...

661
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,900
...and her education.

662
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,600
I'll be damned.

663
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,319
If you prove to her
that your way of life is better than hers...

664
00:53:40,419 --> 00:53:41,520
...she'll admit it...

665
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,280
...and you'll have won.
- And you.

666
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,440
That's a secondary matter, isn't it?

667
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,200
For you, there is only one question:

668
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,079
are you more interested
that I should make no profits...

669
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:57,089
...or are you more interested in saving lllia?

670
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,499
I hate your guts.

671
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,740
But I'm more interested in saving lllia.

672
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,260
What a wonderful song.

673
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,360
Lend me 200 drachmas?
- No.

674
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,560
Why?
- I have only 50 drachmas.

675
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,380
I am missing 200 drachmas.
- Why?

676
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,359
Understand? For our boat tickets.

677
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:44,459
Where are we going?

678
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,639
Italy, of course.

679
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:50,439
What do we do in ltaly?

680
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:53,080
We eat spaghetti and we make love.

681
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,779
We see Napoli, we make love.

682
00:54:56,299 --> 00:54:58,299
We make tourism...

683
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,039
...we make love.

684
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:03,284
We say, 'Good morning,' we make love.

685
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:05,739
You like that?
- Yes.

686
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,220
We go?
- No.

687
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,020
Someday we will...

688
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,640
...because everything you do pleases me.

689
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,039
The way you rinse that thing...

690
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:20,139
...pleases me.

691
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,000
The way you walk pleases me.

692
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,350
The way you hang it up pleases me.

693
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:34,359
The way I put out the light pleases you?
- Yes, that pleases me, too.

694
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:38,029
The way your shoulder fits into my hand...

695
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,780
...pleases me.

696
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,979
The way your body goes with mine
pleases me.

697
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:06,984
lllia--
- That Sunday voice again?

698
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,920
Someday, we'll talk about love.

699
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,419
Forbidden. Verboten.

700
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,024
You don't let me talk about love.

701
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,660
You take my tongue away.

702
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:22,659
Then shut up.

703
00:56:23,419 --> 00:56:26,719
You know,
I have done many things in my life.

704
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:30,134
I'm not the one to talk about morality.

705
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:32,139
But tell me, lllia...

706
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:34,159
...you like your life?

707
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:38,399
My life was fine before the missionary
and you came along.

708
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:40,499
I've thrown him out.

709
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,180
And now....

710
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:46,220
You'll never throw me out.

711
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:19,219
U.S.?

712
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:24,700
I said you to go home.

713
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,840
There's a boat leaving in two hours.

714
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,719
I have something to propose to you.
If you don't accept, I'll be on that boat.

715
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:32,819
Give me water.

716
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:34,899
Water.

717
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:47,719
Poor Homer, he comes in Greece...

718
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:51,219
...and all the time he gets a dirty eye.

719
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,519
Come sit down.

720
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:56,020
Don't be afraid.

721
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,700
Illia, let me talk to you.

722
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:02,200
Are you happy?

723
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,759
I am happy.

724
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:05,999
You like your life?
- I like my life.

725
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:09,159
You like your work?
- I like my work.

726
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:11,759
And what if I prove to you
that you're not happy?

727
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:13,560
Cursed be the hour and the moment--

728
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:18,420
No, you tell me,
exactly what is it that makes you happy?

729
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,719
The sun, he shines on me.
He makes me happy.

730
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:24,479
I eat a good fish, he makes me happy.

731
00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:27,680
I touch you. If you feel good, I'm happy.

732
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,180
Everything sensual, everything physical.

733
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,000
You live by the Stoic
and Epicurean philosophies...

734
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,880
...that came after the fall of Greece.
It's so clear.

735
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Not to me.

736
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,340
How shall I tell you?

737
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:43,640
Illia...

738
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,864
...at one time, Greece was
the greatest country...

739
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:48,120
...in the whole world.

740
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,640
It still is.

741
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,500
At the height of Greek glory,
there were three great men.

742
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:56,619
Philosophers.

743
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,060
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

744
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,440
I told you, this one I don't like.
- All three of them giants.

745
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,760
They gave their lives to the one question:

746
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:11,440
What is happiness?
- Really? And what did they say?

747
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,960
They said that the true happiness
comes from the pleasure of the mind.

748
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,239
That the greatest happiness
is the joy of understanding.

749
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:21,339
Really?

750
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,440
I sat next to you in that amphitheater
when we went to see Medea.

751
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,079
I watched you,
your eyes were shining with happiness.

752
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:33,199
It's not important that you made a mistake
about the play. We'll talk about that.

753
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:34,400
But your....

754
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,155
Everything in you
was shining with pleasure.

755
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:43,979
Beauty that was Greece.

756
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:48,089
Give me two weeks of your life.
- What?

757
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:52,020
I want every minute of two weeks.

758
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,520
You'll lose nothing by it.
I'll pay you for each minute.

759
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,319
If in the end of two weeks
you don't begin to think my way...

760
01:00:58,419 --> 01:01:00,040
I'll disappear.

761
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,520
Why you want to do that for me?

762
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,720
You believe you can make me....

763
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,820
Anything.

764
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,360
Maybe when I was a little girl.

765
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,720
Now.

766
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,280
I'll make you see a world
you never knew about. I'll--

767
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:18,375
Can you make me somebody
who it is good to love?

768
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:21,280
You'll be reborn.

769
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,020
Illia, two little weeks.

770
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:27,459
Please.

771
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:33,459
I give you two weeks.

772
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:33,099
And lllia ate of the apple of wisdom,
and she knew shame.

773
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,519
Good day, lllia.
- Good day, Spiro.

774
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,040
What will I do with all of those fish?

775
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,640
Last Sunday...

776
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,860
...was dark and dreary.

777
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,619
We hoped this Sunday...

778
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,030
...you'd make a party.
- No, Spiro.

779
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,720
What should I do?

780
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:09,005
Throw them back into the sea?
- Go on, put them in the fridge.

781
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:21,219
Spiro.

782
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,460
Come on, take it.

783
01:04:27,459 --> 01:04:30,639
Tell me true. Is your life better this way?

784
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:34,479
Maybe it's not so much fun, but it's better.

785
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,619
This Homer, you sleep with him?

786
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,820
No, it's something else.

787
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:42,179
What else is there?

788
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,719
He believes in me. That I can be wonderful.

789
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:49,814
And I believe in him.
That's what else there is.

790
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,059
Goodbye, llliaki.

791
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:56,179
Come here.

792
01:04:56,499 --> 01:04:58,499
Here.

793
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:09,099
Be well, Spiro.

794
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:37,359
From my window, I send kisses...

795
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:41,619
...one and two and three and four

796
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:44,560
And to the port come...

797
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,299
...one and two and three and four birds

798
01:06:50,659 --> 01:06:52,319
I want to have...

799
01:06:52,419 --> 01:06:57,140
...one and two and three and four sons

800
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:02,500
Who when they become men...

801
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,295
...will be the pride of Piraeus

802
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,900
If I search the world over

803
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:13,579
I'll find no other port...

804
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,779
...which has the magic...

805
01:07:17,939 --> 01:07:21,140
...of my Port of Piraeus

806
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,700
When twilight comes...

807
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:29,540
...the port sings to me

808
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,780
And young men and echoes of song...

809
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,259
...fill my Port of Piraeus

810
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:02,219
No one goes by my door...

811
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:05,220
...for whom I don't feel love

812
01:08:06,779 --> 01:08:10,020
And those to come tomorrow...

813
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:12,980
...fill my dreams at night

814
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,799
So, to the jewels around my throat

815
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:20,940
I add a charm to bring me luck

816
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,095
And now I'm ready to welcome...

817
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,620
...the stranger come from the port

818
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,779
If I search the whole world over

819
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:37,580
I'll find no other port...

820
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:41,300
...which has the magic...

821
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:44,660
...of my Port of Piraeus

822
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,460
When twilight comes...

823
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,180
...the port sings to me

824
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:57,300
And young men and echoes of song...

825
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,620
...fill my port of Piraeus

826
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,860
These blasted shoes.

827
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,400
Boss.

828
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,050
The whole fleet is pulling in.

829
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,865
They've been at sea for 21 weeks.

830
01:11:37,019 --> 01:11:39,569
Fine, be with you in a minute.

831
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:44,749
This is for the books and records.

832
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:49,839
That's very pretty.

833
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,360
That's my personal gift to lllia.
I paid for that myself.

834
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,460
It's still very pretty.

835
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:01,199
And now I would like to talk to you
about my personal gift to you.

836
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:04,614
How would you like a punch in the nose?

837
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,839
Is that your good deed for the day?

838
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:08,319
You're a cynical son of a--

839
01:12:08,419 --> 01:12:11,400
I'm not a boy scout. I'm a working man.

840
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,879
You're a skunk.

841
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:16,634
Look here, you're not a little boy anymore.

842
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:20,360
What's bothering you is
not that I smell bad.

843
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,639
You're afraid that some of the smell...

844
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,559
...might rub off on you.

845
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,659
You're damned right.

846
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:28,399
It's classic.

847
01:12:28,499 --> 01:12:32,400
There shall always be people like you
who will be working for people like me.

848
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,625
And they scream about it.

849
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:37,080
Get her out.

850
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,000
Excuse me, there was no door to knock on.

851
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,239
Please, I am one of your
tenants. The rents--...

852
01:12:42,339 --> 01:12:45,399
Get her out.
- They are too high. It's impossible.

853
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:48,080
Put yourself in our place. You couldn't--...

854
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,390
Get her out.
- Bloodsucker.

855
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,880
Someday, I'll see you
without those glasses.

856
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,279
Hide in dark corners, you whore.

857
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:58,524
That's what you are. You are a whore.

858
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:26,179
Listen.

859
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,700
With two hands.

860
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,140
Bravo. Miraculous.

861
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,680
What is this...

862
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,179
...a house or a bookstore?

863
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,499
It's my new house.

864
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:45,170
The happiest house in Piraeus.

865
01:13:46,499 --> 01:13:48,879
Despo, I died.
- Bite your tongue.

866
01:13:48,979 --> 01:13:51,359
I died and I was born again.

867
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:53,579
You've met Homer?
- Yes.

868
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,230
Is there nothing to drink?

869
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,340
Excuse me.

870
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,719
You must talk to the girls.

871
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:12,560
When the fleet leaves
we'll have a little money put aside.

872
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,080
With that reserve,
we could hold out and fight No Face.

873
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,180
Once and for all.

874
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:21,559
Why don't you forget that life?

875
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:24,080
You have to think of the future.

876
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,900
You're not 18 years old anymore.

877
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,020
I'm better than ever.

878
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,720
The older the chicken, the better the juice.

879
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,020
Listen.

880
01:14:35,379 --> 01:14:37,680
You'll stop working for two weeks.

881
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,780
Homer will pay you.

882
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,500
Homer. How did you know?

883
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,660
I like the reds.

884
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,995
I have something else.
- No.

885
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:54,340
Hello, darling.

886
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:58,599
You know my friend Despo.
She speaks English better as l.

887
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:02,360
Very well he knows me.
We work both for the same man.

888
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,460
What?
- The same man.

889
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:06,399
What are you talking about?

890
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:08,719
You died and you were born again?

891
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:11,000
Well, make a deep breath...

892
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,840
...because you're going to die again.

893
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:17,085
He works for No Face.
- Are you crazy?

894
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,179
I am crazy, darling.

895
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:20,799
It's not true.

896
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:24,359
Darling. It's not true
I see you just now with No Face?

897
01:15:24,459 --> 01:15:26,584
It's not true you see me?

898
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,879
She's mad.

899
01:15:28,979 --> 01:15:31,104
She's dreaming.
- I dream?

900
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:37,295
How do I know
that present you have for lllia is a vase?

901
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,390
And in my dream, I see much money.

902
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:44,119
No Face money...

903
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,364
...in yellow envelope in that pocket.

904
01:15:55,059 --> 01:15:58,204
Show me what you have in that pocket.

905
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,820
I want to see what it is in that pocket.

906
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,819
Over the top.

907
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,479
Will you please--...

908
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:23,120
'Happiness is the joy of understanding.'
- Will you--...

909
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,040
'l think, therefore I am.'

910
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,800
Descartes, French philosopher,
18th century.

911
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,160
Seventeenth.

912
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:33,520
'The Greek decline went fast
after the death of Alexander.'

913
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,879
'To accept the bondage
under the oriental occupation...

914
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:39,639
'the Greeks began to live only for pleasure.'

915
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:41,999
Will you let me explain?
- I let you explain.

916
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:44,319
The money that you give me
comes from No Face?

917
01:16:44,419 --> 01:16:46,919
I'll start at the beginning.
- Does it come from No Face?

918
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,880
Yes, it did.

919
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,199
Attack.

920
01:16:50,299 --> 01:16:53,840
'Afghanistan is situated
on the borders of lran and Pakistan.

921
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,079
'Population is....' I forgot.
- It's a misunderstanding.

922
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,520
'lceland is country very close to North Pole.
Climate very cold.'

923
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,520
Listen.
- 'Greece is far from North Pole.

924
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,480
'Climate very hot.'

925
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,719
'Many Shakespeare plots
come from Plutarch.'

926
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:11,840
'The four great tragedies are...

927
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:15,199
'Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear.

928
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,594
'But some critics prefer...

929
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:20,379
'The Tempest.'
- Please.

930
01:17:20,779 --> 01:17:22,240
Attack.

931
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,340
What? No, not Picasso.

932
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:27,729
Monsieur Picasso, excuse me very much.

933
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,040
Will you listen?
- You listen.

934
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,840
Calm down.

935
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,280
When you calm down,
you'll understand I'm your friend.

936
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,239
'A friend is one soul in two bodies.'

937
01:17:38,339 --> 01:17:41,540
And that, my friend, is Aristotle.

938
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,439
Come on, Despo. We
have some work to do.

939
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:49,060
Now we go fix Mr. No Face.

940
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,160
Will you please tell her--
- No.

941
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,360
Not once the fleet goes away.

942
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,859
Now. I swear to you...

943
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:59,674
...those sailor boys will make like wolves.

944
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,740
Quickly, Mr. Lawyer.

945
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,900
Let's go.

946
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,340
Yes, sir?

947
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:38,125
I'm the lawyer of these girls.
I have come to pay their fines.

948
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,559
Here they come.

949
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:46,659
Isn't he handsome?

950
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:50,984
Such a cute mustache.
- lsn't he adorable?

951
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:55,849
Your fines have been paid, you may go.

952
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,375
May I talk to my clients alone?

953
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,200
I'm listening.

954
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,839
A big cut in the rents.
- All right.

955
01:20:07,939 --> 01:20:11,439
From 180 drachmas
we'll bring it down to 170 drachmas.

956
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:14,174
The darling. Isn't he generous?

957
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,910
All right, 160 drachmas. Let's go.

958
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,780
Silence.

959
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,320
Silence.

960
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,440
What do you want?

961
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:32,300
I want you to know
that the good old days are over.

962
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,860
130 drachmas.

963
01:20:35,139 --> 01:20:37,660
Little bird, 80 drachmas.

964
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,920
Are you crazy?
- 80 drachmas.

965
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,400
120 drachmas. Last offer. I swear.
- 80 drachmas. Last offer. I swear.

966
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,839
110 drachmas.
- 90 drachmas.

967
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:48,064
90 drachmas, it's a deal.

968
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,840
Gibraltar...

969
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,239
...a rock.

970
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:57,339
He stays.

971
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,660
Homer, what did you do to Taki?

972
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:08,020
He's not a man. He's a catastrophe.

973
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,619
What happened? Captain?

974
01:22:12,939 --> 01:22:16,519
He asked Taki if he could read music.
Taki said no.

975
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:19,200
He asked Taki, why does he not learn.

976
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,079
Taki said, 'I'm too old.'

977
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,679
So he told Taki, if he couldn't read music...

978
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,519
...he was no real musician
and he never would be.

979
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:27,560
Perfect.

980
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:32,335
So Taki began to cry
and said he would never play again.

981
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,635
Homer, when will you learn?

982
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:39,630
Where is Taki?
- He locked himself in the bathroom.

983
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,059
Taki, come out.
- No.

984
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:50,839
Taki, open the door. I want to talk to you.

985
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:52,939
Leave me alone.

986
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,400
Nobody in Greece
plays the bouzouki like you.

987
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,305
You play like an angel.
- Go away.

988
01:22:59,859 --> 01:23:02,919
I'm ignorant. I'll never play again.

989
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,019
Taki, listen.

990
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:07,519
Those people who made up music notes...

991
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:11,760
...they made them up so that they could
write down music, no?

992
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,120
What?

993
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:17,719
You make music. They need the notes
to write down what you play.

994
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:19,820
If you don't play...

995
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,010
...what can they do with
their notes? Nothing.

996
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,379
Don't you see?

997
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:38,420
Can birds read music?

998
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,559
No.

999
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:47,139
So should the birds stop singing?

1000
01:25:35,379 --> 01:25:37,379
Is he kidding, brother?

1001
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,460
Watch it, boys.

1002
01:26:45,339 --> 01:26:47,339
Here we go.

1003
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,379
You're beautiful...

1004
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,839
...but you're dumb.

1005
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:02,679
I wanted to save you.

1006
01:27:02,779 --> 01:27:06,079
Why don't you save No Face?
He need it more than me.

1007
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,080
Because you were the symbol.

1008
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,000
Is not symbol. Is a woman.

1009
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,075
Don't you think I know that, Romeo?

1010
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:16,400
I've been dying to sleep with her.

1011
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,700
Homer, is true?

1012
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:21,680
From the first minute.

1013
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,780
Is too late.

1014
01:27:31,299 --> 01:27:34,189
And now we all go to the seashore.

1015
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,720
If anyone will save lllia, it will be Tonio.

1016
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,159
Why Tonio?

1017
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:44,064
Because with love, it's possible.
