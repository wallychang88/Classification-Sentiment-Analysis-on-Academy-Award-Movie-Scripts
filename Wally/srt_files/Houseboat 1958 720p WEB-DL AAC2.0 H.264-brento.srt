1
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,967
What do you know...
He finally made it.

2
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,771
He was pretty far away
when it happened.

3
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:08,206
- Europe or some place like that.
- That's his story.

4
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,805
We'd better go down and say hello.

5
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,677
- Not me.
- He is our father.

6
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:17,076
I'll never say hello to him.
Goodbye, maybe.

7
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,693
Mother would have wanted us to.

8
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:22,129
We don't have no mother.
She's dead.

9
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:26,310
- Shut up. You give me the creeps.
- My mother is dead!

10
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,472
Let's go down.
We'll leave little Frankenstein here.

11
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,253
- She is, too.
- Shut up.

12
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,853
Be quiet.

13
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,394
I hate everybody. I hate everybody
in the whole wide world.

14
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,428
I bought it from a short fellow in Munich.

15
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,263
Wait, Aunt Carolyn.

16
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,096
Come on, jump.

17
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,807
He is supposed to jump.
Come on, jump.

18
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,079
All right, Tom.
Mother and I must be getting home.

19
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:07,787
Many arrangements have to be made.

20
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,714
- The children have enough toys.
- I bought this one for me.

21
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,657
Alice didn't bother to have the car insured
before that terrible accident.

22
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,497
She was as haphazard about that

23
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,147
as she was about choosing
her husband.

24
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,764
Don't worry. I will take on
the additional financial burden.

25
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,086
If you don't mind, I prefer to worry.

26
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,817
As long as you're in my house,
you're going to have some manners.

27
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,361
- Hello, Robert, old man.
- I'm not an old man.

28
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:38,396
He's getting there.
That's a darling thing.

29
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,195
Is that how it works?

30
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,939
You're from another planet.

31
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,502
Thank you.
I think that's a compliment.

32
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:54,228
I was just about to do that.
All you had to do was pull the switch...

33
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,045
The children seem to be happy
with our side of the family.

34
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,138
The divorce wasn't final,
but we're both lawyers

35
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,243
and there shouldn't be any difficulty
making the custody permanent.

36
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,896
- Carolyn, where is your husband?
- John is out, Father.

37
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:15,857
When is he ever in? Both of my daughters
made the wisest choices.

38
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,202
Tom, Mother and I will take Elizabeth
to live with us.

39
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,546
And Carolyn and her husband
will take the boys.

40
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,236
It will be wonderful for the boys.

41
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,508
I'll move the guesthouse
and put in a swimming-pool.

42
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:30,944
They have been helping plan it.

43
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,116
- Is that OK with you?
- Sure. It's a real blast here.

44
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,406
We've got a tennis court, horses,
the river, everything.

45
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:44,321
I'll be living right down the road.
I can come over any time.

46
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:49,065
- How about you?
- I don't care where I live.

47
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:54,544
Well, it happens that I care. I don't want
my kids parcelled out like cabbages.

48
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:57,840
They don't parcel out cabbages,
they are sold in carload lots.

49
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,516
Since when are you interested
in your children?

50
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:04,474
How long were you and Alice separated?
Three years? Four?

51
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,803
When did you see your children?
Occasionally on a weekend?

52
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:09,774
You know my job with the government...

53
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,458
Your job is more important
than your children?

54
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:16,039
You may sign the custody agreement
in my office in the morning.

55
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,491
Elizabeth, it's getting late.
All your things are in the car.

56
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,110
We'd better go home now.

57
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:27,080
OK, Gramps.
See you in the morning.

58
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,616
I'll come over lots of times.
It will be all right.

59
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,906
- Bye bye, sweetie.
- See you tomorrow, Aunt Carolyn.

60
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,123
Goodbye.

61
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,668
No, he is your father.
Why don't you give him a kiss?

62
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,301
- Sure.
- No, wait.

63
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,226
Get your things from that Black Maria
and put them in the jeep.

64
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,592
And you two, get your clothes,

65
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:51,659
you are coming to Washington with me.

66
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,185
We'll stay with Aunt Carolyn.
She's got horses and everything.

67
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:58,153
- Can he do that?
- You bet I can.

68
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,679
You won't miss them.
I'll send a carload of cabbages.

69
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,951
Remember, you're still under
my jurisdiction, the three of you.

70
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,459
Get your things together.
I'll wait for you outside. Carolyn, I...

71
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,295
- What should we do?
- What can we do?

72
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,765
He's got the law on his side.
We have to go with him.

73
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:24,036
- He ain't gonna like it.
- Nope.

74
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,934
Tom... Where are you going
to put the children?

75
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:35,023
I still have my flat in Washington.
It's a little small, but...

76
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,505
We don't have to get rid of
the guesthouse,

77
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,413
if you all wanted to stay here.

78
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,684
How are you and John
getting along these days?

79
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,938
It's one of those modern marriages.

80
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,451
Electric blankets and everything.

81
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,165
Sorry.

82
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:55,826
That's Robert's harmonica.

83
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,213
You'll get to know it well.
It's recent.

84
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:03,570
David is becoming a problem too.
He's been taking things.

85
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,859
- What?
- Elizabeth can't sleep nights.

86
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,986
How will you learn how to be a father
after all these years?

87
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,803
I'll get a booklet
from the Department of Agriculture.

88
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:18,783
Congratulations, Mother Goose.
I'm very proud of you.

89
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:22,607
- Good luck, Tom.
- Thank you, Carolyn.

90
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,888
- Home, sweet home.
- Oh, brother: Sing Sing!

91
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,234
You said you only needed my jeep
for a couple of hours.

92
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,777
A few problems came up.

93
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,776
Robert, Elizabeth and David,
this is Captain Alan Wilson.

94
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:09,287
- They are going to live with me.
- In that rabbit hutch upstairs?

95
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:12,541
Could you and your wife
help me get a maid?

96
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,750
A maid? In Washington?

97
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,838
The only way you get help here
is to elect them.

98
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:21,708
You better get them inside,
it's starting to rain.

99
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,172
Hope it clears up. I'll show them
all of Washington tomorrow.

100
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,141
You kids will have quite a holiday.

101
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:33,087
Holiday? It will be more
of a kidnapping. Come on.

102
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:59,664
- What's the matter?
- I'm afraid.

103
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,668
What are you afraid of?

104
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:05,627
Listen to what's going on out there
and I'm alone in that room.

105
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,723
You're lucky.
Look at us in this barracks.

106
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:12,142
- But you're together.
- Only in body.

107
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,351
Come on, back to bed.

108
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,591
Lie down.

109
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,942
Come on, darling.

110
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,242
Take it easy.
Remember what I used to tell you?

111
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,289
Thunder is just two bodies of air
coming together

112
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:40,120
after an electrical disturbance.

113
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,652
- Got it?
- Got it.

114
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:50,073
- But I'm still worried.
- So am I.

115
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,639
What in the blazes is that?

116
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,362
Ain't that wonderful!

117
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,575
Let's enjoy the day.

118
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:57,447
That's the Washington Monument.
That's 555 feet high.

119
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,295
It's dedicated to the memory
of George Washington.

120
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,546
He died December 14th, 1799.

121
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:06,253
Over there is the memorial
to Thomas Jefferson,

122
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,532
the third President of the United States.

123
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:10,676
He died on July 4th...

124
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:13,967
That's one of the most
striking examples of...

125
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,817
Robert, you ought to pay attention.

126
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,024
You're getting a sightseeing tour

127
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:27,803
of one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

128
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,833
Do you have to talk about
dead people all the time?

129
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,235
There's nothing in this whole city
but dead people.

130
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,562
I want to go back to Aunt Carolyn.

131
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,779
All right, no more monuments.

132
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,275
Tonight we'll go to the
Watergate Concert by the river.

133
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,015
This afternoon I'll take you
to the National Museum.

134
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,869
- What's in a museum?
- Dead people.

135
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,458
- Come on.
- Where are you going to drag us now?

136
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:56,629
- How about some ice-cream?
- Good idea.

137
00:11:56,805 --> 00:12:00,458
Don't tell me I had a good idea, at last.

138
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,095
Is my mother in a museum?

139
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:08,651
- No.
- Good.

140
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:07,361
- I got that seat.
- No, it's mine!

141
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:11,287
Cut it out. Come on.

142
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,812
Give me that thing.

143
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,864
Robert Winters.
Your father is looking for you.

144
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,077
Come to the parking area.

145
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:39,369
Robert Winters.
Come to the parking area immediately.

146
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,233
What a delightful concert.

147
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:55,816
You are so kind.
Have you met my daughter?

148
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,524
- How do you do?
- Delighted.

149
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:02,663
You must be having have the time
of your life. All America at your feet.

150
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,813
- At my father's feet.
- It's the same thing.

151
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:10,658
- I'd like to talk to you, Signor Zaccardi.
- By all means. Come here.

152
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:26,269
It's all settled.
Your father has agreed.

153
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:29,112
You'll all come to my place
for a cosy supper.

154
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,114
About 40 or 50 of the best people.

155
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:35,696
Will you excuse me?
I've got a terrible headache.

156
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,493
She hasn't been feeling well.

157
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,870
- Cinzia.
- Yes, I do not have a headache.

158
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:46,542
Do you know who this woman is?
The Boston Symphony.

159
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:50,627
"We'll have a cosy supper.
40 or 50 of the best people."

160
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm tired of the best people.

161
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,031
I wish I could meet
some of the worst people.

162
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,305
Papa, one night.
Let me have tonight alone.

163
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,540
I don't want to leave America
without having met an American.

164
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:05,689
What do you do with a girl like this?
I'm not a rich man.

165
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:08,147
Best schools in Switzerland for her.

166
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:12,009
Last month she climbs out of a window
and runs away.

167
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:14,872
One night without talking
about Stravinsky or Rossini

168
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:17,713
or you conducting La Scala
at the age of 14.

169
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:23,879
I'm 22 and I haven't yet given my first
performance for a man, any man.

170
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,857
Go ahead. Have a daughter.
See what happens.

171
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,173
You will come to the supper with us.
Do you understand?

172
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,838
You haven't eaten all day.

173
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,735
Without food,
everything is discord.

174
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,444
A starving orchestra I had tonight.

175
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:58,914
Wash your face.
Compose yourself. We will wait.

176
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,539
Wait.

177
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,701
Is this your boat?

178
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,043
No. I will pay you...
As soon as I get some money.

179
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:54,297
You don't have to,
it's not my boat either.

180
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:59,341
- Where are you going?
- Over there. Where the music is.

181
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,547
Good. That's where I'm going too.

182
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:23,608
Why don't you go home,
little boy? It's late.

183
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,247
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>
Go home.

184
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,804
Go home.

185
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:29,275
Hot pizza, here.
We've got hot pizza here, 25 cents.

186
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:33,017
We've got hot pizza here.

187
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,559
My friend...
Would you like me to show you

188
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:40,550
how to eat that properly?
So you don't waste any.

189
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:44,932
You see?

190
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:06,029
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

191
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,808
Three rings for one dime.
Step this way, folks.

192
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,853
Everybody gets a winner.
Look at those prizes.

193
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:22,919
Fantastic prizes.
Three rings for one dime.

194
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,191
Everybody wins here, folks.
Three rings here.

195
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:31,409
Look at the fantastic prizes.
Come right here.

196
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:35,330
Three rings for one dime.
Fantastic prizes.

197
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,622
Everybody has a winner.
You muffed it, son.

198
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:40,836
Everybody has got a winner here.

199
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,222
My last dime.

200
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,303
Everybody's got a winner, everybody.

201
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,638
Except me, I never win anything.

202
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:53,592
Your lucky dime, son.
Everybody's got a winner.

203
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,426
Three for one dime here, folks.
Look at the fantastic prizes.

204
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,232
It can't go half way,
it's gotta go all the way down.

205
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,155
You can take three.

206
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:06,675
He won, he won!

207
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,780
Your father, the Chief of Police,
will be so happy.

208
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:14,823
Congratulations, lady.
Everybody wins here!

209
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,334
Good night. Goodbye.

210
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,067
Don't you want to hear me play
the harmonica?

211
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,379
Why don't you go home? It's late.

212
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,207
Go home to your mother.

213
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,711
Would you like to dance?

214
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,448
Would you like to dance?

215
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,189
My friend.

216
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,052
Are you sure?
No sign of him yet?

217
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,202
He's been murdered.

218
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:30,439
Yes, he's about four feet.
Oh, "eyes"?

219
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,973
- Grey.
- Blue.

220
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,281
Blue.

221
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,201
You can reach me
at the Department of State.

222
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,128
Legal Division. Thank you.

223
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:44,997
- Robert, where have you been?
- You've found him.

224
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:48,253
- Are there any broken bones?
- No, he's all right.

225
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,292
- Let me have him.
- She promised to put me to bed.

226
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:55,471
- Her name is Cinzia, she's my friend.
- Hello.

227
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:59,457
I tried to find out your address,
but he didn't wish to come home.

228
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:01,931
You must have done
something terrible to him.

229
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,474
Yes, I took him to a concert.

230
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:08,941
- Let her carry me. I like it.
- The bedroom is over there.

231
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,246
- Did you have fun?
- It was a ball.

232
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,438
If you try that again, you'll get a spanking
you'll never forget.

233
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:19,026
Yes, a spanking solves so many things.

234
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:23,448
Or a slap in the face.
It's easier than understanding.

235
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,708
Two points for her.
Welcome to our side, Cinzia.

236
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:31,728
Could you come back
tomorrow and take care of us?

237
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,489
We can't get a maid. It's rough.

238
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:38,211
I would like to very much,
but I'm preoccupied.

239
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:41,306
- That is the right word?
- Yes, that will do.

240
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,514
I'd like to thank you properly

241
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:46,556
but may I have my family back
for a few minutes first?

242
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,435
Can you wait for me in the other room?

243
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:52,893
- <i>Arrivederci,</i> Roberto.
- Roberto is me, it's Italian.

244
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,402
- Really?
- Good night.

245
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,897
Good night. Thank you for the dance.

246
00:25:58,074 --> 00:25:59,734
Any time.

247
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,244
Here are your pyjamas.

248
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,072
We'd better let Robert
sleep in the bed

249
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,425
since he's been out
on the town all night.

250
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,796
I won it fair and square, ask my friend.

251
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,549
You're not on trial.

252
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:22,555
- Daddy...
- Take off your pants.

253
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,304
- What were you saying?
- Make her be our maid.

254
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:29,395
Offer her a lot of money.
It would be fun.

255
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:33,692
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- That's the last we'll hear of that.

256
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,646
I hire the help around here.
I can't take any girl you find on the street.

257
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,280
- You don't like her because I like her.
- That's ridiculous.

258
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,862
You keep us here in this city

259
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:50,203
and don't let us go back to Aunt
Carolyn because we like her, too.

260
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:53,461
- That isn't the reason.
- Well, what is?

261
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,207
Go to sleep.

262
00:26:57,843 --> 00:27:00,713
You don't like us.
You don't like us at all.

263
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,007
Well, I don't like you.
I don't like anybody.

264
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,969
I don't like this old harmonica any more.

265
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:10,180
I wish it hit you and killed you dead.

266
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:13,806
Don't you care, Robert.
I like you.

267
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:27,004
Thank you so much.
I'm sincerely grateful.

268
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:28,497
Here.

269
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:31,470
All right, here's five more.

270
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,664
- Apparently, gratitude has gone up.
- But I don't want this money.

271
00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:39,298
Would you mind answering me
a personal question?

272
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,627
How long is it since you had a bath?

273
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,884
- <i>Cosa?</i>
- A bath.

274
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:47,173
You look as if you need a good scrubbing.
How long has it been?

275
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:52,072
Well... I don't remember.

276
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:54,638
A bottle of Chianti, a loaf of bread.

277
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:58,171
A corner in which to sleep.
It's not a bad life, is it?

278
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:02,030
How would you like a job
as a maid to the children?

279
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,389
For $100 a month to start?

280
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:09,739
That's nonsense.
Thank you again and good night.

281
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:11,376
Good night.

282
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:15,368
Be nice to Roberto.
Please don't spank him.

283
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:18,416
I'll handle my own family.
I've done all right so far.

284
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,341
- Why did he run away?
- Must there be a reason?

285
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:25,294
- Always. Where is their mother?
- What?

286
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,376
- Their mother.
- You are looking at her.

287
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,308
- I'm a little new at the job.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:35,027
Roberto tells me
he is very unhappy.

289
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:39,025
Sounds as if Roberto and you
had quite an evening.

290
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:43,322
He doesn't like the hot city.
He wants to be near the river.

291
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,360
Why do you let him stay here
in this tiny box?

292
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:49,820
You must have had
a lot of experience raising children.

293
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:54,092
I have no experience.
But I know when a little child is unhappy.

294
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,957
And how I know when a father
is unreasonable!

295
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,055
Try to be a parent,
not a policeman.

296
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,777
I don't know
what you know about parents,

297
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:09,217
but I imagine you had a wide
acquaintance amongst policemen.

298
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,093
I'll call one if you keep that up.
I gave you some money,

299
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,710
get yourself a room for tonight.

300
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:25,104
Do you like this? This picture?

301
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:27,443
Of course.
That's why I have it.

302
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:31,141
- It's a Cézanne.
- I know. Paul Cézanne.

303
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:33,998
You cut it down to fit the frame, right?

304
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,680
How sad for you.
It's only a print.

305
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:42,297
Buy a real one. <i>Ciao.</i>

306
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:51,839
Two o'clock in the morning.

307
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,960
You've found a man, am I right?

308
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:59,972
Yes, I've found a man.
He's seven years old.

309
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,731
In America that's old enough.

310
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:05,736
Get some rest.
We leave in the morning for Chicago,

311
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,361
where I won't let you
out of my sight.

312
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,711
Only two days in this country.

313
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:16,909
You will come with us to Chicago,
Boston, San Francisco.

314
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,618
Then we come back
to Washington. Come.

315
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,247
What can you do
in this awful city by yourself?

316
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:26,606
A girl, all alone.
No money.

317
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:30,304
Not a penny will I give you.
You will starve.

318
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:33,764
- Perhaps I will get a job.
- A job?

319
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:37,350
I have given you the finest education
in all of Europe.

320
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,560
You do not know how to do anything.

321
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,766
Then perhaps I will run for the Congress.

322
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:58,301
Hello? Who?

323
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,134
Tom.

324
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:03,487
The what?

325
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:06,005
The guesthouse?

326
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:10,378
Yes, they started moving it
to the new lot today. Why?

327
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:14,868
Don't be silly, I won't sell it to you.
You can have it.

328
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,722
If you insist... A thousand.

329
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,967
You drive a hard bargain.

330
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:25,937
Who finally convinced you
the city was no place for children?

331
00:31:26,903 --> 00:31:28,730
It was my own idea.

332
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:32,108
Why did you wait
until they were asleep to call me?

333
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:38,495
Dear Carolyn, you are all-knowing,
all-seeing and shut up.

334
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,905
It will be in the new foundation
first thing in the morning.

335
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:43,466
Good night.

336
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,478
- I don't want to go.
- Who wanted to live in the country?

337
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,318
I have to spend
the whole summer commuting.

338
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:16,318
I've been on a used-car lot all morning,
picking out a reasonably priced car.

339
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:19,449
- Where's my friend Cinzia?
- I tried to hire her.

340
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:22,410
- I offered her a lot of money.
- You don't like her.

341
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,834
I'd have given her my right arm
if she'd taken the job.

342
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:29,375
- I've got a nosebleed.
- If she's not coming, I'm not going!

343
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:33,425
- The cops are ticketing your car.
- And the building's on fire.

344
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,557
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

345
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,245
I knew you would come back.
You are going to be our maid.

346
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:51,897
- Wait a minute.
- If you still want me, yes.

347
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,586
He was going to give his right arm,
weren't you?

348
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,948
You told me you didn't want the job.

349
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,325
It doesn't look as if she needs one.
Where did you get those clothes?

350
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,952
- My father.
- You can help me pack.

351
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:07,668
I don't know anything about you.
You are from Italy, aren't you?

352
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:10,649
- <i>Si.</i>
- That means "yes".

353
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:15,628
- Are you a G.I. Bride or something?
- Yes, almost.

354
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:18,674
- Almost? What does that mean?
- I arrived.

355
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:22,583
He didn't marry me.
So I must work.

356
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:27,310
That's a sad story.
But I don't think this is the job for you.

357
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:31,895
- Besides, we're going to the country.
- I adore the country.

358
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:34,444
- What's wrong?
- Nosebleed.

359
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:37,984
- Get me a damp cloth and hurry.
- That settles it. She stays.

360
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,157
She can't stay with us.
That guesthouse is too small.

361
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,873
Try to look at it from my viewpoint.
Perhaps you'd better not.

362
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,246
- How are you?
- That's fine. It's stopped.

363
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,039
- I was just about to do that.
- We'll go and wash your face.

364
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,574
Come on, David, we'll help.

365
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,687
You wouldn't believe it.

366
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:02,609
Hello, Alan.

367
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,514
Any luck trying to sublet
this apartment?

368
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:09,620
We lined up a few prospects,
but they say the rent is too high.

369
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:14,610
- OK, I'll knock off $25 a month.
- The wife and I will take it.

370
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:16,986
I can't tell you what a help you are.

371
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:20,241
Let's get the luggage out.
I'm so sorry.

372
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,945
We've taken a vote and it's unanimous.
Cinzia stays.

373
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:27,063
You can vote too, but you'll lose.
Three to one.

374
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,121
- We've figured it out.
- Thank you.

375
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:33,166
- Who's she?
- Apparently she's the maid.

376
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,254
- Three to one.
- Upstairs or downstairs maid?

377
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:39,082
What difference does that make?

378
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:41,651
I don't want you wearing yourself out.

379
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:46,837
- Alan, I'm getting her for my children.
- Adopt me.

380
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,879
Well, we're almost at our new house.

381
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,128
I think it's going to be wonderful.
Don't you?

382
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:43,111
Just put down a new foundation
this morning.

383
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:46,721
You remember the guesthouse,
colonial style, green shutters.

384
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,811
Isn't that the house we're trying to pass?

385
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,084
What?

386
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:59,807
- Isn't that the house we're trying to pass?
- It's supposed to be on the lot.

387
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,712
Should I knock on the door
and ask what happened?

388
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:05,401
Hold it!

389
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,564
Wait!

390
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:13,688
Stay there.

391
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:17,477
This house should
have been set up this morning.

392
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:20,606
Are you Mr Winters?
I'm Angelo. How do you do?

393
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,984
- About this house...
- I could throw the bull all day...

394
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,243
But I'm straight from the shoulder.
Do you appreciate that kind of talk?

395
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:30,579
- From the bottom of my heart.
- I got drunk.

396
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:33,074
I've three children on my hands.
What am I to do?

397
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,540
What a party.
You should have been there.

398
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,464
If this house is not up by nightfall,

399
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:40,838
I'll sue you for every penny you have.

400
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:43,582
Two of them were redheads.

401
00:36:43,762 --> 00:36:46,244
I feel a little unbalanced myself.

402
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:48,224
If this is the usual way...

403
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:56,807
Now look what you've done.
You can't even drive.

404
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:59,854
You've smashed in
the whole side of the car.

405
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:04,322
- Where are you going?
- Welcome to historic Virginia. My card.

406
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:08,536
If you ever want anything moved,
call on Angelo.

407
00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:19,043
Angelo, I hear a train coming.
The house is on the tracks.

408
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:21,660
Angelo, the house!

409
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:25,129
Cinzia, can't you hear the train coming?

410
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:29,681
How can a man be that stupid?

411
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,266
- Dad, there's a train coming.
- How nice.

412
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:37,019
Look at that oil.
I bet the transmission is damaged.

413
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,690
- Dad, the train.
- You go and watch it.

414
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,233
The crankcase is probably cracked too.

415
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:50,119
- Dad, look. The train.
- All right. Go and wave at the engineer.

416
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:03,914
Why didn't you tell me
the train was coming?

417
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:06,879
Choke it!
Is the ignition on?

418
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:09,970
Is your foot on the clutch?

419
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:15,421
I've started lots of cars.

420
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:37,703
Which was my room?

421
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:48,250
You'll love it.
Wait till you see it.

422
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:51,299
It's secluded.
I only use it on weekends.

423
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:53,762
We can stay there
until the car is fixed.

424
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:56,140
Here we are.

425
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:59,577
- Where?
- The river.

426
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,477
Did you ever see anything so beautiful?

427
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:11,390
Never. Are you out of your mind?

428
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:15,246
Try it for one night.
You better, I think it's going to rain.

429
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:17,489
If you like it,
I'll make you a good deal.

430
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,290
I figure I owe it to you.

431
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:22,988
Perhaps there is a nice, comfortable hotel.

432
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:27,550
If you're willing to pay for putting up
a nice comfortable family of five.

433
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:31,007
Or you could sell an old Cézanne
you may have hanging around.

434
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:34,513
Let me show it to you.
What can you lose?

435
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:39,343
- It's the best location around.
- I think that's poison ivy.

436
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:44,099
Down there is my old man's grocery store,
and across the river is the country club.

437
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:47,503
There's a better class of people
at the grocery store, but that's up to you.

438
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,334
I'm not going across that shaky thing.

439
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:53,650
It's as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.

440
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:57,363
It's not so bad after closing your eyes.

441
00:39:57,539 --> 00:39:59,532
Roberto, don't you dare!

442
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:02,053
Come on, what are you worried about?

443
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,916
- Come on.
- Don't be afraid.

444
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:11,009
- It's as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.
- Come on. Hurry up.

445
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,188
Perhaps there is a nice, comfortable hotel.

446
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:30,276
This place has everything.

447
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,268
It's got a generator
and batteries for electricity.

448
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:36,826
You've got a gas-stove for cooking.
An ice-box.

449
00:40:36,995 --> 00:40:41,023
A linoleum cupboard sink.
You'll love it here, it's a palace.

450
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,458
There isn't another place
like this around.

451
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:47,170
- That's a neat knife.
- What are you doing?

452
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,128
- It's neater this way.
- Like a palace.

453
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,789
Shall I show you
where the water is coming in?

454
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:56,299
Let me show you how beautiful
it is outside.

455
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,845
I'm just trying to show you the place.

456
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:01,093
You have three bedrooms down here,

457
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,890
the master bedroom
is upstairs and here comes the...

458
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:08,857
- Watch that beam.
- Thank you, I will.

459
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:11,517
Let's go outside.
I want to show you around.

460
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:19,033
We've got a freshwater tank
on the top deck for showers... everything.

461
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:22,106
There's real live spiders up here.

462
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,116
Save them,
we may need them for dinner.

463
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:31,302
Mrs McGillicuddy, the lady who owns
the farmhouse around the bend,

464
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:34,496
she supplies the water from her well.

465
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,137
- What did you say her name was?
- Mrs McGillicuddy.

466
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:40,042
We have an arrangement.

467
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:42,996
I blow the horn...

468
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:48,086
She turns on the tap,
right away, running water.

469
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:53,819
She's a little hard-of-hearing.

470
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:59,695
We can stay at Aunt Carolyn's tonight
and go back to the city tomorrow.

471
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,636
I have sublet the apartment.

472
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,046
I doubt if there's another vacant apartment
in the whole of Washington DC.

473
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:09,143
Then we'll just stay
at Aunt Carolyn's forever.

474
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:10,584
How about it?

475
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:15,551
Angelo, we are going to stay here
for the night.

476
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:20,765
It can be fixed up.
It's a wonderful place for kids.

477
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,555
And not so bad for spiders.

478
00:42:22,726 --> 00:42:25,279
I'll go fix the gangplank
and bring your stuff in.

479
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:27,560
Keep your motor running,
I'll be around.

480
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,057
- What does he mean?
- Let's get off this junk heap.

481
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:34,137
After Cinzia does a little cleaning

482
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:37,140
and polishing
it might be quite comfortable.

483
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:39,998
Who, I?
It will take years.

484
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:43,959
- I bet the roof leaks.
- Let's make the best of things.

485
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,177
Let's play a game
while we wait for Angelo.

486
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:50,792
- I don't know any game.
- We used to play a game.

487
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:53,453
"Who sir, me sir?"
Sure you remember that.

488
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:56,502
- What was I?
- You were Red cap.

489
00:42:56,676 --> 00:43:02,040
He was Black cap.
You were Gold cap. Let's play.

490
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:04,993
- Black cap!
- Who sir, me sir?

491
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:06,794
- Who then sir, say Boxer.
- Boxer.

492
00:43:07,437 --> 00:43:09,627
Who sir, me sir?

493
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:17,863
Thank you, Mrs McGillicuddy.

494
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,934
Did you fix the generator?

495
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,944
There's nothing wrong
with kerosene lamps.

496
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:58,417
They are rather quaint.

497
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:02,691
- You can't see so good with them.
- Of course you can.

498
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:07,037
- I warned you.
- You should be in bed.

499
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,735
Come and see
what Cinzia invented for us.

500
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,985
When the fish comes, the bell rings
and announces his arrival.

501
00:44:15,129 --> 00:44:16,810
Very nice.

502
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:20,253
Do you think if you'll attach
one end to a dust rag,

503
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:24,127
the fish might dust for you?
You hardly got started tonight.

504
00:44:24,301 --> 00:44:29,300
They gave Hercules much more time
to clean Augean stables.

505
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:30,832
Every employer is different.

506
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:34,410
Get to bed and get started
early in the morning.

507
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,835
Here's the knife, David.

508
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:40,845
Where did you get that knife?

509
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:43,798
It was on the ground, near the truck.

510
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,112
That fellow who drove it
must have dropped it.

511
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,194
Why didn't you tell him?

512
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,259
I needed a knife.

513
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,833
I beg your pardon.

514
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,294
It wasn't on the ground, was it?

515
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:05,144
- Give it to me.
- I didn't steal it, I swear on the Bible.

516
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,473
I'm really ashamed of you.

517
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,378
I know. I can't start a car either.

518
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,830
You go to sleep.
I'll wake you if a fish comes.

519
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:21,856
You won't need to.
I won't be asleep.

520
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,593
- Then you wake me.
- Sure.

521
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:30,019
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

522
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:53,550
I've read this communiqué.

523
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,187
It's your schedule. Quite simple.

524
00:45:56,365 --> 00:46:00,576
7:15 am, wake the children.
7:25 am clean sink, pantry and ice-box.

525
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:04,658
7:45 am, prepare breakfast.
What's wrong about that?

526
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:07,583
It's no use.
I'm leaving in the morning.

527
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:09,874
Will you explain to the children, please?

528
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:15,352
Explain?
There's no way I can explain.

529
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:18,426
They will be certain
I've thrown you out.

530
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,504
I cannot stay.
I simply cannot stay here.

531
00:46:24,884 --> 00:46:27,010
I'm sorry.
Would you like some, too?

532
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:30,556
Yes, I would like some.
Especially if it will help break down

533
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:33,985
the social barriers
between capital and labour.

534
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:36,914
In this case,
I'm not sure who is who.

535
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,733
You're hardly my idea
of the faithful family retainer,

536
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:46,927
but you've got to stay. They want you.

537
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,081
I've lost touch.

538
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:55,690
It's too bad.
We used to be such friends.

539
00:46:57,203 --> 00:46:58,500
Never mind.

540
00:46:58,668 --> 00:47:00,550
It will probably take an act of Congress

541
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,270
to get me back into this family.

542
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:05,974
They do like you. You will see.

543
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,824
I was never cut out for it.

544
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:12,954
I'm one of the undomesticated animals.

545
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:17,565
But when they lost their mother,

546
00:47:17,757 --> 00:47:20,374
I thought it might be best to come home
and try to make it up to them.

547
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:24,504
It never occurred to me
they wouldn't want to have me around.

548
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,785
Isn't that curious?

549
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:31,683
Every other place I go,
grown-ups seem to want me.

550
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:36,317
In certain circles I'm considered
quite charming and debonair.

551
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:41,359
But children can look through me
as if there were nothing there.

552
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:43,856
Well, maybe there isn't.

553
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:47,650
Maybe their mother found that out
a long time ago.

554
00:47:52,885 --> 00:47:56,006
They say the fishing is good
after a thunderstorm.

555
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,623
- Good night.
- Good night.

556
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,489
7:15, I'll wake the children.

557
00:48:02,657 --> 00:48:05,367
Thank you. Thank you very much.

558
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:09,068
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

559
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:44,573
Cinzia, I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

560
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:48,206
- So am I.
- Don't you like thunder either?

561
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:52,360
No, I'm frightened every time.

562
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:56,610
In the war, it was like this every night.

563
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,459
I wouldn't like war.

564
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:02,492
When I was a child, I thought I would.
But not now.

565
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:05,134
My mother, on such a night...

566
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:08,711
Our big house... gone.

567
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:13,802
So you see, where I live,
everybody is frightened of the thunder.

568
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,659
If my father lived there,
he'd tell them

569
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:19,935
it was just two pieces of air
coming together.

570
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:23,382
I'm so sick of those two pieces of air.

571
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:27,872
When I was a little girl,
my father would say,

572
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:33,323
"Cinzia, <i>pazzerella."</i> Foolish.

573
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,742
They are no help, fathers.

574
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:39,205
- Listen, can I get into bed with you?
- Yes.

575
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,856
Wait a minute,
why not in bed with your father?

576
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:50,128
He wouldn't want me,
he would say I was...

577
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,195
- <i>Pazzerella?</i>
- Yes.

578
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:54,384
He doesn't like me to be a baby.

579
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:58,942
Elizabeth, did you ever think
that your father is afraid too?

580
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:03,120
- Him?
- He doesn't want anyone to know.

581
00:50:04,273 --> 00:50:08,019
Sometimes it is very difficult
to be a grown-up.

582
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:12,244
Why don't you go upstairs to him?
It's a terrible night.

583
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,806
Well, I've got to get in bed with somebody.

584
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:21,911
Why don't you come too?
He's got a big bed.

585
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,496
I don't think it's big enough.

586
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:52,919
SCHEDULE
7:15 AM, WAKE CHILDREN...

587
00:52:10,282 --> 00:52:12,249
- You'll wake her.
- That's what I intend to do.

588
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:16,741
- I have to be at the office in 45 minutes.
- Can't you shake her a little?

589
00:52:22,216 --> 00:52:24,871
- You shake her.
- Are you scared?

590
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:27,203
- Yes, I'm scared.
- Chicken.

591
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:29,275
Cinzia, wake up.

592
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:39,047
- <i>Buongiorno,</i> Roberto.
- <i>Buongiorno.</i> I'm not alone.

593
00:52:46,419 --> 00:52:49,564
The children are supposed to be dressed
and breakfast on the table.

594
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:53,319
The kids want oatmeal,
and I like scrambled eggs and bacon.

595
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:57,008
The eggs dry, the bacon crisp.
Toast and coffee.

596
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,990
There is one thing you ought to know.

597
00:53:02,218 --> 00:53:06,180
One little thing.
I do not cook.

598
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,277
- You do not cook?
- No.

599
00:53:09,878 --> 00:53:13,095
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- You never asked.

600
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:16,337
- You can scramble an egg, can't you?
- Yes.

601
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,587
What do you mean, "scramble"?

602
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:24,884
Just take the kids down to the village
for their breakfast.

603
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,102
I'll have just some coffee.
You can make coffee, I hope?

604
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:31,848
Not American coffee.
Do you have an espresso-maker?

605
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:34,986
Never mind.

606
00:53:35,157 --> 00:53:38,283
I can do without food
and I can do without coffee.

607
00:53:38,907 --> 00:53:41,573
- You eat too much anyway.
- Thank you.

608
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:43,061
Go back to sleep.

609
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:53,770
- Daddy, wait!
- What?

610
00:53:54,012 --> 00:53:57,611
- I've made American coffee.
- I read her the label.

611
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:00,012
- What?
- I read her the label.

612
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:04,070
I don't see how you could.
It's still here in the coffee.

613
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:06,664
You don't like it?

614
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,680
She burned her hand twice.

615
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:12,296
- It's wonderful.
- Then why don't you drink it?

616
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:15,476
You don't want
to hurt her feelings, do you?

617
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:19,077
- Good, isn't it?
- Holy...

618
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:20,427
Delicious.

619
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:23,688
I don't see how you Americans
can stomach this.

620
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:27,697
We're a young country.
I doubt if we'll grow much older.

621
00:54:28,586 --> 00:54:31,299
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Daddy.

622
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:36,051
What brought that on?

623
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,406
- What?
- You kissing me goodbye?

624
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:43,256
- Don't I always?
- How foolish of me not to have noticed.

625
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:47,045
Take it easy.

626
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:53,125
Pretty good repair-job on the car.
Listen to that motor.

627
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,862
Did you make up your mind
about the boat?

628
00:54:56,054 --> 00:54:58,407
Do you want to rent, buy, make a deal?

629
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:01,133
It's a leaky,
broken-down derelict,

630
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:03,714
that will probably sink
and dump us all in the river.

631
00:55:05,232 --> 00:55:07,315
But I wouldn't think of living
in any other place.

632
00:55:07,795 --> 00:55:09,500
I'll make a deal.

633
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:15,023
Can you select a melon for me?

634
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,282
The 4th of July.
The Sons of Italy Ball.

635
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:23,090
We'll tie one on together.
What do you say?

636
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:25,828
Do you want to be the lucky girl
this year?

637
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:31,855
You have a certain native charm.
Reserve it for the natives.

638
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:39,297
- Elizabeth!
- Aunt Carolyn.

639
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:43,476
Hi, sweetie.
I saw David at the houseboat.

640
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,870
He told me you were shopping.

641
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:51,783
Cinzia is getting melon and prosciutto -
That's ham.

642
00:55:51,904 --> 00:55:54,041
You eat it cold
and don't have to cook it.

643
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:57,114
- Who's Cinzia?
- Cinzia is our maid.

644
00:55:57,282 --> 00:56:01,964
- She doesn't know how to cook.
- So I see. Where is your father?

645
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:05,076
He is doing the laundry at the Laundromat.

646
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,831
We have to bring our clothes there.
Cinzia doesn't know how to wash.

647
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,000
- What does she do?
- Everything.

648
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:26,191
- They have been married for 15 years.
- What happened?

649
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:28,953
Mr Winters, your first batch is dry.

650
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:32,002
Would you put it
over on the table, please?

651
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:37,044
Harry told her that he was going
to night baseball games every night.

652
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:40,886
Every night?
That's an awful lot of baseball.

653
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:44,584
He carried a portable radio
so he could keep up with the games

654
00:56:44,728 --> 00:56:47,156
in case she asked him any questions.

655
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:50,251
They are sneaky... Men.

656
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,540
- So Gertrude followed him.
- Naturally.

657
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,466
He met this blonde at this motel.

658
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,351
Took a room?

659
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:03,168
Do you know anybody that goes
to a motel to sit in the lobby?

660
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,218
Well, she listened at the door.

661
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:11,116
The bases were loaded
and there were two out.

662
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:14,100
So she peaks through the keyhole.

663
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,829
Pretty dirty, it needs another...

664
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:29,268
Bases loaded, two out.

665
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:33,110
- I'll tell you later.
- Hi.

666
00:57:33,505 --> 00:57:36,874
I've been looking for you.
Can we go someplace and talk?

667
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,170
My laundry is in for another inning,
is it important?

668
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:44,659
Not very. It's just that John and I
are through, I've filed suit.

669
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:57,289
I'll tell you later.
Let me know the final score.

670
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:02,787
I can't say I'm surprised.

671
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:04,901
Any chance of you and John
patching it up?

672
00:58:05,117 --> 00:58:08,310
None. Obviously,
there's another woman.

673
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,215
Is there another man?

674
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:15,321
Now that you bring it up,
yes, there is one.

675
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:18,707
- Do I know him?
- Not very well.

676
00:58:25,694 --> 00:58:29,467
Daddy, come here.
I want to talk to you.

677
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:33,689
- Can I, I mean tonight too?
- Of course.

678
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:36,571
- Even if it doesn't thunder?
- Especially.

679
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:40,845
Isn't that nice?

680
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:48,240
That's a clever idea.
How did you think of that?

681
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:53,828
Once in the Vatican, I was looking up
and I said to myself,

682
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:57,893
"How in the devil
did Michelangelo paint that ceiling?"

683
00:58:58,253 --> 00:59:01,422
I always thought he had a pogo stick.

684
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,039
Isn't that amazing?

685
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:07,209
Now they match. Thank you.

686
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,220
- Who sir, me sir?
- Yes sir, you sir.

687
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:11,867
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?

688
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,310
- Gold Cap.
- Who sir, me sir?

689
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:18,782
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?

690
00:59:18,985 --> 00:59:20,871
Want to get in the game?

691
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:25,649
No. These ropes are shot.
I'm going to change them.

692
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:27,615
You'll set the whole boat adrift.

693
00:59:27,786 --> 00:59:31,196
Angelo is coming tomorrow.
Leave it for someone who knows how.

694
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:36,790
Sure. I forgot for a minute
that I was a lamebrain.

695
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,096
Sometimes you behave like one.

696
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,577
Where did you get all that new rope?

697
00:59:48,348 --> 00:59:52,302
Go to your room.
You're not getting anything to eat tonight.

698
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,436
Thanks. I'm trying to lose weight.

699
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,072
Now, where were we?

700
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,177
Thank you, Michelangelo.
Now everything matches.

701
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:45,813
Help!

702
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:48,899
Help!

703
01:00:51,745 --> 01:00:53,121
Help!

704
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:56,099
Help!

705
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,033
Help!

706
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:01,501
Help!

707
01:01:07,504 --> 01:01:10,409
- Who is it?
- David.

708
01:01:11,394 --> 01:01:12,570
Help!

709
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:29,450
If you want to go down the river
to Aunt Carolyn,

710
01:01:29,574 --> 01:01:31,635
I'll drive you there in the morning.

711
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,213
- I can hitch.
- I'll drive you there.

712
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,550
Now, everybody get some sleep.

713
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,663
Come along, you.

714
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:43,395
Come on, you.

715
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:50,844
Good night, David.

716
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:56,559
- Good night, Roberto.
- Good night, Cinzia.

717
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:00,391
So, you are leaving in the morning?

718
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,465
He doesn't care.

719
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:05,634
Who dived in for you, Aunt Carolyn?

720
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,012
Speak to him. Ask him not to go.

721
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:33,992
That's all he is waiting for.

722
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:37,617
If he wants to, I'm not going to stop him.
I've done my best.

723
01:02:40,187 --> 01:02:45,325
You are like my father.
Completely pig-headed.

724
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:50,151
- Is the right word pig-headed?
- It will do.

725
01:02:50,822 --> 01:02:52,480
David is a child.

726
01:02:52,824 --> 01:02:55,457
Do you know what it is
for a child to be alone?

727
01:02:55,673 --> 01:02:57,162
I know.

728
01:02:58,497 --> 01:03:03,117
He has been terribly hurt.
He loved his mother very much.

729
01:03:03,668 --> 01:03:07,343
After all this you expect him
to be grown-up like you?

730
01:03:08,048 --> 01:03:10,944
Grown-up, pompous
and knowing everything.

731
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:12,721
Pig-headed.

732
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:20,237
All right, I'll talk to him in the morning.

733
01:03:21,053 --> 01:03:23,382
In my own pig-headed way.

734
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:33,275
- A little bit pig-headed is all right.
- You ought to know.

735
01:03:39,638 --> 01:03:40,829
Daddy...

736
01:03:41,438 --> 01:03:43,535
When are you coming to bed?

737
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:46,096
I'll be right there, darling.

738
01:03:47,337 --> 01:03:50,872
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

739
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:16,837
What's going on?
How did we get out here?

740
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,171
Why didn't you awaken me?
My alarm-clock didn't go off.

741
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:26,348
Stop that singing, stop it.

742
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:30,256
- Tell me, what happened?
- We broke loose in the wind.

743
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:34,194
Now we're stuck or we could have
floated all the way to the ocean.

744
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:37,532
We could have had one of those
economy cruises to Europe.

745
01:05:39,212 --> 01:05:40,725
Please, stop singing!

746
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:43,630
Why didn't you awaken me?

747
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,323
- What would you do?
- Well, I would have...

748
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,585
I don't know.

749
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:52,658
- What kind of a bird is that?
- Who cares?

750
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:56,332
I have an appointment
and I can't be late.

751
01:05:56,596 --> 01:05:59,910
Someone will come soon,
perhaps Angelo. So we wait.

752
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,896
<i>- Dolce far niente.</i>
- That's wonderful. <i>Dolce far niente.</i>

753
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:08,193
- What does that mean?
- It's a saying. "How sweet to do nothing."

754
01:06:08,314 --> 01:06:10,595
In America
they can pull you in for that.

755
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,851
Poor Americans.
Is it all right?

756
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:17,560
- Look at me, I'm swimming.
- It's wonderful.

757
01:06:17,737 --> 01:06:19,777
That's enough.

758
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:24,409
- Marvellous.
- You were to speak with David.

759
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:28,868
I haven't got time.
I have to get off this boat.

760
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,028
You have plenty of time.

761
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:33,933
You didn't cut that rope, did you?

762
01:06:34,317 --> 01:06:36,046
You have got the knife.

763
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,171
- Come on, let's have breakfast.
- We've had breakfast.

764
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:41,785
I had bacon...

765
01:06:51,188 --> 01:06:52,710
Catch anything?

766
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:57,128
I used to fish in this river
when I was a kid.

767
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,474
What's this?
The Huckleberry Finn approach?

768
01:07:04,163 --> 01:07:06,372
As a matter of fact,
I didn't know very much about it.

769
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,789
Messy business.

770
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:10,574
Had to get my sister
to help me take them off the hook.

771
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:14,248
She enjoyed it.
Blood-thirsty little creature.

772
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:18,282
Shouldn't you have cast that out further?

773
01:07:18,714 --> 01:07:20,563
Are you going to teach me
how to fish too,

774
01:07:20,779 --> 01:07:23,548
just like everything I try to do?

775
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,821
Like I was a real lamebrain.

776
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:29,265
- Sorry.
- I'll pay you for the rowboat.

777
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:33,168
I'll pay you for the house, too.
Someday. I'll save up.

778
01:07:33,522 --> 01:07:36,001
All right. If you want to.

779
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,692
- You're baiting that all wrong.
- What's wrong with it?

780
01:07:42,531 --> 01:07:46,302
You don't lay it on.
You got to put it on here.

781
01:07:48,453 --> 01:07:51,032
You must have worked
your little sister to pieces.

782
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,313
That's very kind of you.

783
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:55,594
Thank you.

784
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:02,919
- How's that?
- Terrible.

785
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:07,264
- What's wrong with it?
- You just can't cast.

786
01:08:07,722 --> 01:08:11,177
- All right, show me. Go ahead.
- All right.

787
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:19,173
That's pretty good.

788
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:26,687
- Wait, I think I've got something.
- Reel in. Set the hook.

789
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:29,440
Come on, reel in.

790
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:33,052
Don't reel in so fast, you'll lose him.

791
01:08:39,006 --> 01:08:42,420
- It must be a big one.
- It sure looks it.

792
01:08:44,718 --> 01:08:46,161
Take it off.

793
01:08:47,846 --> 01:08:51,132
Here! Here, give it to me.

794
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:54,518
You don't even know
how to take a fish off the hook.

795
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:02,984
Everything I try to do,
every little thing.

796
01:09:03,153 --> 01:09:08,313
- Sometimes you gotta.
- I guess sometimes you "gotta".

797
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:18,048
I think the striped perch
is the prettiest thing there is.

798
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:21,482
I think it's practically a shame to catch it.

799
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,435
Look at it. It's dead already.

800
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:26,884
Why does everything have to die?

801
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:29,982
For the same reason
that everything has to live.

802
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:34,352
That's what I get from my teachers.
Double talk.

803
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:38,361
Think what the world would be like
if nothing ever died.

804
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:42,491
There would be no room for the new
and beautiful that's being born.

805
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:45,109
I'm not making room for anyone.

806
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:47,173
Let them come and get me.

807
01:09:47,572 --> 01:09:51,039
That's encouraging.
You sound as if you enjoy living.

808
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,464
It's better than nothing.

809
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:59,583
I have to die some day,
probably a long time before you.

810
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:03,117
- It doesn't bother me much.
- Who are you making room for?

811
01:10:04,214 --> 01:10:08,423
It might be another William Shakespeare
or a George Washington.

812
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:11,064
Or even a lamebrain like you.

813
01:10:12,601 --> 01:10:16,299
But I prefer to think
that no one ever really leaves.

814
01:10:16,515 --> 01:10:18,124
When you're dead, you're dead.

815
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:20,597
Take another look at that fish.

816
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:24,271
I can see there is more than one
pig-headed member of this family.

817
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:30,681
Let me try to explain it to you.
Here, hold on.

818
01:10:32,284 --> 01:10:34,276
See this pitcher?

819
01:10:34,452 --> 01:10:38,605
Try to think of this pitcher as being me.
My body.

820
01:10:38,874 --> 01:10:42,855
The pitcher has no use at all
except as a container for something.

821
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:47,969
In this case it contains water which
you can think of as my life force.

822
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,355
- Try to lose that.
- OK.

823
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:53,708
- Got it?
- It's easy.

824
01:10:57,309 --> 01:10:58,438
There.

825
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:03,432
The only thing is it isn't lost.

826
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:07,599
It's part of the whole river.
It's still in the universe.

827
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:11,500
- You haven't lost it. Get rid of it.
- What about this?

828
01:11:12,028 --> 01:11:14,902
Look out.
What about it?

829
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:20,445
I get the idea.
It will evaporate, become a cloud

830
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,713
and come down someplace else as rain.

831
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:27,731
- That's pretty clever of you.
- I guess you can't lose anything.

832
01:11:28,068 --> 01:11:30,829
You're right.
Probably not even life itself.

833
01:11:31,045 --> 01:11:33,638
It's just that everything
is constantly changing.

834
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:38,416
Perhaps when our life force,
our souls, leave our bodies,

835
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:40,289
we go back into God's universe

836
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:43,483
in the security of being part
of all life again.

837
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:48,045
For all we know, that sort of life
after death may be beautiful.

838
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:50,134
If you say so.

839
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:57,987
Pop, don't do anything beautiful
for a while, will you?

840
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:04,084
- I'll try not to.
- And give up smoking.

841
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,285
It's bad for older people.

842
01:12:09,005 --> 01:12:12,272
I'll just go in and get my orange juice.
Keep up my strength.

843
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,761
Hey, David.
Ahoy there.

844
01:12:24,646 --> 01:12:28,264
- Grab a hold of this line.
- OK. Throw here.

845
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:32,729
I've got it.
How do you like what happened to us?

846
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:36,019
- Where's your father?
- He's inside.

847
01:12:39,911 --> 01:12:42,766
That's about the fourth time
this summer it's broken loose.

848
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,951
Where's the Italian pastry?

849
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,616
The Italian pastry is inside.

850
01:12:48,288 --> 01:12:51,959
I found your knife the other day,
you must have dropped it.

851
01:12:52,132 --> 01:12:54,555
Thanks, I've been looking all over for it.

852
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,668
I stole it from you.

853
01:12:57,179 --> 01:13:00,390
- What?
- You can tell the police if you want to.

854
01:13:00,678 --> 01:13:04,016
Do you think I'm crazy?
I don't even remember where I got it from.

855
01:13:04,496 --> 01:13:06,681
- Have you got that tied fast?
- Yeah.

856
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:10,258
About that rope.
I took it from your boat yesterday.

857
01:13:10,475 --> 01:13:12,807
If we're going to play true confessions,

858
01:13:12,986 --> 01:13:15,469
I've got about 15 years head start.

859
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:19,095
We'll have to wait for the tide.
About an hour and a half.

860
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:21,568
You're going to be late for your office.

861
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,473
What's the difference?
<i>Dolce far niente.</i>

862
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:29,011
- <i>Paisà.</i>
- Not yet, but I'm getting there.

863
01:13:48,868 --> 01:13:50,813
It's wonderful.

864
01:13:51,274 --> 01:13:54,222
It shows what can be accomplished
with cheap child labour.

865
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,864
It's about time. Get downstairs.

866
01:13:57,008 --> 01:13:59,985
We'll take the ladder.
How about you?

867
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,731
I'll take the steps.
I forgot to wear my blue jeans tonight.

868
01:14:03,923 --> 01:14:07,597
- I love you madly.
- Good night.

869
01:14:07,749 --> 01:14:09,325
We'd better hurry.

870
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,567
I can hear them tuning up
over at the Country Club already.

871
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,041
Tom, I want you to know
I'm very flattered.

872
01:14:19,362 --> 01:14:20,947
But, whatever got you out of your shell?

873
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:24,180
Even a hermit needs
a change of scenery occasionally.

874
01:14:24,349 --> 01:14:26,085
And this is very pretty scenery.

875
01:14:26,373 --> 01:14:29,014
Alice knew how I felt about you
all along.

876
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:33,192
- Is it all right to mention her now?
- Is it all right to mention John?

877
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,942
- Only with a snarl.
- I can manage a snarl for John.

878
01:14:37,112 --> 01:14:40,828
It's so nice to have you back.
So very nice.

879
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:44,693
- Miss Jibson.
- Gibson.

880
01:14:44,838 --> 01:14:46,662
Gibson... You have overlooked.

881
01:14:46,854 --> 01:14:49,400
You're so right, "I have overlooked."

882
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:53,416
Good night, Cinzia.
Will you see that the children get to bed?

883
01:14:53,587 --> 01:14:56,603
Yes, Signor Winters,
I shall out the lights in half an hour.

884
01:14:56,819 --> 01:15:00,421
- You do that. You out the lights.
- It is the wrong word?

885
01:15:00,589 --> 01:15:04,911
- It's charmingly the wrong word.
- I shall turn out the lights in half an hour.

886
01:15:05,056 --> 01:15:06,231
Congratulations.

887
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:09,641
I bet if you really tried you could learn
how to do the laundry too.

888
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:29,785
- Elizabeth is sleeping.
- Good.

889
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:32,595
I found my old English book
you asked me for.

890
01:15:32,811 --> 01:15:34,756
I was using it for a doorstop.

891
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:36,990
Teach me.

892
01:15:39,049 --> 01:15:41,504
Why do you want to learn English?

893
01:15:41,718 --> 01:15:43,785
You've got a really cute accent.

894
01:15:44,121 --> 01:15:46,841
- Charming?
- Yeah, charming.

895
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:49,331
I spit on charming. Teach me!

896
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:55,670
This will be the first time for both of us.

897
01:15:56,441 --> 01:16:00,309
"Adjectives and Adverbs."
Do you want to go that deep?

898
01:16:00,487 --> 01:16:01,487
Yes.

899
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:04,602
"An adjective modifies a noun
or a pronoun.

900
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:08,283
"An adverb modifies a verb,
adjective or other adverb.

901
01:16:08,453 --> 01:16:10,576
"Like cautious and cautiously."

902
01:16:10,747 --> 01:16:13,416
Cautious and cautiously.

903
01:16:14,182 --> 01:16:18,708
- Do you like your Aunt Carolyn?
- Sure thing, she's cool.

904
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:21,410
Your father likes her
very much, doesn't he?

905
01:16:21,698 --> 01:16:25,108
I suppose.
She's a lot like our mother used to be.

906
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:27,412
The way she talks and everything.

907
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:30,534
I mean, they were sisters.

908
01:16:32,144 --> 01:16:34,856
Am I teaching you English or ain't I?

909
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:37,689
Yes, go on, <i>Signor Professore.</i>

910
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:41,110
"Poor, poorly. Great, greatly."

911
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,907
- Something wrong?
- What?

912
01:16:46,074 --> 01:16:49,022
- Something wrong?
- No, I know this music very well.

913
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:52,744
It is most pretty.
Is that correct - most pretty?

914
01:16:53,152 --> 01:16:56,010
- Very pretty.
- Thanks. Very pretty.

915
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:02,517
It's an old cornball.
"Almost In Your Arms".

916
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:06,541
In Italy we call it
<i>"Quasi nelle tue braccia."</i>

917
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:15,170
- How does it go in English?
- "How we are changed

918
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:18,796
"by things that seem

919
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,940
"so small.

920
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,035
"One look

921
01:17:25,447 --> 01:17:28,780
"can write a book.

922
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:34,027
"One touch can say..."

923
01:17:36,108 --> 01:17:39,493
"Different, differently.
Beautiful, beautifully.

924
01:17:41,713 --> 01:17:45,016
"Different, differently.
Beautiful, beautifully."

925
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:50,082
- Come on, it's not that hard.
- Well, it is for me.

926
01:17:50,635 --> 01:17:54,572
I haven't learned any English tonight,
but I've learned one thing.

927
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,927
It's time for me to go home.

928
01:17:58,104 --> 01:18:00,143
Go to bed, David. Good night.

929
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:05,834
Good night.

930
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:09,564
Is it all right if I sit here for a while?
I'm not sleepy.

931
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:11,884
- Sure.
- "...ly".

932
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:13,277
Surely.

933
01:18:21,586 --> 01:18:23,938
- Hello there.
- Look, presents.

934
01:18:24,256 --> 01:18:27,203
Why shouldn't we celebrate Christmas
on the 4th of July?

935
01:18:27,347 --> 01:18:31,460
One for you.
One for you and there, one for you.

936
01:18:31,618 --> 01:18:33,494
- Who sir, me sir?
- Yes sir, you sir.

937
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:36,783
- No sir, not I sir.
- Who then sir?

938
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:45,428
Come in.

939
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:51,911
Are you really leaving in the morning?

940
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:54,360
Any hope of you changing your mind?

941
01:18:56,953 --> 01:18:59,978
Before you go, I want you to know
how grateful I am to you and...

942
01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:02,523
- That's a present for you.
- For what?

943
01:19:03,378 --> 01:19:04,444
For everything.

944
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:08,705
With that fine Italian hand
that can't cook or do the laundry,

945
01:19:08,884 --> 01:19:10,999
you've managed
to put a family together.

946
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,848
I thank you with all my heart.

947
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:18,930
- It's a dress.
- I see.

948
01:19:19,691 --> 01:19:23,230
- It's unusual.
- Carolyn helped me pick it out.

949
01:19:23,581 --> 01:19:25,142
Of course.

950
01:19:25,814 --> 01:19:28,287
I thought it was a little gaudy
with those flowers,

951
01:19:28,575 --> 01:19:30,856
but she thought
you might prefer it that way.

952
01:19:31,323 --> 01:19:33,497
Carolyn is a very knowing woman.

953
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:37,699
You are an attractive girl
and you'll look well in that.

954
01:19:38,131 --> 01:19:39,446
Thank you.

955
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,333
I've got another surprise for you.

956
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:44,903
How would you like
to go to a dance tonight?

957
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:47,586
I would love to, yes.

958
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,953
- Angelo will pick you up at 8:00.
- Angelo?

959
01:19:51,259 --> 01:19:54,243
He's been dying to take you
to the Sons of Italy Ball.

960
01:19:54,387 --> 01:19:56,552
I hear it's a very nice affair,

961
01:19:56,723 --> 01:19:59,669
so I took the liberty of accepting
the invitation for you.

962
01:20:00,438 --> 01:20:03,511
You've got to get out
and have a good time.

963
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,449
You're in the United States now.

964
01:20:08,674 --> 01:20:12,419
Three cheers
for the red, white and blue.

965
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:02,434
Daddy, are you taking Cinzia
to the dance tonight?

966
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,516
Not Cinzia,
there are lots of dances tonight.

967
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:08,951
I'm taking Aunt Carolyn
to the Country Club dance.

968
01:21:09,129 --> 01:21:11,727
Is that getting to be a thing
with you and her?

969
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:15,398
- How would you like me to answer that?
- Any way you want to.

970
01:21:15,498 --> 01:21:18,215
Greetings, everybody.

971
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:25,011
- Is the dame ready?
- The lady is finishing dressing.

972
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:29,183
Cinzia, your date is here.
Straining at the leash.

973
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:36,218
Good evening, Mr Donatello.

974
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,499
Holy jumping cow.

975
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:43,301
- What a dress.
- You've certainly improved that dress.

976
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:45,294
Will you assist me?

977
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:48,175
This is the necklace my mother wore,

978
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:50,528
the night my father proposed to her.

979
01:21:50,879 --> 01:21:54,298
- Proposed?
- I've never had it on before.

980
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:57,515
Excuse me,
I just remembered something.

981
01:21:58,668 --> 01:22:00,963
My brother is very sick, very sick.

982
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:03,782
I was bringing him these flowers.

983
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:06,466
That's what I came over
to talk to you about.

984
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:09,929
My apologies, forgive me.
Shoot me.

985
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:12,546
But I'm not taking you to no dance.

986
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:18,765
Angelo. I thought
we had everything arranged.

987
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:21,046
You saw that dress,

988
01:22:21,214 --> 01:22:23,760
she's sharp-shooting
with her old lady's necklace.

989
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:27,329
There's nothing wrong about that.
She's a very nice girl, isn't she?

990
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:32,125
- And that can louse up an evening.
- What have you got against nice girls?

991
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:36,485
I have a good business, I make
a nice dollar, I own my own truck.

992
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:38,812
If I want to have a good time,
I go out and have it.

993
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,804
A blonde one night,
brunette the next.

994
01:22:41,972 --> 01:22:44,671
Smorgasbord.
You like a guy who speaks plain?

995
01:22:44,771 --> 01:22:45,975
Yes, I do.

996
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:51,132
Are you worried that her intentions
are honourable?

997
01:22:51,444 --> 01:22:52,909
It worries me sick.

998
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:57,567
I can feel myself slipping
right into community property.

999
01:22:57,759 --> 01:23:00,112
Go inside,
you're driving me nuts.

1000
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:02,105
It's a free country.

1001
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:05,106
She's beautiful.

1002
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:07,870
She is a delightful girl
and she works very hard.

1003
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:10,198
She deserves an evening out.

1004
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,174
Cut it out, will you?

1005
01:23:14,588 --> 01:23:18,502
My brother once took a dame
like that to the Sons of Italy Ball.

1006
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:20,017
He's married.

1007
01:23:20,185 --> 01:23:23,552
Ever since he's been having
sons of Italy all over the place.

1008
01:23:23,722 --> 01:23:25,612
Six kids, doctor bills.

1009
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:28,709
His wife is getting fat and sloppy.
Who needs it?

1010
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:33,559
You have to settle down one day.
If only from exhaustion.

1011
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:37,833
I'm young yet,
I don't want to be old tomorrow.

1012
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,802
You're beautiful and I love you.

1013
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,899
I never want to see you again.

1014
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,085
Extraordinary.

1015
01:23:55,253 --> 01:23:58,243
I've never seen a man
behave so stupidly.

1016
01:23:58,555 --> 01:24:00,259
Haven't you?

1017
01:24:10,977 --> 01:24:16,947
- Ahoy. Is this ship one of ours?
- Ready for the big dance?

1018
01:24:17,091 --> 01:24:19,817
- Don't you want a drink first?
- Prepare to board.

1019
01:24:19,986 --> 01:24:22,924
- I think you've had enough, Alan.
- One teeny, weenie Martini

1020
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:27,272
and then we all head
for the Country Club, right?

1021
01:24:30,177 --> 01:24:33,323
Maybe we should stay here.
This is prettier than the Country Club.

1022
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,409
This is nice.

1023
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:41,292
- Who is she?
- That's the maid.

1024
01:24:41,392 --> 01:24:44,668
I understand she sleeps in.

1025
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,537
That's not very funny, Alan.

1026
01:24:47,973 --> 01:24:51,547
You have been asking for it.
The whole town is talking.

1027
01:24:52,628 --> 01:24:54,470
I love your new uniform.

1028
01:24:54,646 --> 01:24:56,517
What do you wear on your day off?

1029
01:24:56,877 --> 01:25:00,101
We have to get rid of Sadie the scrubber.

1030
01:25:00,277 --> 01:25:03,889
This, ladies and gentleman,
is what I call a maid.

1031
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:07,860
There are those who require alcohol
to give them courage,

1032
01:25:08,034 --> 01:25:09,915
I'm not one of them.

1033
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:12,629
Is it dry enough?

1034
01:25:17,503 --> 01:25:19,784
You think of an answer
in the morning, dear.

1035
01:25:19,952 --> 01:25:22,785
She must be used to it by now.

1036
01:25:23,049 --> 01:25:24,826
You'd better get off the boat.

1037
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:28,644
Carolyn, I'll take you
to the Country Club in my car.

1038
01:25:31,814 --> 01:25:35,175
- Don't you want to go with me?
- Not until you grow up.

1039
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:39,377
What do you expect people
to think about the girl?

1040
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,418
What do you think, Carolyn?

1041
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:48,693
Thank you and good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1042
01:25:56,977 --> 01:25:58,908
Go away, whoever.

1043
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:04,996
You should have pushed him in the water.

1044
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,847
Are you crying?

1045
01:26:12,872 --> 01:26:14,722
Anybody does anything to you again,

1046
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:16,858
just let me know, no matter who.

1047
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:17,980
Whom.

1048
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,271
Who.

1049
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:22,156
Who.

1050
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:28,960
Why do I only have to be 13 years old?

1051
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:31,024
Why do I have to be a little kid?

1052
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,573
Otherwise I could take you to that dance.

1053
01:26:33,745 --> 01:26:36,955
You are my professor,
not a little kid.

1054
01:26:38,372 --> 01:26:42,670
- Do you want to go fishing for eels?
- I can't think of anything nicer.

1055
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:46,584
Maybe you can make peanut butter
sandwiches, they are easy.

1056
01:26:48,216 --> 01:26:51,986
- No, I think I'd better make them.
- I'll make them.

1057
01:26:52,226 --> 01:26:54,345
I'll go and get the spears and lights

1058
01:26:54,516 --> 01:26:56,044
and I'll meet you on the deck.

1059
01:26:57,102 --> 01:27:01,422
This is going to be a pretty good
4th of July after all.

1060
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:22,543
Cinzia, I think I should apologise

1061
01:27:22,711 --> 01:27:26,034
for the behaviour
of the upper classes in America.

1062
01:27:26,339 --> 01:27:28,723
They behave
like the upper classes in Italy.

1063
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:30,740
Also the lower classes.

1064
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:36,214
Would you help me with...

1065
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,615
This stud is stuck here.

1066
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,680
Thank you.

1067
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:50,693
Cinzia, would you do me a favour?

1068
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:56,071
Will you do me the honour of
accompanying me to the dance tonight?

1069
01:27:57,416 --> 01:28:00,945
- Me? I?
- Yes.

1070
01:28:01,618 --> 01:28:05,844
- With you?
- Me... I.

1071
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:09,253
Of course, yes, thank you.

1072
01:28:12,879 --> 01:28:17,945
- I should have asked you, do you dance?
- We are quite advanced in Italy.

1073
01:28:30,946 --> 01:28:35,113
- Do you feel better?
- We'll get you some solid food.

1074
01:28:57,179 --> 01:29:00,762
There are quite a few stuffy people
at some of these dances.

1075
01:29:00,934 --> 01:29:04,635
- Would you prefer to go somewhere else?
- They are not the only stuffy people.

1076
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:08,176
- Would you prefer to go somewhere else?
- No.

1077
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:11,346
I'm certain you wouldn't do anything
to embarrass me.

1078
01:29:11,706 --> 01:29:13,531
Or would you?

1079
01:29:15,812 --> 01:29:19,221
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, she would do.

1080
01:29:21,997 --> 01:29:25,128
The evening is starting out fine,
I can see that.

1081
01:29:30,839 --> 01:29:32,475
Don't be confused.

1082
01:29:32,619 --> 01:29:35,309
No, I've sworn off.

1083
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,460
I'm only taking that stuff externally now.

1084
01:29:37,637 --> 01:29:42,216
My compliments to you.
Don't report that to the union.

1085
01:29:42,392 --> 01:29:45,681
I've sobered up a little
and would like to apologise.

1086
01:29:45,937 --> 01:29:50,051
May I say that if everyone brought their
maids instead of their wives,

1087
01:29:50,244 --> 01:29:54,398
- I'd pay up my back dues.
- You may say that.

1088
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:56,943
Am I forgiven enough to have this dance?

1089
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:01,505
- Would it embarrass you?
- I've gone past that.

1090
01:30:04,956 --> 01:30:07,580
Hello. They've got quite a buffet.

1091
01:30:07,772 --> 01:30:10,509
Would you care to come over
and watch me eat crow?

1092
01:30:10,677 --> 01:30:13,750
- Hello, Carolyn.
- Won't you dance with me?

1093
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,172
Of course.

1094
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:24,747
Tom, I'm sorry.

1095
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:28,474
I'll go away and I'll vanish
into thin air if you just tell me,

1096
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:30,805
are you in love with her?

1097
01:30:32,651 --> 01:30:33,991
Cinzia?

1098
01:30:34,361 --> 01:30:36,417
She is David's girl.

1099
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:38,914
If you were in love with her,

1100
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:40,739
would you know
you were in love with her?

1101
01:30:43,236 --> 01:30:45,180
It's just that I've waited so long.

1102
01:30:45,517 --> 01:30:47,270
Since I was four years old.

1103
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,815
Then my sister beat me to it.

1104
01:30:50,703 --> 01:30:52,720
Would you care
if we didn't dance any more?

1105
01:30:53,008 --> 01:30:58,122
- Am I stepping on your toes?
- All my life, mister. All my life.

1106
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:12,769
Tom, if you don't marry me,
you're likely to do something foolish.

1107
01:31:15,266 --> 01:31:16,875
I know.

1108
01:31:17,187 --> 01:31:19,110
You don't take a girl
out of another world

1109
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:21,125
and try to make her part of yours.

1110
01:31:21,317 --> 01:31:23,718
You may try, but you just don't.

1111
01:31:23,886 --> 01:31:27,570
If it didn't work out, the children
would be in worse shape than ever.

1112
01:31:27,747 --> 01:31:30,225
They would be rowing across the river
in squadrons.

1113
01:31:30,417 --> 01:31:32,218
Why don't you take an oar, too?

1114
01:31:33,395 --> 01:31:36,804
I swore that one tried marriage
was enough,

1115
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:39,757
but perhaps it's time to reconsider.

1116
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,822
Because the children like me?

1117
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:47,179
Not only that, there are times
you bring out the beast in me.

1118
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:49,242
Likewise, Tom.

1119
01:31:49,478 --> 01:31:52,195
I know you are not
madly in love with me,

1120
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:54,978
but maybe that would come in time.

1121
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:57,430
Are you willing to take me on that basis?

1122
01:31:57,861 --> 01:32:02,190
On any basis, Tom.
That's how the mighty have fallen.

1123
01:32:42,787 --> 01:32:44,659
Thank you very much.

1124
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,750
I'm delighted you are the belle of the ball,
but may I have this dance?

1125
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:52,509
I believe that I am the fellow
that brought you.

1126
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:55,488
Yes, you are the stuffy one.

1127
01:33:03,468 --> 01:33:08,694
It's a lovely evening.
Thank you so much for bringing me.

1128
01:33:20,068 --> 01:33:23,235
There is something I should tell you.

1129
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:27,639
Yes?

1130
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:31,889
What?

1131
01:33:32,747 --> 01:33:33,978
What?

1132
01:33:36,955 --> 01:33:39,332
There is something you wish to tell me?

1133
01:33:47,184 --> 01:33:48,577
There is?

1134
01:33:54,939 --> 01:33:56,692
How have you been, Tom?

1135
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:47,523
Hey, Tom.

1136
01:34:47,691 --> 01:34:52,444
Carolyn just told us the good news.
Congratulations.

1137
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:56,839
- How much for the houseboat?
- They will live on it after they are married.

1138
01:34:57,008 --> 01:35:00,273
- For this, I'm going off the wagon.
- That's a short trip.

1139
01:35:01,978 --> 01:35:03,202
Married?

1140
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:06,002
That was what I was about to tell you.

1141
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,302
Do me the honour to go straight to hell.

1142
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,423
If I don't say it right, I don't care.

1143
01:35:24,092 --> 01:35:26,325
Tom, what's the matter?

1144
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,750
Carolyn, I've been terribly stupid.

1145
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:32,280
I'm sorry. Since you were
four years old, I'm sorry.

1146
01:37:31,736 --> 01:37:35,913
Good morning.
Well, somebody say something.

1147
01:37:36,105 --> 01:37:38,578
"The morning's at 7:00,
God is in heaven,

1148
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:41,194
"all is right with the world."
That is correct?

1149
01:37:41,315 --> 01:37:45,285
- I've given up teaching.
- There is much yet for me to learn.

1150
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:50,319
- You learn pretty fast.
- I don't think I want any breakfast.

1151
01:37:50,589 --> 01:37:52,336
At least one thing I've learned.

1152
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,265
I can make boiled eggs and cereal.

1153
01:37:55,505 --> 01:37:59,717
I just pour in milk
and it goes crack, pop and snap.

1154
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:04,461
Even I cannot spoil it.
Is your father awake?

1155
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:07,367
No, he's sleeping.

1156
01:38:07,655 --> 01:38:10,560
I poked him a few times,
but he's still sleeping.

1157
01:38:10,752 --> 01:38:13,102
He must have been crock.

1158
01:38:14,642 --> 01:38:18,029
If it's all right with you,
can I have my English book back?

1159
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,323
I'm the dumbest one in the class.

1160
01:38:20,494 --> 01:38:23,238
- I'd better start to study.
- All right.

1161
01:38:24,414 --> 01:38:25,951
I'm going to get some air.

1162
01:38:26,288 --> 01:38:28,761
David, I am not leaving today.

1163
01:38:28,977 --> 01:38:31,210
Perhaps later we can go fishing together?

1164
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:35,340
You don't want to go fishing with me,
I'm just a kid.

1165
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:42,096
I bet you think you're beautiful.
Well, you're not.

1166
01:38:42,265 --> 01:38:46,457
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest old girl I ever saw.

1167
01:38:59,574 --> 01:39:02,208
Roberto, eat your breakfast.

1168
01:39:02,327 --> 01:39:03,984
I don't want to.

1169
01:39:06,362 --> 01:39:08,365
Did you kiss him?

1170
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,077
- Who?
- Daddy.

1171
01:39:16,447 --> 01:39:18,487
Yes, I did.

1172
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:23,385
- That's what David said.
- Did he kiss you?

1173
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:29,052
Yes, he kissed me.
I want to tell you something.

1174
01:39:29,316 --> 01:39:32,798
- I'm in love with your father.
- He loves you?

1175
01:39:33,278 --> 01:39:35,679
I believe so. I hope so.

1176
01:39:36,194 --> 01:39:39,569
I want you to know something.
We might get married.

1177
01:39:39,857 --> 01:39:41,648
Would that make you our mother?

1178
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:45,570
I would be most happy to be
your father's wife and your mother.

1179
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:48,669
You can't be our mother.
You are our friend.

1180
01:39:49,629 --> 01:39:53,255
One can be a friend and a mother.
Of course, it's most unusual.

1181
01:39:53,447 --> 01:39:57,085
You can't be our mother.
You don't look like our mother.

1182
01:39:57,185 --> 01:40:01,923
You can't even cook an egg.
What kind of a mother are you?

1183
01:40:02,067 --> 01:40:04,612
- Roberto.
- Don't call me any Italian name.

1184
01:40:04,781 --> 01:40:07,566
My mother is dead!

1185
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:21,924
I'm very sorry.
I don't mean to take her place.

1186
01:40:22,452 --> 01:40:24,637
Perhaps you can explain to Roberto later.

1187
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,113
He wouldn't listen.
He'll just get that harmonica

1188
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,832
and he won't listen to anybody.

1189
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,708
I don't think I can eat either.

1190
01:40:38,924 --> 01:40:42,294
- Listen. About married people.
- What?

1191
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,143
Do they sleep in the same bed together?

1192
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:50,473
In America, sometimes.
In Italy, always.

1193
01:40:50,689 --> 01:40:53,619
Would it matter if I slept with you?

1194
01:40:54,147 --> 01:40:56,308
No, it would be all right.

1195
01:40:56,483 --> 01:41:01,230
- But not all the time.
- Why not? I don't take up much room.

1196
01:41:02,364 --> 01:41:04,856
It has something to do with married people.

1197
01:41:05,096 --> 01:41:07,943
I guess he likes you
better than he likes me.

1198
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:10,907
Why do you talk like that?

1199
01:41:12,749 --> 01:41:15,833
Yes, he does.
He didn't even want me in there

1200
01:41:16,002 --> 01:41:18,134
when it was lightning
and I was afraid.

1201
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:21,229
I hate him.
You go ahead, see if I care.

1202
01:41:21,329 --> 01:41:24,343
He pulls the covers off me anyway.

1203
01:41:45,482 --> 01:41:50,573
I got you a stateroom on the Constitution
leaving New York the day after tomorrow.

1204
01:41:50,981 --> 01:41:54,535
- Will you jump over board?
- I've had my adventure.

1205
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:56,431
I've learned many things.

1206
01:41:56,672 --> 01:41:59,697
Including how difficult it is
to be a father.

1207
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,772
It wasn't easy to cancel
the rest of my tour and come back.

1208
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:10,454
- Is it all right?
- Just perfect.

1209
01:42:10,814 --> 01:42:13,743
We'll go to Como together.
A vacation.

1210
01:42:13,935 --> 01:42:17,897
Then there's a concert at La Scala.
What an ovation we'll get.

1211
01:42:18,231 --> 01:42:21,283
- You will get.
- I will get.

1212
01:42:24,332 --> 01:42:26,037
Are you expecting somebody?

1213
01:42:29,493 --> 01:42:34,153
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Miss Cinzia Zaccardi.

1214
01:42:34,537 --> 01:42:36,002
She's not in.

1215
01:42:37,394 --> 01:42:39,315
Seven years old?

1216
01:42:42,005 --> 01:42:44,213
You left some dirty dishes in the sink.

1217
01:42:44,622 --> 01:42:47,022
Sorry, it was a lovely interlude.

1218
01:42:47,335 --> 01:42:48,992
I enjoyed every minute of it.

1219
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:52,185
Until we both had too much champagne
and spoilt it all.

1220
01:42:52,929 --> 01:42:55,979
- It was just an interlude?
- Yes.

1221
01:42:57,516 --> 01:42:59,771
For one who has had
so much experience lying,

1222
01:42:59,871 --> 01:43:01,789
you're not doing very well now.

1223
01:43:01,981 --> 01:43:04,671
I talked to the children
after I got your note.

1224
01:43:05,403 --> 01:43:08,938
I would like you to meet my father.

1225
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:10,890
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1226
01:43:11,802 --> 01:43:14,731
- I love you very much.
- Some tea?

1227
01:43:15,812 --> 01:43:20,206
- You are in love with me. Aren't you?
- It's excellent tea, I didn't make it.

1228
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:23,615
- One lump or two?
- You stay out of this.

1229
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:26,016
Your children are your friends again.

1230
01:43:26,161 --> 01:43:31,899
- That is the most important thing.
- It is more important to be their father.

1231
01:43:32,115 --> 01:43:36,269
I have my life and my father and I have
finally come to understand him.

1232
01:43:37,494 --> 01:43:41,095
You know you are very beautiful.
Have I told you that before?

1233
01:43:41,576 --> 01:43:43,304
You are really quite beautiful.

1234
01:43:44,121 --> 01:43:48,034
No, I am an ugly old girl.
Please go away.

1235
01:43:53,581 --> 01:43:55,886
I guess she wasn't in after all.

1236
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,957
Come here.

1237
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,383
Cinzia, come out here.

1238
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:16,590
I can lock her in her room.
I can take her to Italy.

1239
01:44:16,766 --> 01:44:20,041
The only way I can keep her
is to let her go away.

1240
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,891
I'm too old
to run after her any more.

1241
01:44:25,107 --> 01:44:28,421
It's your turn.
A terrible time she'll give you.

1242
01:44:29,717 --> 01:44:31,615
Come out here at once!

1243
01:44:32,695 --> 01:44:36,943
If you do one thing ever to hurt her,
or make her cry,

1244
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:41,579
I'll have your heart cut out.
If I have to go to the Mafia.

1245
01:44:41,771 --> 01:44:45,181
- She doesn't want me.
- Zaccardi knows what she wants.

1246
01:44:54,137 --> 01:44:57,838
- I saw him over there.
- Come on down.

1247
01:44:58,016 --> 01:45:02,108
We aren't going to their wedding either,
but you'd better get inside.

1248
01:45:02,373 --> 01:45:05,998
No, I'm going to stay up here
all night and freeze.

1249
01:45:06,358 --> 01:45:11,233
- It's too warm to freeze.
- You're just a girl.

1250
01:45:11,352 --> 01:45:15,891
- OK. Come on down.
- All right.

1251
01:45:22,422 --> 01:45:24,727
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

1252
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:27,056
Did you speak to the children?

1253
01:45:27,796 --> 01:45:30,880
Yes. They are being very pig-headed.

1254
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:33,443
I don't know where they get it from.

1255
01:45:33,718 --> 01:45:37,337
- Please, try again.
- All right.

1256
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:38,965
Thank you.

1257
01:45:49,194 --> 01:45:50,971
Aren't you going to get dressed?

1258
01:45:53,804 --> 01:45:55,341
I know how you feel,

1259
01:45:56,037 --> 01:45:58,702
but nothing ever stays
exactly the same.

1260
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:00,935
Everything changes.

1261
01:46:02,568 --> 01:46:06,002
Everybody has to leave everybody
sooner or later.

1262
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:10,670
It's not so bad.
It's different, but not so bad.

1263
01:46:12,388 --> 01:46:15,750
You will all be leaving me before long
and I have to get used to that.

1264
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:19,736
You can't remain children forever.

1265
01:46:20,072 --> 01:46:24,394
- No matter how much you want to.
- Why do you talk so much?

1266
01:46:24,634 --> 01:46:26,339
Because you make me feel guilty.

1267
01:46:26,483 --> 01:46:29,340
Why should I feel guilty?
You are the ones.

1268
01:46:30,469 --> 01:46:33,014
Why don't you cry or something?
Then I'd feel better.

1269
01:46:36,072 --> 01:46:38,417
Won't you please come to my wedding?

1270
01:46:39,785 --> 01:46:41,274
Cinzia would like it.

1271
01:46:45,884 --> 01:46:47,853
Why do I talk so much?

1272
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:42,718
Would you both kneel, please?

1273
01:47:46,944 --> 01:47:48,975
We are gathered together here

1274
01:47:49,801 --> 01:47:53,763
to join this man and this woman
in bonds of matrimony,

1275
01:47:55,708 --> 01:47:58,325
in the presence of God
and these witnesses

1276
01:47:58,493 --> 01:48:02,359
and by virtue of authority
vested in me by the laws of this state.

1277
01:48:05,412 --> 01:48:10,114
If any of you know any reason
why these two should not be thus joined,

1278
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,668
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1279
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:17,486
Will you take her hand, please?

1280
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:01,546
Do you, Thomas Winters, take this woman
for your lawful and wedded wife?

1281
01:49:02,338 --> 01:49:03,923
That's you, sir.

1282
01:49:04,262 --> 01:49:05,652
Who sir, me sir?

1283
01:49:05,796 --> 01:49:07,428
Yes sir, you sir.

1284
01:49:08,605 --> 01:49:09,734
I do.

1285
01:49:09,902 --> 01:49:14,313
Will you love, honour, cherish,
keep her in sickness and in health,

1286
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:19,818
forsaking all others
so long as you both shall live?

1287
01:49:20,154 --> 01:49:21,307
I will.

1288
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:27,310
- Do you take this man as your husband?
- I do.
