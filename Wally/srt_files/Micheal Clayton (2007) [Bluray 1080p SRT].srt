1
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,770
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,874
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:43,274
<i>And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:46,747
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just --
Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:50,115
<i>Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:52,848
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:55,857
<i>Try and make believe
this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:59,053
<i>...because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,661
<i>Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,358
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,733
<i>...I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:10,670
<i>There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:13,368
<i>...scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:16,480
<i>And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:20,641
<i>...the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,844
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,649
<i>I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,849
<i>...that I'm covered
with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:32,623
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,563
<i>And at first I thought,
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:38,169
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,033
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn. "</i>

25
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,341
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:50,540
<i>...this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:53,585
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion
of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:56,518
<i>...that happens in
the final moment before death. "</i>

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,285
<i>And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

30
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,430
<i>...because I looked back
at the building...</i>

31
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:06,225
<i>...and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,493
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,697
<i>...that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:16,173
<i>...not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,142
<i>...but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:23,944
<i>...whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,486
<i>...the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:31,217
<i>...more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:35,262
<i>And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,626
<i>...for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,634
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,066
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,970
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:51,546
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:55,912
<i>...as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,554
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

47
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:01,748
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:07,229
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

49
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,922
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.</i>

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,332
<i>So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,200
<i>Because I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,706
What does that exactly mean?

53
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:21,277
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:30,049
We found 97.

55
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,756
<i>I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.</i>

56
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:42,093
She will not go away.

57
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,061
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

58
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,333
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,740
<i>...about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:57,280
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,314
...pending and unresolved.

62
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,080
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

63
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:05,747
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

64
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:08,986
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:13,622
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,234
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:19,895
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,564
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

69
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:25,703
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,187
I'll see the turn.

71
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,729
Check.

72
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,503
Check.

73
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,241
Check.

74
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,403
Half the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,276
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:44,656
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,157
We played together a couple times.

78
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,425
That lamp place on Bowery.

79
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,264
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

80
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:55,840
-The Galaxy.
-That's it.

81
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,204
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

82
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:02,608
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

83
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:06,181
-You don't remember me?
-I remember you.

84
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,615
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

85
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,117
You bought some hair too.

86
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,588
With your money.

87
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,857
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,792
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:23,128
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,770
That was a good location.

91
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,771
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept telling me.

92
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,741
Action's on you.

93
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,140
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:37,713
Good to see you again.

95
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,507
Hello?

96
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,948
<i>-Michael.
-Walter.</i>

97
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:16,352
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:20,621
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,696
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:23,854
Just now?

101
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,694
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,928
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,264
Where?

104
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,273
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,467
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:38,511
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,171
Tell him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,614
<i>All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,548
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,282
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,890
I'm walking to the car now.

112
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:52,425
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:56,190
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,799
All right. I'll be in the car.

115
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,155
<i>What they did, see,
they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,124
They widened the street.

117
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:59,196
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:03,859
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

119
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,632
...and they've got these new--
These-- These--

120
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,901
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

121
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:13,342
-That corner there. It is blinding.
-They'll have to work that out.

122
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:16,346
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:21,146
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

124
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,585
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

125
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:28,694
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

126
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,764
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

127
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,525
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

128
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,935
Well, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,665
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,776
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

131
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:44,741
-Not the kind you need.
-What kind is that?

132
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:45,901
A trial lawyer.

133
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,943
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:52,679
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

135
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,847
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:59,756
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

137
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:03,591
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

138
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,825
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,229
I suggest you go local...

140
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:10,270
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

141
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,498
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,701
Hey, you believe this?

143
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:17,176
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 12 years!

144
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:21,078
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

145
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:24,550
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

146
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:26,916
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

147
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,320
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

148
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:32,359
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,432
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

150
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,363
I don't know what Walter
promised you--

151
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:41,994
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:45,267
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

153
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,070
-Well, he misspoke.
-About what?

154
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,838
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,481
Elliot.

156
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,942
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,853
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle....

158
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,852
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

159
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,225
You answer me that!

160
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,946
What if someone had stolen the car?

161
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,280
Happens all the time.

162
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,546
Cops like hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,747
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

164
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,121
Right now there's a B.C.I. unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

165
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,627
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,029
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

167
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,793
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,337
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

169
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,272
There's no play here.

170
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,411
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,243
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,476
The math on this is simple.

173
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,646
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

174
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:07,922
That's the police, isn't it?

175
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:09,495
No.

176
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,992
They don't call.

177
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,103
Hello.

178
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,472
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

179
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:24,112
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,177
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,414
You got a pen?

182
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,010
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,889
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,439
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,008
Did you eat?

186
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:40,078
Dad's down there waiting already.

187
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,111
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,544
Yes, I had a waffle.

189
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,585
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

190
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,085
It's a miracle.

191
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,383
Gloves?

192
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,190
Henry!

193
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,372
Come on.

194
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:10,708
Get in.

195
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,312
Got it?

196
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,715
<i>So no one's even sure
exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:26,054
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

198
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,958
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

199
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,329
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:33,491
Right.

201
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:37,127
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,469
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

203
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,543
This is where they all came.

204
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:45,704
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,907
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,248
-There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
-Okay.

207
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,451
And nobody has any alliances.

208
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,889
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

209
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,051
...maybe the person you're talking to...

210
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,720
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

211
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:04,595
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.

212
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,099
Sounds familiar.

213
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,205
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

214
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:12,536
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

215
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,474
-How much you wanna bet?
-I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,478
-You got your bus pass?
-It's in my locker.

217
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,517
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

218
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,119
-The book?
-Yes.

219
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,687
Bring it on Saturday, I'll....

220
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,087
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,385
Okay.

222
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,961
Well, here we go.

223
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,827
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

224
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:41,463
-See you later, Dad.
-Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,009
Thanks.

226
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:54,810
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,
assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:57,957
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:01,218
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

229
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:03,624
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

230
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:06,322
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

231
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:08,899
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

232
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:11,799
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,715
He says you're still gonna be short.

234
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,613
How short?

235
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,191
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:36,421
-That's liquor and everything?
-What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:39,589
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:43,636
He took $ 1,500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,432
Make a bid.

240
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,666
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,904
Just lying around, no.

242
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,507
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.

243
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,709
Forget that.

244
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:02,187
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

245
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,589
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

246
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:10,362
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:14,230
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:16,201
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,862
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,704
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:26,543
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,614
Make an offer.

253
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:36,423
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

254
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:41,155
But live like that? Even they do a program--
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,323
And then they slip? Forget it.

256
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,867
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,032
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,365
I don't know.

259
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,534
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

260
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,670
I'll ask.

261
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,405
-Hey, Michael.
-Morning, Carl.

262
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:37,919
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,082
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,592
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave
he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:45,095
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,664
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,462
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:53,163
<i>She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,569
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:56,869
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,103
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,806
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,177
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:06,616
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

275
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,688
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

276
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,847
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,185
Thanks.

278
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,988
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,487
We left word.

280
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,826
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

281
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,992
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,831
<i>-This is Miami?
-Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:24,495
And they charged him.

284
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,972
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client....</i>

285
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:33,581
<i>I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,809
<i>-Yeah.
-Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:38,510
<i>-Yeah, let me get a pen.
-Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,315
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:43,720
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,384
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

291
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:49,896
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,624
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,132
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:56,238
<i>None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,500
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

296
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,008
<i>-Can you hang on a minute?
-Yeah, sure.</i>

297
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:04,110
Are we merging?

298
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,777
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:10,045
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

300
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,348
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,083
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

302
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,456
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,757
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

304
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,729
Like I would know.

305
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,596
I don't know.

306
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,432
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,868
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,210
Evan?

309
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,743
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

310
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,884
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,452
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction....

312
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:46,183
<i>At the moment,
U/North currently has 7 0,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,385
<i>...in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,590
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:57,464
<i>Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:03,305
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

317
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:09,148
We have-- We have, right now--
We have--

318
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,547
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

319
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,483
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

320
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,420
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...

321
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,321
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:23,930
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is--

323
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,565
Overwhelming.

324
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:28,968
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,769
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues....

326
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:36,339
It's quite substantial.

327
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,105
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,475
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:46,917
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,421
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:51,822
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:55,452
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

333
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:58,492
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:02,000
<i>...how do you keep a balance
between work and life?</i>

335
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:03,638
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,474
I think that's.... That's something that...

337
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:12,979
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

338
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,947
It's a shifting balance, really.

339
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,282
It's, you know, you.... You try to....

340
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:22,755
<i>When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:24,791
...who needs balance?

342
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:28,386
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

343
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:32,525
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

344
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,864
When Don asked me to take--

345
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,507
When Don Jeffries brought--
Don Jeffries brought me--

346
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,644
Don Jeffries brought me in here
12 years ago...

347
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:43,905
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:47,050
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

349
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:51,553
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

350
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:55,884
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:58,825
But, is it challenging? Yes.

352
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:04,663
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

353
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:09,933
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

354
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:14,102
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

355
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,111
...you're in the wrong place.

356
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:21,379
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and--

357
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,984
We're in the middle of an interview.

358
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:26,125
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,594
Jesus.

360
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:32,093
For chrissake.

361
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,532
You're saying he did this in--?

362
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:36,761
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:39,599
-Barry.
-Hang on.

364
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:45,238
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

365
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:48,578
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,412
<i>...I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:57,388
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,325
<i>...as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,488
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

370
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,430
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:11,060
<i>This moment, today,
here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:15,642
<i>...and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.</i>

373
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,607
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,475
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:24,142
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,051
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:28,224 --> 00:27:30,488
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,
for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:35,794
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

379
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,662
It was-- It was-- It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

380
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:42,930
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

381
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:46,473
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,374
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

383
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:55,279
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:58,717
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,323
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:05,690
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:10,323
I've spent 12% of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

388
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,594
-We had an agreement, Arthur.
-One night.

389
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,705
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:17,204
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:22,142
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

392
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:25,841
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

393
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:29,419
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:33,684
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna....

395
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,157
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:39,559
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:44,828
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year...."

398
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,562
-Arthur.
-No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:50,072
Because it's years! It's lives!

400
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:53,076
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

401
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:57,444
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,016
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:03,519
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

404
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,889
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

405
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:10,053
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,461
-Listen, you promised me.
-Is that it, Michael?

407
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,602
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:18,329
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

409
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,703
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

410
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,537
-That was our agreement.
-Sue me.

411
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:24,905
We okay in there?

412
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,610
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,280
They killed them, Michael.

414
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,653
Those small farms, the family farms.

415
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:40,351
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,553
No.

417
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,824
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

418
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,991
She's God's perfect little creature.

419
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:50,604
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12% of my life...

420
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:54,402
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,340
When did you last take one of these?

422
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:59,242
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

423
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:01,849
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:05,283
-If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
-I have blood on my hands.

425
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,116
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

426
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,987
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

427
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,493
-I'm an accomplice!
-You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:16,966
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:20,359
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

430
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:26,502
<i>We came back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:30,704
<i>...and we were in shock, but we still....
We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,315
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,472
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,677
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:40,449
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,855
<i>-From your mother?
-Yes.</i>

437
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,018
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,359
<i>Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:52,797
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people-- "</i>

440
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:54,199
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,635
<i>-Anna.
-"Down at--</i>

442
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:58,470
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,544
<i>-I'm just....
-Excuse me.</i>

444
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:02,806
<i>-Anna, they're....
-What's he doing?</i>

445
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:05,678
<i>Excuse me. She's a--
No, this is testimony. This is--</i>

446
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:07,842
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,386
<i>You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:12,251
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, I--</i>

449
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:15,018
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:20,098
<i>And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:25,033
<i>...that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:29,005
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,075
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:35,137
<i>-This is my offering!
-No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,543
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:40,243
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are
my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,185
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:46,758
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God--</i>

459
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:56,026
I guess that's it.

460
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,508
When do we get Don?

461
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,638
She said to try back in half an hour.

462
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:10,717
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:14,581
-Closed four minutes ago.
-Shit.

464
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,357
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

465
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:20,791
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:27,129
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:30,371
Michael Raymond Clayton.

468
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,443
<i>Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:39,308
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:42,144
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:45,481
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,283
<i>...in 1977.</i>

473
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:51,827
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:56,990
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,102
<i>1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,204
<i>...Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:05,773
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,376
So he's a partner?

479
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,770
No. He's listed as special counsel.

480
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,974
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

481
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:16,513
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:19,054
<i>He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:22,887
<i>This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:39,407
-Hi.
-Close the door.

485
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:43,872
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,315
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:50,046
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:54,819
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

489
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:58,863
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

490
00:33:59,032 --> 00:34:01,523
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

491
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:05,865
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,008
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:12,475
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

494
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:14,979
All right.

495
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,681
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:20,150
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,289
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

498
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:24,117
-I am.
-Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,487
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,720
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:31,160
Other side wants to talk,
they can call New York.

502
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:34,392
-I need his briefcase.
-Arthur's? I don't-- I didn't see it.

503
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,664
-He said it was in the room.
-It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,632
Find it.

505
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:49,914
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:54,488
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:57,922
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a....</i>

508
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,159
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,892
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

510
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:08,469
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

511
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,663
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,968
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

513
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:16,008
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,407
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,550
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

516
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,015
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:27,852
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

518
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,993
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:32,461
They all think it's just them.

520
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,691
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,994
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:42,662
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:46,470
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,343
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,314
...to hear it?

526
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,386
Yeah. But later they will.

527
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,387
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

528
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,824
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

529
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,963
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,396
<i>-Who?
-Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,229
<i>-Hello? Hello?
-Henry, it's after 11.</i>

532
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,201
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:17,365
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

534
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:20,207
<i>The book is Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,142
Realm and Conquest.

536
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,376
-It's Book One, with the red cover.
-Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,112
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

538
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:33,392
Yeah. Yeah. Thank-- Thank-- Thank--
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:41,033
<i>Realm and Conquest. Thank you.</i>

540
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:06,283
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

541
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:07,929
-You're late.
-I know.

542
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:10,622
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

543
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,494
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,829
-He's asleep.
-Well, wake him up.

545
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,268
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:20,799
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

547
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:22,910
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,842
-Have you seen the video? The tape?
-I heard about it.

549
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:28,583
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:32,654
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

551
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:34,949
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

552
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:38,788
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

553
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,760
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

554
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:43,523
What does this mean?

555
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,491
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:48,296
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:50,268
He wasn't really making much sense.

558
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,999
This is totally unacceptable.

559
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:55,111
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

560
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:57,213
In the morning, I have to call my board.

561
00:37:57,381 --> 00:38:01,943
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:06,283
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

563
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:08,254
I understand.

564
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,351
What sickness is he talking about?

565
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:14,158
-I don't know. It could be anything.
-Well, give me one.

566
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:15,629
Frostbite.

567
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:17,761
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,200
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

569
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:24,832
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

570
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,706
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:30,575
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

572
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:33,808
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:36,819
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,755
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

575
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,919
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

576
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,759
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,697
-...for six years without a break.
-We pay for his time.

578
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,894
I thought you wanted an explanation.

579
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:54,801
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

580
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:58,001
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

581
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,977
He was mostly just quiet.

582
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:09,020
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

583
00:39:09,189 --> 00:39:11,680
-He took it?
-A deal's a deal, right?

584
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:13,588
A super job, Elston.

585
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,423
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

586
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:19,032
I'll do that for sure.

587
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,048
Did you see her?

588
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,551
-Who?
-Anna.

589
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:45,492
No.

590
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:50,222
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

591
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,761
Well, we need her.

592
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:59,404
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:04,004
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

594
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:07,910
No, they're lost.

595
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:11,144
-They have what they want.
-Let it go, man.

596
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,152
This what you wanted?

597
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:16,248
To be a janitor?

598
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,786
Live like this? All this?

599
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,258
Do what you do?

600
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,067
It can't be.

601
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:26,961
It's....

602
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:30,767
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

603
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,536
That's-- That's how it feels.

604
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:39,177
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

605
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:42,783
Get some sleep.

606
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,694
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:03,671
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

608
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,041
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:09,306
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

610
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,347
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:15,715
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:19,648
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:23,721
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

614
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,955
12-BKR-6.

615
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,391
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,801
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:35,305
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

618
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:37,467
Don said that I could....

619
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:41,409
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

620
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,573
<i>Do you have e-mail
at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,979
I do.

622
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:47,313
<i>-Are you alone?
-I am.</i>

623
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:52,321
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:52,494 --> 00:41:53,893
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,359
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

626
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,499
<i>But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,362
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,289
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,296
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

630
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:33,128
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.

631
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:36,295
Is the lease worth anything?

632
00:42:39,776 --> 00:42:42,267
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's--

633
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:45,443
The fixtures are gone, but there's--

634
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,347
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:53,480
But there's a--

636
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:00,889
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,760
Okay, yeah, I will.

638
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:06,927
All right. Thanks.

639
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:18,873
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:22,784
Arthur!

641
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:25,348
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:30,792
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,032
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,598
Arthur, op--!

645
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:41,499
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:49,348
Arthur!

647
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,778
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking--!

648
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,424
Arthur?!

649
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,574
-Mr. Verne, hey.
-Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:20,009
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

651
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:23,048
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

652
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:25,118
-We ready?
-Yep.

653
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:31,316
For chrissake.

654
00:44:31,493 --> 00:44:33,358
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:36,389
That's really his signature?

656
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:38,533
Where's the original?

657
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,763
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

658
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:52,746
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:54,906
Well, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:55,084 --> 00:44:59,043
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

661
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:05,385
What are we looking for?

662
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:09,760
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:12,725
What a mess this is.

664
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:18,602
I want all this...

665
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:23,639
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:26,147
Any luck, Michael?

667
00:45:26,884 --> 00:45:30,981
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:33,123
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

669
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,485
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:35,819
-He moved.
-I know.

671
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,360
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,192
-I called, I got the machine.
-So he could be anywhere.

673
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:44,358
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

674
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:47,266
-Where's his daughter?
-I don't know. Spain, lndia.

675
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:50,566
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

676
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:52,574
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:52,745 --> 00:45:54,542
We got a lot of groveling to do.

678
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,806
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:58,210
I was punting.

680
00:45:58,384 --> 00:46:01,046
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.

681
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,209
Saddle up?

682
00:46:02,388 --> 00:46:05,448
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:07,956
-Where?
-Does that really matter?

684
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,028
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

685
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:14,564
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:16,929
-It's not gonna be that easy.
-Why the hell not?

687
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:20,903
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

688
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:22,632
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:25,505
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

690
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,807
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

691
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:32,474
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:35,314
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:48,993
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:53,834
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:56,169
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,374
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,815
<i>If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,220
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:45,795
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,600
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:54,496
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:56,731
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.

703
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,374
But you gotta call me back.

704
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,942
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,213
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,373
<i>Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,917
<i>And there's a chemical part.
We both know it.</i>

708
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,312
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:14,617
<i>...then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:18,251
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,024
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,860
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:27,005
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:28,765
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:28,941 --> 00:48:32,399
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:36,280
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:37,216 --> 00:48:40,276
<i>We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:44,549
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

719
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:47,289
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,056
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

721
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,563
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

722
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:56,464
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

723
00:48:56,636 --> 00:49:00,834
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:03,441
It's me, buddy. I'm the--

725
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,603
<i>Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

726
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:10,579
<i>-Hello?
-Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:50:10,747 --> 00:50:12,112
Hang on.

728
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,043
<i>Anna!</i>

729
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:21,149
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:23,761 --> 00:50:25,456
<i>-Anna!
-Anna!</i>

731
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,728
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:33,461
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,942
Hello?

734
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,545
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280
<i>-Hey.
-Did you get some sleep?</i>

736
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:53,281
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,426
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,223
<i>-Yeah.
-You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:58,397 --> 00:51:02,925
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

740
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,798
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:51:05,972 --> 00:51:08,372
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:51:09,508 --> 00:51:13,308
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

743
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:16,273
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,950
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,678
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:23,823
I mean, does it--?
Does it really matter?

747
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:28,155
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're--</i>

748
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:29,625
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:33,459
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:35,625
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,463
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:40,368
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

753
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,974
That guy?

754
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:45,635
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:47,646
Sorry.

756
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:52,983
No. That's-- That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

757
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:55,850
<i>She can't believe I can do anything
on my own.</i>

758
00:51:56,024 --> 00:51:57,491
Well, that'll change.

759
00:51:58,226 --> 00:51:59,523
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:02,720
<i>Yeah, but, see,
that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:06,026
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,329
<i>That we could-- We could do that together
if you want. I mean....</i>

763
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,769
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:15,336
I can get you 12 by Monday.

765
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,570
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

766
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:19,213
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:19,381 --> 00:52:22,942
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

768
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:25,212
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

769
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:28,323
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,719
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:32,088
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:36,164
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,961
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:41,598
Are you back at the tables?

775
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:44,706
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:49,903
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:54,142
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

778
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,744
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:02,358
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

780
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:04,617
You got a week.

781
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:08,762
-Hey, Michael. How are you?
-Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:12,233
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

783
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,429
I am trying to get him out
in 15 minutes.

784
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:17,040
-Is he upstairs?
-He's taken over the living room.

785
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,109
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:24,044
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:38,564 --> 00:53:40,054
Marty?

788
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,168
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:48,705
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

790
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,740
...he's building a case against U/North.

791
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,902
-Nobody's gonna let him do that.
-Let him?

792
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,479
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:57,677
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

794
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:02,049
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

795
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:05,157
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,886
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:11,588
-Is that his briefcase?
-Yeah.

798
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,964
-Why?
-We've been looking for it.

799
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:17,662
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

800
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,570
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,634
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:25,613 --> 00:54:27,945
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:31,847
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:35,353
-I thought you were done with that.
-It's not that.

805
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:38,357
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,119
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:40,296 --> 00:54:41,763
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

808
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:44,695
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:45,468 --> 00:54:48,767
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:50,866
There's nothing final on the merger.

811
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,975
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

812
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:56,805
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:56,979 --> 00:54:58,880
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

814
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:02,109
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:03,946
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

816
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:06,817
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

817
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,582
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

818
00:55:08,758 --> 00:55:10,783
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

819
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:13,521
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

820
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,358
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:18,558
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

822
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,397
-How many?
-Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:21,799
You think that's special?

824
00:55:21,973 --> 00:55:24,635
-I was good at it.
-Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

825
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:28,476
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:32,912
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:36,076
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

828
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:40,315
And if it's nostalgia-- "You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

829
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:43,893
--let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:48,055
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:51,459
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:55,336
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

833
00:55:55,507 --> 00:55:57,099
-I never said that.
-No?

834
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:58,607
Maybe you should have.

835
00:55:58,777 --> 00:56:03,442
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:06,779
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

837
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:09,080
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

838
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:13,222
-What are you telling me?
-That I'm counting on you.

839
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:17,552
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

840
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,291
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

841
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:22,764
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:24,435
Hey.

843
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:26,630
When did you get so fucking delicate?

844
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:29,299
I'm late.

845
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:12,011
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

846
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:14,213
It's not that kind of a problem.

847
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:18,258
-How much longer are we doing this?
-I don't know.

848
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:34,074
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

849
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:37,372
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
-Okay. You're welcome.

850
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:47,747
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:50,688
-What?
-I wanna go home.

852
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:52,659
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:57,056
Hold up!

854
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:01,969
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:58:03,608 --> 00:58:06,577
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,075
Wait up.

857
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:12,314
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:16,449
-Making a delivery?
-No, no, no.

859
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:19,917
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

860
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:23,687
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's-- It's still warm.

861
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,489
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:29,535 --> 00:58:31,264
So welcome home.

863
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:35,373
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:37,908
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

865
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:39,909
-But you're feeling better now?
-Yeah.

866
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,571
-Much better, definitely.
-Not enough to call me back.

867
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:45,980
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:49,747
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,789
And how's that going?

870
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,426
Yes, it's good, very good. I just....

871
00:58:54,728 --> 00:59:00,133
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's....

872
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:01,598
That's my goal.

873
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:05,136
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

874
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:06,705
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:09,968
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:14,308
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:19,010
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:22,953
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,889
-Well, I hear everything.
-Then hear this.

880
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:30,287
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

881
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:31,693
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:35,200
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,601
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:41,471
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

885
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,407
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:46,878
-Well, I said I was sorry.
-You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

887
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:49,609
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,051
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,714
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

890
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,124
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

891
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,529
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

892
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,566
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

893
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:09,262
-How can you know that?
-They're gonna take everything.

894
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,932
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

895
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,271
-How do you know I called Anna?
-Marty told me.

896
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:19,212
-Well, how does he know?
-I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,855
-You're tapping my phone.
-Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:26,888
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:31,927
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:34,929
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

901
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,964
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:40,127
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:41,606 --> 01:00:45,906
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,602
I'll help you think this through.

905
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,010
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

906
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:54,346
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:59,184
Michael, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:03,658
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:01:04,263 --> 01:01:06,094
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:01:06,265 --> 01:01:10,134
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:12,965
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,107
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

913
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:17,675
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

914
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:23,378
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,917
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

916
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:29,783
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:32,687
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

918
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:38,091
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

919
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:40,764
I'm not the enemy.

920
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:43,294
Then who are you?

921
01:01:55,951 --> 01:01:57,851
<i>We find the seed.</i>

922
01:02:01,857 --> 01:02:03,950
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

923
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:08,989
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

924
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:13,100
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

925
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:26,576
<i>We find the seed.</i>

926
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:32,552
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

927
01:02:35,826 --> 01:02:37,794
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

928
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,225
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

929
01:02:59,517 --> 01:03:01,314
What the hell is he doing?

930
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,600
<i>We find the seed.</i>

931
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:25,906
<i>You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

932
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:27,943
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

933
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:29,908
Yes!

934
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:34,117
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

935
01:03:34,286 --> 01:03:37,722
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.</i>

936
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:41,418
<i>So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...</i>

937
01:03:41,595 --> 01:03:46,862
<i>...for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.</i>

938
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:50,299
<i>June 19th, 1991.</i>

939
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,197
"Conclusion:

940
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:55,034
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

941
01:03:55,208 --> 01:04:00,441
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

942
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:04,284
<i>Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?</i>

943
01:04:04,452 --> 01:04:07,319
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated" ...

944
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:10,582
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

945
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:12,589
Okay? Okay.

946
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,194
<i>"In-house field studies
have indicated...</i>

947
01:04:15,363 --> 01:04:20,096
<i>...that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...</i>

948
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:24,432
<i>...are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...</i>

949
01:04:24,605 --> 01:04:28,508
..significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

950
01:04:28,677 --> 01:04:31,077
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

951
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:34,579
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

952
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,809
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

953
01:04:37,352 --> 01:04:40,116
<i>- " Culcitate's great market advantage...
-Give me the phone.</i>

<i>...has the potential

...these potentially lethal exposures."

957
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:50,729
Now, I love this.

958
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,800
Not only is this a great product...

959
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:56,666
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

960
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,570
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

01:04:59,743 --> 01:05:03,941
<i>...the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...</i>

962
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:08,984
<i>...would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.</i>

963
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,246
<i>These costs,

01:05:12,423 --> 01:05:14,220
<i>...were not summarized here. "</i>

965
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:16,325
Which, loosely translated, means:

966
01:05:16,494 --> 01:05:20,555
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

967
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:23,859
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

968
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:27,729
<i>" Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...</i>

969

970
01:05:31,276 --> 01:05:34,473
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

971
01:05:34,646 --> 01:05:37,740
...of United-Northfield's

972
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,646
<i>You don't need me
to tell you what that means.</i>

973
01:05:43,922 --> 01:05:45,219
<i>Goodbye.</i>

974
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,452
-It seemed to warrant my coming to--
-Yes.

975
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,893
You have to contain this.

976
01:05:56,636 --> 01:05:58,866
-Contain?
-Right.

977
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:01,464
Well, that's my question.

978
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:06,575
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

979
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:08,577
Along those lines.

980
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:11,774
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't....

981
01:06:12,685 --> 01:06:17,123
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

982
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,156
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

983
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,861
We deal in absolutes.

984
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:24,930
Okay. I understand that. I do.

985
01:06:25,098 --> 01:06:30,536
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

986
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:32,535
Well, the other way?

987
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:36,441
Is the other way.

988
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:42,839
-Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
-No.

989
01:06:43,017 --> 01:06:46,509
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

990
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:55,258
Do you think it's doable?

991
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:59,997
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

992
01:07:00,169 --> 01:07:03,263
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess....

993
01:07:03,439 --> 01:07:04,770
Okay.

994
01:07:08,811 --> 01:07:12,303
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

995
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:18,849
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

996
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:22,150
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

997
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:24,520
-Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
-Come on.

998
01:07:24,694 --> 01:07:27,128
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

999
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:29,863
Come on.

1000
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:31,694
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1001
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:33,802
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1002
01:07:34,604 --> 01:07:37,266
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1003
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,374
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1004
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:43,677
All right, Eddie.

1005
01:07:43,848 --> 01:07:47,147
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1006
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:48,751
Happy birthday.

1007
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,683
You have time for cake?

1008
01:07:51,188 --> 01:07:53,452
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1009
01:07:53,624 --> 01:07:54,613
You going in?

1010
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,521
-I'm late already.
-Shit.

1011
01:07:58,696 --> 01:08:00,095
You're not both running out?

1012
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:02,027
I got a situation.

1013
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:03,861
-You can't hang?
-You're going in.

1014
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:06,402
-Yeah. I got a shift.
-So do I.

1015
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:09,540
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1016
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:12,643
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

1017
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:15,177
Good. You can drive him home.

1018
01:08:15,347 --> 01:08:16,780
Just stay for an hour.

1019
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:19,146
The girls did all this stuff.

1020
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:21,451
He'll be asleep by then.

1021
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,418
Timmy's been calling me.

1022
01:08:31,397 --> 01:08:32,921
He's afraid to talk to you.

1023
01:08:33,099 --> 01:08:34,225
He should be.

1024
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,994
-It closed out bad, right?
-Is that what he told you?

1025
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,138
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:40,870
The in-laws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:44,867
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:45,044 --> 01:08:48,708
-She took him back.
-So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:51,510
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1030
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:55,382
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:55,556 --> 01:08:56,614
I got my hands full.

1032
01:08:57,057 --> 01:09:00,493
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,787
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1034
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:08,196
-He's sick. It's a sickness.
-There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:12,636
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1036
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:15,403
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:09:17,712 --> 01:09:20,442
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,981
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:25,642
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

1040
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,880
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:29,057 --> 01:09:30,616
That was my big play, all right?

1042
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:34,627
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1043
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:37,391
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:40,402
Cool down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,366
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,277
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:56,186 --> 01:09:58,245
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1048
01:10:32,555 --> 01:10:34,955
Ready? And, lift.

1049
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,457
Ready and go.

1050
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:02,477
Wipe.

1051
01:11:11,662 --> 01:11:13,562
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:48,498
We're good.

1053
01:12:22,836 --> 01:12:25,965
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,166
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1055
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,277
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:33,539
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file--

1057
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:35,580
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,014
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:40,780
-Take a night off, Mickey.
-You look tired.

1060
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,947
-I'm okay. See you soon.
-Be good.

1061
01:12:43,124 --> 01:12:45,354
-All right. Bye.
-Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,223
-Bye, Pop.
-Bye.

1063
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:59,639
-Uncle Timmy, hey!
-How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,140
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:05,246
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,914
-What do you want?
-I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:14,584
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,385
In front of the kid?

1069
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,052
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:24,659
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1071
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,466
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:31,098
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:36,381 --> 01:13:39,350
-Is he crying?
-I don't know.

1074
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:41,348
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:41,519 --> 01:13:43,316
That and everything else.

1076
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:16,155
What?

1077
01:14:18,425 --> 01:14:19,790
Your Uncle Timmy...

1078
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,955
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,163
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:30,336 --> 01:14:33,430
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:38,376
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1082
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:40,741
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,712
But when you see him like that...

1084
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:45,647
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1085
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,380
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

1086
01:14:48,556 --> 01:14:52,151
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:54,726
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:56,192
Okay?

1089
01:15:00,435 --> 01:15:04,599
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:15:06,908 --> 01:15:09,638
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1091
01:15:11,346 --> 01:15:12,677
Okay?

1092
01:15:25,895 --> 01:15:27,192
Hello?

1093
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:41,108
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1094
01:15:41,277 --> 01:15:45,908
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1095
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:51,552
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:51,722 --> 01:15:56,056
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,995
There's pills all over the place.

1098
01:16:00,798 --> 01:16:05,862
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:08,971
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,735
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so....

1101
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:18,242
-Is there a note?
-No. They looked.

1102
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:23,379
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,753
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:28,951
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1105
01:16:29,662 --> 01:16:33,826
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:37,127
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:40,830
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1108
01:16:41,006 --> 01:16:44,703
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1109
01:16:45,144 --> 01:16:46,509
Sorry.

1110
01:16:48,548 --> 01:16:50,015
Sure.

1111
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:57,278
Okay.

1112
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:06,124
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1113
01:17:07,767 --> 01:17:08,928
I'll tell him hello.

1114
01:17:09,103 --> 01:17:11,128
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

1115
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:13,371
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,338
I'm sorry for your loss.

1117
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:36,423
-Michael.
-Jeff.

1118
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:38,065
This is tough.

1119
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,825
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,576
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,209
What a thing.

1122
01:17:55,385 --> 01:17:57,615
-Hold on.
-I don't even know--

1123
01:17:57,787 --> 01:17:59,687
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. All right.

1124
01:17:59,856 --> 01:18:03,087
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1125
01:18:03,259 --> 01:18:06,717
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:18:07,263 --> 01:18:10,255
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1127
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:12,765
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:18:12,936 --> 01:18:14,461
Go. Go.

1129
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:16,536
You okay?

1130
01:18:17,274 --> 01:18:19,037
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:20,311 --> 01:18:22,370
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:29,447
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,848
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,818
I just couldn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:36,154
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1136
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:40,257
-Never happened.
-Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,165
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:45,894
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:49,040
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:51,471
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,873
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1142
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:57,071
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1143
01:18:57,248 --> 01:18:58,648
Why?

1144
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:03,283
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1145
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,617
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:12,758
Good years.

1147
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,464
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:23,799
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1149
01:19:24,945 --> 01:19:26,606
You can say it.

1150
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:31,049
We caught a lucky break.

1151
01:19:34,054 --> 01:19:36,352
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:44,498
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:44,665 --> 01:19:46,394
-They accepted?
-In principle.

1154
01:19:46,567 --> 01:19:49,400
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1155
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,471
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,540
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1157
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:58,770
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:20:00,515 --> 01:20:03,644
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1159
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:06,385
It's....

1160
01:20:06,555 --> 01:20:08,216
It's what we got.

1161
01:20:09,358 --> 01:20:12,191
-You need a ride?
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:44,994 --> 01:20:45,983
Hello.

1163
01:20:46,162 --> 01:20:48,757
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:50,025
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:50,201 --> 01:20:53,693
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:53,871 --> 01:20:56,738
<i>-You have got some nerve.
-Excuse me?</i>

1167
01:20:56,907 --> 01:21:00,707
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1168
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:02,704
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,713
<i>This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:21:05,883 --> 01:21:07,874
<i>-Wait a minute. Now, wait.
-No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:21:08,052 --> 01:21:12,285
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again--

1172
01:21:12,457 --> 01:21:14,755
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

1173
01:21:15,227 --> 01:21:17,218
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:21:17,395 --> 01:21:19,829
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:19,998 --> 01:21:21,556
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:21,733 --> 01:21:24,759
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:57,471 --> 01:21:58,699
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:02,598
Anna?

1179
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:06,379
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:09,209
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1181
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:12,382
Please open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:23,698 --> 01:22:25,393
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:26,201 --> 01:22:31,503
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1184
01:22:34,342 --> 01:22:37,608
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1185
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:43,315
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1186
01:22:43,485 --> 01:22:45,851
...and show me, and I would see...

1187
01:22:46,822 --> 01:22:49,689
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1188
01:22:52,895 --> 01:22:54,760
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,522
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:58,068 --> 01:23:02,732
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1191
01:23:02,906 --> 01:23:08,003
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1192
01:23:10,614 --> 01:23:15,449
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

1193
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:18,281
...for a first-class ticket.

1194
01:23:18,455 --> 01:23:19,923
And I just....

1195
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:25,795
I got on the plane.

1196
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:30,500
I believed him.

1197
01:23:35,273 --> 01:23:39,937
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:44,772
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1199
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:48,386
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:52,389
-But I didn't.
-You must have told somebody else.

1201
01:23:52,557 --> 01:23:54,115
No.

1202
01:23:55,294 --> 01:23:57,455
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:58,964 --> 01:24:03,333
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,869
No.

1205
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:13,578
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,194
-You talking about this?
-Let me see.

1207
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,359
-You know what that is?
-Yeah.

1208
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,360
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:38,698
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1210
01:24:40,074 --> 01:24:42,508
-Are you that jammed up?
-What are you talking about?

1211
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:45,304
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:47,971
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1213
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,776
You really wanna know?

1214
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:09,328
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:12,560
What are we doing?

1216
01:28:14,231 --> 01:28:15,255
Freeze!

1217
01:28:15,432 --> 01:28:18,162
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1218
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,599
-It's all right, I'm a friend!
-Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:20,771 --> 01:28:23,296
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:23,473 --> 01:28:25,408
-What's in your hand?
-It's a book.

1221
01:28:25,577 --> 01:28:28,444
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:28,613 --> 01:28:31,912
-Turn around. Slowly.
-All right. All right. Okay.

1223
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,914
-Who else is here?
-Nobody.

1224
01:28:34,085 --> 01:28:36,519
-I said, who else is here?
-Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:38,087
Check in there.

1226
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:42,189
You move, I'll take your head off.

1227
01:29:12,058 --> 01:29:16,495
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife--
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:29:16,663 --> 01:29:18,756
-Now I owe them both my balls.
-I'm sorry.

1229
01:29:18,932 --> 01:29:20,923
-You know I am.
-"Nobody will know it's me."

1230
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:24,161
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:24,337 --> 01:29:25,702
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:25,872 --> 01:29:28,932
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:31,078
-You made your point.
-It's not a point!

1234
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:33,611
-Who called 911?
-What?

1235
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:36,849
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1236
01:29:37,018 --> 01:29:39,452
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you--?

1237
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:41,178
This never happened.

1238
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,515
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1239
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:46,751
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1240
01:29:46,927 --> 01:29:51,057
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:51,232 --> 01:29:53,326
You know exactly what you are.

1242
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:08,472
We tried calling you six times.

1243
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,777
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1244
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,111
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,949
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:30:18,127 --> 01:30:19,992
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1247
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:42,908
Is everything all right?

1248
01:30:43,087 --> 01:30:44,315
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:48,082
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there--

1250
01:30:48,258 --> 01:30:51,318
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:51,495 --> 01:30:53,725
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1252
01:30:53,897 --> 01:30:55,956
-Seriously? Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

1253
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:17,886
Hello.

1254
01:31:22,962 --> 01:31:26,261
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1255
01:31:26,832 --> 01:31:28,129
What?

1256
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:37,702
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:39,367
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:39,545 --> 01:31:41,308
We have a situation.

1259
01:32:01,101 --> 01:32:02,659
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:32:02,836 --> 01:32:05,863
-Who?
-Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:32:14,048 --> 01:32:15,379
Marty.

1262
01:32:15,716 --> 01:32:18,913
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:32:19,086 --> 01:32:21,077
-I need a minute.
-Yeah, well, we're late--

1264
01:32:21,255 --> 01:32:22,882
We never got to finish last night.

1265
01:32:23,057 --> 01:32:25,184
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1266
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:28,420
-No, I left right after you left.
-If you say so.

1267
01:32:28,597 --> 01:32:31,293
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:34,731
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1269
01:32:34,903 --> 01:32:38,100
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1270
01:32:38,273 --> 01:32:41,208
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1271
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:44,709
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,144
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1273
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,414
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:50,987 --> 01:32:53,285
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:53,456 --> 01:32:56,755
There's some strings attached.
And Barry....

1276
01:32:56,926 --> 01:33:01,056
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1277
01:33:04,834 --> 01:33:07,268
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:33:07,437 --> 01:33:09,098
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:33:09,273 --> 01:33:12,140
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:33:12,309 --> 01:33:14,470
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:33:14,645 --> 01:33:17,079
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1282
01:33:17,248 --> 01:33:20,183
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:22,342
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:25,249
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1285
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:28,823
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:28,993 --> 01:33:31,428
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:31,596 --> 01:33:33,655
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1288
01:33:33,832 --> 01:33:36,801
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1289
01:33:36,968 --> 01:33:38,697
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1290
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:42,533
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1291
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:45,369
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:45,844 --> 01:33:47,539
That's 80.

1293
01:33:48,046 --> 01:33:49,843
We're calling it a bonus.

1294
01:33:50,682 --> 01:33:52,707
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:52,885 --> 01:33:54,512
That's assuming this all works out.

1296
01:33:54,687 --> 01:33:55,847
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:57,523 --> 01:34:00,856
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1298
01:34:01,027 --> 01:34:03,894
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1299
01:34:04,063 --> 01:34:06,156
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1300
01:34:06,332 --> 01:34:08,061
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:34:08,234 --> 01:34:12,034
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1302
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:14,765
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:18,138
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1304
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:20,974
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:21,148 --> 01:34:23,742
-If I'm wrong, I apologize.
-You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,145
So there you go.

1307
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:26,980
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:27,854 --> 01:34:30,015
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:30,424 --> 01:34:33,689
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:34,328 --> 01:34:37,025
-Don Jeffries is here.
-We're on the way.

1311
01:34:37,832 --> 01:34:41,928
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1312
01:34:45,506 --> 01:34:46,871
You're welcome.

1313
01:35:39,763 --> 01:35:42,130
You said 12. This is 75.

1314
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:44,460
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:44,635 --> 01:35:46,500
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:48,939 --> 01:35:52,466
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1317
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:54,338
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:54,512 --> 01:35:55,979
That's right.

1319
01:35:56,914 --> 01:35:58,643
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:01,015
Michael.

1321
01:36:12,764 --> 01:36:14,197
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:36:16,034 --> 01:36:17,296
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:17,636 --> 01:36:20,366
-Check.
-Half the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:21,836
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:00,976
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:03,173
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,437
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,544
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1329
01:37:30,712 --> 01:37:34,877
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:38:10,654 --> 01:38:11,712
Get out.

1331
01:38:13,089 --> 01:38:15,217
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:38:16,961 --> 01:38:17,950
<i>-Walter?
-Michael.</i>

1333
01:38:18,129 --> 01:38:20,324
<i>-Michael. Thank God you're there.
-Yeah.</i>

1334
01:38:24,735 --> 01:38:26,669
You have eight...

1335
01:38:27,572 --> 01:38:30,302
<i>...six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:30,474 --> 01:38:32,806
<i>...four, three....</i>

1337
01:38:32,977 --> 01:38:34,604
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,076
<i>-Tell him to stay off the phone.
-All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:41,687 --> 01:38:43,120
Am I clean?

1340
01:38:43,288 --> 01:38:44,516
Just keep walking.

1341
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:46,920
You copy. Am I clean?

1342
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:50,117
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1343
01:38:50,662 --> 01:38:54,223
<i>--to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:56,833
<i>-Just give me two minutes.
-I'll be in the car.</i>

1345
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:03,976
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:35,700
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but....

1347
01:39:37,478 --> 01:39:39,412
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1348
01:39:46,988 --> 01:39:50,185
-I don't know what Walter promised you--
-A miracle worker!

1349
01:39:50,358 --> 01:39:53,589
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:53,762 --> 01:39:55,593
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1351
01:39:55,764 --> 01:39:57,425
-Well, he misspoke.
-About what?

1352
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:01,126
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:40:06,909 --> 01:40:08,843
We're up. Just got a signal.

1354
01:40:32,703 --> 01:40:35,069
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:36,432
Maybe he's lost.

1356
01:40:36,606 --> 01:40:38,403
-Wait a minute.
-That's him.

1357
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:42,973
He was alone, right?

1358
01:40:43,146 --> 01:40:45,944
-Yeah, I think so.
-Call it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:48,386 --> 01:40:50,013
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:41:20,252 --> 01:41:21,879
Talk to me.

1361
01:41:22,054 --> 01:41:23,612
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:23,789 --> 01:41:26,189
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:42,008 --> 01:41:43,600
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:43,777 --> 01:41:45,142
-Where?
-He took--

1365
01:41:45,645 --> 01:41:47,613
-He took a left.
-I don't have a left.

1366
01:41:57,591 --> 01:42:00,526
-East. He's southeast.
-What, so we missed it?

1367
01:42:00,694 --> 01:42:02,821
-Or the grid is wrong.
-Hang on.

1368
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:15,704
-We gotta go back to one.
-One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:42:15,911 --> 01:42:18,903
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:25,787 --> 01:42:28,415
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:29,648
The signal or the grid?

1372
01:42:29,825 --> 01:42:32,555
-It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
-Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,248
Give me the cell.

1374
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,480
Our signal's good.

1375
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:08,651
What?

1376
01:45:11,294 --> 01:45:12,989
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:45:13,162 --> 01:45:14,823
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:22,538 --> 01:45:26,269
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1379
01:45:26,442 --> 01:45:30,071
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell--

1380
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:31,737
-Yeah?
-Did you hear?

1381
01:45:31,915 --> 01:45:34,440
-Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
-No. Michael Clayton.

1382
01:45:34,885 --> 01:45:35,943
What?

1383
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,021
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1384
01:45:40,057 --> 01:45:41,081
What?

1385
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,591
Holy shit.

1386
01:45:58,777 --> 01:46:03,714
<i>It has been and it remains
the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:07,978
<i>...that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.</i>

1388
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:12,214
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1389
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:17,556
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1390
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:20,290
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1391
01:46:20,466 --> 01:46:23,924
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1392
01:46:24,103 --> 01:46:27,971
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:28,974 --> 01:46:33,411
<i>You all have
a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:37,973
<i>...which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:40,915
<i>Over the past several months
we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:41,088 --> 01:46:44,421
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:44,591 --> 01:46:48,425
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1398
01:46:48,929 --> 01:46:50,396
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:50,564 --> 01:46:54,500
<i>...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:54,668 --> 01:46:56,761
<i>...up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:57,204 --> 01:47:01,437
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:06,171
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1403
01:47:06,347 --> 01:47:07,678
...in the middle there.

1404
01:47:08,449 --> 01:47:10,144
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:47:10,318 --> 01:47:14,652
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:47:14,822 --> 01:47:16,653
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:47:16,824 --> 01:47:20,055
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1408
01:47:20,228 --> 01:47:22,663
...and within this fiscal year...

1409
01:47:22,831 --> 01:47:28,701
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1410
01:47:29,204 --> 01:47:33,402
<i>The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:33,842 --> 01:47:38,643
<i>...the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:38,814 --> 01:47:40,509
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:40,682 --> 01:47:43,948
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1414
01:47:45,021 --> 01:47:48,548
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1415
01:47:48,725 --> 01:47:50,989
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1416
01:47:53,396 --> 01:47:54,385
Well....

1417
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:19,352
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:22,393 --> 01:48:24,588
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:24,762 --> 01:48:27,732
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:30,268 --> 01:48:33,533
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:35,106 --> 01:48:38,803
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,447
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:43,615 --> 01:48:45,742
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:47,282
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:47,452 --> 01:48:49,250
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1426
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:52,118
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1427
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:55,954
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1428
01:48:56,128 --> 01:48:58,323
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1429
01:48:58,497 --> 01:49:01,796
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:03,299
I'm calling Marty.

1431
01:49:03,469 --> 01:49:05,835
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1432
01:49:06,005 --> 01:49:08,803
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,807
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:49:10,978 --> 01:49:14,778
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt--

1435
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:18,384
-I know what you did to Arthur.
-It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1436
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,316
-I know you killed him.
-It's attorney-client privilege.

1437
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:25,151
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:25,325 --> 01:49:28,021
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:28,195 --> 01:49:29,526
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:33,133
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:35,826
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:36,004 --> 01:49:39,496
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1443
01:49:39,807 --> 01:49:42,935
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:43,111 --> 01:49:46,512
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:48,581
...and you're gonna kill me?

1446
01:49:49,517 --> 01:49:52,350
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,218
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:56,392 --> 01:50:00,226
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1449
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:03,163
What do you want?

1450
01:50:03,332 --> 01:50:04,856
What do I want?

1451
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:06,626
I want more.

1452
01:50:07,136 --> 01:50:08,899
I want out.

1453
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:11,699
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:50:13,475 --> 01:50:14,703
Is there a number?

1455
01:50:14,877 --> 01:50:16,470
Ten is a number.

1456
01:50:16,646 --> 01:50:18,671
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:50:20,717 --> 01:50:22,207
Ten million?

1458
01:50:22,385 --> 01:50:25,821
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1459
01:50:26,389 --> 01:50:28,289
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:28,458 --> 01:50:30,756
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:31,328 --> 01:50:33,228
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
01:50:33,396 --> 01:50:36,388
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1463
01:50:38,235 --> 01:50:40,635
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1464
01:50:40,805 --> 01:50:42,932
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1465
01:50:43,107 --> 01:50:44,597
Where? My car?

1466
01:50:46,177 --> 01:50:47,201
All right.

1467
01:50:48,379 --> 01:50:51,405
I'm gonna make it easy. 
Let's make it 5.

1468
01:50:51,582 --> 01:50:53,379
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1469
01:50:55,753 --> 01:51:00,521
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1470
01:51:00,692 --> 01:51:04,423
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1471
01:51:04,596 --> 01:51:06,689
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1472
01:51:06,865 --> 01:51:09,231
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don--

1473
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:11,995
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1474
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:13,501
Karen?

1475
01:51:14,206 --> 01:51:16,071
-One second.
-Everything okay?

1476
01:51:17,442 --> 01:51:18,431
Yes.

1477
01:51:19,444 --> 01:51:23,245
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. lmmediately.

1478
01:51:23,416 --> 01:51:24,542
-Yes.
-Say it!

1479
01:51:24,717 --> 01:51:28,585
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1480
01:51:28,755 --> 01:51:31,053
-Karen! Everyone's waiting.
-I'm coming, Don.

1481
01:51:32,091 --> 01:51:33,456
You have a deal.

1482
01:51:34,027 --> 01:51:35,289
You're so fucked.

1483
01:51:35,628 --> 01:51:36,959
What?

1484
01:51:37,463 --> 01:51:39,328
-You're fucked.
-What do you mean?

1485
01:51:39,499 --> 01:51:41,729
-Take a wild guess.
-Is there a problem?

1486
01:51:41,901 --> 01:51:44,598
-I don't understand.
-Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1487
01:51:44,772 --> 01:51:47,570
-You don't want the money?
-Keep the money. You'll need it.

1488
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:49,333
Is this fellow bothering you?

1489
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:50,738
Am I bothering you?

1490
01:51:50,911 --> 01:51:54,938
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1491
01:51:55,115 --> 01:51:56,810
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1492
01:51:56,984 --> 01:52:00,613
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1493
01:52:01,522 --> 01:52:02,784
All right. Here we go.

1494
01:52:02,956 --> 01:52:06,154
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1495
01:52:07,762 --> 01:52:10,492
-What are you doing?
-We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1496
01:52:10,665 --> 01:52:12,997
Come back with us and we'll explain everything.

1497
01:52:13,168 --> 01:52:16,433
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1498
01:52:16,604 --> 01:52:18,765
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1499
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:20,703
Have your guys cover every exit.

1500
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:23,673
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1501
01:52:24,312 --> 01:52:25,677
Did you get all that?

1502
01:52:25,847 --> 01:52:28,043
Yeah. Got it.

1503
01:52:31,687 --> 01:52:34,520
-You okay?
-Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1504
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,180
Sure.

1505
01:52:36,559 --> 01:52:39,323
Just stay close, okay?

1506
01:52:39,495 --> 01:52:40,723
Okay.

1507
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:53,201
So, what are we doing?

1508
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,271
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1509
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:05,811
Just drive.
