1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,213
Julien, don't start this again.
Be reasonable.

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,550
It's naughty to cry.
You promised.

3
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,220
I'm not crying.
Really.

4
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,390
I'll see you in three weeks,
and you'll be home for mardi gras.

5
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,726
Time will fly.

6
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:02,063
Why do you say that?
You know it won't.

7
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,398
Dad and I will write often.

8
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,110
I don't give a damn about Dad,
and I hate you.

9
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,322
Hi, Julien.

10
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,408
Hello, children.

11
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,994
You want to be with your friends.

12
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah, right.
I can't stand that idiot.

13
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,214
Still smooching?

14
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,300
A bright boy like you
mustn't miss the train.

15
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,512
- Francois, I forbid you to smoke.
- It's only corn silk.

16
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,514
- So?
- It doesn't count.

17
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,767
Bye, Mom.

18
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,477
Be good.

19
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,604
All aboard!

20
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,606
Go on now.

21
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,831
You think I like this?

22
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,417
I miss you every moment.

23
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:08,087
I'd like to dress up
as a boy and join you.

24
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,841
I'd see you at school every day.
It'd be our secret.

25
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,178
You know I can't keep you
in Paris with me.

26
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:42,778
GOODBYE CHILDREN

27
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,920
Written and Directed by
LOUIS MALLE

28
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,266
- Did you have a good vacation, Julien?
- Yes, Father.

29
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,435
- Your parents are well?
- Yes, Father.

30
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,106
- What'd you get for Christmas?
- Books.

31
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,234
Just books?
That's lousy.

32
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,703
ST. JOHN OF THE CROSS
CARMELITE CONVENT

33
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,975
Have you ever read Verne?

34
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,227
Just 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

35
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,316
Laviron, did you put
your things away?

36
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:28,579
Ach! Black market, Mr. Quentin.
I arrest you.

37
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,582
Your jam ist konflzkated!

38
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,667
Let me go!

39
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,711
Quentin, stop it.

40
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,174
Next time I'll smash your face in.
I swiped it from my brother.

41
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,134
She's a real dish.

42
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,599
She's got no tits.

43
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,560
Look out! Monkeys!

44
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,745
Good evening, Father.

45
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,375
- Is this bed free?
- Yes. D'Eparville has whooping cough.

46
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,877
Take this one.

47
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,383
Children, this is Jean Bonnet,
your new schoolmate.

48
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,386
Mr. Moreau, find him a locker.

49
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,307
- Good night, children.
- Good night, Father.

50
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,523
- Hey, Bonnet!
- Where's your Easter bonnet?

51
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,484
That's enough!
Leave him alone!

52
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,028
I'll show you your locker.

53
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,033
Take this one.
Go get your things.

54
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,582
What's your name?

55
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,879
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

56
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,052
Shut up and get to bed.
It's just a blackout.

57
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,474
My name's Julien Quentin.
Mess with me and you'll be sorry.

58
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,021
Babinot, vacation's over.

59
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,443
Good night, everyone.

60
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,934
Cut it out!

61
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,148
Hey, that's my place.

62
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,195
- What's today?
- French lit and religion.

63
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,412
- No hot water?
- No. We're not sissies here.

64
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,100
"Verily I say unto you,

65
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,853
unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of Man and drink his blood,

66
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,856
you have no life in you."

67
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,820
Father, give me a hand.

68
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,033
"Whoever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has eternal life.

69
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,327
For my flesh is food indeed,

70
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,329
and my blood is drink indeed."

71
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,125
We starve and freeze,
yet we fast for communion.

72
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,501
What a place.

73
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,754
- You're taking communion?
- I'm no ass-kisser like you.

74
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,902
"Star of the sea,
here lies the heavy sheet

75
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,845
The deep swell,
the ocean of wheat

76
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,888
The turbulent spume
and our full granaries

77
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,307
Here, your eyes
on this immense cope

78
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,435
Here your voice
on this weighty plain

79
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,895
Our absent friends,
depopulated hearts

80
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,648
Here, the stretch
of our shattered fists

81
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,233
Our weariness and our full force -

82
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,278
Quentin, you're ready
for the Comedie-Francaise.

83
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,740
Can you tell us
who Charles Peguy was?

84
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,367
He was killed
in the First World War.

85
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,453
You're starting at the end
of the story.

86
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,246
His mother mended chairs.

87
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,876
Stop laughing like idiots.
Peguy's mother was a good woman.

88
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,922
What about you, Bonnot?
You know anything about Peguy?

89
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,091
No, sir.
And my name's Bonnet.

90
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,761
As in Easter bonnet!

91
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,971
Very funny, Babinot.

92
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,432
To get back in the swing
after vacation,

93
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,518
write an essay
on the first two verses.

94
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,562
You have half an hour.

95
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,307
I'd like to confess.

96
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,659
- Are you nuts?
- It doesn't even hurt.

97
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,937
Quentin, take it easy!

98
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,064
Careful, children.

99
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,987
Take that, Negus.

100
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,910
This'll warm him up.

101
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,302
I'm Bayard, the fearless knight.

102
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,140
Long live France!

103
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,726
Playing rough, Quentin?

104
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,773
Bastard!

105
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,525
En garde, Laviron!

106
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,611
Coward, traitor, villain!

107
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:20,699
I'm Negus, the Black Knight,
protector of widows and orphans.

108
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,411
Get back, Moor!
I'm Richard the Lionhearted.

109
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,373
I'll drive you from Jerusalem,
infidel Saracen.

110
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,125
Son of a bitch.

111
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,669
Allah is God
and Mohammed is his prophet.

112
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,588
Tremble, my friend.

113
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:40,010
Lion heart, flea brain,
pig face, cow turd.

114
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,940
Go, Negus.

115
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,609
Is that his real name?

116
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,819
What do you think?

117
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,948
He looks nasty.
You know him?

118
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,909
That's Lafarge, my best friend.

119
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,123
Death to the Saracens!

120
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,501
Well done!

121
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,800
Playtime's over.
Back to class.

122
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,221
Babinot, hurry up.

123
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,151
It doesn't even hurt.
Hold still while I put on a bandage.

124
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,612
You boys will kill yourselves
on those stilts.

125
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,908
Someone'll break a leg one day.

126
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,788
Hey, we said 45.

127
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,042
The richer they are,
the more they steal.

128
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,171
Joseph, what are you up to?
Back to your potatoes.

129
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,300
There, all better.

130
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,517
You drink too much, Mrs. Perrin.

131
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,937
Quiet, brat! Nothing wrong
with a drop of the good stuff.

132
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,076
- Got any stamps?
- I'm not trading with you guys anymore.

133
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,911
I've got some jam.

134
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,956
After lunch.

135
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,918
The doctor's wife loves your jam.

136
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,047
It puts her in the mood.
Know what I mean?

137
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,980
Pass the basket.

138
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,865
Now there's straw in the bread!
I'm gonna write to my dad.

139
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,910
- What can he do?
- Complain.

140
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,748
I remind those
who've received food from home

141
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,042
to share with their fellow students.

142
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,546
You want some salami?

143
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,423
I'm warning you - it's horsemeat.

144
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,594
I have to eat. I'm anemic.

145
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,806
What about us?
Didn't you hear Father Jean?

146
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,602
There's not enough for everyone.
Let your folks feed you.

147
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,314
There's one piece left.

148
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,067
- You take it.
- Thanks. You're a pal.

149
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,125
Today, St. Simeon Stylites.

150
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,711
"St. Simeon was 13
and tending his father's sheep

151
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,673
when he heard this verse
from the Bible:

152
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,633
'Woe unto you who laugh now,

153
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,136
for the day shall come
when you shall weep.'

154
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,683
He left home to become a hermit
and lived 30 years atop a column.

155
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,063
He stood upright, without shelter,

156
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,816
absorbed in almost
continuous prayer.

157
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,491
Vitamin crackers.

158
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,677
Here. It'll taste better now.

159
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,475
- I've got two.
- Thanks. I'm not hungry anymore.

160
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,520
That guy gets on my nerves.

161
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,232
- There's little Joseph now.
- You got the jam?

162
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,779
Stop it!
These are my clean pants!

163
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,286
Joseph's in love, boys.

164
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,165
Your girlfriend looks like a slut.

165
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,000
How about your sister?

166
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,711
What's she look like?

167
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:31,051
- Is the teacher tough?
- No, he's nice.

168
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,721
- Have you had him?
- Yes. He was amazed at my Latin.

169
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:50,111
- They'll be ready to eat in three months.
- Sure, for Parents' Day.

170
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,864
So parents will say,
"You eat so well here!"

171
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,243
Let's see the stamps.

172
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,293
A 15-centime Madagascar.
The guy said it's real rare.

173
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,170
Somewhat rare.

174
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,175
I think I'll keep my jam.
The grub here is lousy.

175
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,886
You're a real Jew.

176
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,437
So, you're in love?

177
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,775
Don't joke around. It's serious.
Could you spare 50 francs?

178
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,444
Women cost a bundle.
You'll find out.

179
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,698
No, I won't.
Besides, you're rich.

180
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,910
On what they pay me here?
If I could find another job -

181
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,454
I'm broke. Ask Francois.

182
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:47,168
Ciron, put some wood in the stove.
It's freezing in here.

183
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,715
No need to play the fool.

184
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,929
Who can prove that the sum
of the two opposite sides AB plus CD

185
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,974
equals the sum
of the other two sides?

186
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,727
The new boy.

187
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,855
- His name's Easter Bonnet, sir.
- Knock it off.

188
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,239
We know that tangents of a circle
from a given point are equal.

189
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,327
Therefore A equals a,

190
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,496
B equals b...

191
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,175
You think?

192
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,511
Turns your brain to mush,
but he doesn't have a lot to lose.

193
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,856
Right. Very good.

194
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,611
- Everyone understand?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,948
Great! An air raid!

196
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,535
We'll go down to the shelter.

197
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,914
But class isn't over.
Bring your books.

198
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,315
Hurry up, children.

199
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,360
- Mother Michel lost her cat
- Quiet!

200
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,992
Now for some algebra.

201
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,413
Follow along in your books.
Page 61.

202
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,000
Algebraic numbers

203
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,547
are like arithmetic numbers in that...

204
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,095
Give me some light?

205
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,139
Get lost.

206
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,307
Lift up the light.
I can't see.

207
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,101
I'll get caught!

208
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,979
You're such a pain!

209
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,493
They're bombing the station.

210
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,164
- No, it's the barracks.
- Calm down and stay seated.

211
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,502
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you...

212
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,978
The lovebirds!

213
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,524
Quentin, turn that off!

214
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,492
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

215
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,452
Give us this day our daily bread,

216
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,372
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive our trespassers,

217
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,044
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

218
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,672
To bed now. Good night.

219
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,518
Just curl up
like a little doggie.

220
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,315
Did you do this?

221
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,198
Shit!

222
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,220
What is it?

223
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,744
One, two...

224
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:59,332
three, four...

225
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,589
Shoulders back!

226
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,181
You've got biceps
like papier-mache!

227
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,692
She's showing off her ass.

228
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,111
It's a lot better than yours.

229
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,279
Quiet!

230
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,865
Ciron, 20 extra push-ups!

231
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,705
Keep going!
Get those rear ends down!

232
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,055
It's an A-sharp.

233
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,224
Can't you hear
when you hit a wrong note?

234
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,102
Go on.

235
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,444
You should try the violin.

236
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,612
Do you hate music?

237
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,323
Not at all. But my mother
forces me to take piano.

238
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,661
She's right. If you stop now,
you'll always regret it.

239
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,164
Time's up.

240
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,832
See you Tuesday.

241
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,959
Good-bye, miss.

242
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,843
- What's your name?
- Jean Bonnet.

243
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,764
Let's hear you play.

244
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,601
Try this.

245
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,157
Ass-kisser.

246
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,555
Bonnet, get back to your seat.

247
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,865
"My darling, as you know,

248
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,534
it's very hard
for me to write to you.

249
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,495
Mr. D. was going to Lyon,

250
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,665
and he agreed to mail this.

251
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,042
Your aunt and I seldom go out -

252
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,794
Julien Quentin.

253
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,088
Confession.

254
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,097
Your mother's up to something.

255
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,150
Oh, yes - I fought
with my sister on vacation.

256
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,110
Nothing else?

257
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,904
I don't think so.

258
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,031
No evil thoughts?

259
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,244
You know what I mean.
Everyone has them.

260
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,581
- Even you?
- Even me.

261
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,586
- What's wrong?
- Frostbite.

262
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,421
Show me.

263
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,802
It's a vitamin deficiency.

264
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:25,598
Tell Mrs. Perrin
to give you cod-liver ail.

265
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,184
It's the cold.
It's freezing in school.

266
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,810
I know.

267
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,688
But think of those
less fortunate than you.

268
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,486
You told your mother
you wanted to take holy orders.

269
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,446
She told you?

270
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:44,116
I don't think you have
any calling for the priesthood.

271
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,787
It's a sorry job anyway.

272
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,255
Say three Hail Marys.

273
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,424
You may stand up.

274
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,601
Who told you that?

275
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,479
You mustn't believe rumors.

276
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,901
What can I do?

277
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,448
We're in the Lord's hands.

278
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,003
Do you get along well
with your new classmate?

279
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,462
Bonnet?

280
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,673
Be very nice to him.

281
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:44,010
The others look up to you.
I'm counting on you.

282
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,345
Why? Is he sick?

283
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,890
Not at all.
Run along now.

284
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,002
- Petain's a loony.
- He is not.

285
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,188
If we didn't have Petain,
we'd really be in deep shit.

286
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,881
- Says who?
- My father.

287
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,841
My father says Laval
sold out to the Germans.

288
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,801
Jews and Communists
are worse than Germans.

289
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,220
- Your Dad says that?
- No, I do.

290
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,097
I'm not surprised.

291
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,691
Don't dawdle.
Stay together.

292
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,529
- Good, isn't it?
- What?

293
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,823
The Three Musketeers.
How far are you?

294
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,077
- Milady's trial.
- She's a real bitch.

295
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,624
- What are you gonna do later?
- I don't know. Math.

296
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,086
Math's a bunch of shit,
unless you want to be an accountant.

297
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,379
My father was an accountant.

298
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,429
PUBLIC BATHS
Hurry up, children.

299
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,681
Quentin, come along.

300
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,062
Come on, Babinot.

301
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,694
NO JEWS ALLOWED

302
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,369
Remember,
we don't have much time.

303
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,204
You haven't bathed in two weeks.

304
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,000
Bonnet, is it true
you're not gonna be confirmed?

305
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,710
I'm a Protestant.

306
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,713
A heretic - disgusting!

307
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,220
Bonnet isn't a Protestant name.

308
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,222
It sure is.

309
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,686
- Second shower.
- Not a tub?

310
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,521
A shower. Now go!

311
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,775
Babinot, what are you doing?
That's enough now.

312
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,364
Bonnet, take the tub at the end.

313
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,617
- Can I have a tub too?
- In there.

314
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,869
- What about me?
- In there.

315
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,332
- It's tiny. My feet'll stick out.
- It'll have to do.

316
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,400
You should try the violin.

317
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,620
Quentin, what are you doing?

318
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,206
I'm waiting for your tub.

319
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,225
Smart-aleck.
I told you to hurry up.

320
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,982
I can't help it.

321
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,109
My soap won't lather.

322
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,243
Hurry up. It's freezing.

323
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,417
- That guy's got some nerve!
- Shut up.

324
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,753
It's cold. We'll run back.
Let's go!

325
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,744
Pull your arms back.

326
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:50,667
Squat, one and two.

327
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,045
Again.

328
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,726
Looks like the mountain troops.

329
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,978
No, they're militia.

330
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,898
This is a search.

331
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,275
You have no right to enter here.

332
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,444
This is a private school.

333
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,114
Only children and men of the cloth.

334
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,743
What do those collaborators want?

335
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,995
- We have orders.
- From whom?

336
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,455
Our superiors.

337
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,457
- I'll complain.
- To whom?

338
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,045
- You can go in now.
- Already? Great!

339
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,602
Hey!

340
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,981
Your jam was a big hit.
Got any more?

341
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,859
What did the militia want?

342
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,945
They're snooping around.
Heard there were draft dodgers here.

343
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,363
Draft dodgers?

344
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,033
Guys hiding out
to avoid forced labor in Germany.

345
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,619
Like Moreau, the monitor.
- Really?

346
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,290
Moreau's not his real name.
But I don't care.

347
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,126
With my leg, I'll be exempt.

348
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,129
- Joseph!
- Coming.

349
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,798
She's worse than going to Germany.

350
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,808
Rollin: average. Nine and a half.

351
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,894
Bonnet? Not here.

352
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,979
Good riddance.

353
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,148
Quentin.

354
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,693
Intelligent, but a bit pretentious.

355
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,487
This, for example:

356
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,741
"Peguy sees the cathedral
as a grand and generous beacon."

357
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:51,830
Take your seat.

358
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,835
Where were you?

359
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,468
Ciron, 12 points.

360
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,679
Where do you get barges
in the middle of wheat fields?

361
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,807
On the Foussarde Canal, sir.
I was there on vacation.

362
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:12,643
Bonnet.

363
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,772
13 1/2. Good work.
Sensitive and well-written.

364
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,108
Quentin, you've got competition.

365
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:28,242
Who hasn't had
his vitamin cracker?

366
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,538
D'Arsonval, stop lagging.

367
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,665
I can't pay you right away.

368
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,126
You promised.

369
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,799
Ask the little shit. I'm sure
the miser's hoarding some sugar.

370
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,635
Want some marbles?

371
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,977
Julien Quentin?

372
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,437
Wait!

373
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,898
Julien Quentin.

374
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:20,085
The apartment seems empty
without you.

375
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,672
Paris is no fun these days.
They bomb us nearly every night.

376
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,259
A bomb killed
eight people yesterday.

377
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,011
Charming!

378
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,929
The girls are back in school.

379
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,682
Sophie works at the Red Cross
Thursdays and Sundays.

380
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,892
So many unfortunate people.

381
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,895
Dad's at the plant in Lille.
His factory's hardly producing.

382
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,939
He's in a foul mood.

383
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,734
It's really time this war ended.

384
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,778
I'll come get you Sunday at 8:00,
as we agreed.

385
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,947
We'll have lunch at Le Grand Cerf.

386
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,742
Can't wait to give you a big hug.

387
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,619
Your loving mother.

388
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,787
P.S. Eat your jam.
I'll bring you more.

389
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,831
Take good care of your health.

390
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,499
Beat it, buddy.

391
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,563
"First prize in arithmetic - Jean...

392
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,745
Jean Kippel...

393
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:04,291
Kippelstein."

394
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,761
I'm hungry.

395
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,430
What's a perpendicular bisector?

396
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:22,434
- A perpendicular in mid-segment.
- What's it good for?

397
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,459
That's a theta, not a tau.

398
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:11,274
We'll continue next time.

399
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,154
Greek is useful, you know.

400
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,990
All scientific words
have Greek roots.

401
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,822
Who do you like best?
Athos or d'Artagnan?

402
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:00,532
Aramis.

403
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:02,868
He's a hypocrite.

404
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,995
Yeah, but he's the smartest one.

405
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,249
Why don't you take Greek?

406
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,210
- I took Latin.
- Where?

407
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:16,214
At school in Marseilles.

408
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:19,718
You're from Marseilles?
You don't have an accent.

409
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,971
I wasn't born there.

410
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,265
Where were you born?

411
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,436
You wouldn't know it
if I told you.

412
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,983
Is Greek hard?
- Not once you know the alphabet.

413
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,319
Are your parents in Marseilles?

414
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:45,619
My dad's a prisoner.

415
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,495
He didn't escape?

416
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,207
And where's your mother?

417
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,880
You won't tell me?

418
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,734
- In the unoccupied zone.
- There's no unoccupied zone anymore.

419
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:02,928
I know that. Now lay off.
I don't know where she is.

420
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,805
She hasn't written in three months.
Happy now?

421
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,897
What are you two up to?

422
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,400
I have a cold.

423
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,279
Enough nonsense.
Go out and play.

424
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,953
Hippo's a bastard.
Always snooping around.

425
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:36,211
St. Thomas's proofs
of God's existence don't hold water.

426
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,254
I don't agree.

427
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,633
Since we can imagine God,
he must exist.

428
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:43,927
That's just sophistry.

429
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:47,555
At least Bergson seeks
transcendence in science.

430
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,725
Hey, I want to talk to you.

431
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:58,817
- That's strong.
- It's the real thing, dummy.

432
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,823
Let's go somewhere else.
The monkeys will catch us here.

433
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,245
- Do me a favor.
- What?

434
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,580
Pass a note to your piano teacher.

435
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,500
- You're crazy! I'll get expelled!
- She won't say anything.

436
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,335
You're such a scaredy-cat.

437
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,755
Francois, what's a yid?

438
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:24,092
- A Jew.
- I know, but what exactly is a Jew?

439
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,012
- Someone who doesn't eat pork.
- Are you kidding me?

440
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,680
Not at all.

441
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,765
What have people got against them?

442
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:34,185
The fact they're smarter than us,
and they crucified Jesus.

443
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,187
That's not true.
It was the Romans.

444
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,441
Is that why they have
to wear yellow stars?

445
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,027
- Will you take my letter to Davenne?
- No.

446
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,320
What do you want with her anyway?
- Never mind.

447
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:48,033
Be nice. I'll lend you my
Arabian Nights. It'll give you a hard-on.

448
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,160
Leave me alone!

449
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,624
You smell awful, Joseph.

450
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,336
Stop it, right now!

451
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,590
He called me a creep!

452
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,885
That's enough now.
Calm down and go back to the kitchen.

453
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,513
"Down, Joseph!
To your kennel!"

454
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,432
I'm not a dog!

455
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,350
Stop it, D'Arsonval!

456
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,157
Damn, a cross.
Another wrong trail.

457
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,788
We have to get back to the crossroads,
quickly and quietly.

458
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,541
There must be another trail
at the fork.

459
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,712
I wonder where the others are.

460
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,631
What's today?

461
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,342
January 17. Thursday.

462
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,930
You realize there'll never be
another January 17, 1944?

463
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,099
Never again.

464
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,975
Shut up and get a move on!

465
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,270
In 40 years,
half these guys'll be dead and buried.

466
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,940
Come on.

467
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,985
I'm the only one in this school
who thinks about death. It's incredible!

468
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,828
You're our prisoners.
Follow us.

469
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,163
We're gonna tie your hands.

470
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,419
There are two missing.
Over there! It's Quentin!

471
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:19,911
Wow!

472
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:47,480
I found the treasure.
The Greens win.

473
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,775
Didn't they catch you?

474
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:59,070
Yes, they tied me to a tree,
but I got free.

475
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,738
Bastards!

476
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,700
I found the treasure.
All by myself.

477
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,041
Are there wolves in these woods?

478
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,722
It's that way.

479
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:49,722
We go left. I'm sure.

480
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,808
- No, we go right.
- I told you, we go left.

481
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,241
It's the high wall
next to the church, right?

482
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:54,328
I know it.
We Bavarians are Catholic.

483
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,758
Good evening, Father.
Lost any children?

484
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,596
We looked everywhere.
Always playing the fool, Julien!

485
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,433
That's not fair.
I found the treasure.

486
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:19,228
But everyone had vanished.

487
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,943
It's all right, my boy.

488
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,778
What happened?

489
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,281
They got arrested by the Krauts.

490
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:32,658
Could the Krauts

491
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,243
have their blanket back?

492
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,705
Thank you very much.

493
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:42,460
No civilians in the woods after 8:00 p.m.
Don't you know there's a curfew?

494
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,629
You think we did it on purpose?

495
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:47,465
I caught hell because of you.

496
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,050
You won because of me, jerk.

497
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,968
Come on. Hurry up.

498
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:08,319
Calm down.

499
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:09,945
Lafarge, out!

500
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,329
Feeling better, twerp?

501
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,956
A present from Joseph.

502
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,334
And a letter from your mom.

503
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,002
She's your mom too.

504
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,921
But you're her pet.

505
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,340
Dad's always off in Lille.
I bet she's getting plenty.

506
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,760
- What do you mean?
- Women are all whores, my friend.

507
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,387
Sorry, Sister.

508
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,930
What an idiot!

509
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,265
- Swabbing time.
- Again?

510
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,018
Three times a day.
Sit up straight.

511
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,230
Open your mouth.

512
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,983
Open wide.
Keep your tongue down.

513
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,912
Listen here!
Open your mouth!

514
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,720
- Were you scared last night?
- Not really.

515
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,888
I hear you saw some wild boar.

516
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,391
Were there lots?
- Around 50.

517
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,394
What about the Germans?

518
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:25,730
Did they really fire at you?

519
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,232
- Just a few bursts.
- Come on!

520
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,652
Nice book.

521
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,280
What is it?

522
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,782
The Arabian Nights.
It's my brother's.

523
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,993
It's banned by the monkeys.
- Why?

524
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,079
It's really dirty.
I'll lend it to you.

525
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,081
Recess is over.

526
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,462
We've got our religion class.

527
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,255
See you tomorrow.

528
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,718
- Kiss Mother Michel for me.
- Oh, we will.

529
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,765
The Arabian Nights.

530
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,375
You're disgusting.

531
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,503
It doesn't hurt it.

532
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,922
It's dead.

533
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:38,719
A present from Joseph.

534
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,765
No, thanks.
I don't like pate.

535
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:44,391
Go on. Eat it.

536
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,727
I said no.
I don't like pate.

537
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:50,815
Because it's pork?

538
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,151
Why do you always ask
such stupid questions?

539
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,322
Because your name's Kippelstein,
not Bonnet.

540
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,785
Do you say "Kippelstine"
or "Kippelsteen"?

541
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:13,629
Bonnet, get back in bed
this minute or I'll report you!

542
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:18,342
And you quiet down.

543
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:35,860
- Are your parents coming?
- The whole family.

544
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,831
Aren't you dressing up?
No visitors?

545
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,458
What the hell is it to you?

546
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:13,355
My message today is especially
for the youngest among you

547
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:16,567
who will be confirmed
in a few weeks.

548
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,110
My children,

549
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:20,446
we live in a time
of discord and hatred.

550
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:24,074
Lies are all-powerful.
Christians kill one another.

551
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,911
Those who should guide us
betray us instead.

552
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:31,498
More than ever, we must beware
of selfishness and indifference.

553
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:36,295
You're all from wealthy families,
some very wealthy.

554
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,925
Because you've been given much,
much will be asked of you.

555
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,178
Remember the Bible's stern lesson:

556
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,890
"It's easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle

557
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,602
than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven."

558
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,103
St. James said,

559
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:58,484
"Now, you rich, weep and wail
for the woes awaiting you."

560
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:02,780
Your wealth has rotted,
and your garments are eaten by worms."

561
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,242
Worldly wealth corrupts souls
and withers hearts.

562
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,996
It makes men contemptuous, unjust,

563
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:13,499
pitiless in their egoism.

564
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,669
I understand the anger
of those who have nothing

565
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:20,214
when the rich feast so arrogantly.

566
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,475
He's hitting pretty hard.

567
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,979
I don't mean to shock you

568
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,692
but only remind you
that charity is a Christian's first duty.

569
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:43,320
St. Paul tells us in today's Epistle,

570
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:47,157
"Brothers, be not wise
in your own conceits.

571
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,326
Do not repay any man
evil for evil.

572
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,413
If thine enemy hunger, feed him.

573
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,873
If he thirst, give him drink."

574
01:03:56,375 --> 01:04:00,671
Let us pray for the hungry,
for those who suffer,

575
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,048
for the persecuted.

576
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,843
Let us pray for the victims

577
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,429
and for their executioners as well.

578
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,959
- Will you give concerts?
- Not right away.

579
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,961
I still need practice.

580
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,964
It's hard to get started.

581
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,134
It's Duvallier's dog.

582
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:31,970
- It'll bite you.
- He doesn't bite.

583
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,560
En garde, Easter Bonnet.

584
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,689
Help me, you guys!
Get the heretic!

585
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,945
You're really getting on my nerves.

586
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,447
Go, Julien!

587
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,456
Julien, have you gone mad!

588
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,418
Your best suit.

589
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,547
What'll they say at the restaurant?

590
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,177
What's gotten into you boys?
You think it's funny?

591
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,693
Was everything all right, Mr. Meyer?

592
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,988
Thank you.
The rabbit was tolerable.

593
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,324
Mrs. Quentin,
your table's this way.

594
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:38,662
Francois, sit over there.
Julien here.

595
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,878
- We haven't seen you lately.
- Vacations.

596
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,216
What fish do you have?

597
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,428
We haven't had fish in ages, ma'am.

598
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:59,391
I recommend the rabbit.
Half a meal coupon per serving.

599
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,602
Is it rabbit or cat?

600
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,271
Rabbit, sir.
With sauteed potatoes.

601
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:07,983
- In butter?
- Margarine.

602
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,902
No coupons required.

603
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:14,698
Very well. We'll have the rabbit,
and a bottle of Bordeaux.

604
01:07:23,332 --> 01:07:24,583
The place is full of Krauts.

605
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,377
I thought they were all
on the Russian front.

606
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,630
You caught their eye.

607
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,011
Your parents couldn't come?

608
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,388
Poor boy.

609
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:39,973
What about Dad?

610
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,227
He said he was coming.
- He couldn't. Problems at the plant.

611
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,686
As usual.

612
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,940
Your poor father
is under a lot of pressure.

613
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:51,735
- Is he still for Petain?
- No one is anymore.

614
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:56,490
I heard of your ordeal in the woods.
I gave Father Jean a piece of my mind.

615
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,409
Those boy scout games are ludicrous
in this freezing cold.

616
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,495
You could've died, my darling.

617
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:04,998
Guns do go off!
- Makes a man of him.

618
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,961
That's just what Father Jean said.

619
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,295
I mean really!

620
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,298
- He was with me in the woods.
- Oh, so it was you.

621
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,760
I bet you're from Lyon.

622
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,288
The name Gillet is from Lyon.
They're all in the silk trade.

623
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,807
His name's Bonnet, not Gillet.

624
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,558
Of course.

625
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,102
He's from Marseilles.

626
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:29,481
I knew a Bonnet there, a cousin
of the Du Perrons. Is she your mother?

627
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,860
How strange.

628
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,613
His father's an accountant.

629
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,282
Really.

630
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,922
Your papers, please.

631
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,431
Your papers, sir.

632
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,743
Can't you read?

633
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,745
This place is off limits to yids.

634
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,545
Why are those men bothering people?

635
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,048
That gentleman looks very proper.

636
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:39,301
Mr. Meyer's been coming here
for 20 years.

637
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,763
I can't just throw him out.
- Shut up, flunky!

638
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:46,016
I can have your license revoked.

639
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,851
Collaborators.

640
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,561
Quiet, Francois.

641
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,397
Did you say that?

642
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,900
He's a child.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

643
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,029
We serve France, lady.
He insulted us.

644
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,074
Go away!

645
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:07,245
It's monstrous.
You should be ashamed.

646
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,122
Not at all.

647
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,087
Leave him alone.

648
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,881
He's right.
Send the Jews to Moscow!

649
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:25,889
Get the hell out of here!

650
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,269
You understand?
Get the hell out!

651
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:44,991
We'll meet again.

652
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:51,039
Say what you will,
but some of them are decent.

653
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,375
He was showing off for you.

654
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,887
Aren't we Jewish?

655
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:09,558
- That's all we need!
- Isn't Aunt Reinach Jewish?

656
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,769
- She's Alsatian.
- You can be Alsatian and Jewish.

657
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:15,981
That's quite enough!
The Reinachs are devout Catholics!

658
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,483
If they heard you!

659
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,820
Mind you,
I have nothing against Jews.

660
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:25,657
Except for that Leon Blum.
They can hang him.

661
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:31,455
Julien, sit up straight.

662
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,710
Your friend is nice.
He doesn't say much.

663
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,378
He has his reasons.

664
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:41,631
- Then he's no dummy.
- Not at all.

665
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,303
Where's Francois?
What's he up to?

666
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,639
He always gives the Krauts
wrong directions.

667
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,475
Very clever!

668
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:59,065
- What if I joined the resistance?
- Nonsense. You must finish school.

669
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,943
Some things are
more important than school.

670
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:03,987
Julien wants to become a monkey.

671
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:06,573
Not a monkey.
A missionary in the Congo.

672
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,160
Stop using that stupid word.
It's awful.

673
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:12,787
You should be grateful
to those poor monks who -

674
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,457
"...work so hard to educate you."

675
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:17,375
Precisely!

676
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,630
You're a real pain.
Leave me alone.

677
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,509
Fernande!

678
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,055
You know her?

679
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,893
Julien, are you sure
you want to become a priest?

680
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,187
- Would you object?
- Not at all.

681
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,814
Your father and I would be proud.

682
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,693
But why not engineering,
like Grandpa?

683
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,445
Don't worry.

684
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:49,282
He'll give up the church for a girl.
He's a lover boy, like Joseph.

685
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,003
Laviron's sister is a real dish.

686
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,214
I'm gonna sweet-talk her.

687
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,931
I can't kiss you anymore?

688
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:17,143
Look at that.
You've got a little mustache.

689
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:22,566
Can I go back to Paris with you?
Dad won't know.

690
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,541
Did you have a good lunch?

691
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:49,467
Your mother's nice.
Boy, can she talk fast.

692
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,261
She's crazy.

693
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:56,850
You'll see her again soon.

694
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,981
I know how to thread it.

695
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:06,026
It'll break like last time.

696
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,944
No, it won't.

697
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,661
Your jam's great.

698
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,789
- Adrienne made it.
- Is that your sister?

699
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,833
No, she's the cook.

700
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,087
What's funny?
Don't you have a cook?

701
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,841
You always eat out?
- No. My mom's a great cook.

702
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,436
- You're eating my jam.
- Stop it.

703
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:43,396
Move over, guys.

704
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,152
We're ready.

705
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,988
Turn out the lights, please.

706
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,681
The fat lady's gonna go sliding.

707
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:02,642
Looks like Mrs. Perrin.

708
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,101
She's beautiful.

709
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:25,642
He's in love.

710
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,853
She loves him too.

711
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:25,910
Shit!

712
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,346
Time to get up.

713
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,057
Quentin wets the bed.

714
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,352
Quentin wets the bed.

715
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,904
Hurry up in the washroom.

716
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,156
It never fails.

717
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,534
I'm having a great dream.

718
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:10,413
I feel like peeing.
I open my fly. Everything's great.

719
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:15,919
Then I wake up and feel
the warm piss on my stomach.

720
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,296
It's no fun, let me tell you.

721
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,594
Try it. Don't be scared.

722
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:28,139
Go on. Keep your head up.

723
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:33,102
Get back up.

724
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:36,439
- Bed wetter.
- Sagard, you're gonna get it.

725
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,403
You dirty thief!

726
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,030
You're the thief!

727
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:46,491
Just you wait, you thief!

728
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,119
Father Michel,
I caught him stealing lard!

729
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,288
He put it in his bag to sell!

730
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,375
Not in front of the boys, Mrs. Perrin!

731
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,628
- I told you he was stealing!
- It's not true, damn it!

732
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:01,214
She's the thief!
She's a liar!

733
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,299
Get back in the kitchen.

734
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,929
I told that idiot he'd get caught.

735
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:15,186
Joseph was selling our supplies
on the black market.

736
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:19,983
Mrs. Perrin should have told us.
She may have been in on it.

737
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,068
But that's not all.

738
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:27,031
We found these in his locker.
Private food supplies.

739
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,325
He named all seven of you.

740
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:31,494
Whose pate is this?

741
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,579
Mine.

742
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:36,249
- And the jam?
- Mine.

743
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,668
Know what you are?

744
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:41,295
A thief, just like Joseph.

745
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,965
I didn't steal.
That jam was mine.

746
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:45,883
You should've shared it.

747
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,095
I believe true education
consists in teaching you

748
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,514
to make good use
of your freedom.

749
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:53,307
And this is what happens!

750
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:58,312
You disgust me. There's nothing
I despise more than the black market.

751
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,189
Always money!

752
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,026
It wasn't for money.
We traded, that's all.

753
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,861
For what?

754
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,320
Cigarettes.

755
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:11,200
Quentin, if it weren't for your parents,
I'd kick you out at once.

756
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:13,202
You and your brother.

757
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,123
I have to fire Joseph,
even though it's unfair.

758
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,086
You're all confined to school
until Easter.

759
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,465
Now go back to class.

760
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:36,517
Where do I go now?
I don't even have a place to sleep.

761
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,230
Get back to class.

762
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,241
Go see the bursar.
He'll pay you a month's wages.

763
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:56,079
I end up taking the rap.
It's not fair.

764
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,208
Come on, Joseph.

765
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,649
- What are you doing here?
- Choir practice.

766
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:28,027
You two help me
with the flowers for Sunday.

767
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,956
We'll take it from
"O Lord, in thee..."

768
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,668
Bonnet's not here?

769
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:46,838
- No, miss. He's in the infirmary.
- Really?

770
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:19,328
It's easy.
Do this with your left hand.

771
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,762
We'd better get to the shelter.

772
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:44,061
Everyone in the shelter, and hurry!

773
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,576
They won't miss us.
They never count.

774
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:00,096
I hope the Americans land soon.

775
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:04,767
Will you stay at this school
when the war's over?

776
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:09,105
I don't know. I doubt it.

777
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:15,403
You scared?

778
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,823
All the time.

779
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:26,122
How long's it been
since you saw him?

780
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:30,167
My father?
Almost two years.

781
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,047
I never see mine either.

782
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,107
What are you doing here, Joseph?

783
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:56,360
I forgot some things.

784
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,823
What about you?

785
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,880
"Could I, lad,
belong to anyone but you?

786
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:20,176
She swiftly cast aside her veils,
removed her clothing,

787
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,595
and appeared naked
as the day she was born.

788
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:25,014
Blessed be the womb that bore her.

789
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:29,185
The princess was
as soft and white as fine linen.

790
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:32,021
Her whole being
exuded a scent of amber.

791
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:35,024
He took her in his arms,

792
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:38,611
probing her intimate depths,
and found she was a virgin pearl.

793
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:42,406
His hand roved
over her lovely limbs and neck

794
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:45,409
and through
the richness of her hair.

795
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:49,997
She responded by eagerly displaying
her many gifts.

796
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:54,210
She had the sinuous grace of Araby,
Ethiopian ardor,

797
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:57,630
the startled candor of the French,
the high art of the Indians,

798
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:59,548
Yemeni coyness,

799
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:03,761
and the narrow passage
of a Chinese girl.

800
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:09,141
Each embrace became a coupling,

801
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:12,436
and each coupling
the wildest fornication,

802
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:16,565
until, weary from
their passionate writhings,

803
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:21,737
they fell asleep in each other's arms,
drunk with pleasure.

804
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,989
Thus ended..."

805
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:34,667
The Russians have begun
a major offensive in the Ukraine.

806
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:39,588
British radio claims
the Germans have been overrun

807
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,550
along a 60-mile front west of Kiev.

808
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:45,261
Radio Paris claims
the attack was repulsed

809
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:47,263
with heavy losses.

810
01:27:47,805 --> 01:27:50,766
The truth is likely
somewhere between the two.

811
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,853
Radio Paris tells German lies

812
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,688
Meanwhile, in Italy,

813
01:27:55,855 --> 01:28:01,152
the Americans and British
are pinned down at Monte Cassino.

814
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,947
Take out your notebooks
for an algebra problem.

815
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:10,119
We're going to multiply
two monomials.

816
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:14,457
May I be excused, sir?
It's the soup.

817
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:17,126
It's always you, Sagard.
Go on.

818
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,622
Dr. Muller. Gestapo.

819
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,669
Which one of you
is Jean Kippelstein?

820
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,092
Answer me.

821
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,345
There's no one by that name
in this class.

822
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,862
Let's go.

823
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:41,478
That boy is not French.

824
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:45,107
He's a Jew.

825
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:51,864
Your principal committed
a serious crime by hiding him.

826
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,411
The school is closed.

827
01:30:57,578 --> 01:31:01,624
You have two hours to pack your bags
and line up in the yard.

828
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:09,506
Was Bonnet a Jew?

829
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:16,430
Keep calm, children.

830
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:24,146
Quiet down
and listen to me, children.

831
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:27,941
They've arrested Father Jean.

832
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:31,654
It seems we've been denounced.

833
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:34,073
What about Bonnet?

834
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,283
Bonnet, Dupre and Lafarge
are Jewish.

835
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:39,662
Father Jean took them in
because their lives were in danger.

836
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:45,125
Go to the dormitory
and pack quickly and calmly.

837
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:48,504
But first we'll say a prayer
for Father Jean and your friends.

838
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:53,717
Our Father, who art in heaven...

839
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,739
Negus got away.

840
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:19,827
They didn't get Negus.

841
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:24,206
They're looking for him and Moreau.
Father Jean had resistance leaflets.

842
01:32:25,082 --> 01:32:28,252
When you're ready,
go to the dining hall.

843
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,715
Quentin, pack Laviron's bag
and take it to the infirmary. Hurry!

844
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,550
Want some help?

845
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:32,191
Don't worry.
They'd have gotten me anyway.

846
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:36,820
Negus got away.

847
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,530
I know.

848
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:47,498
Take these.
I've read them all.

849
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,966
You want The Arabian Nights?

850
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:27,204
- What are you doing here?
- I brought his bag.

851
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:32,501
Are you gonna get up?

852
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,256
What do you want now?

853
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,466
We can't stay here.
They're searching the attic.

854
01:34:57,943 --> 01:35:00,070
Sister, put a compress on him!

855
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:01,530
Hurry!

856
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,157
You'll get us all arrested!

857
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,186
There's a Jew here.
I'm sure of it.

858
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:35,188
We haven't seen anyone.

859
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,858
You, come here.

860
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:42,571
Pull down your pants. Quick!

861
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:33,038
What happened?

862
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,832
- It's her.
- Get out!

863
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:40,462
I'm going over the roof.
Good-bye, Julien.

864
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,869
He's a friend.

865
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,752
What are you doing with them?

866
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:26,508
Here.

867
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:31,096
Aren't you happy?
You'll get a vacation.

868
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:41,940
You don't smoke?

869
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:52,492
Don't worry about it.
They're just Jews.

870
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,291
You really liked Bonnet?

871
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,426
Don't act so pious!
You guys are to blame!

872
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:12,471
I got fired
for doing business with you.

873
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,723
Mrs. Perrin stole more than I did.

874
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:21,063
Stop acting so pious!

875
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,440
There's a war going on, kid.

876
01:38:44,336 --> 01:38:46,713
Are there any other Jews among you?

877
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:50,759
Answer me!

878
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:14,324
What about you?
Sure you're not Jewish?

879
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:15,784
Your name?

880
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:17,828
Pierre de la Roziere.

881
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,122
Go stand against the wall.

882
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:05,667
You think they'll arrest us?

883
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,878
We didn't do anything.

884
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:34,654
We were in the chapel.

885
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:38,033
We came for confession.

886
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,420
That soldier did his duty.

887
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,882
His orders were
to let no one leave.

888
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:59,387
The strength of the German soldier
is his discipline.

889
01:41:00,472 --> 01:41:04,100
That's what you French lack:
discipline.

890
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:10,065
We're not your enemies.

891
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:14,694
You must help us rid France
of foreigners and Jews.

892
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,483
Good-bye, Father.

893
01:41:57,112 --> 01:41:59,739
Good-bye, children.
See you soon.

894
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:25,890
Bonnet, Negus and Dupre

895
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,767
died at Auschwitz.

896
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:30,687
Father Jean
died in the camp at Mauthausen.

897
01:42:31,855 --> 01:42:35,817
The school reopened its doors
in October of 1944.

898
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,361
More than 40 years have passed,

899
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:43,950
but I'll remember every second of that
January morning until the day I die.
