1
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,959
Hello, George. Only me.

2
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,709
How are you today, dear?

3
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,334
Having a little doze
or just resting your eyes?

4
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,417
I'll make you a fresh cup.

5
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,542
Shan't be a minute. Couple of biscuits.

6
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,917
Here you are then, dear.

7
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:52,959
There.

8
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,959
There. That better?

9
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,042
Yes, thanks.

10
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:05,834
- Forward a bit.
- Bit more?

11
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:06,917
Mm.

12
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,959
There. Do you need anything else, dear?

13
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,459
- No.
- You sure?

14
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,542
- Yep.
- Drink your tea up before it gets cold.

15
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,459
I'll be on my way.

16
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,876
Tell Ivy I was asking after her,
won't you?

17
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:20,667
And don't get up to any mischief.

18
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,209
Ta-ta, dear.

19
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,167
- Hello, Reg.
- Afternoon, Mrs Drake.

20
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,251
- You all right, dear?
- Can't complain.

21
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,167
- Going off for your tea?
- Yes.

22
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,042
- What you having?
- Bit of bread 'n dripping.

23
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,417
- That all?
- Cup of tea.

24
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,042
You want to look after yourself,
Reg. I told you.

25
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,042
You want to come over
our house for tea one night.

26
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,626
- I don't want to put you out.
- Oh, don't be daft.

27
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,376
What about tomorrow?
You could come over after work.

28
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,042
You know where we are.
Number 82.

29
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,501
Could feed you up a bit.
Do you fancy that?

30
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:54,417
- You sure?
- Be no trouble, Reg.

31
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,042
- Go on, then.
- Oh, lovely.

32
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,667
See you tomorrow, then.

33
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,834
Now don't you forget!

34
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,876
- Hello, Nellie.
- All right, Vera?

35
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,167
- Yes.
- Innit cold?

36
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,417
Yes!

37
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,167
Oh!

38
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,251
That's better.

39
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,917
Nice cup of tea.

40
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,167
- That you, Ethel?
- Hello, Mum.

41
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,251
Oh.

42
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,459
- Oh, nippy today, weren't it?
- Yes.

43
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,292
Ooh, hold up, Ethel.

44
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,001
- 'Scuse, Mum.
- What you doing?

45
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,001
I'm washing me hands like you told me to.

46
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,459
- Oh, yes. Oh, your dad's here.
- Hello, Dad.

47
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,251
- Hello, Mum. You all right, Ethel?
- Yes.

48
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,792
- All right, Dad?
- Yes, thank you.

49
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,542
- Good day?
- Not bad, you?

50
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,501
- Can't complain.
- Oh, Ethel, take the teapot through.

51
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,834
Cor, I'm starving. I could eat an 'orse.

52
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,042
Wash your hands, Dad,
I'll put the tea on the table.

53
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,459
Just get me slippers on.

54
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,501
Well, he's all on his tod, ain't he?
Seems a nice enough fellow, though.

55
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:22,251
- Ooh, yes. Hard worker.
- Is he the little bloke, bald?

56
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:24,209
- No.
- No. Stocky fella.

57
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,042
- Lives opposite.
- Oh, yes. Does he?

58
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,417
I shouldn't wonder he don't have
bread and dripping every night.

59
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:29,751
Ain't nothing wrong
with bread and dripping.

60
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,459
- Not every night.
- I wouldn't mind.

61
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,042
Oh, yes? Like to see your face

62
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,709
if I put bread and dripping
on the table every teatime!

63
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,751
No, I'll do him a nice stew.

64
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:40,042
- Can we have dumplings, Mum?
- Oh, course you can.

65
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,792
- I love a dumpling.
- You are a dumpling.

66
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,042
- Oh, that's nice!
- What you got your work clothes on for?

67
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,542
It's a Tuesday, Dad.
I've got me night school.

68
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,251
- Oh, yes.
- That's right.

69
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,251
Better leave in a minute.

70
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,917
Dumpling!

71
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,917
I'm meeting David this evening.

72
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,417
You're looking very flat-chested.

73
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,959
Have you lost weight?

74
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,667
I don't know.

75
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,834
That was lovely, Vera.
Thank you very much.

76
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:44,126
- Very tasty.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.

77
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,167
Why don't you sit on the settee, Reg?
Make yourself at home.

78
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,251
'Ere you are, Reg, sit down.
We'll have a smoke.

79
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,917
Make a fresh pot, Ethel.

80
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,876
- No, 'ere you are.
- No, go on.

81
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,334
Ta.

82
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,084
- Sid?
- Oh, cheers, mate.

83
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,251
How's work going, Stan?

84
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,751
- What is it, motors?
- Motor mechanic, yes.

85
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,751
Well, they bring 'em in,
we mend 'em, push 'em back out again.

86
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,751
It's just the two of us, see?
Me and my brother.

87
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,459
Oh, what, family business like?

88
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:18,626
Well, it's Frank's business.
I work for him. Well, with him.

89
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,459
You always worked on the roads,
then, Reg?

90
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,251
- Nah, started in the war.
- Oh?

91
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,751
Oh, what kind of war did you have, Reg?

92
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,292
- Pioneer Corps.
- Oh, yes?

93
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:28,542
We laid tarmac
on all the American bases.

94
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,167
- Did you?
- We did.

95
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,126
- Went out in France, 1940.
- You was out there early then?

96
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,626
Dunkirk. We done a runner
when they broke through.

97
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:38,126
Then we went out a few days after D-Day.

98
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,792
Same as you, Dad.

99
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,751
About a month after D-Day,
we went out there.

100
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,959
- Just after the Battle of Caen.
- Oh, yes?

101
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:47,042
It was murder then.
Mind you, others had it worse than us.

102
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,667
I was in the Service Corps, driver.

103
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,751
We pushed through Normandy
into northern France, Belgium.

104
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,417
I ended up in Hamburg.

105
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,792
I was in Hamburg an' all, Reg.

106
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:59,084
- Was you?
- Not then, though.

107
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,042
- No, after the war. National Service.
- Oh, I'm with you.

108
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,667
I tell you, they got it worse
over there, the Germans.

109
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,334
Well, we all had it bad.

110
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,042
- It weren't cosy for no one, was it?
- Right an' all, Dad.

111
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,709
No, but we done demolition
before the war.

112
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,292
- Me and my brother.
- Oh, does he live round here?

113
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,167
Not now. He's in Australia.

114
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,084
- Melbourne.
- Ooh, is he?

115
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,959
He went out two year ago.

116
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,667
- That's a long way away, innit?
- Well, he was in Burma in the war.

117
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,167
- My brother was in Burma.
- Was he?

118
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:31,126
Well, he met a few Australian blokes,

119
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,626
came back, married a Scottish girl,
went out there.

120
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,084
Cor! Well, I never!

121
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,459
Was he a POW, Reg?

122
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,834
He don't talk about it, Stan.

123
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,501
No, my friend won't
talk about it, neither.

124
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,167
You lose any mates, Reg?

125
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,959
A few, yes.

126
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,584
I lost a couple of pals, an' all.

127
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,251
I lost my best mate.

128
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:57,292
- Oh, that's right, Bill.
- Did our basic together and everything.

129
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,459
Out in Palestine.

130
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,876
He got ambushed in an orange grove.

131
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,709
I had to pack his kit up for him, like.

132
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,042
Sit next to Reg.

133
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,042
- It's dreadful, innit?
- Terrible.

134
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,792
You warm enough, Reg?

135
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,667
Put the fire on, Dad.

136
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,001
I lost my mum in the Blitz.

137
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,334
Did you, Reg?

138
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,001
Chapel Street market, 1941, March.

139
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,001
Oh, now, we remember that bomb,
don't we, Dad?

140
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:30,667
- It blew all the windows out.
- Yes, it did.

141
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,501
We was just round the corner,
Penton Street.

142
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,376
- Opposite the church.
- Oh, yeah?

143
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,542
Our flats never got touched.

144
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,417
She popped in to see my aunt,
went shopping...

145
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,042
gone.

146
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,626
Want another cup of tea, Reg?

147
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,876
Sorry to hear that, mate.

148
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:54,126
That was a lovely spread, Vera.

149
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,876
Thank you very much.

150
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,042
Well, enjoy your pub.

151
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,834
Make sure you wear a coat, Susan,

152
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,959
if you're travelling in
an open-top sports car.

153
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,709
- Yes, I am.
- Cheerio, old chap.

154
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,126
Goodbye, sir.

155
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,542
Goodnight, Sid.

156
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,792
- Night, Dad.
- Night-night, Ethel.

157
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,542
Night-night, Dad.

158
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,292
Night, Ethel.

159
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:39,542
Goodnight.

160
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,542
Where are you tomorrow, Mrs Wells'?

161
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,542
No, Mrs Fowler's tomorrow.

162
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,917
I was at Mrs Wells' this morning,
bless her.

163
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,876
- Night-night, love.
- Night, dear.

164
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:57,042
Ooh, Stanley, your feet!

165
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,542
- Warm 'em up for us.
- Oh, come on, then.

166
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:06,042
I reckon that Reg would make
a good husband to some nice girl.

167
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,334
Where's a bloke like that
gonna meet anybody?

168
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,626
We managed to find each other.

169
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,167
That's right, love.

170
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,834
Miracles do happen.

171
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:17,709
Oh.

172
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,042
Let me go.

173
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,626
Don't.

174
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,376
Stop.

175
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,626
- You're terribly beautiful, you know.
- I should get...

176
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,834
- I should get a taxi.
- Shhhh.

177
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,792
- Come on, let's dance.
- Please don't be silly.

178
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,042
- I do apologise.
- What?

179
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:53,542
I haven't got a gramophone.

180
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,459
That's not funny.

181
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,376
- It's not funny.
- It's not funny?

182
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,501
It's not funny.

183
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,001
It's not funny.

184
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,501
Oh, morning, Mrs Fowler.

185
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:52,001
- Good morning, Mrs Drake.
- Am I in your way, dear?

186
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,042
Lost something?

187
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,042
- I am in your way, aren't I?
- Oh, no, I just...

188
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,501
Oh, can't see for looking, sometimes.

189
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:10,501
I'm like that myself,

190
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,542
when I'm looking for things.

191
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,459
All right, Mother?

192
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,001
Ain't you been up today?

193
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,709
Now...

194
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,126
Leave it alone!

195
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,751
You getting married yourself, sir?

196
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,209
No fear.

197
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,751
No, it'll be a sister of mine
that's getting married.

198
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,209
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

199
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:28,001
Well, to tell you the truth,
I haven't met your man yet.

200
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,334
He's a bit of dark horse, so I...

201
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,334
- Just lower your arm for me.
- Yeah.

202
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,334
So when are you catching the boat?

203
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,334
A week this Saturday coming.

204
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,834
- Oh, doesn't give us much time, then.
- From Holyhead, I'm goin'.

205
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,209
- Just lower your arms for me, please, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

206
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,834
Thank you.

207
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,876
So I'll be having
a waistcoat with it, then?

208
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,917
That's no problem whatsoever, sir.

209
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,334
As I said, it's, uh... We charge
ten guineas for the two-piece suit,

210
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,626
moving up to 13 guineas
for the three-piece.

211
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,834
- Well, I have no money on me now, so...
- Oh, lovely.

212
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,334
And I want the jacket just
like the one you have on there.

213
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,334
Well, you have chosen
the double-breasted jacket, sir,

214
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,084
- with the four buttons.
- Yeah.

215
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,792
Now, the only difference is

216
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,626
your lapel is going to fasten
down to the bottom button,

217
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,417
- giving it a much more streamlined effect.
- Oh.

218
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,917
And what with the light blue barathea,
plus the stripe

219
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,334
to accentuate your height,
it's bold, it's sharp,

220
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,126
and it's certainly going
to make an impression

221
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,834
when you walk into the church, sir.

222
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,417
Well, that's exactly what I want, sir.

223
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,251
- Just face the mirror for me.
- Yeah.

224
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,542
- I'll be the lord of the manor in it?
- Oh yes, sir.

225
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:29,876
- I'll be like your man, George Raft.
- You will indeed, sir.

226
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,667
Me daddy won't know me, huh?

227
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,834
Well, if you're going
for the George Raft look, sir...

228
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,167
we can always supply you
with a pair of spats.

229
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,834
Oh, no. No spats.

230
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,626
Whatever you want, sir.

231
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,334
I'm just going to measure
your outside leg.

232
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,667
Yeah.

233
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,626
Come on!

234
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,459
Seized up?

235
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,917
She's there.

236
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,167
Is Joycie all right?

237
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,959
She's fine.

238
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,417
We ain't seen her in ages.

239
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,876
She's started talking about moving.

240
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,334
Moving where?

241
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,959
To a bigger house.

242
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,709
Your house is big enough, innit?

243
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,709
Yes.

244
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,626
- You ain't been there a year.
- I know.

245
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,834
We had a bit of company last night.

246
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,959
- Did you?
- You know what Vera's like.

247
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,001
She finds a young fella,
lives on his own, no family,

248
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,251
hoicks him in with us,
gives him his tea.

249
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,167
She's got a heart of gold, that woman.

250
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,834
She's a diamond.

251
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,709
You're a lucky man.

252
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,792
You're a lucky man an' all, Frank.

253
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,917
What she invited him round for, anyway?

254
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,709
- He lives on his own.
- A lot of people live on their own.

255
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,334
Don't mean you've got to invite them
all round for tea though, does it?

256
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:29,834
It's just Vera's way, ain't it?

257
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,876
Maybe he wants to be on his own.

258
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,834
She wants to mind her own business.

259
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,834
She's a little busybody, bless her.

260
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,001
She's going to get herself in trouble
one of these days.

261
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,334
I'm glad we moved out here, aren't you?

262
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:45,334
I seen the washing machine I want
this morning. It's twenty-five pound.

263
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,792
Oh, no, not now, Frank.
Not your accounts.

264
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,376
- It'll take me ten minutes.
- I know your "ten minutes".

265
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,501
An hour and ten minutes, more like.

266
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,834
I thought we was going
to have another early night.

267
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,334
I'll finish this and we can
have an early night.

268
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,917
All right, dear.

269
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,334
Frank?

270
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,542
Frank.

271
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,251
You asleep?

272
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,292
Don't go to sleep on me.

273
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,501
Frank?

274
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:26,834
Mmm?

275
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,042
Oh, you come on top of me then.

276
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,834
- Come on.
- Can't we leave it till tomorrow?

277
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,959
No, we got to do it now, ain't we?

278
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,501
Afternoon, dear.

279
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,042
Thank you.

280
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,334
This way.

281
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,042
Right then, dear.

282
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,959
First thing we've got to do...

283
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,917
is put the kettle on.

284
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,459
Oh. Got a bowl in here.

285
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:23,917
There.

286
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:27,459
Now, where are...? Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,376
You got a towel, dear?

288
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,709
Oh, very good. Where's your bed?

289
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,917
Through here.

290
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,834
Now, what I want you to do,

291
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,834
take your knickers off for me,

292
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,417
lie down here.

293
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:59,834
Don't you be upset because
I'm here to help you, aren't I?

294
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,459
And that's what I'm going to do.

295
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,501
So, pop your bottom on the bed
and I'll be back in a jiffy.

296
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,376
Here we are, then.

297
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,126
Hop on the bed for me.

298
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,542
- How long is it going to take?
- Not long, dear.

299
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,126
Open your legs. There.

300
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,667
- You on your own?
- Only for a bit.

301
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:21,626
Now, what I'm going to do
is have a little feel,

302
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,626
make sure everything's as it should be

303
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,334
and then we'll get
the soapy water inside.

304
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,126
- So you go all floppy for me.
- What do you mean?

305
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,792
Just lie down, dear.

306
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,917
Wet my hand a bit and feel.

307
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,542
You're all right, all right.

308
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,667
Push this little tube in.

309
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,209
All right.

310
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,792
Here comes the water.

311
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,167
When you feel full,

312
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,626
we'll stop.

313
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:12,042
Was you at work, today?

314
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,042
I went in this morning.

315
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,501
- Weather's turned.
- Yes.

316
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,709
Now...

317
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,459
- That feel full?
- Yes.

318
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,751
Right.

319
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,542
There. Now...

320
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,001
You dry yourself off.

321
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,501
Hold that towel there for a minute
and I'll clean out the bowl.

322
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,501
Now, what's going to happen
is tomorrow or the day after,

323
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,501
you'll get a bit of a pain down below.

324
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,001
Take yourself to the toilet,
you'll start bleeding,

325
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:06,751
then it'll all come away.

326
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,001
What do you mean,
"it will come away"?

327
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:11,584
It'll all be over, dear.
You'll be right as rain.

328
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,001
I won't die, will I?

329
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,001
No, dear.

330
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,917
Right. I'll be on my way.

331
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,084
- I'll see meself out.
- It's all right.

332
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,667
- Look after yourself, dear.
- Right.

333
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:52,501
I've got 200 Craven "A" and he's
given me eight pair of nylons.

334
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,042
Well, I'll have some nylons.

335
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,959
I'll take three pairs of nylons
off you, Sid.

336
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:59,001
- Right, what you offering?
- Five packets of Players.

337
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:02,001
- What, for three pairs of nylons?
- That's right.

338
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,334
No, no. These are the Italian nylons.
They ain't the Czech ones.

339
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,167
- Yeah, they're nice they are.
- I don't care.

340
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:10,001
I'm offering five packets of Players
for three pairs of nylons.

341
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:12,501
- Take it or leave it.
- Turn it up, Ron, eh?

342
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,751
I mean, either I'm talking
in another language,

343
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,417
- or he's a bit Mutt and Jeff.
- I heard you.

344
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:19,751
Look, make it ten packets.

345
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,542
- I'll give you six... seven.
- Eight.

346
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,334
Look, take 'em out with you Saturday.

347
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,334
"How you doing, darling? Fancy a turn?"
Slip her a pair, happy days!

348
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,709
- All right, eight.
- Done.

349
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,084
Good boy.

350
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,167
I'll give you two packets of tea
for a pair.

351
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:38,084
What are you two, a double act?

352
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,084
- Hello, Lily.
- Your bleedin' stairs.

353
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,876
- They'll be the death of me.
- You've must've heard the kettle boil.

354
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,001
No.

355
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:52,917
Just made a fresh pot.

356
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,834
How'd that go the other week?

357
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,376
Same as usual.

358
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,667
- Nervous little thing, wasn't she?
- I know.

359
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,126
I put her right. Set her mind at rest.

360
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,542
- You always do, don't ya?
- Don't you want a biscuit, Lily?

361
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,084
Won't say no.

362
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,542
Thank you.

363
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,251
- I got another one for you.
- Oh, yes? Friday, is it?

364
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:13,001
- Is Friday all right?
- Mm.

365
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,334
- I told her five o'clock.
- That's all right, yes.

366
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,084
Want some tea?

367
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:20,876
- Sardines?
- I'm all right this week, Lily.

368
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,251
- Oh, now what sweets you got?
- Boiled sweets.

369
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:27,542
'Ere you are.
Don't you want some for your Ethel?

370
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,084
- How much are them, then?
- Tuppence a bag.

371
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:32,584
- Penny ha'ppenny to you.
- Righty-oh.

372
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,251
- Kelp Street.
- Oh, I know.

373
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:45,751
Nora. Got seven kids already.

374
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,501
Oh, can't she manage?

375
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,667
- Well, could you?
- I've only got a threepenny bit.

376
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,251
I've got change.

377
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,084
Ain't the husband around?

378
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,501
I expect so.

379
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:56,501
Can't control himself, if you ask me.

380
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,001
Oh, ta. Poor woman.

381
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:00,626
Serves her right.

382
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,709
Don't you want no sardines
for your mother?

383
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:06,501
No, she can't eat them no more, Lily.
Gives her heartburn.

384
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,251
How's she keeping anyway, your mum?

385
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:10,917
Oh, you know, getting older.

386
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,626
Ain't we all?

387
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,501
That's Ethel.

388
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:16,959
- That you, Ethel?
- Hello, Mum.

389
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,084
- Lily's here.
- Oh.

390
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:20,709
Hello, Ethel.

391
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,292
Hello.

392
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,834
- You want a cuppa?
- Yes, please, Mum.

393
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:38,001
- Ain't she got a boyfriend yet?
- No.

394
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,126
I ain't surprised.

395
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,542
That was a lovely spread, Vera.
Thank you very much.

396
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,126
- You're welcome, Reg, you know that.
- Doing a bit of mending?

397
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:52,376
Yeah. You got anything needs doing?

398
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,501
You've got a bit of leg poking
through your trousers there, Reg.

399
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,334
- Yes, he has.
- I done that at work.

400
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,667
- I ain't got round to it yet.
- You do your own sewing?

401
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,667
Well, I'm all fingers and thumbs,
but I have a go.

402
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:03,459
- You want to bring 'em over here, Reg.
- You need a little patch on that.

403
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,209
I'll get you a bit of cloth
from the shop, Reg.

404
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,501
What is it? Navy serge, 19 ounce.

405
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,376
Give it to Mum, she'll
mend it for you, no problem.

406
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,001
- I could do that.
- Course you can.

407
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,126
- Ethel will see you right.
- I don't want to put you out.

408
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,959
- I don't mind.
- Not now.

409
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,001
Thanks very much.

410
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:19,376
- It'll cost you, half a crown!
- Don't be silly.

411
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,751
- He was only joking, Reg.
- Do you want another sweet?

412
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,042
Ta.

413
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,001
- What are you doing, love?
- Go back to sleep.

414
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:36,417
You're ill.

415
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,792
You'll have to be quick.
Is it going to take long?

416
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:42,292
- No, dear.
- I haven't told him, you see?

417
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:44,042
- He's supposed to be at work.
- Yes, dear.

418
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:47,334
- What's he want to come home sick for?
- Take your knickers off for me.

419
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,626
Can't have no more kids, see?

420
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,792
I've got seven already.
I ain't having no more.

421
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,501
- I know, dear.
- It'd kill me.

422
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:58,959
Lay the towel on the bed for me.

423
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,334
You sit right on the edge.

424
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:08,709
- What's that?
- Just soapy water, dear,

425
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,501
bit of disinfectant.

426
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:13,001
- Do you want me to lie down?
- Stay where you are.

427
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,292
- I've just got to get this inside.
- All right.

428
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,001
- Oh!
- All right, all right, all right?

429
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,334
Yes.

430
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,834
Oi-oi.

431
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,459
- What?
- See them, blonde, brunette?

432
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,501
- Oh, tidy!
- Ain't they?

433
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,459
How do you do?

434
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,417
Right-oh, mugger, bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed and look lively.

435
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,417
- Leave it out, we only just got here.
- Oh, come on, Kenny!

436
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,917
- Let your hair down.
- Enjoy the view.

437
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,167
- Let's have a swap, eh?
- All right.

438
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:47,917
Do you reckon she likes him?

439
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,292
Well, she's gone for a walk with him.

440
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:53,459
She wouldn't go, would she,
if she didn't like him. Would she?

441
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,917
He should take her out dancing.

442
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:00,917
- I don't think he's that type.
- I can't see Reg dancing.

443
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:09,001
She'd come back
black and blue, wouldn't she?

444
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:12,501
- Dad!
- She'd have to give her feet a soak.

445
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,917
No, hold on, they might turn out
to be a proper Fred and Ginger,

446
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:18,167
the pair of them. You never know.

447
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,334
- Did you have to come far?
- Not far, dear, no.

448
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,834
- Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink?
- No, thank you.

449
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,417
- Have you done this before, dear?
- Yes, as it happens.

450
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,917
Here we are.

451
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,917
One bowl, one towel.

452
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,917
- Kettle's on.
- Oh. Thank you.

453
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,917
- Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink?
- No, dear.

454
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,167
What?

455
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,917
You know, your hair looks really lovely.

456
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,917
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

457
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,001
Oh.

458
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:18,417
Why don't you make us all a cup of tea?

459
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,751
What, do you want a cup of tea as well?

460
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:23,084
Oh.

461
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,667
Good luck.

462
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,917
Right, dear.

463
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:32,917
You're gonna have
to take your knickers off.

464
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,334
Okey-dokey.

465
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:41,834
So, how are you?
This is rather a surprise.

466
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,501
- Haven't seen you for ages.
- Yes. No, um...

467
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,834
Sugar?

468
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,751
No, thank you.

469
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:56,501
- Thank you for coming today.
- Oh, not at all.

470
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:59,167
An excuse to get out of that
dreary old bank.

471
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:01,626
- Would you like a fag?
- No, thank you.

472
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,792
Thank you for...

473
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:09,042
Sorry.

474
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:12,001
What's the matter?

475
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,376
- Um...
- Oh, sorry.

476
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,292
Have some cake.
I had a piece before you arrived.

477
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,084
Can't resist, it's delicious.

478
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:23,834
I wanted to talk to you.

479
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:26,084
Fire away.

480
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,792
Um...

481
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,834
The first person I thought of.

482
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,084
Really.

483
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,167
Crikey, Susan, what is it?

484
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,292
I have this, um...

485
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,959
friend, who...

486
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,042
She needs some help.

487
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:07,292
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,584
Sorry.

489
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:19,209
You've got yourself into trouble,
haven't you?

490
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,501
Oh, Susan, you clot.

491
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,751
Who told you to phone me?

492
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,834
Oh!

493
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,459
All right. I'll tell you
what you have to do.

494
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,834
Oh, and when you see the psychiatrist,
you have to make up a fearful fib

495
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,667
about some potty aunt
or something or other.

496
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,501
Here. Have a hanky.

497
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:56,001
Thank you.

498
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:00,834
You'll be all right, you know.

499
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,209
Hello, George. Oh, hello, Peggy!

500
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:18,084
- You off work, today?
- Sit up, then.

501
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,584
Oh, she's all right, George. Bless her.

502
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:24,084
This has slipped a bit.
Ivy taken bad again, has she?

503
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:27,584
Oh, dear. Well, I'll make
a fresh pot of tea.

504
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:31,917
And you'll want a biscuit, Peggy,
I shouldn't wonder.

505
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,084
- Hello, Ivy.
- All right, Vera?

506
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,084
Having one of your bad days?

507
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,084
- I'm sick of it.
- Oh, dear.

508
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,126
I'll put the kettle on.

509
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,084
Didn't you sleep last night, dear?

510
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,626
You don't sleep
when you're like this, do you?

511
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:01,167
Have you managed to kip at all today?

512
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,126
- No, I ain't.
- Oh, ain't you?

513
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:05,959
Still, you're in the best place, Ivy.

514
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,084
I should be at work.

515
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,084
You can't go to work in this state.

516
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,084
Somebody's got to earn the money.

517
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,792
If I stay off, she wants to stay off.

518
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,584
I'll lose me job if this goes on.

519
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,584
It's not your fault, dear.

520
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,584
Try telling that to your boss.

521
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,084
They don't understand nothing, men.

522
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,584
Bastards.

523
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,334
Now...

524
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,917
is this your first pregnancy?

525
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,001
Yes.

526
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,917
And what does the father say?

527
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:41,834
Um...

528
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:44,417
I don't want my parents to know.

529
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:47,042
No, no, no.
I mean the father of the child.

530
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,667
Big as you can. Come and sit down.

531
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:05,042
Have you considered the possibility
of having the child?

532
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,376
I can't.

533
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,792
Very well. I'll help you.

534
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:16,917
But I'm afraid we are obliged to discuss
the delicate matter of money.

535
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:20,084
It'll come to one hundred
and fifty pounds.

536
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:23,292
How much do you have available?

537
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,376
Um...

538
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,834
Just over a hundred pounds.

539
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,459
I see.

540
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,292
Well...

541
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:34,209
let's say 100 guineas, shall we?
In advance, in cash.

542
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,126
Now, I shall require you
to see a psychiatrist.

543
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,459
I know.

544
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,209
Do you?

545
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:43,917
Yes.

546
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:47,334
And I'll arrange the nursing home
and the obstetrician.

547
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,584
Baxter. Terribly good man.

548
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,167
Any questions?

549
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,292
Pretty day.

550
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:00,834
Yes.

551
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,376
- How many weeks pregnant are you?
- Seven.

552
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:07,376
And were you a virgin?

553
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,209
Yes.

554
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,876
Miss Wells, it would be helpful

555
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:22,334
if you would give me simple
and honest answers if you can.

556
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,167
What does your father do?

557
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,751
- My father?
- Yes.

558
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,001
Um...

559
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:37,959
He works in the Ministry of Defence.

560
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:41,042
And are your parents happily married?

561
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,501
Um... I think so.

562
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,959
Is there any history
of mental illness in your family?

563
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,584
Yes.

564
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,917
An aunt of my mother's committed suicide.

565
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,876
Did she?

566
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,417
Yes.

567
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:11,917
And your own mental state,
how would you describe it at the moment?

568
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:15,542
Um...

569
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:17,834
Anxious?

570
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,084
Depressed?

571
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,876
Tell me your feelings
towards the father of the child.

572
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,084
- Do you love him?
- No.

573
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,084
- Does he love you?
- No.

574
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,959
Did you love him
at the point of conception?

575
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,584
No.

576
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,751
Did he force himself on you?

577
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,417
Miss Wells...

578
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,084
if you were to have the child,

579
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,084
would you keep it or have it adopted?

580
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,084
I can't have it.

581
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,209
I'd rather kill myself.

582
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,667
Well, I don't think
we can allow that to happen...

583
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:15,751
can we?

584
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,042
Tea's brewing.

585
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,084
- Miss Wells.
- Hello.

586
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,584
- I'm Nurse Willoughby.
- How do you do?

587
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,584
- Is this all your luggage?
- Uh, yes.

588
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,792
- If you'd like to follow me.
- Thank you.

589
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,917
- Have you had far to come?
- Not really, no.

590
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,334
- Miss Wells.
- Hello.

591
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,084
- Sister Beech.
- How do you do?

592
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,084
I hope you'll be comfortable.

593
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,459
Thank you.

594
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:58,959
There, dear.

595
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:03,792
I'll put this back under the bed for you.

596
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,667
Now, that didn't take too long, did it?

597
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,709
What, you finish already?

598
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,167
Yes, dear.

599
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:20,667
So when I gonna see you again?

600
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,251
What did you say, dear?

601
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:24,542
You have to come back, yes?

602
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:27,584
Oh no, dear.
I've done all I've got to do.

603
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,626
Now you've just got to wait.

604
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,084
What is it me waiting for?

605
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,001
For it to come away, dear.

606
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:37,584
But all you used
was a lickle bit of water.

607
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:38,959
Don't you worry.

608
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:41,334
What happen if somethin' go wrong?

609
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,584
Now what's going to happen is this...

610
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,167
tomorrow...

611
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:49,084
or Sunday, you'll have a pain down below.

612
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,334
Get yourself to the toilet.

613
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:54,667
You'll start bleeding, it'll all come
away, you'll be right as rain.

614
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:59,584
What you need now
is a nice hot cup of tea.

615
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,376
Take care, dear.

616
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:09,209
Ta-ta.

617
00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:33,126
- Oh, hello, dear.
- Good morning, Mrs Drake.

618
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,251
- Hello, Mummy.
- Good morning, dear.

619
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:42,042
- How was your weekend?
- Lovely, thank you.

620
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:44,501
How was Norfolk?

621
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:46,251
Oh, bearable.

622
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,709
Terribly sunny.

623
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:50,167
Extraordinary.

624
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:10,542
Have you got the money?

625
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:13,042
I've got the two pounds.

626
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:15,667
- Two pound?
- That's what she told me.

627
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,501
Well, she told you wrong.
It's two guineas.

628
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:19,792
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ain't no use being sorry.

629
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,751
Oh, you want payment
now then, do you?

630
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:23,667
Well, I don't want paying
next week, do I?

631
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,917
Where is your husband, anyway?

632
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,167
Korea, since you're asking.

633
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,042
- In the forces, is he?
- Yes.

634
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:41,209
- Two guineas.
- Thank you very much.

635
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,626
So it's not his, then?

636
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:51,876
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

637
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:59,251
Done this for a lot of girls then,
have you?

638
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:00,751
Mind your own bleedin' business.

639
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:03,459
- I'm only asking.
- And I'm only telling ya.

640
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:05,792
Right.

641
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,209
You put your address down there.

642
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,042
She'll be there at five o'clock.

643
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:16,792
Don't mention the money.

644
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,501
That's between me and you.
Is that understood?

645
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:21,084
- Yes!
- Good.

646
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:32,376
Can you do one on Friday?

647
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:33,792
- At five o'clock?
- Yes.

648
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:34,917
That's all right.

649
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:36,417
- Married lady.
- Oh, yes?

650
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:38,917
- Got herself in a bit of trouble.
- How's that, then?

651
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:40,917
Having a bit of "how's your father"
on the side.

652
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:44,251
- Oh, that's not right, is it, Lily?
- Well, I don't think so.

653
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:47,126
Still, gotta help them out, ain't you?

654
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:49,417
How'd you get on with that darkie?

655
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,917
- Oh, I did feel sorry for her.
- Long way from home.

656
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:53,417
She was very scared.

657
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,417
What are they doing over here, anyway?

658
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,917
Trying to make a better life
for themselves, I shouldn't wonder.

659
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,417
- They should stay where they are.
- They're hard workers.

660
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:03,417
- You need any sugar?
- How much you charging this week, Lily?

661
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,501
One and threepence ha'penny to you.

662
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,709
All right, then.

663
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,667
- Here you are.
- Ta.

664
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,501
There.

665
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:18,626
Thank you.

666
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:33,126
Oh! Oh! I'm ever so scared!

667
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:36,792
- Try not to upset yourself, dear.
- I'm sorry. I can't...

668
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,917
I've got to pull myself together.

669
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,542
Oh, I've got to go through with this.

670
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,917
Oh! I know I have to, it's just that...

671
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:46,917
nobody knows...

672
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:49,334
Well, my friend knows,
but she doesn't know.

673
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:51,792
I mean, she doesn't know
it's today and...

674
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:56,417
So if anything were to happen to me,
no one would know.

675
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,626
You've got to get your knickers off,
dear, and lie down.

676
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:04,459
Oh. Oh, no. No, no, no.

677
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

678
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:09,876
Oh, no, no...

679
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:13,501
Oh, I'm a terrible person!

680
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,584
What's the matter?

681
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,667
Nothing.

682
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:37,417
Ain't you had a nice night?

683
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:39,417
Yes.

684
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:41,542
You?

685
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:57,584
You ever thought about moving out?

686
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:01,084
What do you mean?

687
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,542
What do you think about getting married?

688
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,917
What, to you?

689
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:12,042
Yes.

690
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:18,084
I ain't never thought about it.

691
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,084
- I've been thinking about it.
- Have you?

692
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,084
About three or four weeks.

693
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:34,501
What do you reckon?

694
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,959
Do you wanna?

695
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,251
Yes.

696
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:50,792
I do.

697
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:05,626
All right, then.

698
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:17,042
Better tell your mum.

699
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:34,292
Dad...

700
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,167
- Dad, wake up.
- What's the matter?

701
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,667
I've got to go in the kitchen.

702
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,459
Woke me up.

703
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:50,626
- Oh, hello, Reg.
- Hello, Stan.

704
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:52,834
Good kip?

705
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:54,542
Yes, all right.

706
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:00,459
Can I have a word, Stan?

707
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,917
What's the matter?

708
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,751
Can I have your permission to marry Ethel?

709
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:21,084
Have you asked her?

710
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:22,917
Yes.

711
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:26,917
What'd she say?

712
00:52:27,001 --> 00:52:28,876
She said yes.

713
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:32,959
Well, of course you can.

714
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,792
- Are you sure?
- Congratulations!

715
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:36,792
- Thanks very much.
- Vera? Ethel?

716
00:52:36,876 --> 00:52:39,292
- You know what he's just asked me?
- I'm ever so pleased.

717
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,292
- I'm delighted!
- Me too.

718
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:43,917
- What's all the shouting about?
- These two just got engaged!

719
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:45,084
No!

720
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,792
- Oh, congratulations, mate!
- Thanks very much.

721
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:48,709
I was asleep on that chair, there.

722
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,001
Sorry about waking you up.

723
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,001
- Oh, that's all right!
- Oh, don't you worry about that.

724
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:54,876
- I asked her last night.
- Oh, did you?

725
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:56,376
Yeah.

726
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:59,126
- Well done, the both of you.
- I can't believe it.

727
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,334
Wow, Reg, good going.

728
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,792
- Don't look so worried.
- You're sure?

729
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:09,292
Course, I'm sure.
I've been to the doctors and I'm sure.

730
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:11,001
About time an' all.

731
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:13,126
You have to start taking things easy.

732
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,959
What, you gonna look after me?

733
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:16,917
- Yes.
- Are you?

734
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:20,292
We'll have to tell Stan and Vera.

735
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,459
Yes, we'll tell Stan and Vera.

736
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,459
We'll tell them together, properly.

737
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:26,292
We'll go around there...

738
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:29,292
- next weekend.
- I'll ask him in the morning.

739
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,001
Can I have my washing machine now, please?

740
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:08,792
- Morning, Frank.
- Morning, Stan.

741
00:54:08,876 --> 00:54:10,626
Got some news for you.

742
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:11,792
What?

743
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,959
'Ere you are. Have a guess.

744
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:18,626
Good news or bad news?

745
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:20,876
- Bad news.
- Wrong. Try again.

746
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:23,001
All right, good news.

747
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:28,251
Well, come on, then. What is it?

748
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,376
Eh?

749
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:34,376
Spill the beans, old cock!

750
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:37,584
My little Ethel, she got engaged.

751
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,084
- What?
- Yesterday afternoon.

752
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,667
- What, to Reg?
- I couldn't believe it.

753
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:43,001
I thought they'd be courting for years.

754
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:47,542
Well...

755
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:50,084
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Frank.

756
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:52,084
You must be a very proud man.

757
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,084
You should've seen Vera's face.

758
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,209
It was a bolt from the blue.

759
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,417
So, on Sunday,

760
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:01,084
you and Joycie got to
come over for your tea.

761
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,251
We'll get some beers in,
some sherry for the girls.

762
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:05,584
We'll toast the happy couple
and Reg can meet the family.

763
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,584
- On Sunday?
- About four o'clock.

764
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:10,251
- You'll tell Joyce?
- I'll tell her.

765
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,584
Can you feel that, dear?
Starting to fill up?

766
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,792
Yes.

767
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:19,751
- Does that feel peculiar, Pam?
- Yes.

768
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,834
That's how it's meant to feel, ain't it?

769
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,209
- Peculiar?
- Yes.

770
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:25,084
- You've done this before, ain't you?
- Yes, dear.

771
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:26,834
- So, it's safe.
- It's safe, innit?

772
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,584
- Yes, darling.
- And when it's full,

773
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,292
that's when we'll stop.

774
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,084
I know your face from somewhere.

775
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,084
- Who, me?
- Yes.

776
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,209
- Do you?
- I can't think where, though.

777
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:42,584
You all right?

778
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:45,084
Of course. Sunlight Laundry.

779
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,084
- Oh, dear.
- It's Vera, ain't it?

780
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:50,209
- That's right.
- Vera Drake.

781
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:53,834
- I knew your mother before the war.
- Did you?

782
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,459
- Was you doing this back then?
- That feel full, dear?

783
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:57,667
Yes.

784
00:56:00,084 --> 00:56:01,792
All right.

785
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:07,167
Just dry yourself off. There.

786
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:30,417
Get that down you, come on.

787
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:32,417
Cold. Cold.

788
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:34,417
Cool you down.

789
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:37,167
Cool you down.
Make you nice and cool.

790
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:51,501
Cheers. Here's to 'em, eh?

791
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:57,251
Hello again, Pamela.
How are you feeling?

792
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:59,251
Poorly, hmm?

793
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,792
Now, I need to take
another look at your tummy.

794
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,001
Don't worry,
I'll be as gentle as I can.

795
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:06,626
Pamela, we just need you
to straighten your legs.

796
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:09,251
That's it. Good girl.
Right down on to the bed.

797
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,917
I promise you, I have very warm hands.

798
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:15,667
Bring your bottom up.
Good girl. That's it.

799
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,751
Now, I'm going to press gently

800
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:22,167
and I want you to tell me
what happens when I let go.

801
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:24,667
- No!
- Good girl, well done.

802
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:26,959
- We'll do an internal, Sister.
- All right, doctor.

803
00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:32,751
Now then, Mrs Barnes,

804
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:36,376
I, uh... I don't have
very good news, I'm afraid.

805
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:38,417
Why? Why? What's happening?

806
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:41,501
I'm going to have to operate.
Pamela is a very sick girl.

807
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:43,126
She ain't gonna die, is she?

808
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,292
We sincerely hope not, Mrs Barnes,
but this is a grave situation,

809
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,251
as I'm sure you'll understand.
Now then...

810
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:51,251
when Pamela was admitted this evening,

811
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,959
you stated that she was
having a miscarriage.

812
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,376
Yes.

813
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,667
But that isn't the whole truth, is it?

814
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:01,542
Mrs Barnes,

815
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:03,834
did you do something to Pamela to try

816
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:05,751
- to bring about a termination?
- No, I didn't!

817
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:07,334
Well, somebody did.

818
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,876
You know that and I know that.

819
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:14,751
Mrs Barnes, I've been a doctor
for over 25 years.

820
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:18,501
Sister and I see cases like this
every weekend, don't we, Sister?

821
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:20,459
Yes, we do.

822
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:24,459
All right.

823
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:28,042
Someone come to the house.

824
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,959
And what did they do?

825
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:33,251
She grated pink soap
into a bowl of warm water

826
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:34,959
and she had
a bottle of stuff and put...

827
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:37,292
- And she used a syringe?
- Yes.

828
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:39,751
And no doubt,
she'll use her syringe again.

829
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:42,251
And again and again
and again, and Sister and I

830
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,959
will have to deal with dozens of cases
just like Pamela's.

831
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:47,417
Mrs Barnes, these people must be stopped.

832
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:53,251
You're going to have to inform the police.

833
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:56,251
I ain't talking to them!

834
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,251
Sister Coombes.

835
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,292
Righty-oh. They're ready for you
in theatre, Mr Walsh.

836
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:06,751
Thank you, Sister.

837
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:10,667
Mrs Barnes, if you don't inform
the police, I'm going to have to.

838
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,751
Unfortunately, it's my
legal obligation to do so.

839
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:16,001
Excuse me.

840
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,792
- Excuse me, nurse.
- Yes, sir?

841
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:37,251
We're police officers.
We're looking for Sister Coombes.

842
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:39,501
Yes, sir, if you'll just follow me.

843
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,417
Sister, it's police.

844
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:51,251
Good evening, Sister.
I'm Detective Inspector Webster.

845
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:53,251
- This is DS Vickers...
- Good evening.

846
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:55,167
Oh, good evening.

847
00:59:58,709 --> 01:00:00,626
We was sitting by the side of the road,

848
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,626
there was bodies everywhere,
stink, petrol.

849
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,626
I'd had enough.

850
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:07,626
I couldn't do nothing.

851
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:09,626
Couldn't run away, couldn't cry,

852
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:11,709
couldn't feel nothing, just sat there.

853
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,626
And all of a sudden,
there was this old girl

854
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:17,626
staggering past us,

855
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:19,751
muttering in French.

856
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,042
Guess what she was carrying under her arm?

857
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:25,917
- What?
- A pair of old mirrors.

858
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,834
You ain't told me that before.

859
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,959
We've got a lot to be thankful for.

860
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,959
- Yes, we have.
- I have.

861
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:43,251
For one thing, you ain't turned out
nothing like your mother.

862
01:00:44,626 --> 01:00:46,667
She can't help it.

863
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:50,084
Did you ever ask
who your dad was in the end?

864
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:52,834
No.

865
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,001
If I'd have been 11 or 12
when Mum died...

866
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,876
I'd have had to gone
in an orphanage, like Frank.

867
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:02,792
I know. You were straight out to work.

868
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:04,459
I had to fend for meself, didn't I?

869
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:07,209
- Still, it did you no harm.
- No, girl.

870
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,042
- Look at everything you got now.
- Yes.

871
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:14,251
I'm a lucky man.

872
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:21,042
You telephoned for an ambulance
this afternoon, is that right?

873
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:23,417
- Yes.
- Now, why did you do that?

874
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:25,376
She was having a miscarriage, weren't she?

875
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:27,376
- A miscarriage?
- Yes.

876
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:30,709
Mr Walsh has told us that somebody
came round to your house

877
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,376
to perform an operation on your daughter.

878
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,001
Well, there you are,
Mr Walsh has told you.

879
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,792
Doctors know everything.
Why don't you ask him?

880
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:37,501
I want to hear it from you, Mrs Barnes.

881
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,876
He's the one what phoned you.
I never phoned you.

882
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:41,376
It ain't got nothing to do with me.

883
01:01:41,459 --> 01:01:43,959
Keep your voice down, Mrs Barnes.

884
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:47,042
Who was it that performed this operation?

885
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:49,959
A woman.

886
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:52,209
- Do you know her name?
- No.

887
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,501
How did you get in touch with this woman?

888
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:56,334
I don't know. You just ask about.

889
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,667
- Who did you ask?
- People at work.

890
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:00,126
Where do you work, Mrs Barnes?

891
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:01,876
Allied Laundries, Clerkenwell Road.

892
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:04,376
- Who did you talk to at work?
- What does it matter now?

893
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:07,709
Your daughter's just
nearly died, Mrs Barnes.

894
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,042
It would be in your best interests.

895
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:17,542
You do realise this is a criminal matter?

896
01:02:20,459 --> 01:02:21,876
All right.

897
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,001
- Vera.
- Vera?

898
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:29,709
- Vera Drake.
- That's who you talked to at work?

899
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:32,167
No, she's the one what come round.
She's the one what done it.

900
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:35,376
Vera Drake is the person that performed
the operation on your daughter?

901
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:37,834
- Yes.
- So you do know her name?

902
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:40,042
Yes.

903
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,042
Had you met her before?

904
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:45,251
We both worked in a laundry in 1931.

905
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,334
- Have you seen her since then?
- No.

906
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:49,501
- Do you know where she lives?
- No.

907
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:56,334
What does she look like, Mrs Barnes?

908
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:02,417
Um, small, small hands. I ain't going
to get into trouble for this, am I?

909
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:05,876
It's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?
Somebody you haven't seen for years

910
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:07,876
just suddenly turns up
on your doorstep.

911
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:09,376
Well, I ain't lying!

912
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:11,376
You're twisting my words.
That's not fair!

913
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:12,834
It's all right, dear.

914
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:15,126
I'm not suggesting
you are lying, Mrs Barnes.

915
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,709
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of things.

916
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:22,376
- 'Ere you are, Sid, round here.
- Come on then.

917
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:24,376
Yeah, that's better.
Where we always have it.

918
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,376
- Gives us more room, don't it?
- Oh, yes.

919
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:28,376
Got the Christmas cloth.

920
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,084
Well, we want it to look nice,
don't we, Mum?

921
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,751
Yes. There.

922
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:34,876
- Yes?
- Good afternoon.

923
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,876
Are you Mrs Lillian Clark?

924
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,959
- Why, who wants to know?
- DI Webster, Metropolitan Police.

925
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:44,917
There we are!

926
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,626
There you are.

927
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:49,334
- Hello! Hello, Joyce!
- All right, Stan?

928
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:51,334
- Just catching my breath.
- Hello, Joyce!

929
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,334
Oh, don't she look lovely?

930
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,376
- All right, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

931
01:03:55,459 --> 01:03:57,376
- Hello, Auntie Joyce.
- Hello, Sidney.

932
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,126
- How are you?
- Look at the inside of this!

933
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:00,917
- How are you doing, Uncle Frank?
- All right, Sid.

934
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:03,626
- Cor, I ain't seen you for ages.
- Oh, you look like a film star.

935
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,584
Congratulations, Ethel,
it's lovely news.

936
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,917
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I do!

937
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:08,876
- I sewed the lining in myself.
- Did you?

938
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,501
- It's leopard print.
- Leopard print?

939
01:04:10,584 --> 01:04:12,709
Cor, blimey, look at that, eh?

940
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:16,251
'Ere, I hope you left your rifle
at home, Auntie Joyce!

941
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:18,792
Do you know Mrs Edna McKenzie?

942
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:20,834
What if I do?

943
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:22,834
Just give us a straight answer, please.

944
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,084
I might.

945
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:28,126
Are you familiar with the standard
tearooms in the Holloway Road, Mrs Clark?

946
01:04:28,209 --> 01:04:29,959
- Yes.
- Were you there last Wednesday?

947
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:33,292
- I can't remember.
- You're not helping yourself, Mrs Clark.

948
01:04:33,376 --> 01:04:35,376
What's this all about, anyway?

949
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,501
Do you know Vera Drake?

950
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,876
Quite a grocer's shop
you've got here, love.

951
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:46,334
- It's for the old people, for Christmas.
- How much you charge 'em for a bag of tea?

952
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:48,876
Did you take two guineas off
Jessica Barnes last Wednesday?

953
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:51,876
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do, Mrs Clark.

954
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:54,251
Nice living you're making for yourself.

955
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:02,376
Have you got a little bit
of lipstick on, Ethel?

956
01:05:02,459 --> 01:05:04,376
Don't she look lovely
in that top an' all?

957
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:06,834
- Did you knit that yourself?
- No, got that from the market.

958
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,667
How's the house coming along,
Uncle Frank?

959
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:10,376
I've been keeping Frank busy,
ain't I, Frank?

960
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:12,834
Been up a ladder
the best part of six months.

961
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:15,292
- The neighbours have just got a TV.
- Have they?

962
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,834
- In the front room.
- Have you seen it?

963
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,084
- Only through the window.
- You'll have to get one now, Frank.

964
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:21,376
- That's next on my list.
- Dear though, ain't they?

965
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,876
- Only thirty-six pound.
- Thirty-six pound!

966
01:05:23,959 --> 01:05:25,876
- A bit steep, that.
- They must have a few bob.

967
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:28,251
Oh, yes. Got a lovely colour
an' all, ain't they, Frank?

968
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:29,376
V-8 pilot.

969
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:30,834
He's dying to have a shifty at the Javers.

970
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:32,376
I was hoping for a little spin
round the block.

971
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:35,584
- You can see it out the window.
- That ain't the same thing, is it?

972
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:37,459
Will it be
all right out there, Frank?

973
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,667
I've already told you.

974
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,334
- It'll be fine.
- Course it will.

975
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,542
Well, you can't be sure,
can you?

976
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:44,751
There he is!

977
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:47,834
Let him in, Ethel.
Talk of the devil, the man himself.

978
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:50,542
Hello.

979
01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:51,751
- That you, Reg?
- All right?

980
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:53,876
- Come on in.
- 'Ere you are, Reg, in you come.

981
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,834
- 'Ere he is!
- Afternoon.

982
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,376
Oi-oi! How's your luck, pal?

983
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:00,167
Reg, this is my brother, Frank.

984
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,584
- Pleased to meet you, Reg.
- How do you do?

985
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,251
- Congratulations.
- And his wife, Joyce.

986
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,709
- Hello, Reg.
- How do you do?

987
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:06,876
Here, take your coat off.
We can eat now. I'm starving.

988
01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:08,792
Didn't hold everybody up, did I?

989
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:10,459
Oh, don't be so silly.
Go on, sit yourselves down.

990
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:12,834
- Where do you want us then?
- Looks smart, don't he?

991
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:14,709
- Yeah, he does.
- You sit there, Reg.

992
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:17,334
- Here, Uncle Frank. You're next to me.
- Well, don't make trouble.

993
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:20,834
- Come on, everyone, tuck in.
- Fill your boots!

994
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:22,834
Ethel, thank you.

995
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:25,209
- This is nice.
- Aw.

996
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:30,542
Eh-up. Eh-up.

997
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:33,042
Here's to Ethel and Reg.

998
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:34,876
Welcome to the family, Reg.

999
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:36,876
And all the very best
to the both of you. Cheers.

1000
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,834
- Cheers.
- To the happy couple.

1001
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,834
- Here's to you.
- Ta very much.

1002
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:42,334
And if you're half as happy with your wife

1003
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:43,876
as I've been with mine,
you'll be a lucky man.

1004
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,334
- Quite right.
- It's the truth.

1005
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,751
Well, there's no turning back now, Reg.

1006
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,501
You'll be coming to us for your
Christmas dinner, won't you, Reg?

1007
01:06:49,584 --> 01:06:51,417
Yeah, you don't want
to miss Christmas here.

1008
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,376
Well, Frank and Joyce,
you'll be here, won't you?

1009
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:55,376
- Course we will.
- We ain't made no plans yet.

1010
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:57,667
- Wouldn't be the same without you.
- We'll be here, don't worry.

1011
01:06:57,751 --> 01:06:59,626
- We have a laugh, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

1012
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:01,876
And you want to get your name
down on the housing list, Reg.

1013
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:03,876
Ooh, yes, you want to get
yourself somewhere nice.

1014
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:06,042
We'll be all right at my place.

1015
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,542
Mind you, we was in one room after
we got married, weren't we, Dad?

1016
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:10,501
We was in one room for years,
yeah, in Windmill Road.

1017
01:07:10,584 --> 01:07:13,501
- Yeah, we had some good times in there.
- Christmases.

1018
01:07:13,584 --> 01:07:16,209
But one of these days
you might find that...

1019
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,709
one room ain't enough.
I'm being a bit previous there.

1020
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:21,417
- He knows what I mean.
- Take no notice.

1021
01:07:21,501 --> 01:07:23,876
'Ere you are, I'll be an uncle.

1022
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:27,542
We've... we got a bit of news to tell you
ourselves, me and Joyce.

1023
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,376
- Oh, yes?
- What is it?

1024
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,209
I've had to keep me trap shut all week.

1025
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:33,251
- Oh, dear.
- Come on, Frank. Spit it out.

1026
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:35,251
- Well?
- Well, go on then.

1027
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:37,584
- Joyce is going to have a baby.
- Aah!

1028
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,667
Gonna have a family.

1029
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,459
Congratulations, Frank.

1030
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,334
I'm really pleased for you.

1031
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,876
- Congratulations, Uncle Frank.
- That's marvellous!

1032
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:47,751
- Congratulations, Auntie Joyce.
- Thank you, Sidney.

1033
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:51,042
Well, blimey, this is
a double celebration, innit?

1034
01:07:51,126 --> 01:07:53,334
'Ere, Joyce. You'll have a little top up?

1035
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:55,292
'Ere, you kept that one quiet,
didn't you?

1036
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:58,417
- I'll go. Hey, Sid, pour the drinks.
- All right, go on.

1037
01:07:58,501 --> 01:08:00,417
'Ere you are, pass 'em over.

1038
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,084
Good afternoon, sir.

1039
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:08,417
- DI Webster, Metropolitan Police.
- Oh, yes?

1040
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,251
Does Mrs Vera Drake live here, sir?

1041
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,084
Yes, she does, yes.

1042
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:15,584
Would you be Mr Drake, sir?

1043
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:17,584
Yes.

1044
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,876
- Is Mrs Drake at home now?
- Yes.

1045
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:23,251
We'd like to have a few words with her,
if we may.

1046
01:08:23,334 --> 01:08:25,084
Oh, well, we're having a party.

1047
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,084
My daughter's just got engaged,
celebration.

1048
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,959
I'm sorry about that, sir, but we do
need to talk to your wife.

1049
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:33,209
- What about?
- I can't tell you that, sir.

1050
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,834
But it is a serious matter.

1051
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:38,792
Well, she's good as gold. She's never
done a dishonest thing in her life.

1052
01:08:38,876 --> 01:08:39,751
Yes, sir.

1053
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:42,751
May we come in?

1054
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,542
Hold up, hold up. It's the police.

1055
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,667
Eh?

1056
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,084
Good afternoon.

1057
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:55,084
Sorry to interrupt your celebrations,

1058
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,626
but we need to talk to Mrs Vera Drake.

1059
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:02,084
This is my wife.

1060
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:05,084
- What's going on?
- Could you sit down please, sir?

1061
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,209
Do as you're told, Sid.

1062
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,584
May I speak to you in private,
please, Mrs Drake?

1063
01:09:17,459 --> 01:09:18,626
Vera?

1064
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,584
This way, Mrs Drake.

1065
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,417
What is it, Dad?

1066
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:30,584
Hold on, Sid. I'll come with her.

1067
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,959
If you wouldn't mind staying
in the parlour, please, sir.

1068
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:36,084
- What's all this about?
- We will keep you posted.

1069
01:09:36,167 --> 01:09:38,084
I'm her husband,
I've got a right to know.

1070
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,084
I appreciate that, sir.

1071
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,001
If you'll just do as I've asked.

1072
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:44,751
Close the door. Thank you.

1073
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:01,959
Mrs Drake.

1074
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:05,626
I'm Detective Inspector Webster.

1075
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:09,292
This is Detective Sergeant Vickers
and WPC Best.

1076
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:13,501
I know why you're here.

1077
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,126
Beg your pardon?

1078
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:18,876
I know why you're here.

1079
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:25,001
Why are we here?

1080
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,792
Cos of what I do.

1081
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,167
Because of what you do?

1082
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:33,126
Yes.

1083
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:35,751
What is it that you do, Mrs Drake?

1084
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,334
I help young girls out.

1085
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,834
You help young girls out?

1086
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:49,209
That's right.

1087
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:51,167
How do you help them out?

1088
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,084
We're having a party today.

1089
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,917
Can I sit down, please?

1090
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:06,751
Yes, of course.

1091
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,334
I don't want to spoil it for my family.

1092
01:11:14,001 --> 01:11:16,084
Can't you come back tomorrow?

1093
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,751
I'm sorry, Mrs Drake.

1094
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:27,167
But we have to deal
with this matter today.

1095
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:29,667
Oh, do you?

1096
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:31,959
Yes.

1097
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,251
What are they taking so long for?

1098
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,792
I don't know, Sid.

1099
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,751
- Someone might've been murdered.
- Oh, my godfathers, Sidney!

1100
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:42,251
- All right, Sid.
- No, in one of the houses she cleans in.

1101
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:44,084
I mean, he said it was serious, didn't he?

1102
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,792
Someone's pinched something, that's all.

1103
01:11:45,876 --> 01:11:49,251
But there were a couple of detectives.
Plain clothes, aren't they?

1104
01:11:51,876 --> 01:11:53,792
Can you answer my question, please?

1105
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:56,376
How do you help them out?

1106
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:01,167
When they can't manage.

1107
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:03,626
When they can't manage?

1108
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,251
That's right.

1109
01:12:07,084 --> 01:12:09,834
You mean, when they're pregnant?

1110
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:18,834
So, how do you help them out?

1111
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:27,167
I help them start their bleeding again.

1112
01:12:28,626 --> 01:12:30,626
You help them to get rid of the baby?

1113
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:35,209
I've spoilt their day for them now,
haven't I?

1114
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,167
You perform an abortion.

1115
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:43,542
Is that right, Mrs Drake?

1116
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,167
You perform abortions, don't you?

1117
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:52,542
That's not what I do, dear.

1118
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:56,042
That's what you call it but...

1119
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,042
they need help.

1120
01:12:58,126 --> 01:13:01,376
Who else are they gonna turn to?
They've got no one. I help them out.

1121
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:06,209
Did you help Pamela Barnes in this way?

1122
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,501
Pamela?

1123
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:11,209
Yes, I did.

1124
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,792
On Friday?

1125
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:14,709
That's right.

1126
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:18,334
Is she all right?

1127
01:13:19,376 --> 01:13:21,542
She nearly died, Mrs Drake...

1128
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:24,709
last night.

1129
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:29,667
Oh, God.

1130
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:35,251
She'll live.

1131
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:38,417
- Thank you.
- She's in hospital, but she'll live.

1132
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:54,959
Mrs Drake, I'm arresting you
for carrying out an illegal operation

1133
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:57,167
on Pamela Mary Barnes,

1134
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:59,876
of 37 Flixton Street, London, North 1...

1135
01:14:01,084 --> 01:14:03,292
on the 17th of November, 1950.

1136
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:06,709
You're not obliged to say anything,

1137
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:09,501
but anything you say
may be given in evidence.

1138
01:14:10,209 --> 01:14:12,042
Do you understand?

1139
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:14,376
I think so, dear, yes.

1140
01:14:14,459 --> 01:14:17,001
I must ask you to accompany me
to the police station.

1141
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,376
Mrs Drake...

1142
01:14:21,459 --> 01:14:24,376
does anybody in that room
know why we're here?

1143
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:25,459
No.

1144
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:27,209
No.

1145
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:30,584
You won't tell them, will you?

1146
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:33,751
No.

1147
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,584
Now, the equipment you used

1148
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,751
to perform these operations...

1149
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:44,126
is it here on the premises?

1150
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:49,292
Can you get it for me, please?

1151
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:22,417
- Can you manage?
- Thank you, dear.

1152
01:15:35,001 --> 01:15:37,084
Pop it on the bed for me, please.

1153
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:45,626
Would you mind showing me
what's inside?

1154
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,626
Sorry, dear?

1155
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:51,167
I need to see the contents of the bag.

1156
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:52,751
Take your time.

1157
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:13,417
Can you open it up, please?

1158
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:36,126
Thank you.

1159
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:42,292
- Go on.
- Ask him, Dad.

1160
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:44,001
It's your house, Stan.

1161
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:50,126
Could you stay in the room, please?

1162
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:52,417
- I want to know what this is about.
- I don't know, sir.

1163
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:53,876
Mr Drake.

1164
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:56,126
Could I have a word with you, please?

1165
01:16:56,209 --> 01:16:57,959
What's going on?

1166
01:16:58,042 --> 01:17:01,126
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take
your wife to the police station

1167
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:03,626
- to help us with our inquiries.
- Well, I wanna go with her.

1168
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,626
You're free to do that, sir.

1169
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:08,042
- You'll have to make your own way.
- Will I?

1170
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:10,251
She's got to go to the station.

1171
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:16,709
Well, it's just a mistake, ain't it?

1172
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,292
- Yes, it is.
- Course it is.

1173
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:27,792
- How we doing?
- Ready, Sarge.

1174
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,626
Follow the sergeant.

1175
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:34,626
- You'll be all right, Vera.
- Love you, Mum.

1176
01:17:38,209 --> 01:17:40,126
- You know where the station is, sir?
- Yes, I do.

1177
01:17:40,209 --> 01:17:42,042
- I'll just get my coat.
- I'll take you.

1178
01:17:42,126 --> 01:17:43,751
- You stay 'ere.
- I've got the motor.

1179
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:46,001
- Be better if you stayed.
- Go with her, Dad.

1180
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:48,792
- What are you doing?
- Having a look.

1181
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:50,292
- Sid.
- Frank!

1182
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:55,292
Ethel, come back inside.
You'll catch your death.

1183
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:02,376
Mum!

1184
01:18:17,709 --> 01:18:20,084
Don't worry, love.
I'm coming with you.

1185
01:18:31,084 --> 01:18:33,626
As I say, Vera, this is just procedure.

1186
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,334
It's nothing to worry about

1187
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:38,167
and we'll look after everything
we've taken from you here today.

1188
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,584
Just have to pop them on for me.

1189
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,584
Sit yourself down.

1190
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,584
Thank you.

1191
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,126
Now, Vera, do you have any jewellery?

1192
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:48,459
No, dear.

1193
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:50,292
Your wedding ring.

1194
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:52,584
I'm going to have to take
that off you, I'm afraid.

1195
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,584
I... I can't.

1196
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:56,917
I know this is difficult for you.

1197
01:18:58,209 --> 01:19:00,126
I never took it off.

1198
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:01,626
I know.

1199
01:19:01,709 --> 01:19:03,626
Twenty-seven years.

1200
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,084
We'll take extra special care of it.

1201
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,792
It is regulations.

1202
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,376
Thank you, my love.

1203
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:33,209
I'll just hand this over
to the station sergeant.

1204
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:41,209
Do you know how long
this is gonna take?

1205
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:43,334
I have no more information than you, sir.

1206
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:45,667
Take a seat, please.

1207
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:04,834
Excuse me.

1208
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:07,126
- Excuse me.
- Sit down, sir.

1209
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,959
Don't get up, Mrs Drake.

1210
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,917
Now, Mrs Drake...

1211
01:20:45,209 --> 01:20:47,709
You help women who are in trouble?

1212
01:20:55,209 --> 01:20:57,126
How long have you been doing this?

1213
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:03,626
I don't know, dear.

1214
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:05,834
Well, roughly speaking.

1215
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:07,542
Five, ten years?

1216
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:12,376
A long time.

1217
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:14,667
Twenty years?

1218
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:21,626
Maybe, yes.

1219
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,751
About 20 years?

1220
01:21:27,209 --> 01:21:28,501
No, I...

1221
01:21:30,209 --> 01:21:31,959
I don't know.

1222
01:21:35,209 --> 01:21:37,126
Mrs Drake, you're in a police station

1223
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,126
under arrest for
a serious criminal offence,

1224
01:21:39,209 --> 01:21:41,126
- do you understand?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

1225
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:43,417
It's very important that you try

1226
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,584
to answer my questions truthfully.

1227
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:47,751
Yes.

1228
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,584
Is my... Is my husband in yet?

1229
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:54,084
Yes, Mrs Drake. He is.

1230
01:21:58,959 --> 01:22:01,001
How did you start...

1231
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,834
helping girls in this way?

1232
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:12,709
I can't...

1233
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:22,959
I can't...

1234
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,542
Don't worry, Vera.

1235
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:32,334
Just answer the inspector's question.

1236
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:39,167
Mrs Drake...

1237
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,584
did it happen to you
when you were a girl?

1238
01:23:15,709 --> 01:23:16,959
Now...

1239
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:20,042
as far as you're aware...

1240
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:24,626
have any of the other girls you've
helped over the years become ill?

1241
01:23:28,334 --> 01:23:30,584
What did you say, dear? Sorry.

1242
01:23:31,709 --> 01:23:33,917
Have any of them gone to the hospital?

1243
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:35,251
No.

1244
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:37,959
Are you sure?

1245
01:23:40,209 --> 01:23:41,292
Yes.

1246
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:45,376
Do you always use the syringe?

1247
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:50,626
You never use knitting needles or hooks?

1248
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:52,626
- No.
- Or any other metal objects?

1249
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:54,751
No, no, I wouldn't do that.

1250
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:04,334
- How much do you charge, Mrs Drake?
- What?

1251
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:06,334
How much do they pay you?

1252
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:11,792
I don't take money.

1253
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:16,917
I never take money. I wouldn't...

1254
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:20,626
That's not why...

1255
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:24,501
You do it for nothing?

1256
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:26,209
Of course I do.

1257
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:28,751
They need help.

1258
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:37,334
Do you know a Mrs Lillian Clark?

1259
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:45,167
Yes.

1260
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:47,751
How long have you known her?

1261
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,126
I think since... since we was kids.

1262
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:55,084
She puts young girls
in touch with you, doesn't she?

1263
01:24:57,209 --> 01:24:58,584
Sometimes.

1264
01:24:59,751 --> 01:25:01,792
Did she put you in touch
with Pamela Barnes?

1265
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:12,917
Did you know that Lillian Clark was paid
two guineas by Pamela's mother?

1266
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:17,542
No!

1267
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:20,334
She never gives you any money?

1268
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:21,626
No.

1269
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:27,834
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes, I am.

1270
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:37,709
Can I go home now, please?

1271
01:25:40,209 --> 01:25:42,251
No, Mrs Drake, I'm afraid not.

1272
01:25:43,834 --> 01:25:46,167
My children will be worried sick.

1273
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:53,751
They won't be long now.

1274
01:25:56,959 --> 01:25:58,959
Well, we can't stay here all night,
can we?

1275
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:00,626
Well, we'll be all right,
if you want to get off.

1276
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:01,709
We don't mind.

1277
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:04,084
He told us to stay,
so stay is what we'll do.

1278
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:06,001
I don't like driving in the dark.

1279
01:26:06,084 --> 01:26:08,167
It's already dark anyway.

1280
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:11,126
Well, can we have
the wireless on, please?

1281
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:19,501
So now, Mrs Drake,
I'm going to invite you under caution

1282
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:21,251
to make a statement in your own words

1283
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:23,417
which I shall write down
and then read back to you.

1284
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:27,126
If you agree it to be a true statement,
you shall then sign it. Is that clear?

1285
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:30,042
Yes.

1286
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:33,917
So if I can begin by asking you how long
you've been helping girls out?

1287
01:26:36,626 --> 01:26:38,709
A long time.

1288
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:40,584
Can you be specific?

1289
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,751
Exactly how long?

1290
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:45,209
Um...

1291
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,959
You previously stated to the inspector

1292
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,126
"about 20 years".

1293
01:26:51,209 --> 01:26:52,709
Oh, did I?

1294
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:55,126
So if I put...

1295
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:58,626
"I have been...

1296
01:26:58,709 --> 01:27:00,626
helping girls out...

1297
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:04,584
for 20 years."

1298
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,251
- "For about 20 years."
- Yes, sir.

1299
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:12,417
What's wrong with climbing a wall?

1300
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,959
Well, it depends what's on
the other side of it, sir. Sarge.

1301
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,584
You are charged that you, Vera Rose Drake,

1302
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:46,417
on the 17th day of November, 1950,

1303
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:49,084
at 37 Flixton Street, North 1,

1304
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:51,084
with the intent to procure a miscarriage,

1305
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,584
did unlawfully and feloniously use
an instrument

1306
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,084
on Pamela Mary Barnes,

1307
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:58,042
contrary to Section 58

1308
01:27:58,126 --> 01:28:01,042
of the Offences Against
the Person Act, 1861.

1309
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:04,584
Do you wish to say anything
in answer to the charge?

1310
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:07,001
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

1311
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:08,751
but whatever you say
will be taken down in writing

1312
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:10,917
and may be given in evidence.

1313
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:17,542
No.

1314
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,251
Thank you, sergeant.

1315
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:20,959
Very good, sir.

1316
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:22,792
This way, Vera.

1317
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:34,584
- Mr Drake...
- What's going on? What's all this about?

1318
01:28:38,292 --> 01:28:41,084
Look, I'll tell you what,
could you bear with me for a minute?

1319
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,834
Have a seat.

1320
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:51,709
Sir.

1321
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:57,834
Mrs Drake, I've just
been talking to your husband.

1322
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:01,584
He doesn't know why you're here, does he?

1323
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:02,834
No.

1324
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:06,001
He's going to find out, you know.

1325
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:14,917
Why don't you tell him yourself?

1326
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:16,959
I can bring him through now.

1327
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:24,417
I think it's for the best, don't you?

1328
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,709
Yes, dear.

1329
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:31,292
Myself and the WPC will have to be
present, do you understand?

1330
01:29:37,251 --> 01:29:39,167
- When you're finished.
- Sir.

1331
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:49,376
That's it, Vera.

1332
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:56,876
I'm sorry.

1333
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:03,542
What... What you got to be sorry about?

1334
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,751
What is it, love?

1335
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:26,376
Look at the state of her,
she don't deserve this.

1336
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:31,709
You're going to have to tell him,
Mrs Drake.

1337
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:43,709
- I...
- What?

1338
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:38,584
Your wife has been charged.

1339
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:42,042
I'm afraid she's going
to have to spend the night

1340
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:44,709
- here in the police station.
- Oh! Oh...

1341
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:46,917
We will take good care of her, sir.

1342
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:49,917
She'll be appearing before
the magistrate in the morning.

1343
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:55,084
If you'd like to come with me, sir.

1344
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:58,084
Don't tell Ethel and Sid.

1345
01:31:59,251 --> 01:32:00,751
Promise me.

1346
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:33,251
- Where's Vera?
- Where's Mum?

1347
01:32:35,459 --> 01:32:36,626
Dad?

1348
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:39,876
They're going to keep her
in there overnight.

1349
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:41,626
What for? Dad, what's going on?

1350
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:43,709
Let your dad take his coat off.

1351
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:50,376
Let me have a word with your
Uncle Frank. It'll just be five minutes.

1352
01:32:50,459 --> 01:32:52,167
- Why can't you tell--
- Five minutes.

1353
01:32:52,251 --> 01:32:53,501
Come on.

1354
01:33:03,459 --> 01:33:06,417
- She's in serious trouble, Frank.
- Why, what's happened?

1355
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:11,334
What am I gonna do?

1356
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:13,001
What is it?

1357
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:17,292
- Tell me.
- I can't.

1358
01:33:22,959 --> 01:33:25,251
She's been helping young girls out.

1359
01:33:27,126 --> 01:33:28,709
How do you mean?

1360
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:33,167
What find themselves in the family way.

1361
01:33:36,542 --> 01:33:38,001
You mean...?

1362
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:45,501
- I don't believe it.
- She told me herself in front of the cops.

1363
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:59,376
She asked me not to tell the kids.

1364
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:01,376
What shall I do?

1365
01:34:01,459 --> 01:34:03,584
- You got to tell them the truth.
- I know.

1366
01:34:05,959 --> 01:34:09,334
- What's gonna happen to her?
- She's got to go to court in the morning.

1367
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:14,001
Copper give me the name of a... solicitor.

1368
01:34:15,001 --> 01:34:17,167
- Got to go around there first thing.
- I'll come with you.

1369
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:18,334
- Will you?
- Course, I will.

1370
01:34:18,417 --> 01:34:19,626
Thanks.

1371
01:34:29,959 --> 01:34:32,042
Joyce, get your coat.

1372
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:35,876
Thank God for that. Excuse me.

1373
01:34:35,959 --> 01:34:37,876
I'll see you tomorrow.

1374
01:34:37,959 --> 01:34:40,292
Ethel, where's my hat, please?

1375
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:44,417
It might be better if you
was to get off home, Reg.

1376
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:47,251
Yeah, course.

1377
01:34:47,334 --> 01:34:49,126
- Nice to meet you, Reg.
- Nice to meet you.

1378
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:51,292
- Cheerio, then.
- Cheerio.

1379
01:34:51,376 --> 01:34:52,626
Night.

1380
01:34:54,084 --> 01:34:56,126
You still got your hat and coat on, Dad.

1381
01:34:57,959 --> 01:34:59,709
- Pop round tomorrow.
- After work.

1382
01:34:59,792 --> 01:35:01,126
All right.

1383
01:35:04,376 --> 01:35:06,376
- Thanks for the do, Stan.
- You're welcome.

1384
01:35:06,459 --> 01:35:08,542
- Look after yourself, Reg.
- And you, mate.

1385
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:14,751
Here you are.

1386
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:21,876
Tea?

1387
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:24,001
How about a sandwich?

1388
01:35:25,459 --> 01:35:27,501
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

1389
01:35:28,459 --> 01:35:30,542
Well, goodnight then, Vera.

1390
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:34,209
Thanks, Arthur.

1391
01:35:43,459 --> 01:35:45,167
I don't believe it.

1392
01:35:46,626 --> 01:35:48,792
How could she do that?

1393
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,417
She was trying to help people out, Sid.

1394
01:35:52,459 --> 01:35:54,292
It's wrong though.

1395
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:58,792
Well, whatever she done, she's done it
out of the kindness of her heart.

1396
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:03,501
- She's let us down.
- No.

1397
01:36:25,959 --> 01:36:27,376
Mrs Drake.

1398
01:36:27,459 --> 01:36:29,376
- Yes?
- My name is Mr Lewis.

1399
01:36:29,459 --> 01:36:31,376
I'm your solicitor.

1400
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:33,876
Stanley came to me this morning
to ask me to represent you.

1401
01:36:33,959 --> 01:36:36,834
- Oh.
- He's waiting outside with Frank.

1402
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:40,334
- Is Frank here?
- Yes, they're taking care of each other.

1403
01:36:40,417 --> 01:36:42,376
Now, I have a number of questions

1404
01:36:42,459 --> 01:36:44,834
I need to ask you, but I would imagine

1405
01:36:44,917 --> 01:36:47,834
that you have a thousand and one
questions that you'd like to ask me.

1406
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:50,376
So why don't you go first. Hmm?

1407
01:37:03,459 --> 01:37:06,084
This is case number five on the list,
Your Worship.

1408
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:08,001
Vera Rose Drake.

1409
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:11,376
Good morning, Your Worship.

1410
01:37:11,459 --> 01:37:14,751
It is my privilege to appear
for Mrs Drake this morning.

1411
01:37:14,834 --> 01:37:17,292
It is my intention
to make an application for bail,

1412
01:37:17,376 --> 01:37:19,501
subject to Your Worship's
views in this matter.

1413
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,167
I understand from the inspector,

1414
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:24,626
the police will raise
no objections to this application.

1415
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:27,292
Thank you, Mr Lewis.

1416
01:37:27,376 --> 01:37:30,251
Are you Vera Rose Drake?

1417
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,376
Yes.

1418
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:34,209
What is your address?

1419
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:39,417
- 82...
- Would you speak up?

1420
01:37:40,917 --> 01:37:44,376
82, Essex Buildings...

1421
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:47,792
Oslow Street,

1422
01:37:48,584 --> 01:37:50,501
North 1.

1423
01:37:50,584 --> 01:37:54,876
You are charged for that you,
on the 17th day of November, 1950

1424
01:37:54,959 --> 01:37:57,334
at 37 Flixton Street, North 1,

1425
01:37:57,417 --> 01:38:00,084
did unlawfully and feloniously

1426
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:03,376
use an instrument on Pamela Mary Barnes,

1427
01:38:03,459 --> 01:38:07,584
contrary to Section 58 of the Offences
Against the Person Act, 1861.

1428
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:09,001
Sit down, Mrs Drake.

1429
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:11,542
Inspector?

1430
01:38:12,417 --> 01:38:16,376
Detective Inspector Earnest Webster,
G-Division, Metropolitan Police.

1431
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:18,251
I swear by almighty God

1432
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:20,167
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth,

1433
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,251
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

1434
01:38:24,959 --> 01:38:28,376
As a result of a telephone call
from Ward Sister Coombes,

1435
01:38:28,459 --> 01:38:31,334
Detective Sergeant Vickers,
WPC Best and myself

1436
01:38:31,417 --> 01:38:34,751
went to the North London
General Hospital at 9:00pm...

1437
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:40,001
"I know why you are here.

1438
01:38:40,084 --> 01:38:42,292
I help young girls who are in trouble.

1439
01:38:42,376 --> 01:38:44,167
I help them to start their bleeding."

1440
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,542
I said, "You mean you perform abortions?"

1441
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:49,376
She said, "That's not what I call it.
I just help them."

1442
01:38:49,459 --> 01:38:53,167
She admitted performing an illegal
operation on Pamela Barnes

1443
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:56,251
and on hearing of the girl's critical
condition, became distressed.

1444
01:38:56,334 --> 01:38:58,376
I arrested and cautioned her

1445
01:38:58,459 --> 01:39:01,376
and at my request she produced
the equipment used in the operation,

1446
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:04,667
which included a Higginson's
syringe and a cheese grater.

1447
01:39:04,751 --> 01:39:07,334
Mrs Drake accompanied us
to the police station,

1448
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:10,376
where she made a voluntary
statement under caution.

1449
01:39:10,459 --> 01:39:12,751
Mrs Drake was cooperative throughout

1450
01:39:12,834 --> 01:39:15,584
and is not previously known to the police.

1451
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:18,167
We will not be opposing bail
for this defendant.

1452
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:19,751
Mr Lewis.

1453
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:21,959
Thank you, sir.

1454
01:39:22,042 --> 01:39:26,209
My application for bail
is based on the grounds

1455
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:28,126
that Mrs Drake is gainfully employed

1456
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:31,209
as a domestic in several households.

1457
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:35,376
Um, she has a permanent residence
and is married with two children,

1458
01:39:35,459 --> 01:39:37,376
in addition to which,
there is an aged mother,

1459
01:39:37,459 --> 01:39:40,376
all of whom rely upon her
for domestic duties.

1460
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:44,292
I understand that she has cooperated fully
throughout the police investigations

1461
01:39:44,376 --> 01:39:49,501
and has not received, nor sought
to receive any remuneration

1462
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:51,376
for performing this operation.

1463
01:39:51,459 --> 01:39:54,876
She has no previous convictions.

1464
01:39:54,959 --> 01:39:58,584
Um, however, she is unable
to provide a surety.

1465
01:40:10,959 --> 01:40:12,792
Yes, I shall grant bail.

1466
01:40:12,876 --> 01:40:15,001
Much obliged, Your Worship.

1467
01:40:15,084 --> 01:40:17,376
Stand up, Mrs Drake.

1468
01:40:21,626 --> 01:40:24,501
I shall admit you to bail
in your own recognisances

1469
01:40:24,584 --> 01:40:28,876
in the sum of fifty pounds
to appear in this court

1470
01:40:28,959 --> 01:40:31,126
three weeks from today...

1471
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:34,709
On December the 18th, sir.

1472
01:40:35,501 --> 01:40:37,167
That is at 10:00am

1473
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:38,834
on the 18th of December.

1474
01:40:40,042 --> 01:40:41,959
Thank you, inspector.

1475
01:41:02,959 --> 01:41:05,001
I don't think I can go to prison, Stan.

1476
01:41:15,709 --> 01:41:17,709
I'd better be getting off.

1477
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:19,876
Gonna do a bit of work?

1478
01:41:19,959 --> 01:41:21,959
I think I should.

1479
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:33,501
Let's get your coat off.

1480
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:54,417
Sid?

1481
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:03,626
Hello, Sid.

1482
01:42:15,834 --> 01:42:17,334
Didn't think you'd be here.

1483
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:21,501
Come in and sit down, Sid.

1484
01:42:22,959 --> 01:42:25,001
I'm gonna go to me room.

1485
01:42:41,834 --> 01:42:43,792
I've known her since I was six.

1486
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:47,167
She's been like a mum...
She was me mum.

1487
01:42:49,459 --> 01:42:51,251
The two of them...

1488
01:42:52,334 --> 01:42:55,209
- paid for me apprenticeship.
- Yes, I know all that, Frank.

1489
01:42:57,459 --> 01:42:59,126
All their savings.

1490
01:43:03,751 --> 01:43:06,876
When I left on me own,
I spent all me time round there.

1491
01:43:09,251 --> 01:43:11,876
She taught me how to waltz
in the front room.

1492
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:15,376
She always made us laugh.

1493
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:18,042
Stupid cow.

1494
01:43:18,126 --> 01:43:20,334
How can she be so selfish?

1495
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,667
So now you both know what we know.

1496
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:38,626
I wish I didn't know any of it, Dad.

1497
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:40,542
Well, we all wish that, Sid.

1498
01:43:42,459 --> 01:43:44,042
I'm ever so sorry.

1499
01:43:54,959 --> 01:43:57,709
How could you do those things, Mum?

1500
01:43:59,417 --> 01:44:01,042
I don't understand it.

1501
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:04,584
I don't expect you do, Sid.

1502
01:44:04,667 --> 01:44:06,167
Why'd you do it?

1503
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,917
I had to.

1504
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:13,334
It's wrong though, ain't it? Eh?

1505
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:16,751
- I don't think so.
- Well, course it is!

1506
01:44:19,626 --> 01:44:21,334
It's little babies.

1507
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:26,334
I mean, you hear about these things,

1508
01:44:26,417 --> 01:44:28,876
you read about it in the papers,
but you don't expect to come home to it

1509
01:44:28,959 --> 01:44:31,834
on your own doorstep with your own mum!

1510
01:44:33,459 --> 01:44:35,376
- You ain't got no right!
- That's enough, Sid.

1511
01:44:35,459 --> 01:44:36,792
Oh, what?

1512
01:44:37,709 --> 01:44:41,167
So what are we supposed to do then, eh?
Sit round, playing happy families,

1513
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:43,417
- pretending like nothing's happened?
- I said that's enough!

1514
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:44,626
- You lied to us!
- No, she never.

1515
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:46,667
- She did!
- She never told us, but she never lied.

1516
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:49,542
- It's the same thing!
- No, it ain't!

1517
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:04,542
It's dirty.

1518
01:45:13,959 --> 01:45:16,001
- All right?
- Come on in.

1519
01:45:27,626 --> 01:45:29,501
It don't seem fair.

1520
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:34,251
Look at my old mum.

1521
01:45:34,334 --> 01:45:36,959
Six of us in two rooms.

1522
01:45:38,459 --> 01:45:40,501
It's all right if you're rich.

1523
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:44,251
But if you can't feed 'em,

1524
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:46,459
you can't love 'em, can you?

1525
01:45:55,459 --> 01:45:57,334
- Poor Sid.
- I know.

1526
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:00,334
Everything's black and white for Sid.

1527
01:46:00,417 --> 01:46:02,334
He's young.

1528
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:04,001
I can't blame him.

1529
01:46:04,084 --> 01:46:05,667
He'll come round.

1530
01:46:06,417 --> 01:46:09,042
- I don't know, Stan!
- Here, come here.

1531
01:46:13,959 --> 01:46:15,876
I don't think I can tell mother.

1532
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,001
She don't need to know.

1533
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:20,792
That's it. It's all right.

1534
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:30,376
It's all gonna come out, Sid.
Everyone will know.

1535
01:46:30,459 --> 01:46:32,376
Some people won't be able
to look us in the eye,

1536
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:34,834
- cross the road to avoid us.
- Can you blame 'em?

1537
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:36,917
You wanna be one of them people?

1538
01:46:38,334 --> 01:46:41,334
Can't look your own mother in the eye? Eh?

1539
01:46:43,209 --> 01:46:45,376
You know when you went off into war,

1540
01:46:45,459 --> 01:46:48,542
you turned round to me, you said,
"Sid, you're the man of the house now,

1541
01:46:48,626 --> 01:46:51,001
you've got to look after things."
And I did.

1542
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:54,292
I was only 13.

1543
01:46:54,376 --> 01:46:56,667
Me and Mum, we pulled together, and Ethel.

1544
01:46:58,959 --> 01:47:01,042
- She must've been doing it then.
- I know.

1545
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:04,334
So how many has she done
over the years then, eh?

1546
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:06,501
Dozens? Hundreds?

1547
01:47:07,751 --> 01:47:09,876
And all right, fair enough,

1548
01:47:09,959 --> 01:47:12,542
she's kept it from me and Ethel,
but she didn't even tell you.

1549
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:14,376
If she'd told me, I'd have put
a stop to it, wouldn't I?

1550
01:47:14,459 --> 01:47:15,876
I don't get it, ain't you angry?

1551
01:47:15,959 --> 01:47:18,167
Of course I'm bloody angry,
you silly bugger.

1552
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:26,001
- You're asking me to forgive her.
- Yes.

1553
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:32,167
You can forgive her, Sid.
She's your mother.

1554
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:38,084
She'd forgive you anything,
wouldn't she?

1555
01:47:41,959 --> 01:47:44,167
I know you think she done a bad thing.

1556
01:47:47,959 --> 01:47:51,292
But God knows, she's going to get
punished enough for what she done.

1557
01:47:53,459 --> 01:47:55,167
We can't let her down.

1558
01:48:00,417 --> 01:48:02,501
I don't know what to say to you, Mum.

1559
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:06,209
You don't have to say nothing, Sid.

1560
01:48:07,584 --> 01:48:09,709
I'm scared for you, that's all.

1561
01:48:11,459 --> 01:48:13,876
You'll have to look after your dad.

1562
01:48:13,959 --> 01:48:15,792
Course I will.

1563
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:30,251
I love you, Mum.

1564
01:48:41,459 --> 01:48:42,959
Stand up.

1565
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:47,751
Vera Rose Drake.

1566
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:52,376
I commit you for trial
at the Central Criminal Court

1567
01:48:52,459 --> 01:48:56,834
of the next session commencing
the 10th of January, 1951.

1568
01:48:58,626 --> 01:49:00,876
I shall admit you to bail
in your own recognisances

1569
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:03,876
in the sum of fifty pounds

1570
01:49:03,959 --> 01:49:06,876
and I shall grant a defence certificate.

1571
01:49:06,959 --> 01:49:08,959
Much obliged, Your Worship.

1572
01:49:16,959 --> 01:49:19,376
I don't want to see that woman, Frank.

1573
01:49:19,459 --> 01:49:21,959
- I can't be near her.
- It's Christmas.

1574
01:49:22,042 --> 01:49:25,584
I won't sit round the dinner table
with her, eating food.

1575
01:49:25,667 --> 01:49:27,709
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.
- He's me brother.

1576
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:30,126
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- I don't know.

1577
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:34,876
We ain't never going
to have a Christmas by ourselves!

1578
01:49:35,584 --> 01:49:37,626
Just you and me.

1579
01:49:47,917 --> 01:49:49,667
All right, I'll go.

1580
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:51,834
For you.

1581
01:49:53,459 --> 01:49:55,126
I ain't staying though.

1582
01:49:56,417 --> 01:49:58,501
We'll have a quick drink
and then we'll leave.

1583
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,667
All right?

1584
01:50:07,792 --> 01:50:11,709
Now I have received a reply from
three of Mrs Drake's four employers.

1585
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:14,084
Mrs Wells has not even had the decency

1586
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:16,667
to respond to my second letter,
I'm afraid to say,

1587
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:19,542
and whilst they all speak
very highly of Mrs Drake,

1588
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:22,209
I'm afraid that none of them,
under the circumstances,

1589
01:50:22,292 --> 01:50:25,001
feel able to appear as a character
witness on your behalf.

1590
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:30,584
A, Miss, uh, Miss Kitchener does,
however, send her blessing.

1591
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,251
On a more positive note,

1592
01:50:33,334 --> 01:50:36,001
I have secured the services
of Mr Hampton Ward,

1593
01:50:36,084 --> 01:50:37,709
who is an excellent barrister,

1594
01:50:37,792 --> 01:50:39,876
and will present our case
in the best possible light.

1595
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:42,709
Now, the judge may see fit to
give us the minimum sentence,

1596
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:45,126
which could be as little as 18 months.

1597
01:50:46,459 --> 01:50:50,209
I'm afraid I'm unable to offer you
any more hope than that.

1598
01:50:51,792 --> 01:50:53,167
I'm sorry.

1599
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,751
- You been feeling all right, Joyce?
- Yes, thank you.

1600
01:51:26,792 --> 01:51:28,834
You gonna have one of your chocolates?

1601
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:32,542
Oh, yes.

1602
01:51:36,292 --> 01:51:38,209
I'll have one of these.

1603
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:40,501
Frank?

1604
01:51:43,792 --> 01:51:44,959
No.

1605
01:51:45,792 --> 01:51:47,167
Ethel?

1606
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:57,334
No, you're all right, mate.

1607
01:52:02,792 --> 01:52:05,376
This is the best Christmas
I've had in a long time.

1608
01:52:07,792 --> 01:52:09,876
Thank you very much, Vera.

1609
01:52:11,751 --> 01:52:13,084
Smashing.

1610
01:52:44,001 --> 01:52:46,334
Is your name Vera Rose Drake?

1611
01:52:48,792 --> 01:52:50,167
Yes.

1612
01:52:50,251 --> 01:52:51,917
Prisoner at the bar,

1613
01:52:52,001 --> 01:52:53,709
you are charged with using an instrument

1614
01:52:53,792 --> 01:52:55,917
with intent to procure miscarriage,

1615
01:52:56,001 --> 01:53:00,834
contrary to Section 58 of
the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.

1616
01:53:02,167 --> 01:53:03,917
The particulars of the offence,

1617
01:53:04,001 --> 01:53:07,167
are that on the 17th day of November 1950,

1618
01:53:07,251 --> 01:53:09,126
in the county of London,

1619
01:53:09,209 --> 01:53:11,001
you did unlawfully use an instrument

1620
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:13,584
with intent to procure
the miscarriage of a woman

1621
01:53:13,667 --> 01:53:15,751
named Pamela Mary Barnes.

1622
01:53:16,667 --> 01:53:18,167
How say you?

1623
01:53:18,251 --> 01:53:21,042
Are you guilty, or not guilty?

1624
01:53:23,209 --> 01:53:24,959
I'm guilty.

1625
01:53:26,209 --> 01:53:28,042
Could you please speak up, Mrs Drake,

1626
01:53:28,126 --> 01:53:30,334
that the court might hear you?

1627
01:53:31,959 --> 01:53:34,084
- I'm guilty.
- Thank you.

1628
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:36,251
Please be seated.

1629
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:47,626
The inspector then arrested the defendant

1630
01:53:47,709 --> 01:53:49,626
and cautioned her.

1631
01:53:49,709 --> 01:53:54,042
On being asked to surrender
the equipment used for the abortion,

1632
01:53:54,126 --> 01:53:58,126
the defendant produced nine objects

1633
01:53:58,209 --> 01:54:00,667
from the top of a cupboard in the bedroom.

1634
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:04,042
My Lord, they were
a Higginson's syringe.

1635
01:54:04,126 --> 01:54:07,584
That is exhibit EW-1.

1636
01:54:07,667 --> 01:54:10,584
A cheese grater. Exhibit EW-2.

1637
01:54:10,667 --> 01:54:12,584
A nail brush.

1638
01:54:12,667 --> 01:54:14,584
Exhibit EW-3.

1639
01:54:14,667 --> 01:54:16,501
A bottle of disinfectant.

1640
01:54:16,584 --> 01:54:18,626
Exhibit EW-4,

1641
01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:21,126
Wrapped in a towel. Exhibit EW-5.

1642
01:54:21,209 --> 01:54:24,334
A piece of carbolic soap
wrapped in a dishcloth.

1643
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:28,626
They are exhibits EW-6 and EW-7.

1644
01:54:29,834 --> 01:54:34,251
Those last two objects
were both enclosed in a tin.

1645
01:54:34,334 --> 01:54:36,792
Which is exhibit EW-8.

1646
01:54:37,709 --> 01:54:41,917
All the aforementioned items
were kept in a cloth bag,

1647
01:54:42,001 --> 01:54:44,084
which, as Your Lordship will see,

1648
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:46,584
is exhibit EW-9.

1649
01:54:49,209 --> 01:54:52,751
Vera Drake is not concerned with riches.

1650
01:54:52,834 --> 01:54:55,292
She simply helps people,

1651
01:54:55,376 --> 01:54:58,751
as and when she's asked.
She's always helped people.

1652
01:54:58,834 --> 01:55:03,167
Her solicitude for others
has led her to commit

1653
01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:07,626
one of the most serious offences
in the calendar,

1654
01:55:07,709 --> 01:55:11,501
but her intention
was to help the young girl

1655
01:55:11,584 --> 01:55:13,251
and not to harm her.

1656
01:55:13,334 --> 01:55:16,042
Um, I may assure Your Lordship that

1657
01:55:16,126 --> 01:55:18,251
Vera Drake is more relieved than anyone

1658
01:55:18,334 --> 01:55:20,417
at the recovery of Pamela Barnes.

1659
01:55:21,667 --> 01:55:24,834
And I submit that Your Lordship
would have little doubt that this...

1660
01:55:25,751 --> 01:55:29,459
uh, unfortunate woman is now ever likely

1661
01:55:29,542 --> 01:55:32,001
to reoffend.

1662
01:55:32,084 --> 01:55:34,626
And that is the case
for the defence, My Lord.

1663
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:37,626
Thank you, Mr Hampton Ward.

1664
01:55:41,042 --> 01:55:43,209
Prisoner at the bar, please rise.

1665
01:55:50,292 --> 01:55:53,209
Prisoner at the bar,
you stand convicted of felony.

1666
01:55:53,292 --> 01:55:54,959
Have you anything to say

1667
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:58,209
why the court should not give you
judgment according to law?

1668
01:55:59,917 --> 01:56:01,292
No.

1669
01:56:01,376 --> 01:56:03,584
Please remain standing.

1670
01:56:14,876 --> 01:56:16,792
Vera Rose Drake,

1671
01:56:16,876 --> 01:56:21,667
you have committed a crime, the gravity
of which cannot be overestimated.

1672
01:56:22,584 --> 01:56:24,834
The law is very clear

1673
01:56:24,917 --> 01:56:27,584
and you have wilfully broken that law.

1674
01:56:29,417 --> 01:56:31,334
And furthermore,

1675
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,834
in so doing,

1676
01:56:32,917 --> 01:56:34,209
you have put at risk

1677
01:56:34,292 --> 01:56:36,751
the life of a vulnerable young woman.

1678
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:39,334
And but for the timely intervention

1679
01:56:39,417 --> 01:56:41,626
of the medical profession,

1680
01:56:41,709 --> 01:56:44,584
you might have been before me
on an even more serious charge

1681
01:56:45,834 --> 01:56:48,084
than the one that has
brought you here today.

1682
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:50,792
Now...

1683
01:56:50,876 --> 01:56:53,501
I have heard your plea of guilty,

1684
01:56:53,584 --> 01:56:55,709
and I have taken that into account...

1685
01:56:56,417 --> 01:57:00,084
and I have listened very carefully
to the submissions of your council.

1686
01:57:00,917 --> 01:57:04,209
But nothing has been advanced me today
on your behalf

1687
01:57:04,292 --> 01:57:07,792
which would persuade me
to take any course

1688
01:57:07,876 --> 01:57:10,876
other than to impose a custodial sentence.

1689
01:57:10,959 --> 01:57:12,292
Indeed...

1690
01:57:13,667 --> 01:57:16,751
the extreme seriousness of your crime

1691
01:57:16,834 --> 01:57:18,751
is bound to be reflected

1692
01:57:18,834 --> 01:57:21,917
in the sentence that I am about to pass.

1693
01:57:22,001 --> 01:57:25,251
And that must serve
as a deterrent to others.

1694
01:57:26,876 --> 01:57:28,417
I therefore sentence you

1695
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:31,001
to a term of imprisonment...

1696
01:57:31,876 --> 01:57:34,876
which will be two years and six months.

1697
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:38,334
Take her down.

1698
01:57:51,584 --> 01:57:53,042
All rise.

1699
01:58:22,792 --> 01:58:25,292
She won't be able to come round
and see you.

1700
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:28,167
Not for a while.

1701
01:58:29,751 --> 01:58:31,251
Why not?

1702
01:58:32,501 --> 01:58:34,376
Ethel will come over.

1703
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:43,584
- She ain't dead, is she?
- No.

1704
01:58:44,876 --> 01:58:46,834
No, she ain't dead.

1705
01:58:55,959 --> 01:58:57,584
How long did you say you got?

1706
01:58:57,667 --> 01:58:59,917
Two years and six months.

1707
01:59:00,001 --> 01:59:01,917
First offence?

1708
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:03,501
Oh, yes.

1709
01:59:03,584 --> 01:59:06,459
- Did she die?
- No, dear.

1710
01:59:06,542 --> 01:59:08,834
I don't know what I'd
have done if she had.

1711
01:59:08,917 --> 01:59:10,709
My girl died.

1712
01:59:10,792 --> 01:59:12,709
- Did she?
- So did mine.

1713
01:59:14,417 --> 01:59:16,167
Oh, dear.

1714
01:59:16,251 --> 01:59:18,001
What'd you use?

1715
01:59:20,626 --> 01:59:23,501
- A syringe.
- There you are.

1716
01:59:23,584 --> 01:59:26,751
Hundreds of times, safe as houses.

1717
01:59:26,834 --> 01:59:28,334
Yes, I don't know what happened.

1718
01:59:28,417 --> 01:59:30,584
We just do our best, love.

1719
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:35,584
- How long you in here for then?
- Three years.

1720
01:59:35,667 --> 01:59:38,376
- Four.
- Second time for us.

1721
01:59:39,501 --> 01:59:40,834
Oh.

1722
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:45,334
- Cheer up. You'll only do half.
- You'll be out before you know it.

1723
01:59:45,417 --> 01:59:46,667
Yes.

1724
01:59:50,001 --> 01:59:52,084
See you later, then.

1725
02:00:01,292 --> 02:00:03,376
Mind where you're going, Drake.
