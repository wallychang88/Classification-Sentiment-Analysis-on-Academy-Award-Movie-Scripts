1
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,840
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,120
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,200
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,000
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,840
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,760
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,240
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,120
Sorry.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Just this way.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,480
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,720
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,680
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,080
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,480
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,480
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
And you want to live in London?

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,520
Very much. Very much.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,840
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,240
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,240
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,800
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,040
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,520
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,840
All that stuff.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,400
So it's all good.

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,000
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,640
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,520
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,720
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,640
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,200
Very good.

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,360
Chris Wilton.

46
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,200
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,800
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,400
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,680
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
OK.

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,200
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,160
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
For a while.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,520
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,920
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,280
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,160
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,800
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,560
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,760
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,880
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,200
I love opera.

72
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,400
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,760
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
To the opera?

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,920
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,040
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,640
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,880
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
So?

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,920
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,920
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,040
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,680
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,800
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,200
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,840
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,480
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,200
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,240
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,280
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,680
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,840
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,080
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Lt'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,480
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,360
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

109
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,400
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,320
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
OK.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,280
Was I dreadful?

114
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,240
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,040
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,960
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,600
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,920
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,720
I love it.

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,600
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,880
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,400
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
That'd be great.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,760
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,400
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,520
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,480
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,720
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,960
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
I can do that.

144
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,520
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,360
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,320
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,360
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,680
You?

150
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
What did I walk into?

153
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,640
What did I walk into?

154
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
It's like this.

155
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,760
- May I?
- Please.

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,000
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,840
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,080
The story of my life.

159
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
So, tell me,

160
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,440
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,760
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,920
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,480
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,400
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,960
There you are.

168
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,080
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

169
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,200
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancée.

170
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,480
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,520
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,960
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,400
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,480
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,680
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,880
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,360
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,520
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,280
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,640
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
To be honest with you,

186
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,080
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,440
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Especially an American one.

189
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,560
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,320
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,400
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,400
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,880
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,280
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Do you need money?

199
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
God, no.

200
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,280
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,600
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,880
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,560
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,400
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,360
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,680
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,200
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,560
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,600
Can't we do something for him?

214
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,000
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,360
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,080
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,400
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,520
Chloe, be careful.

219
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,520
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,520
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,440
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,680
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,400
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,080
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,040
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,040
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,320
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,960
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,440
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,320
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,080
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,040
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thanks.

237
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,640
What do you think?

238
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,440
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,760
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,560
I think it is.

244
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,720
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,920
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,080
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,640
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,760
To?

251
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,800
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

252
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,800
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,920
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,200
Of course.

255
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,440
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,640
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,280
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,520
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,960
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,680
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,200
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,160
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,040
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,720
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,240
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,680
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,080
Hello.

271
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,560
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,360
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

273
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,280
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,560
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,200
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

277
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,400
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,360
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,640
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,240
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,280
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,080
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,320
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,640
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,840
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,880
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,080
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,640
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,440
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,440
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,040
"So-so."

299
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,080
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,040
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,840
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,880
He was kind of austere.

303
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,080
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Oh, Christ.

305
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,160
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,640
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,000
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,760
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,680
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,360
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,720
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,280
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,040
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,720
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,920
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,760
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,080
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,360
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,280
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,280
No purpose, no design.

325
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,000
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,960
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,240
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,600
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,680
Can we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,040
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,760
No, I was...

335
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,440
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,960
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,680
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

338
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,040
Ever.

339
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,640
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,120
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

342
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,800
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

343
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

344
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,680
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

345
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

346
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,680
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

347
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,920
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

348
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,960
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

350
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,520
Now, if you're OK with the package,

351
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,760
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

352
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

353
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,760
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

354
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,800
And Rod.

355
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

356
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,520
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

357
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

358
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,360
It's such good news.

359
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

360
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,600
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,160
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

362
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,040
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

363
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

364
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,800
It has some beautiful arias on it.

365
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
And his voice expresses

366
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,000
everything that's tragic about life.

367
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,760
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

368
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,520
I love it.

369
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,760
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

370
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,320
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

371
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,960
Puligny-Montrachet.

372
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,360
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

373
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,760
Now I'm addicted.

374
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,560
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

375
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
but I told them we're busy.

376
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
But we have no plans.

377
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,080
Well, no special plans.

378
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I thought we said we'd stay in?

379
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

380
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,320
We could've joined them.

381
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,840
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

382
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,280
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

383
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,360
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

384
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,720
Well, shall I call them?

385
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,440
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

386
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Well...

387
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,760
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

388
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,320
The wine, the opera.

389
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
Absolutely.

390
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,760
I just figured...

391
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,400
We can stay in any... any night, and...

392
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,480
...they're free and suggested a film.

393
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
What's the film?

394
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,600
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

395
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,560
I am in the mood for a film.

396
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Thank you so much, fella.

397
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,960
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

398
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,200
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

399
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

400
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,280
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

401
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,320
Where is she?

402
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,880
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

403
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,040
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

404
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,880
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

406
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,440
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

407
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,280
Everybody likes you at work.

408
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,920
Papa says he's heard great things.

409
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,680
You're a very clever boy.

410
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,000
Hey!

411
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
Hey.

412
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,400
- Hi.
- How are you?

413
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,120
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

414
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,000
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

415
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
It's vicuña.

416
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,000
- Vicuña.
- Vicuña?

417
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,320
- Yeah.
- Right.

418
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,440
Where are you going?

419
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,200
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

420
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
- Why?
- So...

421
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,800
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

422
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,440
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

423
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,160
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

424
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,680
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

425
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

426
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,560
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

427
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,680
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

428
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,360
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

429
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,520
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

430
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

431
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,600
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

432
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
Have you ever tried yoga?

433
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,720
- No.
- No?

434
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,960
Hi.

435
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,000
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

436
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,880
- How was it?
- Blew that.

437
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

438
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,840
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

439
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,160
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

440
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,560
Yeah.

441
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,800
You know what,

442
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,760
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

443
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,280
...a little bit.
- Sure.

444
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,320
- OK.
- This way.

445
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,680
What was I saying?

446
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,560
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

447
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,320
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

448
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
You should see my sister, she's...

449
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,960
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

450
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

451
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,440
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

452
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,280
My sister...

453
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,120
...is classically beautiful.

454
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,240
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

455
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,200
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

456
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,880
It's just a joke.

457
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,480
What did your father do?

458
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,280
He... left.

459
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,920
And never sent any money.

460
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,360
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

461
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,160
- No?
- No.

462
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,600
Her problem was that she drank.

463
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
How did you meet Tom?

464
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,080
We met at a party.

465
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,360
He...

466
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,160
...saw me across the room

467
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,480
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

468
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
And I...

469
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,880
I liked him right off, you know.

470
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,760
I thought...

471
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,760
Well, I think he's very handsome.

472
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,080
Don't you?

473
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Very.

474
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,320
And he asked you to marry him?

475
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,600
Well, he...

476
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,480
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

477
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,480
What did I know
about that kind of life?

478
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

479
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
But...

480
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,720
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

481
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,560
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

482
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,040
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

483
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,080
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

484
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,600
It's such an inbred family. It's...

485
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,040
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

486
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,000
I thought he was very handsome.

487
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,040
You know, and I told you I was just...

488
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,560
I was overwhelmed with attention.

489
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,840
So, what about you and Chloe?

490
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
She's very sweet.

491
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
She is very sweet.

492
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,200
And she wants to marry you.

493
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,880
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

494
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,160
No. No, it's different.

495
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,680
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

496
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
...are being groomed.

497
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,480
You mark my words.

498
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,920
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

499
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,640
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

500
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,200
But...

501
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

502
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,560
And how am I going to blow it?

503
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,560
By making a pass at me.

504
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,120
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

505
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,720
Men always seem to wonder.

506
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,840
They think I'd be
something very special.

507
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,880
And are you?

508
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,880
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

509
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,400
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

510
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,200
I've had too much to drink.

511
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,680
Can you get me a cab?

512
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Sure.

513
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you.

514
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,080
You were driving a bit fast,

515
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,640
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

516
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,600
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

517
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,640
Oh, hi.

518
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

519
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,040
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

520
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,520
Oh, he's so sweet.

521
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,520
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

522
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,560
It should have dissipated fully already.

523
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,880
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

524
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,520
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

525
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,480
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

526
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,280
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

527
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,200
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

528
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
You're so beautiful.

529
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,600
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

530
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
that the company would pay for?

531
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,600
I don't know.

532
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,360
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

533
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,520
And the beginning of next year

534
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,520
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

535
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,520
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

536
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Plus, there are a number of perks...

537
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,520
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

538
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,120
We had been focusing on someone else...

539
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

540
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,000
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

541
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,640
I'd hate to disappoint you.

542
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,440
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

543
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,480
We're nearly ready.

544
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

545
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,920
Never mind, fella.

546
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,600
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

547
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,560
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

548
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,080
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

549
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,120
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

550
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,360
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

551
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
Come on, Chloe.

552
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
Hi, darling.

553
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,920
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

554
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,320
No.

555
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
How did your audition go?

556
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,520
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

557
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,440
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

558
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

559
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,880
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

560
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,200
So, how long do you keep it up?

561
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,080
How long?

562
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,440
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

563
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,040
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

564
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,800
To try something else?

565
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,520
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

566
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm not saying that.

567
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,360
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

568
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,160
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

569
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,360
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

570
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,680
Well, I do ask myself that.

571
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,880
See? It's only logical, Tom.

572
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,240
Especially for a woman.

573
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,160
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

574
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,960
and as you get older and time passes,

575
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

576
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

577
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm not saying now.

578
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,560
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

579
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,640
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

580
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

581
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,440
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

582
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

583
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,560
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

584
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,000
...innuendos.

585
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,720
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

586
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,840
Those that have it, know it right off.

587
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,440
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

588
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,360
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

589
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

590
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,360
Excuse me.

591
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Nola.

592
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,280
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

593
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

594
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,560
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

595
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,160
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

596
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
I was looking for you.

597
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,640
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

598
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,680
I don't mean to intrude.

599
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,840
I need a drink.

600
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,680
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

601
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,720
- Do I?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,160
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

603
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,840
You shouldn't have followed me here.

604
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Do you feel guilty?

605
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Do you?

606
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
We can't do this.

607
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,840
I know.

608
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
This can't lead anyplace.

609
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Hello.

610
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,960
Darling, I think it's for you.

611
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,840
But take it outside.

612
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,480
Well, there's hope, at least.

613
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,720
When's the callback?

614
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

615
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,240
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

616
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,120
Yeah. OK.

617
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,280
Bye.

618
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Why have you been so cold to me?

619
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,840
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

620
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,080
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

621
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,560
you've been distant, evasive.

622
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,760
I don't want to encourage anything.

623
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,160
What happened, happened, Chris.

624
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,200
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

625
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,960
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

626
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,760
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

627
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,880
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

628
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,240
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

629
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,960
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

630
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,840
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

631
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,200
We had our moment.

632
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,760
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

633
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,080
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

634
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,120
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

635
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,440
Chris, forget it. It's over.

636
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,080
Thanks. Henry!

637
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,800
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

638
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,400
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

639
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,760
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

640
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,560
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

641
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,360
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

642
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,800
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

643
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,480
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

644
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,280
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

645
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,080
I just couldn't stand it.

646
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
No. No, I heard you went into business.

647
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,760
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

648
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,280
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

649
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,880
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

650
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,560
Family's got nothing but money.

651
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,800
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

652
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,960
Hey, look, I understand.

653
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,720
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

654
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,320
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

655
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,880
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

656
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
I always admired
your game though, you know?

657
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,360
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

658
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,040
Cool under pressure, but creative.

659
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,280
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

660
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,760
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

661
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,640
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

662
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

663
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,080
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

664
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,440
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

665
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,200
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

666
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,960
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

667
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,040
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

668
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,440
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

669
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,680
So good to see you, Henry.

670
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,120
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

671
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,560
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

672
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,680
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

673
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,840
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

674
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,760
- All right.
- Bye.

675
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,200
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

676
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,520
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

677
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

678
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,200
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

679
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

680
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,600
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

681
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,720
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

682
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,760
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

683
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Stop it.

684
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,960
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

685
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,800
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

686
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,120
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

687
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,600
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

688
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,960
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

689
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,080
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

690
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,400
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

691
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,880
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

692
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,040
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

693
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,440
I appreciate that.

694
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,080
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

695
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,800
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

696
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

697
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

698
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,480
It was all her fault, you know.

699
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,320
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

700
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

701
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,880
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

702
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,000
All men who see you want to attack you.

703
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,280
Isn't that right, Christopher?

704
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,920
Oh, God, are you all right?

705
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,320
I'm fine.

706
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,760
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

707
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,720
I now pronounce you man and wife.

708
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,840
You may kiss the bride.

709
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Oh, my God.

710
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,120
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

711
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

712
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,200
There's another bedroom through there.

713
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,240
The bathroom and a kitchen.

714
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,360
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

715
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,480
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

716
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,200
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

717
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

718
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,080
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

719
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,320
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

720
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

721
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,600
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

722
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,680
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

723
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
I want you to make me pregnant.

724
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,160
Chloe... We discussed this.

725
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,120
It's very quick.

726
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,280
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

727
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,000
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

728
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,120
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

729
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,560
Hey! Where are you?

730
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

731
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,640
Not good.

732
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

733
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,800
What?

734
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,280
Well, Nola and I...

735
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,160
...broke up.

736
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,400
- No!
- Yeah.

737
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,760
Or, I should say, I called it off.

738
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,440
I thought you were gonna get married.

739
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,680
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

740
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,320
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

741
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,520
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

742
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,240
who's her main candidate.

743
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,160
God, no.

744
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,080
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

745
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,560
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

746
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,040
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

747
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
...l've met someone else.

748
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,160
- No!
- Yeah.

749
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,440
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

750
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,880
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

751
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,240
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

752
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,280
You know what I mean.

753
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,760
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,080
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,480
Excuse me.

756
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,000
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

757
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,840
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

758
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,400
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

759
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,240
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

760
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,120
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

761
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Just business.

762
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,080
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

763
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,640
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

764
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,840
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

765
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,960
OK, I can take a hint.

766
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,640
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

767
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,120
Look...

768
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,520
...it'll happen.

769
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,040
I'm just really tired.

770
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,480
Kiss.

771
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,960
Sweet dreams.

772
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,200
I now pronounce you man and wife.

773
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,400
You may kiss the bride.

774
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,560
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

775
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:45,600
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

776
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,560
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,800
I know.

778
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,160
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

779
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,240
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

780
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,320
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

781
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,840
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

782
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,880
I want my own children.

783
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,760
This one?

784
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Sort of...

785
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,680
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

786
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,920
Really?

787
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,920
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

788
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,000
Her and her husband
just found each other.

789
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,040
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

790
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,120
and itjust works like a charm.

791
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,400
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

792
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,240
- God...
- I know, it's great.

793
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,320
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

794
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,960
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

795
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,120
If I have to work all night.

796
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
OK.

797
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,400
Thank you. Thanks.

798
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,160
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

799
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,280
Thanks.

800
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,840
Are you OK, sir?

801
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,720
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

802
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,480
No, not really.

803
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Oh, Christ!

804
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

805
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,200
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

806
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,560
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

807
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,160
Not before.

808
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,000
Good night.

809
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,240
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

810
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,120
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

811
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,680
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

812
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

813
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
Yeah?

814
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,920
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

815
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,880
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

816
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Why?

817
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,920
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

818
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,680
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

819
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm coming.

820
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,400
- OK.
- OK.

821
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,680
Hello.

822
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,920
What a surprise.

823
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,320
I...

824
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,160
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

825
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,920
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

826
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,600
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

827
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,920
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

828
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,160
I looked for you.

829
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,120
For what?

830
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
You're still so angry.

831
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,240
Where are you living?

832
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,600
In town. Why?

833
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,560
You live alone?

834
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,160
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

835
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,640
Can I meet you for a drink?

836
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,560
Talk?

837
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,000
Where can I reach you? Come on.

838
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,240
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

839
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,360
Look who I bumped into.

840
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

841
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,240
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

842
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,600
- You look great.
- Thanks.

843
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,360
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

844
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,560
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

845
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,240
Yeah. They've got a baby.

846
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,440
You know Tom, all settled down.

847
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,120
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

848
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,520
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

849
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,400
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

851
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,560
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

852
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,960
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

853
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,800
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

854
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,280
Say your phone number.

855
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,720
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

856
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,440
- Chris...
- Please.

857
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,600
Say your phone number.

858
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,800
02079460996.

859
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,760
I'll call you.

860
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Bye.

861
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

862
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,600
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

863
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,360
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

864
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,560
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

865
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
It's OK, John.

866
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,800
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

867
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,600
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

868
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,200
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

869
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,440
- OK.
- See you at home.

870
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,520
Bye.

871
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,120
You have a very charming flat.

872
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,000
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

873
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,880
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

874
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,720
I mean, it's not perfect.

875
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,760
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

876
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,920
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

877
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,800
...you know, the lobby's decent.

878
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,800
The key word is it's cheap.

879
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,720
What time is it?

880
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,920
Time for you to go.

881
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,480
It's so hard to leave you.

882
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Beautiful woman.

883
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,480
How'd you sleep?

884
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,000
Good.

885
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,840
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

886
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
about that earthquake in China?

887
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,520
Terrible.

888
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,600
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

889
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,600
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

890
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,080
Yeah.

891
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,840
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

892
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,280
Papa's getting so into the idea.

893
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,520
It should be good for you.

894
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,880
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

895
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,200
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

896
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,240
...before you went to work.

897
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,400
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

898
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,920
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

899
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,920
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

900
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,640
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

901
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,960
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

902
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,480
Let me come up.

903
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,440
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

904
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,880
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

905
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,400
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

906
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,960
Come on.

907
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,440
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

908
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,880
Hey, did you get that pest control?

909
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,120
Oh, yes. Yes.

910
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,640
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

911
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,160
It's much better than cheese,

912
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,560
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

913
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,040
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

914
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,600
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

915
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,880
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

916
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,920
Bye.

917
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,240
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

918
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,360
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

919
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,920
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

920
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,360
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

921
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,680
Yeah.

922
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,360
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

923
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,360
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

924
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,800
Heths didn't have a problem

925
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,800
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

926
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,840
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

927
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,080
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

928
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,320
- No.
- Yeah.

929
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,120
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

930
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,120
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

931
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,800
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

932
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,560
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

933
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,760
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

934
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,200
But she's just such an odd girl.

935
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,120
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

936
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But something's just...

937
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,760
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

938
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,360
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

939
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,600
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

940
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,440
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

941
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,640
but, I don't know...

942
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,000
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

943
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,160
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

944
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,280
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

945
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,600
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

946
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,520
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

947
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,440
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

948
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,600
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

949
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,040
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

950
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,080
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

951
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,240
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

952
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,640
I know Tom's dying to get away.

953
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,280
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

954
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,360
Me?

955
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,520
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

956
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,680
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

957
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,520
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

958
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,760
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

959
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,880
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

960
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,360
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

961
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,560
I'd have sworn it was you.

962
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,760
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

963
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,720
He's completely dependant on our driver.

964
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,040
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

965
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,880
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

966
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,120
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

967
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,720
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

968
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,000
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

969
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,440
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

970
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,880
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

971
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,080
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

972
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,120
Nuts.

973
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,840
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

974
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,760
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

975
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,040
Just the Sarazin people at two.

976
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,240
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

977
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,560
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

978
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,280
Chris. Where are you off to?

979
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,440
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

980
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,680
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

981
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,680
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

982
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,640
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

983
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,480
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

984
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,400
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

985
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,960
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

986
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,520
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

987
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,720
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

988
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,680
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

989
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,160
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

990
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,600
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

991
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,720
It's a hard field.

992
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,280
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

993
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,200
Tom's mother was right.
Itjust gets to a point, you know?

994
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,040
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

995
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,080
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

996
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,200
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

997
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Maybe I will.

998
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,400
Don't say that unless you mean it.

999
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,520
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

1000
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,640
I mean, it's... mechanical.

1001
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,040
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

1002
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,360
Really. I mean it.

1003
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,880
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

1004
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,640
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

1005
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,920
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

1006
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,840
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

1007
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,080
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

1008
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,600
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

1009
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,320
Hi.

1010
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,720
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

1011
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,320
I've been thinking about you.

1012
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,040
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

1013
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,960
OK. See you then.

1014
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,600
Bye-bye.

1015
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,160
There you are, Chris.

1016
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,600
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

1017
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,440
over the past few months.

1018
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,440
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

1019
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,320
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

1020
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,200
Well, who could have predicted these?

1021
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,560
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

1022
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,480
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

1023
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,080
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

1024
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,200
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

1025
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,360
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

1026
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,800
Yes.

1027
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,560
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

1028
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,600
- Boat.
- Boat.

1029
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,880
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

1030
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,320
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

1031
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,640
- What?
- No.

1032
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,240
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

1033
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,160
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

1034
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
Oh, that reminds me,

1035
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,760
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1036
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,840
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

1037
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,440
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1038
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,360
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

1039
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1040
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,000
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

1041
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
Oh, God.

1042
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,600
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

1043
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,640
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1044
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,560
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

1045
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,320
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

1046
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,320
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

1047
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,400
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

1048
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,440
Poor thing.

1049
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,120
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

1050
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

1051
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,960
I miss you.

1052
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,760
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

1053
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,320
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

1054
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,520
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

1055
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,680
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

1056
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,360
When can you get here?

1057
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,800
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

1058
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,200
Look...

1059
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,600
It's a three-day weekend.

1060
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,440
Tuesday.

1061
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Chris, I need to see you.

1062
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,840
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

1063
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,360
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1064
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,400
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

1065
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,040
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

1066
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,520
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

1067
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,560
Jack Garner?

1068
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,680
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

1069
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,040
The traffic'll be terrible.

1070
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,520
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

1071
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,560
I don't mean today.

1072
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,320
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

1073
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,720
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

1074
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,600
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

1075
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,200
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

1076
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,040
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

1077
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,120
That's mean.

1078
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,200
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

1079
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,760
I've some lovely new horses.

1080
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,440
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

1081
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,480
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

1082
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,640
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

1083
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,520
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

1084
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,200
- No.
- Yeah.

1085
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,800
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

1086
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,000
- Where from?
- Anyway...

1087
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,480
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

1088
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,360
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

1089
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,960
Excuse me.

1090
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,280
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

1091
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,040
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1092
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,160
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

1093
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,600
Hello?

1094
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,840
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

1095
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,280
Are you mad calling me here?

1096
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,520
When are you coming over?

1097
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1098
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,760
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

1099
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,680
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

1100
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,840
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1101
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,400
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

1102
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,560
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

1103
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,240
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

1104
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,840
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

1105
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,240
Well, they only had biscuits.

1106
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,680
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

1107
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,520
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

1108
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,720
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

1109
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,080
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

1110
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,400
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1111
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,640
It's no big deal.

1112
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,880
I'll pop back into town.

1113
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,960
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

1114
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,720
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

1115
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,400
Well, it is a pity because I...

1116
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,680
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

1117
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,120
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1118
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,320
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1119
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,040
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

1120
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,600
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1121
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

1122
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:13,840
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1123
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,520
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1124
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,400
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

1125
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,040
but you couldn't wait.

1126
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,840
What unbelievable bad luck.

1127
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,720
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

1128
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,600
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

1129
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,480
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

1130
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,560
Is that your interpretation?

1131
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,720
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

1132
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,360
not as part of some fertility project.

1133
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,360
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

1134
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,200
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

1135
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,800
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

1136
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,400
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

1137
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,280
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

1138
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,320
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

1139
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

1140
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,400
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

1141
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,440
Why? You hate yourjob,
you hate your life.

1142
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,200
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

1143
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,960
Look, Nola, I have to go.

1144
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,000
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

1145
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,640
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

1146
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,600
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

1147
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,920
Chris...

1148
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,120
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

1149
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,720
I'm not walking away from this.

1150
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,320
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1151
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,760
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

1152
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,880
Us.

1153
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,320
Is something wrong?

1154
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,560
Yeah. There is.

1155
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,040
What?

1156
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,160
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

1157
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,720
you know it's not a problem.

1158
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,920
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

1159
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,320
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

1160
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,920
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

1161
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,680
What is it?

1162
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,560
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

1163
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,920
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

1164
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,680
Are you having an affair?

1165
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,880
Am I having an affair?

1166
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,040
Yeah, that's what I asked.

1167
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,440
- No.
- You are.

1168
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,680
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

1169
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,000
Do you not love me anymore?

1170
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,400
Of course I love you.

1171
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,800
Well, what's wrong?

1172
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,240
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

1173
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,320
You're not. How?

1174
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,960
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

1175
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,280
I just...

1176
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,320
...feel so guilty.

1177
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,840
So terribly guilty.

1178
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,240
Listen, Chris.

1179
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,760
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

1180
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,280
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

1181
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,240
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

1182
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,960
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

1183
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,640
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1184
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,800
Oh, Chloe.

1185
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,000
Let's get off the subject.

1186
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,040
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

1187
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,880
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

1188
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
I had to talk to somebody.

1189
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,160
I'm really suffering.

1190
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,320
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1191
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,560
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

1192
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,920
But when the time came to tell her...

1193
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,560
...I couldn't do it.

1194
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,120
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

1195
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,960
It's crazy.

1196
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,960
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

1197
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,400
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

1198
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,800
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

1199
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,480
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

1200
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,240
Right.

1201
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,120
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

1202
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,720
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

1203
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,640
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1204
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,120
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

1205
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,360
Is it for a woman you love?

1206
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,160
To live how? Where?

1207
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,440
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

1208
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,400
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

1209
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,560
There must be anotherjob in another
firm that you can just, you know...

1210
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,680
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

1211
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,880
And he loves me.

1212
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,480
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

1213
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,120
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

1214
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,000
We're going away for three weeks.

1215
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,120
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

1216
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,600
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

1217
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,960
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

1218
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,200
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

1219
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,280
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

1220
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,360
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

1221
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,840
which is all you ever tell me...

1222
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,680
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

1223
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,960
It's a big blow.

1224
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,160
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

1225
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,600
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

1226
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,760
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

1227
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,440
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

1228
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,600
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

1229
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,920
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

1230
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Hey, keep your voice down.

1231
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,240
You know I make love to her.

1232
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,800
And you know it's just routine.

1233
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,280
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

1234
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,280
Yeah.

1235
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,440
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

1236
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,160
It will.

1237
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,720
- It will.
- OK.

1238
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,160
The holiday's off.

1239
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,680
Why? What happened?

1240
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,920
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

1241
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,160
Why?

1242
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,640
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

1243
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,480
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1244
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,800
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

1245
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,320
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1246
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,960
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

1247
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,720
Yeah.

1248
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,800
Hello?

1249
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
Hello?

1250
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,840
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

1251
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,880
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

1252
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:56,960
Really?

1253
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

1254
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,240
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

1255
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:06,720
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1256
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,040
assuming our predictions are correct.

1257
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,520
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

1258
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,560
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

1259
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,560
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

1260
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,680
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

1261
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,760
You already are a young grandmother.

1262
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,080
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

1263
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,160
but I'd like you to be a mother.

1264
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,440
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

1265
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,680
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

1266
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,480
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

1267
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,520
Great. You forgot.

1268
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,240
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

1269
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,000
So my hints worked.

1270
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,160
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

1271
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,240
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

1272
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,560
- Hello?
- Chris?

1273
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,880
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

1274
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,440
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

1275
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,120
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

1276
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,760
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1277
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,160
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

1278
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,480
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

1279
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,120
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

1280
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,520
I've been waiting a week.

1281
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,480
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

1282
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,600
When are you coming home?

1283
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,160
In about two weeks.

1284
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,880
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

1285
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,320
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

1286
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,200
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1287
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,160
OK. OK...

1288
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,080
Who is that? What country are you in?

1289
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,200
Your mobile's been impossible.

1290
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,720
I told you. I'm in Greece.

1291
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,240
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

1292
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,920
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

1293
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,920
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

1294
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,400
Can you just?

1295
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,040
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

1296
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,840
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

1297
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,200
Do you miss me?

1298
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,240
OK. Bye, bye.

1299
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,520
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1300
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,320
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

1301
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,640
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

1302
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,640
Sardinia.

1303
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,000
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

1304
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,960
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

1305
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,800
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

1306
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,160
You lied to me.

1307
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,800
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

1308
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,360
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

1309
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,200
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

1310
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,240
Look, Christ, Christ.

1311
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,520
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

1312
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,840
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

1313
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,080
I can explain. I... Taxi!

1314
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,480
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

1315
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,760
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

1316
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,680
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

1317
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,240
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

1318
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,800
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

1319
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,480
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

1320
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,400
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

1321
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,400
You're a liar!

1322
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,280
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

1323
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,160
I only came back
the day before yesterday

1324
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,400
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

1325
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,280
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

1326
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,320
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

1327
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,160
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

1328
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,560
I was about to when you called.

1329
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,680
What does that have to do with anything?

1330
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,920
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

1331
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,520
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

1332
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,640
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

1333
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,360
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

1334
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,880
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

1335
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,560
Well, she has to know eventually.

1336
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,840
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

1337
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,920
Nola, stop!

1338
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,240
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

1339
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,880
We don't have to have a child together.

1340
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,720
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1341
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,840
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1342
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,200
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

1343
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,920
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

1344
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,920
Nola, be reasonable.

1345
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

1346
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,240
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

1347
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,640
So, you're threatening me?

1348
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,320
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

1349
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,240
Were you lying to me?

1350
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,800
All those times we made love,

1351
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,880
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

1352
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,480
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

1353
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,400
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

1354
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,120
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

1355
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,600
Have you seen Chris?

1356
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,680
A minute ago. He went that way.

1357
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,800
Chris?

1358
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,760
Chris?

1359
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,720
Chris?

1360
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,280
Where are you, Chris?

1361
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,560
Chris?

1362
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,360
Chloe, are you there?

1363
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,920
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

1364
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,280
No. Could you come up for a minute?

1365
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,960
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

1366
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,560
Yeah, OK.

1367
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,080
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

1368
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,880
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

1369
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,960
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

1370
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,040
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

1371
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,000
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1372
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,080
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1373
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,920
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

1374
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,720
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

1375
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,320
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

1376
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,480
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

1377
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,040
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

1378
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,160
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

1379
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,760
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

1380
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,920
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

1381
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,280
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

1382
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,320
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1383
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,600
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

1384
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,200
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1385
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,800
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

1386
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,080
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

1387
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,560
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

1388
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,840
Did you hate it?

1389
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,560
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

1390
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,520
I thought you were gonna pass out.

1391
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,880
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

1392
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,160
I still can't do it with you tonight.

1393
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,640
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1394
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,880
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

1395
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,080
No. What are you doing?

1396
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,840
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1397
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,840
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

1398
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,760
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1399
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,560
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

1400
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,480
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

1401
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,600
Is this it?

1402
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,240
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

1403
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,240
I've got to have words
with her about it.

1404
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,920
It's really...

1405
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,720
What did you just put in your pocket?

1406
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,400
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

1407
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,840
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

1408
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,600
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

1409
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,240
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

1410
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,920
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

1411
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,200
- Guess what?
- What?

1412
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,680
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

1413
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,720
You haven't. That's not like you.

1414
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,040
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

1415
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,920
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

1416
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,720
No, that's not so.

1417
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,240
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

1418
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,240
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

1419
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,680
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

1420
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,480
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1421
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:51,160
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

1422
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,200
You're so sweet.

1423
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,760
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

1424
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,600
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

1425
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,480
OK, I will.

1426
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,120
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

1427
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,640
When you get off work today,
come right home.

1428
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,720
I have some good news.

1429
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,160
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1430
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,120
You've got to meet me
right after work.

1431
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,880
We have... plans to make.

1432
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,160
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

1433
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,960
It's good. This is good.

1434
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,840
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1435
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,280
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

1436
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,880
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

1437
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,120
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

1438
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,200
Yes.

1439
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,920
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1440
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,640
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

1441
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,760
Good.

1442
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,000
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

1443
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,160
for developing their capacity.

1444
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,760
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

1445
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,600
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

1446
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,120
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

1447
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,840
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

1448
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,560
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

1449
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,840
We met here last...

1450
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,320
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

1451
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,400
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

1452
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,040
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

1453
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,680
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

1454
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,760
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

1455
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,720
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

1456
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,200
Well, what's the trouble?

1457
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,120
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

1458
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,120
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

1459
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,680
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

1460
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Yes.

1461
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,800
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

1462
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,080
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1463
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,160
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

1464
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,240
I have to take my medicine.

1465
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,200
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

1466
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,240
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1467
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,680
Mrs. Eastby?

1468
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
It's lan.

1469
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,840
Mrs. Eastby?

1470
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,840
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

1471
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,600
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

1472
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,600
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

1473
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,440
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

1474
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,200
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

1475
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,320
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

1476
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,400
Excellent.

1477
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,800
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

1478
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,760
Nola.

1479
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,560
Excuse me.

1480
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,520
Hello.

1481
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,560
Where are you?

1482
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,320
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

1483
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,480
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1484
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,560
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

1485
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,160
Two pounds.

1486
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,280
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

1487
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,320
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1488
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,440
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

1489
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,520
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

1490
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,920
As he, or they, were running out

1491
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,480
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

1492
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,840
Either out of panic,

1493
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,920
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

1494
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,600
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

1495
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,800
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

1496
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,240
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

1497
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,680
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

1498
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,080
Probably cased her.

1499
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,520
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

1500
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,600
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1501
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,320
Some people just don't have any luck.

1502
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,320
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

1503
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,280
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

1504
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,960
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

1505
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,240
Do you need anything from the car?

1506
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,360
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

1507
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,680
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

1508
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,680
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1509
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,440
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

1510
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,880
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

1511
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,680
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

1512
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,480
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

1513
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,200
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1514
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,240
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,040
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

1516
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,240
No, hang on. If you just wait.

1517
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,680
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

1518
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,000
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

1519
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

1520
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:39,040
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

1521
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,000
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

1522
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,360
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

1523
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,600
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

1524
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,560
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

1525
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,080
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

1526
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,480
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

1527
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,560
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

1528
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,720
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1529
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,080
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

1530
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:01,000
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

1531
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,160
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

1532
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,640
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

1533
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:08,080
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1534
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,440
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

1535
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,200
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

1536
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,400
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

1537
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,440
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

1538
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,720
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

1539
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,760
Did you like the musical last night?

1540
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,400
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

1541
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,880
Yeah, he's very good.

1542
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,640
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

1543
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,760
Good.

1544
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,000
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1545
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,320
Oh, my God! Nola!

1546
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,160
- Nola Rice.
- What?

1547
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:52,160
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

1548
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,800
What? Here, let me see that.

1549
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:57,680
Jesus Christ!

1550
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,680
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

1551
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,720
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1552
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,320
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

1553
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,360
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

1554
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,720
Oh, my God.

1555
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,800
Hello?

1556
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,440
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

1557
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,080
Isn't itjust terrible?

1558
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,440
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

1559
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,520
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

1560
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,800
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

1561
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,120
I know.

1562
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,720
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

1563
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,560
Hello?

1564
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,120
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

1565
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,040
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

1566
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,480
I suppose she must've...

1567
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,200
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

1568
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,560
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

1569
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,360
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1570
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,640
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

1571
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,960
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

1572
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,920
over the past year.

1573
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,640
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1574
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:13,080
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

1575
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:20,800
Mummy.

1576
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,960
I've got something to tell you.

1577
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,040
But I want Chris to be here.

1578
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,240
Chris?

1579
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:33,280
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1580
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,360
He was just in here. Chris?

1581
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,040
Chris?

1582
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,720
He was just here.

1583
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,440
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1584
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,960
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

1585
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,480
Where are you? Chris?

1586
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,240
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1587
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,000
Well, I just really want him to be here.

1588
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,400
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

1589
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,080
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

1590
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,400
Well, I wanted you to be here.

1591
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,000
Well, what is it?

1592
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,560
Mummy...

1593
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,400
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

1594
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,200
It looks like I'm pregnant.

1595
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,520
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

1596
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,400
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

1597
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,520
Alec?

1598
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,320
Alec? Come here.

1599
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,960
We're both walking on air.

1600
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,160
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1601
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,120
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

1602
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,440
Chloe's pregnant.

1603
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,000
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1604
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,440
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

1605
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,160
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

1606
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,200
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1607
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,840
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

1608
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,280
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

1609
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:21,120
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

1610
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,640
Thank you, Margaret.

1611
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,040
Sam?

1612
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:27,680
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

1613
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,640
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1614
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,840
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1615
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,360
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

1616
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,400
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

1617
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,840
I bet it was that night...

1618
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,200
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

1619
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,160
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1620
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,400
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

1621
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,680
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

1622
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,320
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1623
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,960
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

1624
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,280
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

1625
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,520
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

1626
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,400
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

1627
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,240
Detective Banner, please.

1628
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:13,320
This is Chris Wilton.

1629
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Oh, hello.

1630
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,560
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

1631
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:23,520
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

1632
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,840
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

1633
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,320
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

1634
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,680
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1635
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,760
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

1636
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
I certainly hope not.

1637
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,960
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

1638
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,040
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1639
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,960
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

1640
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:59,080
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

1641
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,400
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

1642
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,840
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

1643
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,680
How?

1644
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:11,880
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

1645
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,680
That's...

1646
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,480
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

1647
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,560
They broke up. A year ago. More.

1648
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
When did you last see her?

1649
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,240
Oh, God, I can't remember.

1650
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,920
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

1651
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,440
But that was a long time ago.

1652
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,920
Have you seen her since?

1653
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:43,120
Not that I recall.

1654
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,520
Have?

1655
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,160
Have you ever seen this?

1656
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,120
No. What is it?

1657
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,040
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1658
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,240
No.

1659
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:11,240
As you can see...

1660
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,240
...you're all over it.

1661
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,840
Yes, I can see that.

1662
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,280
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

1663
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,880
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

1664
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,480
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

1665
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,480
But you people have to protect me here.

1666
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,200
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

1667
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,240
How long did your affair go on?

1668
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,360
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

1669
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,320
They broke up, she moved away.

1670
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:03,160
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

1671
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,560
God, have a heart.

1672
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,760
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1673
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,280
This will devastate her.

1674
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,880
Did you...

1675
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:20,120
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1676
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,600
No, I did not.

1677
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,320
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

1678
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:29,560
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

1679
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,720
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

1680
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,040
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

1681
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,200
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

1682
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,880
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

1683
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:50,600
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

1684
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,280
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

1685
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,400
But you did lead her on,

1686
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,280
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

1687
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,240
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

1688
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:06,080
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

1689
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:12,400
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

1690
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,880
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

1691
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,040
much less Nola Rice.

1692
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,320
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

1693
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,400
and she walked in when it was happening?

1694
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:33,800
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

1695
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,200
...wreck people's lives.

1696
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:39,360
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1697
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,080
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

1698
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,560
OK, but I'm not your man.

1699
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:49,280
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1700
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,600
but that does not make me a murderer.

1701
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,680
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

1702
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,760
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

1703
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,440
And if we have to talk to you again,

1704
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,840
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

1705
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,440
Your personal life's your own.

1706
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:06,360
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

1707
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,640
I understand.

1708
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,200
Look...

1709
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,480
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

1710
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,560
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

1711
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,600
please call me on my mobile.

1712
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,080
This is my number.

1713
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,560
Thanks.

1714
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,240
One other thing.

1715
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,720
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1716
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,360
Me?

1717
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,760
No.

1718
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,720
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

1719
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,960
You can check it out, but...

1720
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:53,920
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

1721
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,080
Of course.

1722
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,040
Thank you.

1723
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,680
So, what do you think?

1724
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,000
I think it's what it looks like.

1725
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,120
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1726
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:19,760
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

1727
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:24,360
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

1728
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,440
He's 'specting a baby.

1729
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,040
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

1730
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,800
...we can find out discreetly enough

1731
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,880
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1732
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:40,840
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

1733
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,720
never mind sawing one off.

1734
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,520
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

1735
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,320
Not even a speeding ticket.

1736
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:52,200
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

1737
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,600
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

1738
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,920
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

1739
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,480
Well, come on, Mike.

1740
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,400
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

1741
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,600
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

1742
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,000
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1743
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:08,040
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

1744
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:12,720
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

1745
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,840
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

1746
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,760
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

1747
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,200
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

1748
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,560
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

1749
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:26,360
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

1750
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,800
Chris.

1751
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,520
Nola...

1752
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,840
...it wasn't easy.

1753
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,600
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

1754
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:50,480
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

1755
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:56,280
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

1756
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,240
You have to.

1757
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:01,840
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1758
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,080
And what about me?

1759
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,880
What about the next-door neighbor?

1760
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,640
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

1761
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:17,000
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

1762
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:23,320
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

1763
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,640
You were collateral damage.

1764
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,200
So was your own child.

1765
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,440
Sophocles said:

1766
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,120
"To never have been born

1767
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,200
may be the greatest boon of all."

1768
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:47,880
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

1769
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,960
Your actions were clumsy.

1770
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,720
Full of holes.

1771
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,000
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

1772
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,480
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

1773
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,440
and punished.

1774
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,280
At least there would be
some small sign ofjustice.

1775
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,360
Some small...

1776
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,480
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

1777
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,040
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

1778
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,880
What?

1779
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:26,640
It's as we speculated

1780
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,120
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

1781
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:32,280
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

1782
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,040
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1783
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:35,120
He waited in the hall.

1784
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:37,080
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

1785
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:40,440
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

1786
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,640
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

1787
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,960
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

1788
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,560
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

1789
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:49,120
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1790
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,360
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

1791
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,200
and I am going to break this case.

1792
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,120
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

1793
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,160
What?

1794
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,200
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1795
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,520
What's the bad news?

1796
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,480
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

1797
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,280
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1798
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,600
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

1799
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,360
No, he didn't have to.

1800
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:13,640
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

1801
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:17,560
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

1802
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,760
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

1803
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,160
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1804
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,480
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1805
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,200
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

1806
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,800
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1807
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:33,720
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

1808
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,120
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

1809
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,600
No, wait.

1810
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:41,640
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

1811
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:46,440
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

1812
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:49,240
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

1813
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,160
Come on.

1814
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,760
I give up.

1815
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,640
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

1816
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:58,040
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

1817
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:01,440
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1818
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:04,920
What a world. Am I right?

1819
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:08,360
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

1820
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:11,440
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

1821
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,480
Right. Champagne.

1822
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,760
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

1823
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,200
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

1824
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:21,520
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

1825
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,440
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

1826
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,160
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

1827
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:30,720
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1828
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,160
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

1829
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,720
Let's work on number two. Come on.

1830
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,160
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

1831
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,480
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

1832
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,600
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

1833
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,040
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

1834
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,600
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

1835
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:46,840
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

1836
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:47,880
Please do.

1837
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,040
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

1838
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,320
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

1839
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,800
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

1840
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:56,680
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

1841
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,280
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

1842
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,280
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

1843
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,680
I just hope that he's lucky.

1844
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,360
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

1845
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,760
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

1846
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,680
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

1847
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,600
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

1848
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,040
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

1849
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,400
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

1850
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,640
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

1851
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,200
What are you saying about him?

1852
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,280
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

1853
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:24,320
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

1854
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,680
I wonder what he's thinking.

1855
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,000
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

1856
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,720
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

1857
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,720
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

1858
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,480
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
