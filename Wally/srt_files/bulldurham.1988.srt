1
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,440
l believe in
the Church of Baseball.

2
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,800
l've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

3
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,960
l've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu...

4
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
Siva, trees, mushrooms
and lsadora Duncan.

5
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,440
l know things.

6
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,600
For instance, there are 108 beads
in a Catholic rosary...

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
and there are 108 stitches
in a baseball.

8
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
When l learned that,
l gaveJesus a chance.

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
But it just didn't work out
between us.

10
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
The Lord laid
too much guilt on me.

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,080
l prefer metaphysics
to theology.

12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,080
You see, there's no guilt
in baseball...

13
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,800
and it's never boring...

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,720
which makes it like sex.

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,800
There's never been a ballplayer
who slept with me...

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
who didn't have
the best year of his career.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,640
Making love
is like hitting a baseball-

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,960
you just gotta relax
and concentrate.

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,080
Besides, l'd never sleep
with a player hitting under 250...

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,000
unless he had a lot of RBl's or was
a great glove man up the middle.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,160
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom l give these boys.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,440
l can expand their minds.

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
Sometimes when l've got
a ballplayer alone...

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,640
l'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,320
And the guys are so sweet,
they always stay and listen.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
Of course, a guy will listen
to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,320
l make them feel confident,
and they make me feel safe...

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and pretty.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,680
Of course, what l give them
lasts a lifetime.

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,760
What they give me
lasts 142 games.

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Sometimes it seems
like a bad trade...

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,040
but bad trades
is a part of baseball.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Who can forget Frank Robinson
for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
lt's a long season,
and you gotta trust it.

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,960
l've tried 'em all,
l really have.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,640
And the only church
that truly feeds the soul-

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,080
day in, day out-
is the Church of Baseball.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,120
Hey, Skip, that Max,
hell of a guy.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
Where's Ebby?

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Ain't he warming up yet?

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,160
No. His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

42
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,360
Better find our "bonus baby."

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,200
Have you seen Ebby?

44
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
No.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
Ebby!

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Jesus.

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,000
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920
l am warm.

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,320
Jesus, this is your
professional debut tonight.

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes.

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,240
You're leaving your fastball in
the locker room for some piece of ass.

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,360
Skip, it is me.

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,280
l am not some, quote,
piece of ass, unquote.

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Oh, Millie.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Jeez, sorry.
Didn't recognize you.

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Don't take this personally, Millie,
but if l catch you in here again...

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,920
you're banned from the ballpark.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
You can't ban me
from the ballpark...

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
'cause my daddy
donated that scoreboard.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
And if you ban me, he just might
take that scoreboard away.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,320
What do we need
a scoreboard for?

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,520
We ain't scored any runs
all year.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,800
Now you get your ass out there!

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,440
Hey, boss, l got a question.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
What?

66
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
You think l need a nickname?
l think l need a nickname.

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
Like "Oil Can," "Catfish."
What was the one you were-

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,040
"Pokey."

70
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,840
What do you think of"Pokey"?

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,360
You got three minutes.

72
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,120
Goddamn, son of a bitchin',
motherfuckin' shithead!

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,120
Time for another quickie.

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,320
Jesus, you got
a game to pitch.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
We got three minutes.

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,760
Come on, folks.
Let's hear it for Max Patkin-

77
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
the clown prince of baseball.

78
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,880
You gonna sit there all day?

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,960
And now
"The Greatest Show on Dirt"...

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
your own Durham Bulls!

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,240
l'm there. l'm ready.

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,560
And now WRDU radio presents...

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
the voice of the Durham Bulls,
Teddy Garland.

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
The Bulls off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games.

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,440
But hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut...

86
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,280
of heralded young pitcher,
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Millie, you gotta stay out
of the clubhouse.

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,520
You're gonna get everybody
in trouble.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,440
l got lured.

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
You did not get lured.
Women do not get lured.

91
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,640
They are too strong and powerful
for that. Now say it...

92
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,760
"l did not get lured. l accept
full responsibility for my actions."

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,520
That's better.
You got your radar ready?

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,360
- Ready.
- Go to it.

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,520
Steppin' in
for the Peninsula White Sox...

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
is leadoff hitter Willie Foster.

97
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Word on LaLoosh is that
the good-looking, young pitcher...

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,080
has a major-league fastball, but
sometimes has problems with control.

99
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,200
Damn.

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,960
One ball, no strikes
to Willie Foster.

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
No problem!

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Go get 'em, one, two, three, babe.
Get 'em, big guy.

103
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,640
Ninety-five miles an hour.

104
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
That's great.
He looks just great.

105
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,480
Stepping in
for the Peninsula White Sox...

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,680
second baseman Allen Powley.

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,920
What's it say?

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,400
lt says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

109
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,080
Scotty, baby, take this
to Ebby Calvin.

110
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,360
All right, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

111
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,840
Well, he fucks
like he pitches.

112
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Sort of all over the place.

113
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,160
My!

114
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
He walked 18.

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
A new league record.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,840
- Struck out 18.
- Another new league record.

117
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,040
ln addition, he hit
the sportswriter...

118
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,320
the public address announcer,
the Bull mascot twice.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Also, new league records.

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,640
But,Joe...

121
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,800
this guy's got
some serious shit.

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Yeah, serious shit.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Who are you?
Who's he?

124
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
l'm "the player
to be named later."

125
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,960
Crash Davis?
l'm Joe Riggins.

126
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,400
And you, Larry Hockett,
should recognize me...

127
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
'cause five years ago
in the Texas League...

128
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,360
you were pitching for El Paso,
l was hitting cleanup for Shreveport.

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,720
You hung a curveball
on an 0-2 pitch in a 3-2 game...

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,760
in the bottom of the eighth,
and l tattooed it...

131
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,320
over the Michelin Tire sign,
beat you 4-3.

132
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,240
l remember. l should have
thrown a slider.

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,800
Damn, Crash, how ya doin?

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,080
l'm too old for this shit.

135
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,240
Why in the hell
am l back in A ball?

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,600
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
Big club's got
a hundred grand in him.

138
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
He's got a million-dollar arm
with a five-cent head.

139
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Had a gun on him tonight.

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
Last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

141
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,440
He's got the best young arm
l've seen in 30 years.

142
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,160
You've been around.

143
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,440
You're smart.
You're a professional.

144
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
We want you to mature the kid.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
We want you to room with him
on the road.

146
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,560
Stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.

147
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah? Where can l go?

148
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,560
You can keep going
to the ballpark...

149
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,240
keep getting paid to do it.

150
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Beats the hell out of
working at Sears.

151
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,360
Sears sucks. l once worked there.
Sold Lady Kenmores.

152
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Nasty work.

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Even if it is
the Carolina League...

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,880
this is a chance
to play every day.

155
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

156
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
No.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,960
My triple A contract
gets bought out...

158
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,360
so l can hold the flavor
of the month's dick.

159
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,160
ls that it?
Fuck this fucking game!

160
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,200
l fuckin' quit, all right?

161
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
Who we play tomorrow?

162
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,280
Winston-Salem.
Batting practice, 11:30.

163
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,640
How's it feel to get
your first professional win?

164
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,080
lt feels out there.
lt's a major rush.

165
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,120
lt doesn't just feel out there,
it feels out there.

166
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,880
Kind of radical
in a kind of tubular way.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
But most of all,
it's out there.

168
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,240
This is hopeless.
This is utterly, fucking hopeless.

169
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,760
Hey, l'm Millie.

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
l'm Tony.
l play second base.

171
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,760
l know.

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,760
How do you just keep
coming back every year?

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,920
'Cause l love the game, Annie.
l love it.

174
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
- Here you go.
- We didn't order these.

175
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,760
- He did.
- Who?

176
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,680
The guy in the booth.

177
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,080
Who's that?

178
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,600
That's Crash Davis.
Hey, Crash, come here.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Get over here.

180
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
He's kinda cute.

181
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
He's played in more ballparks
than l have.

182
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,600
Hell of a guy.

183
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,640
He's really different.

184
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,600
l actually saw him read a book
without pictures once.

185
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,600
- Hi, Max.
- How you doing?

186
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
Come over and sit down.

187
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,080
l'm Crash.

188
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,160
Annie Savoy.
Wanna dance?

189
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
l don't dance.

190
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,920
How embarrassing.

191
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,000
What is that?

192
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Who's he dancing with?

193
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,200
All of them, l think.

194
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,240
You Annie Savoy?

195
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,160
Thanks for your note. You're right.
l wasn't bending my back.

196
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
You have a live arm there.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Thanks.

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,200
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

199
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
You need a nickname, honey.

200
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,960
l've been telling
everybody that.

201
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,480
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

202
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
She's dancing with me.

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
'Fraid not, pal.

204
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,320
You boys gonna fight
over little ol' me?

205
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,000
- No.
- Let's go.

206
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Step outside and party, man.

207
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't be such guys.

208
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Max, let's dance.

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
You comin' or not, homeboy?

210
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,440
Let's go. Come on.
We're waitin'.

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,040
- Let's go, homeboy.
- Come on, Ebby. There he is.

212
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,400
l don't believe in fighting.
Let's just-

213
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,480
That's really sweet.
Fuck you, you pussy.

214
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,320
All right.
Take the first shot at me.

215
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,720
No way.
l don't hit no man first.

216
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,720
All right, then.

217
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,160
Hit me in the chest
with that.

218
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
l'd kill you.

219
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,360
From what l hear,
you couldn't hit water...

220
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,360
if you fell out of
a fuckin' boat.

221
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,120
Go ahead, man.

222
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Go ahead, come on.
Right in the chest.

223
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
- No way.
- Come on, Meat.

224
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
You're not gonna hit me 'cause
you're thinking about it already.

225
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
Starting to think
how embarrassing it would be...

226
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
to miss in front of these people,
how somebody might laugh.

227
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,760
Come on, Rook.
Show us that million-dollar arm...

228
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,360
'cause l got a good idea
about that five-cent head of yours.

229
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
Hit 'im, man!

230
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,480
Fuck!

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
Ball four.

232
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
Who the fuck are you?

233
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,840
Good punch.

234
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,760
l'm Crash Davis.
l'm your new catcher...

235
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,560
and you just got
lesson number one:

236
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,680
Don't think.

237
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,720
lt can only hurt the ball club.

238
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Come inside,
l'll buy you a drink.

239
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
He's my new catcher.

240
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
We fight, she gets the clown.
How's that happen?

241
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,880
God, l like this song.

242
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Did you boys stop fightin'?

243
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
Pals now?

244
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
That's good.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
l love a little
macho male bonding.

246
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,120
l think it's sweet.
l do.

247
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,080
Even if it probably is latent
homosexuality being rechanneled.

248
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,280
l'm all for rechanneling,
so who cares, right?

249
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,480
Okay, shall we go to my place?

250
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,120
Which one of us?

251
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Both of you, of course.

252
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
These are the ground rules.

253
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,680
l hook up with one guy a season.

254
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,160
Usually takes me a couple weeks
to pick the guy.

255
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,280
Kind of my own spring training.

256
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,880
You two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

257
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,240
l just thought we should kinda
get to know each other.

258
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Time-out.
Why do you get to choose?

259
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,760
- Why?
- Why do you get to choose?

260
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,760
Why don't l get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

261
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

262
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
lt's all a question
of quantum physics...

263
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,880
molecular attraction
and timing.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,760
Laws we don't understand that
bring us together and tear us apart.

265
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,840
lt's like pheromones.

266
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,520
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

267
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,080
You get 300 million of them,
they can build a cathedral.

268
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,360
ls somebody gonna go to bed
with somebody?

269
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,640
Honey, you are a regular
nuclear meltdown.

270
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
You better cool off.

271
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
Where you going?

272
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
l don't try out.

273
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Besides...

274
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,040
l don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,400
What do you believe in, then?

276
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,000
l believe in the soul...

277
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,560
the cock, the pussy...

278
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,600
the small of a woman's back...

279
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,480
the hanging curveball,
high-fiver, good scotch...

280
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,920
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,040
l believe Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone.

282
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,240
l believe there oughta be
a constitutional amendment...

283
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
outlawing Astroturf
and the designated hitter.

284
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,400
l believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography...

285
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,000
open your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve...

286
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
and l believe in long, slow,
deep, soft, wet kisses...

287
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
that last three days.

288
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Good night.

289
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,600
Oh, my.

290
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,400
Hey, what's all
this molecule stuff?

291
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
Crash, wait!

292
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
All's l want is a date.

293
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
l'm not gonna fall in love
with you or nothing.

294
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,240
l'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in that boy.

295
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,360
Good night.

296
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,760
- l'm not interested yet.
- Who you calling a boy?

297
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
See you at the yard, Meat.

298
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
Damn, nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

299
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,680
He's crazy.

300
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
l want you bad.

301
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,680
Honey, hold on.
Slow down.

302
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,840
l wanna watch.

303
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,800
Go ahead.
Put it back on.

304
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,360
Jesus, what kind
of chick are you?

305
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,680
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

306
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,840
l know how to pitch.

307
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,240
Good.

308
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,520
Now take it off slowly.

309
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
That's nice.

310
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,720
Oh, my, what a nice back.

311
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,000
Honey. Sweetheart.

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,480
Try taking off
your shoes and socks first.

313
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,080
My socks?
lt's cold in here.

314
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,760
What?

315
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
You think Dwight Gooden
leaves his socks on?

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,560
Ebby, honey.

317
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,360
Have you ever been
tied up in bed?

318
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,720
Bring it on, baby!

319
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,840
l heard about shit like this.

320
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,840
You ever heard
about Walt Whitman?

321
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,000
Who's he play for?

322
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,400
He sort of pitches
for the Cosmic All-Stars.

323
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,600
- Never heard of him.
- Oh, good.

324
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,960
Listen to this.

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,120
"l sing the body electric.

326
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,960
The armies of those l love
engirth me and l engirth them.

327
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,560
They will not let me off
till l go with them...

328
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,480
respond to them
and discorrupt them...

329
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,520
and charge them full
with the charge of the soul.

330
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
But the expression of a well-made man
appears not only in his face...

331
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,800
it is in his limbs
and joints also."

332
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,680
Excuse me.
Are we gonna fuck or what?

333
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,680
"lt is curiously in the joints
of his hips and wrists.

334
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,160
Love flesh swelling
and deliciously aching.

335
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,320
Limitless limpid jets of love,
hot and enormous."

336
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,280
Listen up, guys.
Can l have your attention a minute?

337
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
l'm gonna be leading a daily chapel
service here in the locker room...

338
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,880
- at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- Amen, brother!

339
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,160
Y'all are invited to stop on by
and worship before batting practice.

340
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,960
Jimmy, goddamn it.
Loosen up and get laid.

341
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,320
l know y'all think
l'm pretty square, but...

342
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,960
l believe what l believe.

343
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,360
Jesus, Ebby, you look like
a truck ran over you.

344
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,000
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

345
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,760
Annie says
it's my new nickname.

346
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,360
Okay, Nuke. Go get 'em.

347
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Annie nailed you?
Annie did?

348
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,360
That's great. That means
you're gonna have a great year.

349
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,600
ls she as good as they say?

350
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,320
No, man, we didn't fuck.

351
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,640
No, she read poetry
to me all night.

352
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,960
lt's more tiring than fucking.

353
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
"Limpid jets of love."

354
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Hey, Crash. Does that mean
what l think it means?

355
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,520
"Limpid jets of love."

356
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,920
Your shower shoes
have fungus on them.

357
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,040
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

358
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,720
Think classy,
you'll be classy.

359
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,360
lf you win 20 in the Show...

360
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,840
you can let the fungus
grow back on your shower shoes...

361
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
and the press will think
you're colorful.

362
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Until you win 20
in the Show, however...

363
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
means you're a slob.

364
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Y'all don't forget
Saturday is Bull Day...

365
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,440
down at the Northgate Mall.

366
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,560
Strike!

367
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,560
Whoa, too bad, Butch.

368
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,680
Charge!

369
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
Not getting that cheese
by me, Meat.

370
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,640
And now batting for the Bulls,
number eight, Crash Davis.

371
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,760
Foul ball!

372
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,360
God, stupid fuck, Crash.

373
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,280
What'd you swing
at a breaking ball for?

374
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,440
Fuck me.

375
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,360
You usually start me off
with a hammer.

376
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,160
You're thinking too much, Crash.
Get out of your fuckin'head.

377
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,080
Don't let him in your kitchen.

378
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,640
Come on, Crash.Just relax.
You got it, honey.

379
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,520
All right, here we go.
Stay back. Relax.

380
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
Quick bat.

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,280
Foul ball!

382
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,040
Throw that shit again, Meat.
Throw that weak-ass shit again.

383
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay, get close.
You got it. One more, baby.

384
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,000
He's gonna throw the deuce now.

385
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,640
He's gotta waste one.

386
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,160
Stay back and wipe that
silly grin off his face.

387
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,760
Come on. Bring it.

388
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
Jesus Christ!

389
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,480
What the hell was that?

390
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
What goes around,
comes around.

391
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Son of a bitch throws hard.

392
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
lt's okay, Crash.
You take it easy, honey.

393
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,880
All right, one and two.
You can eat this shit. Relax.

394
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,560
Annie.

395
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,400
Who's this Annie?

396
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Jesus, get out of the box, idiot.
Where's your head?

397
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
Get the broad
outta your head!

398
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,160
Time-out!

399
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,360
Give me a rag.

400
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,240
Get a hit, Crash.

401
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
Shut up.

402
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
All right, you've seen
all his pitches.

403
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,960
You've seen them all.

404
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Shorten up, Crash.
Bring me the gas, kid.

405
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,520
Quick bat.

406
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
Strike!

407
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Scotty, baby,
take this to Crash.

408
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,720
Folks, we have
a little lost girl up here.

409
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,360
Says her name is Lana Ann Baker.

410
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,360
- She'll be waiting...
- lt's for Crash.

411
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,480
at the ticket box
for her daddy, Cedar Baker.

412
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,480
Cedar, come get
your little girl.

413
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,000
- What?
- From Annie.

414
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,240
Read it.

415
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,360
"Dear Crash, you have
a lovely swing...

416
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
but you're pulling
your hips out too early.

417
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,600
l'd be happy to meet you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it.

418
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
Signed, Annie."

419
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
lf there's one chick who'd know
you were pulling your hips out early...

420
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,920
it'd be Annie.

421
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,080
lt's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

422
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
There you go.

423
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,480
Here, Millie.

424
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,000
What's it say?

425
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
lt says, "l wanna make love
to you. Crash."

426
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,800
Oh, my.

427
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,600
See my hips?

428
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,760
Yep.

429
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,040
And l think Susan Sontag
is brilliant.

430
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,480
ls this gonna happen? Us?

431
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,080
l'm committed to Nuke
for the season.

432
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,240
Oh.

433
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,960
You had your chance
the other day.

434
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,000
What is it you see in this guy?

435
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,840
He's a young, wild...

436
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,640
dim, pretty boy.

437
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,800
Young men are uncomplicated.

438
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,640
And he's not dim.
He's just inexperienced.

439
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,240
lt's my job
to give him life wisdom...

440
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
and help him get on
to the major leagues.

441
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,720
That's funny,
that's my job too.

442
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,120
Damn!

443
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,960
You're pulling your hips.

444
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,800
l know,
but they're nice hips.

445
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,640
l looked up your records.

446
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,680
You what?

447
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,280
You hit 227 home runs
in the minors.

448
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,000
That's not bad.

449
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,640
Don't tell anybody.

450
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Why not?
You hit 20 more this year...

451
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,560
you're gonna be the all-time
minor-league champ.

452
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,720
The record's 246.

453
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,600
Well, 247 home runs
in the minor leagues...

454
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,680
would be a kind of
dubious honor.

455
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,560
l think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know it.

456
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,920
No.Just no. Please.

457
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,600
Okay.

458
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
Last chance,
your place or mine?

459
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics...

460
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,280
l am, within the framework
of the baseball season, monogamous.

461
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,840
- Gimme a break.
- lt's true.

462
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,000
Stop it.

463
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,080
Jeez, the fact is...

464
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,480
you're afraid of meeting a guy
like me, 'cause it might be real...

465
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,120
so you sabotage it with some,
what is it...

466
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,080
bullshit about commitment
to a young boy you can boss around.

467
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,920
That's a great deal.

468
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,040
Nice.

469
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,800
l know women like you.

470
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,760
You're a regular
patron saint.

471
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,920
Stray cats, lost causes...

472
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,680
or 6'3" homeless studs.

473
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,440
Oh, Crash,
you do make speeches.

474
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,440
Crash, that was fabulous.

475
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
Crash?

476
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,440
You mean Nuke.
You said Crash.

477
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,560
No, l said Nuke.

478
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
You said Crash.

479
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,560
Oh, no.

480
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,480
Sweetie, you shouldn't listen
to what a woman says...

481
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,640
when she's in the throes
of passion.

482
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,840
They say the darndest things.

483
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,640
Yeah, you said Crash.

484
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,920
Honey...

485
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,400
would you rather l'd be making love
to him using your name...

486
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,480
or making love to you
using his name?

487
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
Yeah, maybe you're right.

488
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,400
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers...

489
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,360
City Council Little League
Cash Drop Day.

490
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,680
These young fellas- young men,
l should say- over here to my left.

491
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,640
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

492
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
Hey, Dino.

493
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,120
Hey, Millie.

494
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,960
Hey. l'm Millie.

495
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,080
l'm married.

496
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
What is that?

497
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Chicken bone cross.

498
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,040
Takes the curse off the bat
that brings me hits.

499
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,400
What are you,
a goddamn witch?

500
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,360
Yes, a switch-hitting witch.

501
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,440
Will that work for me?

502
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
lf you believe in voodoo.

503
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,240
Jose, l am zero for 16.

504
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,240
A big fucking
doughnut hole for 16.

505
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,840
l can't remember the last time
l had a base hit.

506
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,640
Let me have
some of that stuff.

507
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,240
That is not belief.
That's desperation.

508
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,400
Jose, come on.
Just touch my bat once.

509
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,160
Come on, just once. l won't
bother you the rest of the day.

510
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,080
l swear to God.
Just touch the bat once.

511
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
five, four...

512
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,440
three, two, one.

513
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,960
Let it go!

514
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,520
One thousand big ones!

515
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,880
That batter ain't nothin'.
Come on, Nuke.

516
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,760
Cut it!

517
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,120
Time-out.

518
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Let's play ball!

519
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,000
Stay there.
Give me the ball.

520
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,040
Hey.

521
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,280
Relax, all right?

522
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,680
Don't try to strike
everybody out.

523
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,040
Strikeouts are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

524
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,360
Throw some ground balls.

525
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,640
More democratic.

526
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,680
What's this guy know, anyway?

527
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,640
lf he's so great, how come he's
been in the minors for ten years?

528
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,800
lf he's so hot, how come Annie
wants me instead of him?

529
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,160
And another thing, Meat,
you don't know shit.

530
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,280
You wanna make it to the Show,
you'll listen to me.

531
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,040
Annie only wants you 'cause
she can boss you around. Got it?

532
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,400
Relax. Let's have
some fun out here.

533
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
This game's fun.

534
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,640
Fun, goddamn it.

535
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,120
And don't hold the ball so hard.

536
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,000
lt's an egg.
Hold it like an egg.

537
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,280
What's he know about fun?
l'm young. l know about fun.

538
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,960
Old man, he don't know
nothin' about fun.

539
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,160
Nobody's goin' out there.

540
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,880
Why's he calling
for a curveball?

541
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,480
l wanna bring heat.

542
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,880
Shake him off.
Throw what you want.

543
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,000
Goddamn it. Time-out.

544
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,360
Hey, why you shaking me off?

545
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,200
l wanna bring the heater.
Announce my presence with authority.

546
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
- To announce what?
- Announce my presence with authority.

547
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,440
"Announce your presence
with authority"?

548
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
This guy's a fastball hitter,
looking for heat.

549
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,440
So what.
He ain't seen my heat.

550
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
All right, Meat.
Give him your heat.

551
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,920
Why does he always call me Meat?

552
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,840
l'm the guy driving a Porsche.

553
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,000
Fastball.

554
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,120
Come on, Nuke. Settle down.
Take your time.

555
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,120
Home run for Bud Shelton
of the Fayetteville Generals.

556
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,120
What are you doing standing here?
l gave you a gift.

557
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,080
You stand here showing up
my pitcher? Run, dummy!

558
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,680
Give me the ball.

559
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,400
He really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

560
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,400
Held it like an egg.

561
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,080
And he scrambled the son of a bitch.
He hit the fuckin' bull.

562
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,280
Guy gets a free steak.

563
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,240
You havin' fun yet?

564
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,800
Oh, yeah,
l've havin' a blast.

565
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,960
Good.

566
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
Sucker teed off on that like he knew
l was gonna throw a fastball.

567
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,760
- He did know.
- How?

568
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,080
l told him.

569
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,720
One down now!

570
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,800
Come on, Nuke. You're the man.
No batter. Chuck hard, baby.

571
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Don't think, just throw.

572
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
Strike!

573
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,800
God, that was beautiful.
What did l do?

574
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,080
Hang on, Millie.
Here we go again.

575
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,000
That's the first home run
of the year for Crash Davis.

576
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,200
That brings the score to
Fayetteville 14, Durham 2.

577
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,720
Hell of a shot.

578
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,640
Sorry it got wasted.

579
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,680
l don't know what to do
with these guys.

580
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,320
l beg. l plead.
l try to be a nice guy.

581
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
l'm a nice guy.

582
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,200
They're kids. Scare 'em.

583
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,120
That's what l'd do.

584
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,720
Yeah.

585
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,160
Everybody into the shower!

586
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,920
Anybody ain't in this shower
in ten seconds gonna get fined $100.

587
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,840
- Larry.
- One Mississippi...

588
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,720
two Mississippi,
three Mississippi...

589
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,520
- four Mississippi.
- Get in there! Hurry it up!

590
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,320
seven Mississippi,
eight Mississippi...

591
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,040
nine Mississippi,
ten Mississippi.

592
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,120
You guys, you lollygag the ball
around the infield.

593
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,680
You lollygag your way
down to first.

594
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,160
You lollygag
in and out of the dugout.

595
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,040
You know what that
makes you? Larry.

596
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,840
Lollygaggers.

597
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,200
- What's our record, Larry?
- Eight and sixteen.

598
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,080
Eight and sixteen.

599
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,400
How'd we ever win eight?

600
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,400
lt's a miracle.

601
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,200
This is a simple game.

602
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,360
You throw the ball.

603
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,080
You hit the ball.

604
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,360
You catch the ball.

605
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,080
You got it!

606
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,480
We have got a 12-day road trip...

607
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,440
starting tomorrow.

608
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,040
Bus leaves 6:00 in the morning.

609
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,760
Goddamn, son of a bitchin',
motherfuckin' shithead. Goddamn it!

610
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,880
Yeah, Skipper,
you wanted to see me?

611
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,240
Yeah, Bobby.
Shut the door.

612
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,200
This the toughest job
a manager has.

613
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,680
But the organization
has decided to make a change.

614
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,920
They're releasing you
from your contract.

615
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,560
Skip, l know l'm in a goddamn slump,
but l hit the ball hard today.

616
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,440
Couple flares drop in for me,
l'm right back in the groove.

617
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
Sorry.

618
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,800
Let's go. Come on.

619
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,920
Nuke, honey!

620
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,080
Let's go.
We got five hours.

621
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Honey, l want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

622
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,920
- What are they?
- They're garters.

623
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,120
They're gonna hug your waist
and snuggle...

624
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,240
and dangle off your thighs
and buns in such a wonderful way.

625
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,960
lt'll help you see things
differently.

626
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,240
Plus, it'll remind you of me,
which is a lot nicer...

627
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,560
than thinking about
all those nasty hitters.

628
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,320
Jesus, Annie, l don't know.

629
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,240
You've been pitching
on the wrong side of your brain.

630
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
This will help put things
on the right side.

631
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,960
Big-league pitchers
don't use these.

632
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,440
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

633
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,800
Nuke, excuse me.
Time to go to work.

634
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
All right.

635
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,880
Bye, y'all.

636
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,120
Gimme a break.

637
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,680
Go get 'em, boys!
Hit 'em where they ain't.

638
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,040
She may get woolly

639
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,960
Young girls
they do get woolly

640
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,400
'Cause of all the stress

641
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,560
Yeah

642
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,240
When they get woolly

643
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,320
Try a little tenderness

644
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,160
Stop it.

645
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,080
Thank you.

646
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,120
What?

647
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,120
lt's not "woolly."

648
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Nobody gets "woolly."
Women get "weary."

649
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,440
They don't get "woolly."

650
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,760
Nobody's got "stress,"
they're wearing a "dress."

651
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,960
Damn, l hate people
that get the words wrong.

652
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,280
How come you don't like me?

653
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,240
You don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

654
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,960
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

655
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,840
- You got a gift.
- What do l got?

656
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,240
You got a gift. When you were
a baby, the gods reached down...

657
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,440
and turned your right arm
into a thunderbolt.

658
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,120
You got a Hall-of-Fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

659
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,720
l ain't pissing nothing away.
l got a Porsche already.

660
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,760
l got a 9-11,
with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

661
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,680
You don't need
a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

662
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,600
What you need is a curveball.

663
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,800
ln the Show, everybody
can hit a fastball.

664
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,840
How would you know?

665
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,640
You've been in the majors?

666
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,840
Yeah, l've been in the majors.

667
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,120
You were?

668
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,040
You've been in the Show?

669
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah, l was in the Show.

670
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,960
l was in the Show
for 21 days once.

671
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,600
Twenty-one greatest days
of my life.

672
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,680
You never handle your luggage
in the Show.

673
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,400
Somebody else
carries your bags.

674
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,200
lt's great.

675
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,720
You hit white balls
for batting practice.

676
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,840
Ballparks are like cathedrals.

677
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,480
The hotels
all have room service.

678
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,600
The women all have
long legs and brains.

679
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,120
They're really hot?

680
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,760
Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

681
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,240
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the Show.

682
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,880
Exploding sliders.

683
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,560
You could be one of those guys.

684
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,480
Nuke could be one of those guys,
but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

685
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,840
l am sick and fuckin' tired of you
calling me Meat.

686
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,200
You wanna step outside?

687
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,720
Yeah, l'll step outside.

688
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,120
What's the problem?
What's happening?

689
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,920
l was just gonna ask Crash to show me
how to throw a breaking ball.

690
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,480
Good idea.
Did anybody bring a ball?

691
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,000
Double off the wall by Higgins.

692
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,880
Once again, Durham pitchers are unable
to get the first out of the inning.

693
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,080
The Bulls will attempt to end
a six-game losing streak...

694
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,040
against the Greensboro Hornets
with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.

695
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,320
Base hit to center field
off LaLoosh.

696
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,680
That closes the book
on LaLoosh today.

697
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,240
Five earned runs,
five hits, five strikeouts...

698
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,440
five walks
and five wild pitches.

699
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,760
lt's time to tell it
like it is, sports fans.

700
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,920
This is the most wretched
road trip l've seen in 20 years.

701
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,000
And possibly the worst Durham team
in half a century.

702
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
ls the modern-day athlete a pale
imitation of the great warriors?

703
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,080
Only Crash Davis
stands out this year.

704
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,360
Begging the question, what are
these boys thinking about?

705
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,120
'Cause it sure ain't baseball.

706
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,640
Hey, Mr. Hormone,
check out this.

707
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,880
lce-skaters.
God, look at 'em.

708
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,080
Hey, fellas,
that's what we need, man.

709
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,680
One night with these skaters,
we can get right back on track.

710
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,640
Yeah, right.

711
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,120
Just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

712
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
What we need is a rain-out.

713
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,960
l can get us a rain-out.

714
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,360
There ain't been a cloud
in the sky in weeks.

715
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,600
Hundred bucks says l can get us
a rain-out for tomorrow.

716
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,840
You're on.

717
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,960
l ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

718
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,240
Shut up. You're gonna
wake everybody up.

719
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,280
Let the bonus baby
pay for it.

720
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,200
Jesus, man.

721
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Crash, what are you doing?

722
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,600
Oh, my goodness!

723
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,160
We got ourselves
a natural disaster.

724
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,760
Wake up.

725
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,800
You're awake.

726
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,840
You're okay.

727
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,720
You were dreaming.

728
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,280
You're okay.

729
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,640
l was playing damn near naked.

730
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,400
- What?
- l was naked.

731
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,560
Playing naked.

732
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,520
l know.

733
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,880
l know. l had that dream
all the time too.

734
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,360
We're almost home.

735
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,280
Watch your head.

736
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,760
Here you go.
Let me get that back there.

737
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,360
- l'm not your slave.
- No, that one over there.

738
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,320
Hi.

739
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,160
God, l'm tired.

740
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,720
What a trip.

741
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,160
l was lousy.
l was worse than lousy.

742
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,560
But every time l pitched, it was
like throwing gasoline on a fire.

743
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,040
l mean-

744
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,200
What is all this l, l, l?
What about me?

745
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,120
Aren't you glad to see me?

746
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Don't l look nice?

747
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,560
You look great.
l'm sorry.

748
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,880
l'm just totally exhausted.

749
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,040
Good. Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

750
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,400
What you need
is a good game of catch.

751
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,440
Catch?

752
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,400
Baby, come on.
Fire one in here.

753
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,680
This is ridiculous.
l'm a professional.

754
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,280
Will you just give it a try
and lean in?

755
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,840
Thank you.

756
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,120
l want you to breathe
through your eyelids.

757
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,080
My eyelids?

758
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,320
Like the lava lizards
of the Galapagos lslands.

759
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,360
Some have a parietal eye behind their
heads so they can see backwards.

760
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,680
Haven't you ever noticed
how Fernando Valenzuela...

761
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,760
he just doesn't even look
when he pitches?

762
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,760
He's a Mayan lndian.

763
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,880
Or an Aztec. l forget which one.
l get 'em confused.

764
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,080
- So do l.
- Stand up for a second.

765
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,000
l want you to be aware
of the chakra connection...

766
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,920
between your feet
and your testicles.

767
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,880
- Chakra.
- Your right leg and left testicle...

768
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,400
and your left leg
and your right testicle.

769
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,760
l like that.

770
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,120
l bet you do.

771
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,200
Give me the ball.
l'm tired of hearing this.

772
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,120
Fire one in there.
Come on.

773
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,640
Okay.

774
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,520
You're patronizing me,
and l will not be patronized.

775
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,600
lf l throw too hard,
l'm gonna hurt the girl.

776
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
This girl has handled
a lot of pitchers...

777
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,480
whose records
are a lot better than 1-7.

778
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,440
1-6. Give me
the goddamn ball.

779
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,440
- How do you like that?
- That was much better.

780
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
You see that? Because your delivery
was fully integrated...

781
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,320
'cause you weren't thinking about it
'cause you were pissed off at me.

782
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,800
That's progress.
Get your butt up here.

783
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,720
Let's bend over,
and l'm gonna show you-

784
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,840
l give up. Let's go inside
and make love and fall asleep...

785
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,960
until it's time
to go to the ballpark.

786
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,600
Or we could just take
all that sexual energy...

787
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,680
and kind of hold
onto it for a few hours...

788
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,040
and then rechannel it
into your pitching tonight.

789
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,040
You're a powerful young thing,
Ebby Calvin.

790
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,720
You want something
for that sore shoulder?

791
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,520
l want that shit
that don't smell bad.

792
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,400
- lt's on back order.
- Give him some of that shit.

793
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,120
That's hot.

794
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,880
l mean it,
that's very hot.

795
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,200
Annie says it'll keep
one side of my brain...

796
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,160
occupied while l'm on the mound,
keeping my brain slightly off center...

797
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers.

798
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,560
Okay.

799
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,600
She also said l should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

800
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,840
Annie's a very smart lady.

801
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,080
What?

802
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,320
The rose goes in the front,
big guy.

803
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,840
Now batting
for the Salem Buffs...

804
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,240
center fielder, Joe McCorkle.

805
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,960
This underwear
feels kinda sexy.

806
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,320
That don't make me
queer, right? Right.

807
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,120
Breaking ball.

808
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,480
Yeah!

809
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,600
All right!
Way to start, baby.

810
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,600
l ain't queer.
No, l ain't.

811
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,120
Fastball.

812
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,120
Strike!

813
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,080
Ninety-six miles an hour.
He looks good...

814
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,000
but why is he all
twisting up like that?

815
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,560
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

816
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,800
That was a humdinger.

817
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,200
Yeah.

818
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,640
Fastball again?
Why's he want the heat?

819
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,040
l just threw heat.
Don't think, Meat.

820
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,080
Just give 'em the gas.

821
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,760
Strike!

822
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Jesus, what's got into Nuke?

823
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,400
He's wearing garters...

824
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,600
and he's breathing out of his eyelids
like a lava lizard.

825
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,200
lt's an old Mayan deal.

826
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,040
- Aztec.
- Aztec deal.

827
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,800
Got it!

828
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,840
l got it!

829
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,160
Way to go. Hustle in!

830
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,240
Have my mojo working.

831
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,280
You know what a mojo is?

832
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,920
- Sure.
- No, you don't.

833
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
l was great, huh?

834
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,640
Your fastball was up.
Your curveball was hanging.

835
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,360
ln the Show,
they would have ripped you.

836
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,520
Can't you even let me
enjoy the moment?

837
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,040
The moment's over.

838
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,920
Come on, Crash.

839
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,120
This guy starts me off
with a breaking ball...

840
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,960
l'm taking him downtown.

841
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,160
l dare you
to throw me the hammer.

842
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,360
You ain't that stupid.

843
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,360
Stepping up to the plate
for Durham, our own Crash Davis.

844
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,920
Come on. Put your hands
together for Crash.

845
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,080
Let's hear it!

846
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,720
Let's go.

847
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,560
Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit.

848
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,000
Bring it.

849
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,680
Oh, my.

850
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,640
Two-nothing
Bulls in the second.

851
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,560
First time the Bulls have been
ahead in weeks, eh, Whitey?

852
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,640
Mm-hmm.

853
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,640
Let's see if the real
Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

854
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,960
There you go!
Dig in there!

855
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,840
Back!

856
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,560
Crash, you got room!

857
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,560
What are you doing out here?
l'm cruising.

858
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,520
l want you to throw
the next one at the mascot.

859
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,520
l'm finally throwing it
where l want to throw it.

860
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Just throw it at the bull,
all right?

861
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,800
Trust me.

862
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,320
He's the boss.

863
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,320
A staggering start by LaLoosh.

864
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,360
He's thrown five outs
on nine pitches, all of'em strikes.

865
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,960
He's got pinpoint control
here tonight, Bull fans.

866
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,200
Here's the pitch.

867
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,960
This guy's crazy.

868
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,840
Yep. l wouldn't dig in there
if l was you.

869
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,760
Next one might be
at your head.

870
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,200
l don't know
where it's gonna go.

871
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,520
Swear to God.

872
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,960
You're the man!
Easy game!

873
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,160
Top of the ninth.
Two outs.

874
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,640
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

875
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,360
Bring it on, Meat.
Don't let up.

876
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,000
You own these guys.

877
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,440
Dad would love a shutout.

878
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,880
No.

879
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,960
No, he's looking for heat.

880
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,280
Let me give him the deuce.

881
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,080
Play ball!

882
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,160
Oh, no, he's shaking off
the signs.

883
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,320
Big mistake.

884
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,880
This son of a bitch
is throwing a two-hit shutout.

885
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,200
He's shaking me off.
You believe that shit?

886
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,360
Charlie,
here comes the deuce.

887
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,400
And when you speak of me,
speak well.

888
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,400
No, serve it up.

889
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,520
Yeah.

890
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,280
Home run.

891
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,560
Give me the ball.

892
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,920
You told him l was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

893
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,880
Yep.

894
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,720
That ball got out of here
in a hurry.

895
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,120
Anything that travels that far
oughta have a damn stewardess on it.

896
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,480
Don't you think?

897
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,320
When Nuke started listening to Crash,
everything fell into place.

898
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,480
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

899
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,760
But Nuke was still confused.

900
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,680
He was so encouraged
by his victory...

901
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,400
that he vowed not to have sex
until he lost.

902
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,400
Unfortunately, however,
he kept on winning...

903
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,880
and for one extraordinary
June and July...

904
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,720
the Durham Bulls
began playing baseball...

905
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,080
with joy and verve and poetry.

906
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,480
The two sides of my own brain
werejumbled up and cross-wired.

907
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,160
While one side
was being neglected...

908
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,880
the other was in paradise
watching our Bulls play...

909
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,520
like big leaguers.

910
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,720
We swept a four-game series
at Kinston...

911
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,280
two games at Winston-Salem...

912
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,440
and kicked the holy shit
out of Greensboro in a three-game set.

913
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,960
And Crash,
who kept hitting dingers...

914
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,040
was approaching
the minor-league record...

915
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,480
though l told nobody.

916
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,920
After sweeping
theJuly 4 doubleheader...

917
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,720
the Durham Bulls
were tied for first.

918
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,120
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
l was getting damn lonely.

919
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,120
Something had to be done.

920
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,840
l needed a man.

921
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,360
l love winning, man.

922
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,760
l fuckin' love winning.

923
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,120
You know what l'm saying?
lt's like better than losing.

924
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,160
Teach me something new.
l need to learn.

925
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
Teach me something.

926
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,280
You got something
to write with?

927
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,280
Good. lt's time to work on
your interviews.

928
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,600
My interviews?
What do l gotta do?

929
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,600
You have to learn
your cliches.

930
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,960
You're gonna have to study them,
gonna have to know them.

931
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,640
They're your friends.
Write this down.

932
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,400
"We gotta play 'em
one day at a time."

933
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,240
"Got to play-"

934
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,000
- lt's pretty boring.
- Of course it's boring.

935
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,600
That's the point.
Write it down.

936
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,800
"One day at a time."

937
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,840
"l'm just happy to be here.

938
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,880
Hope l can help the ball club."

939
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,840
l know.
Write it down.

940
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,640
"l just wanna give it
my best shot.

941
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,760
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out."

942
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,880
"Good Lord willing...

943
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,720
things will work out."

944
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,920
How's Annie?

945
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,960
She's getting
pretty steamed, actually...

946
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,840
'cause l'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

947
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
l'm figurin' l'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her.

948
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,880
You know, calm her down.

949
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,720
Are you out of your mind?

950
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,920
l'm just-
Talking about one time.

951
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,680
lf you give in now,
you might start losing.

952
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,160
Never fuck
with a winning streak.

953
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,160
Hi, boys.

954
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,440
Hi, darlin'.
Get in here.

955
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,360
Hey,Jimmy!

956
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,600
Want a ride?

957
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,480
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

958
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,680
No.

959
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,080
Can l give you my testimony?

960
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,240
You can do anything you want.

961
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,000
Hop in.

962
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,520
l am so proud of you guys.

963
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,200
You want
some more soup, honey?

964
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,320
No, thanks.
That was great.

965
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,400
How about a little back rub?

966
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,120
No, l'm okay.

967
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,040
l think l'll just take
a little nap.

968
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,440
You want me to tuck you in?

969
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,760
Annie, you can't seduce me.

970
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,160
Sweetie, l'm not gonna
try to seduce you.

971
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,080
What's that?

972
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,720
That's my leg.

973
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,880
l know what it is.

974
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,160
l thought maybe we could work on
some fundamentals...

975
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,600
since we're not gonna make love and
improve your hand-eye coordination.

976
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,000
My hand-eye coordination?

977
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Unsnap my stocking.

978
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,680
The other day, Crash called
a woman's pu-

979
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,760
pussy-

980
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,880
You know how the hair
is kind of in a V-shape?

981
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,680
Yes, l do.

982
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,280
He called it
the Bermuda Triangle.

983
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,560
He said a man could get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

984
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,760
What a nasty thing to say.

985
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,200
He didn't mean it nasty.

986
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,560
He said getting lost and disappearing
from the face of the earth...

987
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,280
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

988
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,880
But, he also said
that there were times...

989
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,240
for discipline and self-control.

990
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,440
And l think this is
one of those times.

991
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,960
Crash is a very smart man.

992
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,360
Honey, let's give it a try.

993
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,240
Here, wait. Watch.

994
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,440
You try. Go ahead.

995
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,240
Yep.

996
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,000
You're playing with my mind.

997
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,600
l'm trying to play
with your body.

998
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,160
You're trying to seduce me.

999
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,160
Of course
l'm trying to seduce you.

1000
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,560
l'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't l pretty?

1001
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,960
God, l think you're real cute.

1002
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,560
Cute?
Baby ducks are cute.

1003
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,280
l hate cute.

1004
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,240
l wanna be exotic
and mysterious.

1005
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,880
You're exotic
and mysterious and cute.

1006
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,160
That's why l better leave.

1007
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,080
Nuke, you got it all wrong.

1008
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,680
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball.

1009
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,280
- Ask Crash.
- l did.

1010
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,840
What did he say?

1011
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,320
lf l give into you,
l'll start losing again.

1012
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,240
He did?

1013
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,680
Yeah.

1014
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,080
l'll be back when we lose.

1015
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,880
Damn it!

1016
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,080
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed.

1017
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,080
You are messin'
with my private life!

1018
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Knock-knock, you know?
Come in.

1019
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,200
- You're confusing him.
- Like, thank you.

1020
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,000
You're bending his mind
all out of shape.

1021
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,640
- l'm what?
- You're confusing him!

1022
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,000
l'm confusing him? You got him
breathing out of the wrong eyelid.

1023
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,320
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

1024
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,960
That is a religious ritual
and happens to be working.

1025
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,640
Wait a second.
Who dresses you?

1026
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,640
- What?
- Who dresses you?

1027
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,040
You think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

1028
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,880
"The road of excess leads to
the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

1029
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,080
William Blake?

1030
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,120
- What do you mean "William Blake"?
- l mean "William Blake."

1031
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,320
Who are you?

1032
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,160
Do you have a job?

1033
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,240
l teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College-

1034
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,000
English 101
and Beginning Composition.

1035
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,920
Having a conversation
with you is like-

1036
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,440
is like a martian
talking to a fungo.

1037
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,080
That's really cute.Just because
sometimes you manage to be clever...

1038
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,560
and have a nice smile,
does not mean you are not full of shit.

1039
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,600
l'm full of shit?

1040
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,040
You are full of shit.

1041
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,800
- Chastity was your idea.
- l know!

1042
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,520
- Keep your hands out of this.
- l never told him...

1043
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,440
- to stay out of your bed.
- You certainly did.

1044
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,080
l never told him
to stay out of your bed.

1045
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,520
l told him a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

1046
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,440
- Fine.
- You know why?

1047
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,000
They don't happen
very often.

1048
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,080
lf you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid...

1049
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,440
or you're not getting laid,
or you wear women's underwear...

1050
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,320
then you are,
and you should know that.

1051
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,920
Come on. Think of something
clever to say.

1052
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,760
Something full of magic
and religion bullshit.

1053
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,640
Come on. Dazzle me.

1054
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,120
l want you.

1055
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,880
What?

1056
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,680
l said, "l want you."

1057
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,600
Stop it.

1058
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,320
You're scared.

1059
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,840
Maybe l am.

1060
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,080
But l still think
you should leave.

1061
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,480
Okay. Well...

1062
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,240
this is the damnedest season
l've ever seen.

1063
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,240
The Durham Bulls can't lose,
and l can't get laid.

1064
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,080
Come on. Show 'em what you got,
Super Nuke!

1065
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,920
Show 'em there, Super Nuke!

1066
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,320
LaLoosh. L.A. Loosh!

1067
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,080
Just relax out there.
Don't aim the ball.

1068
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,920
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

1069
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,040
Anything bothering him?

1070
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,760
He says his chakras are jammed.

1071
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,040
He's having trouble breathing
out of his left eye.

1072
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,200
- Left eye?
- Right eyelid.

1073
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,360
Right eyelid.

1074
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,600
Give me the ball.

1075
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,920
Fuck!

1076
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,840
Time-out!

1077
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,240
Up to the plate,
Junior Chavley.

1078
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,680
What's wrong?

1079
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,720
l'm a little nervous.
My old man's here.

1080
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,000
Your dad's here?
Where's he at?

1081
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,600
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look.

1082
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,160
Look, he's waving,
and he's just your old man.

1083
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,000
He's as full of shit
as anybody.

1084
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,040
What's going on?

1085
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,360
You breathing through
the wrong fucking eyelid again?

1086
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,640
- Shut up.
- You hear about Jimmy and Millie?

1087
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,240
They got engaged.
Can you believe that?

1088
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,200
Yeah? Wait till l tell him she's gone
down on half the Carolina League.

1089
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,480
Anybody says anything bad
about Millie, l break his neck.

1090
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,960
Excuse me. l've got
a game to pitch here.

1091
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,680
Hey, you guys.
Don't throw me anything.

1092
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,280
My girlfriend put a curse
on my glove.

1093
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,600
l'll take the hex off.
Give me the glove.

1094
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,400
You gotta cut the head off
a live rooster.

1095
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,520
Play ball!

1096
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,560
What the hell's
going on out there?

1097
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,320
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they're gonna call roll.

1098
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,880
Get your ass out there
and check it out.

1099
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,920
You bet.

1100
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,320
Let's play some baseball!

1101
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,760
Hurry up!

1102
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,400
Excuse me. What the hell's
going on out here?

1103
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,120
Well, Nuke's scared...

1104
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,800
'cause his eyelids are jammed
and his old man's here.

1105
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,280
We need a live-
ls it a live rooster?

1106
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,680
We need a live rooster to take
the curse off Jose's glove...

1107
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,280
and nobody seems to know
what to get Millie or Jimmy...

1108
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,920
for their wedding present.

1109
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,680
That about right?
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

1110
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,920
Okay, well, candlesticks
always make a nice gift.

1111
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,040
And maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

1112
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,520
Maybe a place setting
or a silverware pattern's good.

1113
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,800
Let's get to it.
Go get 'em.

1114
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,000
Come on.
Get your ass in gear.

1115
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,320
LaLoosh looks in for the sign.
Here's the pitch.

1116
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,080
Ball hit deep in the right field,
off the wall.

1117
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,120
You should be
at the game, Annie.

1118
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,560
No, l'm fine.

1119
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,960
Beautiful night for baseball
here in Durham.

1120
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,760
And as the batter steps in-

1121
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,400
How much time did you and Jimmy
spend together...

1122
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,600
before he proposed?

1123
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,720
About five hours, l guess.

1124
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,280
We both just knew.

1125
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,280
Once again,
he goes to the resin bag.

1126
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,480
Annie...

1127
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,800
do you think l deserve
to wear white?

1128
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,560
Honey, we all deserve
to wear white.

1129
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,800
Ball two, in the dirt.

1130
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,560
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

1131
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:03,960
Bring it!

1132
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,960
Come on!

1133
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,400
He's coming. Go home!

1134
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,320
We got 'im!

1135
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,360
- Safe!
- No, l got him!

1136
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,280
- You missed him!
- l didn't miss him!

1137
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,640
- Don't bump me.
- He still hasn't touched the plate!

1138
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,520
He still ain't
touched the plate!

1139
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,960
Fuck it!
lt's a cocksucking call!

1140
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,360
Did you call me a cocksucker?

1141
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,960
l said it was a cocksucking call!
You can't throw me for that.

1142
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,080
You missed the tag!

1143
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,040
- You just spit on me!
- l did not spit on you!

1144
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,000
You're in the wrong business!
You're Sears & Roebuck material!

1145
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,520
You're pushing it, buddy!
You want me to run you out?

1146
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,280
- You want me to call you a cocksucker?
- Go ahead. Try it.

1147
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,360
Beg me!
Pretty please, beg!

1148
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,760
Call me a cocksucker,
and you're outta here!

1149
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,680
You're a cocksucker.

1150
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,200
- You're outta here!
- Shit!

1151
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,640
- What the fuck is that?
- Holy shit!

1152
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,240
He called me a cocksucker!
He missed the tag!

1153
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,640
l've never seen Crash so angry.

1154
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,840
And frankly, sports fans,
he used a certain word...

1155
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,840
that's a no-no with umpires.

1156
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,280
Crash must have called
the guy a cocksucker.

1157
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,440
God, he's so romantic.

1158
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,680
When Crash got thrown out,
the game got out of hand.

1159
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,640
Jose made three errors
with his cursed mitt...

1160
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,080
Nuke never quite got in the groove,
though he didn't pitch bad...

1161
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,640
and the winning streak
came to an end with a 3-2 loss.

1162
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,880
The good news was that a man
was about to come calling.

1163
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,440
Bad news was
it was the wrong guy.

1164
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,880
Annie.

1165
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,360
Annie.

1166
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,640
l know you're in there.
l can hear that crazy Mexican singer.

1167
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,640
We lost.

1168
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,840
lt's okay.

1169
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,160
Oh, Annie, l'd like you
to meet my father.

1170
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,480
Oh, my!

1171
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,000
Ebby's told me
a lot about you.

1172
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,200
Ebby tells me you taught him a lot
about discipline and self-control.

1173
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,800
We were worried that he might
get involved in the wrong crowd.

1174
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,000
We're so pleased
he met a Christian woman.

1175
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,440
Praise the Lord.

1176
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,800
Excuse me.

1177
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,120
Excuse me, Dad.

1178
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,400
What?

1179
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,320
- We got a lot of catching up to do.
- Your father is right there.

1180
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,240
Crash tells me l gotta quit
worrying about him...

1181
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,720
so l think it's a good opportunity
to go for a quickie.

1182
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,000
We gotta talk.

1183
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,560
Hello?

1184
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,200
Yes, he most certainly is here.

1185
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,640
lt's for you.

1186
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,320
Hey, Skip, it's me.

1187
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,960
What?

1188
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,520
My God.

1189
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,760
Okay.

1190
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,520
Yeah. All right.

1191
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,360
What?

1192
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,880
l'm going to the Show.

1193
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,280
Dad!

1194
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,240
They're sending me up to the majors.
l leave first thing in the morning.

1195
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,880
Can you believe it?

1196
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,720
Let's have a quick word
of prayer.

1197
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,240
Oh, let's not.

1198
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,840
l gotta find Crash.
Come on. l'll dump you off.

1199
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,800
Wait.

1200
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,000
Not so fast.
He'll be right with you.

1201
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,480
Come on, sweetie. l just want to
have you alone for a second...

1202
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,880
so we can say good-bye.

1203
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,400
l'll be back.

1204
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,800
When somebody leaves Durham,
they don't come back.

1205
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,440
l mean later.

1206
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,120
Oh.

1207
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, God, Annie.

1208
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,160
Jeez.

1209
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,000
What do you have in there?

1210
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,400
Nothing.

1211
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,200
You're not going to
be needing these anymore.

1212
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,040
- l'd better take them.
- No, you're ready.

1213
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,360
You think l'm ready for this?

1214
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,800
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

1215
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,080
Don't think too much.

1216
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,600
l won't.

1217
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,120
You know something, Annie.

1218
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,520
You can't breathe
through your eyelids.

1219
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,400
Of course you can't breathe
through your eyelids.

1220
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,440
Whoever told you
such a ridiculous thing?

1221
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,440
Now, get. Come on.

1222
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,280
Drive careful.

1223
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,200
Oh, my.

1224
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,280
Hey, there you are.

1225
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,960
Crash.

1226
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,920
Hey, Crash...

1227
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,080
guess what.

1228
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,320
l'm going to the Show.

1229
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,520
Big club's expanding its roster
to finish out the season.

1230
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,800
Nice shot.

1231
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,800
And l am going to the Show.

1232
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,880
So why don't you go then?

1233
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,800
Let's celebrate!

1234
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,840
Congratulations.

1235
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,400
Hope you end up on the cover
of Sports lllustrated...

1236
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,040
or maybe a cereal box.

1237
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,480
What's your problem, man?

1238
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,080
l'm trying to thank you.
Let's get out of this dump.

1239
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,800
- l'll buy you a beer.
- Hey.

1240
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,640
You callin' my place a dump?

1241
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,440
No, he's not.

1242
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,760
He's not. Are you?

1243
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,200
- No.
- He's not.

1244
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,600
All right?

1245
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,920
Do you know who this is?

1246
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,520
This is Sandy Grimes.

1247
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,760
Sandy Grimes hit 371
in Louisville in 1967.

1248
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
376.

1249
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,760
l'm sorry.
He hit 376.

1250
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,960
That's a career, man.

1251
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,920
- ln any league.
- Got that right.

1252
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,640
Did you hear what l said?
l'm going to the Show.

1253
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,040
You know what the difference
between hitting 250 and 300 is?

1254
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,200
lt's 25 hits.

1255
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,440
Twenty-five hits
in 500 at-bats is 500 points.

1256
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,600
There's six months in a season.
That's about 25 weeks.

1257
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,680
That means if you get
one extra flare a week.

1258
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,160
A gork. You get a ground ball.

1259
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,360
You get a ground ball
with eyes.

1260
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,680
You get a dying quail.

1261
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,680
Just one more dying quail a week...

1262
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,320
and you're in Yankee Stadium.

1263
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,360
You still don't know
what l'm talking about.

1264
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,280
Get the hell outta here.

1265
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,480
All right.

1266
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,120
Fuck.

1267
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,120
Send you a postcard.

1268
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,960
Send me a postcard?
Hey, l made it.

1269
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,680
You made it.
You made shit.

1270
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,600
Hey!

1271
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,000
You crazy?

1272
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,640
What the hell's
wrong with you?

1273
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,520
- l'll be all right.
- l'm talking about my mirror.

1274
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,240
Shit, l'm sorry. Hey!

1275
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,960
l'm not gonna fight you.

1276
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,080
What do you mean you're not gonna
fight me, you fuck?

1277
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,400
Why am l a fuck?

1278
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,640
Because you got talent.

1279
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,320
l got brains,
but you got talent.

1280
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,040
See this right arm?
Worth a million bucks a year.

1281
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,720
All my limbs put together
aren't worth seven cents a pound.

1282
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,640
What are you talking about?
You're a great catcher.

1283
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,520
l'm a great catcher?

1284
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,520
- Forget it.
- Hey.

1285
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,040
- Fucking forget it.
- Hey, Meat.

1286
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,760
Damn!

1287
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,520
l didn't mean to hit you.

1288
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,720
You hurt my eye!

1289
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,400
Sorry.

1290
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,240
Did you hit me with
your right or left?

1291
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,720
Did you hit me with your right hand
or with your left?

1292
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,680
My left.

1293
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,600
That's good.

1294
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,800
You get in a fight with a drunk,
you don't hit with your pitching hand.

1295
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,800
l can't keep giving you
these free lessons.

1296
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,400
Quit screwing around
and help me up.

1297
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,280
You look great, man.

1298
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,680
Be careful with those now.

1299
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,600
We got a boy going to the Show.

1300
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,920
Sorry about last night.

1301
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,360
Forget it.

1302
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,240
l have been known
on occasion to...

1303
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,040
howl at the moon.

1304
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,920
You understand?

1305
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,240
No.

1306
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,360
Well, you will.

1307
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,400
Look, Nuke...

1308
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,360
these big-league hitters are going to
light you up like a pinball machine...

1309
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,960
for a while, all right?

1310
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,800
Don't worry about it.

1311
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,520
You be cocky and arrogant,
even when you're getting beat.

1312
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,600
That's the secret.

1313
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,520
You gotta play this game
with fear and arrogance.

1314
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,880
Fear and ignorance.

1315
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:11,920
No, fear and arrogance,
you hayseed, not ignorance.

1316
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,320
l know.

1317
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,720
l just like seeing you
get all worked up.

1318
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,920
Listen.

1319
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,800
Thanks.

1320
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,440
Hey, Nuke.

1321
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,480
Good luck.

1322
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,080
You too...

1323
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,320
Meat.

1324
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,520
l now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1325
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,160
You may kiss the bride.

1326
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,200
Jimmy, we all pitched in,
and we got you a little gift.

1327
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,280
Tony.

1328
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,040
Kind of a special wedding cake
from the Durham Bulls.

1329
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,920
Oh, my Lord!

1330
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,880
Yeah, Skip?

1331
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,800
You wanted to see me?

1332
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,840
Crash, shut the door.

1333
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,800
l wanna thank everyone!

1334
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,520
Gimme a piece of that!

1335
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,280
This is the toughest job
a manager has.

1336
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,520
But...

1337
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,880
the organization
wants to make a change.

1338
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:53,720
Now that Nuke's gone, they wanna
bring up some young catcher.

1339
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,320
Some kid hitting 300
in Bluefield.

1340
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,600
He's probably a bust.

1341
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,880
l put in a word for you
with the organization.

1342
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:06,080
Told them l thought you might make
a fine minor-league manager someday.

1343
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,920
There might be an opening
at Visalia next year.

1344
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,720
You had a hell
of a year, Crash.

1345
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,400
But...

1346
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,360
you know how it is.

1347
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,160
l got released.

1348
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,760
l heard already.

1349
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,960
Oh, my.

1350
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,160
l think probably with my love
for four-legged creatures...

1351
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,920
and hooves and everything,
that in another lifetime...

1352
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,640
l was probably Catherine the Great
or Francis of Assisi.

1353
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,560
l'm not sure which one.

1354
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,400
What do you think, honey?

1355
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,720
How come in former lifetimes...

1356
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,760
everybody is somebody famous?

1357
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,920
How come nobody ever says
they were "Joe Schmoe"?

1358
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,200
Because it doesn't work
that way, you fool.

1359
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,960
God, you are gorgeous.

1360
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,400
You wanna dance?

1361
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,120
Yes.

1362
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,800
l guess you do.

1363
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,880
Crash took off at dawn.

1364
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Said he heard there might be
an opening for a catcher...

1365
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,000
in Asheville
on the South Atlantic League.

1366
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,680
A woman should be so strong
that she's not affected by such things.

1367
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,160
lt wasn't the first time
l went to bed with a guy...

1368
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,560
and woke up with a note.

1369
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,160
At least the son of a bitch
left me breakfast.

1370
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:59,680
You have to respect a ballplayer
who's trying to finish the season.

1371
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,880
At least,
that's what l told myself.

1372
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:06,000
Baseball may be a religion
full of magic cosmic truth...

1373
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,080
in the fundamental ontological
riddles of our time...

1374
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,080
but it's also a job.

1375
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,680
Come on, Meat.
Throw me that weak-ass shit.

1376
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,320
You ain't gettin'
that cheese by me.

1377
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,640
Bring it.

1378
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,920
When Crash hit his 247th home run,
l knew the moment it happened.

1379
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,640
But l'm sure nobody else did.

1380
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,000
And The Sporting News
didn't say anything about it.

1381
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,880
"Full many a flower is born
to blush unseen.

1382
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,480
And waste its sweetness
on the desert air. "

1383
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,600
Thomas Gray.

1384
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,240
Or William Cullen Bryant.

1385
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,160
l don't know.
l get 'em mixed up.

1386
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,880
Anyway, my attempts at housekeeping
were feeble as usual.

1387
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,840
l sometimes
get easily distracted.

1388
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,120
Funny thing was
l stopped worrying about Nuke.

1389
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,800
Somehow l knew
nothing would stop him.

1390
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,840
The world is made for people
who aren't cursed with self-awareness.

1391
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,800
Crash was right-
Nuke had a gift.

1392
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,720
l'm just happy to be here,
and l hope l can help the ball club.

1393
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,640
You know, l just wanna
give it my best shot...

1394
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,840
and good Lord willing,
things will work out.

1395
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,080
You gotta play them
one day at a time, though.

1396
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,000
Raye Anne, right?
That's a beautiful name.

1397
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,240
ls that Greek?
lt's a beautiful name.

1398
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,720
There's a great song by Motley Crue.
Do you know it?

1399
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,120
"Raye Anne, she's a stay in."

1400
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,240
Anyway, a good friend of mine
used to say...

1401
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,960
"This is a very simple game.

1402
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,560
You throw the ball, you catch
the ball, you hit the ball.

1403
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,720
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1404
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,680
Sometimes it rains."

1405
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,320
Think about that for a while.

1406
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,560
What happened?

1407
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,360
l quit.

1408
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,040
Hit my dinger
and l hung them up.

1409
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,600
l'm quittin' too.

1410
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,800
l mean boys,
not baseball.

1411
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:36,240
There might be an opening for
a manager in Visalia next spring.

1412
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,920
Think l could make it
to the Show as a manager?

1413
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,240
You'd be great.

1414
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:56,760
Because you understand about
nonlinear thinking.

1415
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,680
Baseball seems like a linear game
with all those lines and box scores.

1416
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,400
But the fact is, it's a spacious
non-time kind of time to it.

1417
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,640
What?

1418
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,280
l got a lot of time
to hear your theories.

1419
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,960
And l wanna hear
every damn one of them, but...

1420
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,240
now l'm tired and l don't want to
think about baseball.

1421
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,920
And l don't wanna think
about quantum physics.

1422
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,840
And l don't wanna
think about nothing.

1423
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,560
l just wanna be.

1424
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,920
l can do that too.

1425
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,440
Walt Whitman once said,
"l see great things in baseball.

1426
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,600
lt's our game.
The American game.

1427
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,840
lt will repair our losses
and be a blessing to us."

1428
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,440
You could look it up.

1429
