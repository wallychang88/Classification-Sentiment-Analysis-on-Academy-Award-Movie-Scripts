00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:02,750
<i>This is the road to town.</i>

8
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:05,714
<i>Those who leave our village,</i>

9
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,726
<i>and those who later return
to their birthplace,</i>

10
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,690
<i>walk along this road.</i>

11
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,293
<i>She's not waiting for anyone.</i>

12
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:20,099
<i>The one she used to wait for,
her son Alyosha,</i>

13
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,902
<i>did not return from the war.</i>

14
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:27,542
<i>He's buried far from his birthplace,</i>

15
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,850
<i>near a town with a foreign name.</i>

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>Strangers bring flowers to his grave.</i>

17
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:39,861
<i>They call him a Russian soldier,</i>

18
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,262
<i>a hero, a liberator.</i>

19
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:45,839
<i>But to her he was simply a son,</i>

20
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,670
<i>about whom she knew everything</i>

21
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:50,838
<i>from the day he was born</i>

22
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:56,016
<i>to the day he left
along this road for the front.</i>

23
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,183
<i>He was our friend.</i>

24
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:04,128
<i>We will tell his story,
a story not everyone knows...</i>

25
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:07,156
<i>not even her... his mother.</i>

BALLAD OF A SOLDIER

27
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,244
- That's it! Let's go!
- But what about reporting?

28
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:11,076
You want to report
from the next world? Scram!

29
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:17,453
Eagle! Eagle! I see tanks!

30
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:21,125
Eagle! Eagle! Do you read me?

31
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:26,256
Eagle! This is Finch.

32
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:29,404
This is Finch! Eagle!

33
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,101
This is Finch! Answer me!

34
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,656
Yes, this is Finch!

35
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,709
I see tanks! Four of them!

36
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,546
They're heading straight towards me.

37
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,220
There's no infantry.
I can pull back.

38
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:16,544
You don't like that, eh?

39
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:58,893
<i>- Skvortsov, report to the general.
- Skvortsov, report to the general.</i>

40
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,604
Here he is, Comrade General.

41
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:13,034
Private Skvortsov,
reporting as ordered.

42
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,689
Well, hero, come here.

43
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,807
Tell us everything that happened.

44
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,549
Were you at the observation point?
- Yes.

45
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,735
Well, what happened?

46
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,744
Comrade General, to be honest,
I was afraid!

47
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:36,708
They were so close...

48
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,356
I was scared.

49
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,754
You were so scared
that you knocked out two tanks?

50
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:43,825
Out of fright?

51
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,760
Everybody hear?
I wish everybody were so scared.

52
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,526
Wait a minute. Is it possible
that somebody else did it?

53
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:54,770
No, it was me.

54
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,639
Excellent.

55
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:01,343
I'm putting you up for a decoration.

56
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,079
Include Skvortsov on the list.
- Yes, Comrade General.

57
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,883
Please make note of this.

58
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:15,997
Comrade General,
instead of my decoration,

59
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,295
could I go home to see my mother?

60
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:29,180
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

61
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,316
When I was leaving, I didn't have time
to say good-bye to my mother.

62
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:36,286
And I just got a letter from her.
The roof is leaking.

63
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,317
Please let me go, Comrade General.

64
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,646
We'd all like to go home, Skvortsov,

65
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,861
but we can't leave the front.

66
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,440
This is war and we're all soldiers.

67
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,815
I wouldn't have asked you

68
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,642
if we weren't all taking a rest now.

69
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,925
I just need one day,
Comrade General.

70
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,997
I'll fix the roof
and come right back.

71
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,201
Well, should we let Skvortsov
go home?

72
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,768
Let him fix the roof?

73
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,523
Just make sure you're back on time!

74
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:20,728
Well, I... Comrade General...
I'll do whatever it takes!

75
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:23,034
Sit down.

76
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:26,079
You're pretty lucky, Skvortsov.

77
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:27,724
Where are you going?

78
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,489
To Georgievsk, the village of Sosnovka.

79
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:32,888
I could be there by tomorrow.
- No, my friend.

80
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:36,065
The way things are going nowadays,
a day won't be enough.

81
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:41,909
I'll give you two days to get there
and two to get back.

82
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,427
And two to fix the roof.

83
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,235
Satisfied?

84
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,158
Comrade General.

85
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,885
Can I go now?
- Go!

86
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,631
Just make sure you're back on time.
- Yes, Comrade General!

87
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,199
Fellows, give us a hand!

88
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,271
- Take care!
- Thanks, guys!

89
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,410
- Have a good trip!
- Thank you!

90
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:01,329
Hey, friend! Wait a minute!

91
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,837
Are you going on leave?
- Yes.

92
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,183
- To Georgievsk?
- Yes.

93
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,209
I'm from Uzlovaya.
We're neighbors!

94
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,781
Stop by at this address.
- I won't have enough time. I can't.

95
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:13,596
You have to change trains
at Uzlovaya anyway.

96
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:16,687
Chekhov Street.
Not far from the station.

97
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,645
Stop by, friend!
- Okay. What should I say?

98
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,675
Say that you saw me!

99
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,937
Tell Liza that her Sergei is all right,
that you saw him yourself.

100
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,347
Tell his Liza that he dreams
about her day and night.

101
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,506
Sergei, you ought to give her
some sort of present.

102
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,252
What can he give?
Everything he has is army-issue.

103
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,086
Quit talking!

104
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:43,459
Sergeant, give Sergei a cake of soap!

105
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,888
It's for his wife!

106
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,161
- His ration is only for one washing.
- Give him a whole cake.

107
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,568
I have only two cakes
for the entire platoon.

108
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,468
- Well, give him one.
- That's against regulations.

109
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:57,053
- Come on, Comrade Sergeant!
- Don't be stingy!

110
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:00,605
It's for his wife.

111
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,242
Open it.

112
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,915
She's going to be happy.

113
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,501
- Soap is now a delicacy.
- A deficit, you moron.

114
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,243
She'll be happy regardless.

115
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,660
- Let him have the second one, too!
- He's right, Sergeant!

116
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,421
Come on, Sergeant.

117
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:27,305
- Comrade Sergeant...
- Here. Take it!

118
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,050
Close it.

119
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,463
- 7 Chekhov Street.
- I'll find it.

120
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:59,963
Let me help you.

121
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,778
Where are you going?
- To Gorisov.

122
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,840
Me, too.
That's where I'm changing trains.

123
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,778
Going home?
- Yes, I've finished fighting.

124
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,301
I'm going home, too.

125
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,632
On leave. I got lucky.

126
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,801
We'll be traveling
to Gorisov together.

127
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:34,548
Thanks, friend.

128
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:38,610
- I'll help you in Gorisov, too.
- Someone will meet me there.

129
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,481
Your wife?

130
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,552
My wife.

131
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:47,824
Keep an eye on my suitcase.
I have to send a telegram.

132
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,498
What on earth are you doing?

133
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,105
The train's here.
It's about to leave.

134
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,488
- What's with you?
- What do you mean? We have to go!

135
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:58,949
I have your suitcase.
- So go by yourself.

136
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,286
- What's wrong?
- What do you want? Beat it!

137
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:13,392
Beat it? I have your suitcase.

138
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:17,528
Fine, I'm going.
- Wait a minute. Don't be angry, friend.

139
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,653
Things are hard for me.

140
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:24,708
I wrote to my wife
and told her I wouldn't be coming.

141
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,129
- Why?
- I have to.

142
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,488
Even before the war,
things weren't working out.

143
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:32,660
I was jealous of her.
And now...

144
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:34,427
Be quiet!

145
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,260
I don't want to, you understand?

146
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,009
She's young and pretty.

147
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,898
She'll find her happiness, right?

148
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,739
I don't know.

149
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,617
She will.

150
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,080
- What about you?
- What?

151
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:03,628
Where will you go now?

152
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,732
Russia is a big country.

153
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:18,791
That's despicable!

154
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,742
It's despicable to think that way!

155
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,553
She's waiting for you.
And what do you do?

156
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:27,287
You lie! It's despicable!

157
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,480
Wanna smoke?

158
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,426
Got a piece of paper for me?

159
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:31,566
- Here.
- Hey, friend, can you spare one?

160
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:35,111
Pass one over here.

161
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,730
How thin!

162
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,978
Kill the enemy. Read it
and pass it on to your comrade.

163
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,049
And how's the tobacco supply
on the front?

164
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,701
On the front? It's available.

165
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:51,956
It's available, hero!

166
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:54,128
That reminds me of the soldier

167
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,596
who asked a collective farmer
for a glass of water and said,

168
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,371
"Lady, give me something to drink.

169
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:02,002
I'm so hungry
that I don't have a place to sleep."

170
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:06,013
Exactly!
The story of your life.

171
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:11,914
A good woman.
I can't forget her.

172
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:13,960
Then why forget about her?

173
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:17,321
After the war, go and marry her.

174
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,568
You fool!
She's already got a husband.

175
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,267
- Pockmarked like you?
- No, smooth.

176
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,736
Why would she trade
a guy with smooth skin

177
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,279
for someone pockmarked like you?

178
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:35,712
How should I know?
Maybe he has some other defect!

179
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,789
- Are you accompanying your friend?
- No, I'm by myself.

180
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,596
- Are you on a mission?
- No.

181
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,000
- Being transferred?
- No again.

182
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,701
- Then what?
- Home. On leave.

183
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,506
Who do you think you're kidding?
Come on!

184
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,809
I'm telling the truth.
I knocked out two tanks!

185
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,878
You see, even a signalman...

186
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,388
A signalman. Well, that's about
average for a signalman, of course.

187
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,724
What did you knock them out with?

188
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,827
A telephone receiver.
It was double-barreled!

189
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,603
You know how it is
with these signalmen?

190
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,772
They walk around,
they see a tank.

191
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,334
First one, then another,
and then into his bag.

192
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:27,446
I'm serious! When the general
called me to the bunker...

193
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:31,320
- Soldier, enough already.
- Enough about you talking to the general!

194
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,193
Gimme this.
I'll prove it to you

195
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,527
What are you doing?

196
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,318
- Look!
- Looks like him!

197
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,668
Direct hit!

198
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,768
Why on earth did you ruin it?

199
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,516
I have a lot more just like it.

200
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:38,236
Don't think about it, son.

201
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:40,641
Everything will work out.

202
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:43,371
I can't.

203
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:46,946
I have a daughter
who just got married

204
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:49,686
and she's already a widow.

205
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,099
- You should go. Thanks.
- Yes, in a minute.

206
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:14,192
Let's go.

207
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,827
<i>Vasya!</i>

208
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:42,057
Oh, Vasya.

209
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:46,568
You're back. You're alive.

210
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,787
Well, here I am.

211
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,255
Now we're together.

212
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:26,513
I was in such a hurry.
The buses aren't running.

213
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,661
It's just a shaving.
I work at the factory now.

214
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,724
The steel coming out these days
is very hard.

215
00:25:42,426 --> 00:25:45,143
<i>So, citizen, are you going
to take this car or not?</i>

216
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,240
Yes, coming.

217
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:51,713
Vasya, this is the driver.
Where are your things?

218
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:55,989
- There it is.
- I'll get it.

219
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,752
- Where's the boy?
- What boy?

220
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:59,908
The boy. The soldier.
He accompanied me.

221
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:04,667
A hero! He knocked out two tanks!
- Let's hurry. I'm running late.

222
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,533
How unfortunate. He left.

223
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:36,473
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.

224
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:39,807
- Are we taking off now? To Georgievsk?
- Yep.

225
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,529
- Listen, friend...
- He won't allow it.

226
00:26:41,737 --> 00:26:43,243
Who won't allow it?

227
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,344
- The lieutenant.
- Do you understand what's going on?

228
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:49,824
I understand perfectly.
It's not allowed. It's strategic cargo.

229
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:52,494
- Hay is strategic cargo?
- Depends on who it's for.

230
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:55,293
- For horses. Who else?
- Depends on what kind of horses.

231
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:57,420
Fine, your hay is strategic!

232
00:26:57,611 --> 00:27:00,449
But you've got to understand.
I've come from the front.

233
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:05,101
I'm on leave. I've already used up
half a day and I only have two.

234
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,774
I understand perfectly,
but the lieutenant won't.

235
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,478
- What kind of man is he?
- Him? A beast! Got it?

236
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:24,928
Listen, let's forget
about the lieutenant.

237
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:28,469
I'll climb into the car
and he won't know anything about it.

238
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,808
As if I feel like getting
court-martialed for you.

239
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,934
Why court-martialed?

240
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,376
You set the wagon on fire,
and I get court-martialed.

241
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:39,282
- Why on earth would I set it on fire?
- How would I know?

242
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:43,448
What do you have in that bag?
Maybe something flammable?

243
00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:46,000
It's just canned beef. Look.

244
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:48,128
Canned beef?

245
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:04,944
So, you're trying to bribe a guard?

246
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:08,423
- What? Give me that!
- What's with you?

247
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:12,827
I was just kidding.
What, you can't take a joke?

248
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,930
Well, you convinced me.
Climb in.

249
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:23,108
Not a sound. Got it?

250
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:27,144
Got it.

251
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:01,761
Where are you going?

252
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:05,206
Let me go! Mama!

253
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:08,633
Let me go, you scoundrel!
Let me go!

254
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,010
What are you doing?
You're crazy!

255
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:26,954
You fool!

256
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,593
Leave me alone!
What have I ever done to you?

257
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:33,258
Don't come near me!
- Are you insane?

258
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:36,608
- If you come near me, you'll find out.
- Don't even think about it.

259
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,571
Get away from the door.

260
00:30:56,952 --> 00:30:59,800
Get away, I tell you!
- I won't.

261
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:04,146
What's with you?

262
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,410
- What's with you?
- Why do you keep screaming?

263
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,444
- Don't come near me.
- Then get away from the door.

264
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,020
I won't.

265
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:18,566
I was right. You're insane.

266
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,663
Well, to hell with you.

267
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:26,005
Go ahead and jump!
Break your neck!

268
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:30,839
Why should I?
We're stopping soon.

269
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,745
Open the door. I'm getting off.

270
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:22,281
<i>Keep away
from the military transport.</i>

271
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,371
Anyone caught
will be court-martialed.

272
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:26,663
Hey, citizen, I'm talking to you!

273
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:28,948
<i>Anyone caught will be shot!</i>

274
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,652
- There's no point in that.
- It's all your fault.

275
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,748
I threw my things out
because of you.

276
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,492
You would have killed yourself.

277
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,924
It's none of your business.
Quit pestering me.

278
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:07,319
Pestering you?

279
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,728
You jumped into the car yourself,
and I'm pestering you?

280
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,662
Then why were you hiding
in the straw?

281
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,901
- You think I was hiding from you?
- Who else?

282
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,773
From the lieutenant!

283
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:19,142
What lieutenant?

284
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:22,516
The one in charge of the transport.

285
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:25,590
He's a beast.
I snuck on the train, too.

286
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:28,159
If they catch me,
they'll make me get off.

287
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,553
I'll have to wait
for a passenger train, or even fly.

288
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:33,997
I'm scared of bigger things than you.
I thought you were the lieutenant.

289
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,402
I had a terrible fright
and got slapped in the face,

290
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:41,807
and it's all my fault.

291
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:49,117
I had everything in my bag:
my things, some bread, a skirt.

292
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,847
Everything.

293
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:52,514
It's nothing.

294
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:55,025
When you go back,
you can find your bag.

295
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:58,029
- You think so?
- Of course. Where could it go?

296
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,930
It's probably waiting for you
on a bridge somewhere right now.

297
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,846
This train just keeps
going and going.

298
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:42,116
We're pulling in.

299
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:45,823
When you get off,
go quickly so nobody sees you.

300
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:54,761
What if I can't find my bag?

301
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:03,108
You know what?
Don't get out.

302
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:06,817
I have some food

303
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:09,384
and the car is comfortable.

304
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:14,589
No, I'd better get out.

305
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,708
Any chance you'll stay?

306
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,046
No.

307
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,044
Someone's out there.

308
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,527
Yes.

309
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,110
Want a bite to eat?

310
00:36:48,323 --> 00:36:49,680
Eat?

311
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,279
No, thanks. I'm full.

312
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,546
If you want any,
you're welcome to it.

313
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,253
<i>Don't be shy.
Look at this salo.</i>

314
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,204
<i>- Salo?
- Yes. Try some.</i>

315
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:07,361
Well, maybe just a little piece.

316
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,691
Like it?

317
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,991
Dry rations.

318
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:37,369
I love the wafers too.

319
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:41,442
Remember, before the war?

320
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:44,607
- I lived in a village before the war.
- I lived in a city.

321
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,750
- Are you mad at me?
- For what?

322
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,928
Because I hit you.

323
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:22,151
It happens.
It made us friends.

324
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,232
<i>- Stepanov, do you have the tarpaulin?
- No, Gavrilkin has it.</i>

325
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,681
<i>Call Gavrilkin.</i>

326
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:29,570
<i>Gavrilkin, do you have
the tarpaulin?</i>

327
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,176
Please forgive me.
I was so foolish.

328
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:37,613
Me, too. I frightened you.

329
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:49,357
You know what?
Let's introduce ourselves.

330
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:51,862
Let's.

331
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,741
My name is Alexei.

332
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,869
And mine is Shura.

333
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:04,105
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

334
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:18,199
- Where are you going?
- Home, on leave. You?

335
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,233
<i>Hurry up, Gavrilkin!</i>

336
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,190
<i>I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.
Something's jammed.</i>

337
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,637
Hide! Hurry!

338
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,113
Here it is, Comrade Lieutenant.

339
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,379
<i>- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.</i>

340
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,935
He didn't notice us.

341
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,160
Were you scared, Shura?
- No.

342
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:25,875
- You're a scaredy-cat.
- No.

343
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,816
Shura, who are you going to see?

344
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:33,121
I'm on my way to Kupinsk.

345
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,983
To see my fiancé.

346
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:37,936
He's a pilot.
He's in the hospital.

347
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:40,829
He's very badly wounded.
Honest!

348
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:48,337
I'm getting off now.

349
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,192
Why?

350
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,519
Did I offend you?

351
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:57,420
Then why?
- Just because.

352
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,219
- You think I won't take you to your fiancé?
- I don't think anything.

353
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,391
I'm going out for water.

354
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:12,217
- Heard any news?
- Those rotting swine!

355
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:15,289
The battle for Novorossisk
is getting fierce.

356
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:27,129
We'll turn you over to the war tribunal
for sneaking on board.

357
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:29,173
Follow me.

358
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,444
Follow me, I tell you.
- I won't.

359
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:34,505
Hey, stop that.

360
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:38,445
Ah, here's her lovey-dove now.
What's going on here?

361
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:42,359
We had an agreement,
and you're sneaking civilians aboard?

362
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:44,230
What difference does it make
if it's two people instead of one?

363
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:47,306
A big difference.
Come on, citizen.

364
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:51,291
She's not going anywhere, got it?
Get out of here.

365
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:53,297
What?

366
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,903
Who are you to give orders?

367
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,755
You've got it made: hay, a girl...

368
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,504
What? Shut up.

369
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,370
You think I didn't see?
I saw everything.

370
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:07,255
- What did you see?
- The two of you, tumbling in the hay.

371
00:43:14,497 --> 00:43:16,094
Fine.

372
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:20,910
Attacking a guard while on duty.

373
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:22,668
You know what will happen?

374
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,805
- You miserable shit!
- From your point of view.

375
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:31,024
A miserable shit from your point of view.
From mine, I'm priceless.

376
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:38,367
Get the hell off this train,
both of you.

377
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:41,922
If you don't,
I have every right to shoot.

378
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:44,620
So, shoot. We're not scared.

379
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:48,940
You still haven't seen the lieutenant.
That's why you're so brave.

380
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,743
Enough. We're both a little
hot under the collar.

381
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:57,728
Let's talk it out.
- I have nothing to say to you.

382
00:43:58,057 --> 00:43:59,880
Get out of here, and take your...

383
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,891
I'll give two warning shots
and then...

384
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:04,820
You've really made yourself
at home here.

385
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:07,988
What if I give you
another can of meat?

386
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,691
How about two?

387
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:12,884
It will take much more than that
to make up for the insult.

388
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:15,132
You want me to apologize to you?

389
00:44:16,773 --> 00:44:19,479
Fine. Give me the canned meat.

390
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:34,831
What's going on here?

391
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:40,363
Comrade Lieutenant,
they snuck into the car.

392
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,072
I'm taking appropriate measures.

393
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,366
Who are they?

394
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,405
Private Skvortsov. On leave.

395
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:49,983
Where are you headed?

396
00:44:50,245 --> 00:44:52,646
To Georgievsk, Comrade Lieutenant.
Here are my papers.

397
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,362
I have only two days,
and I'm already late.

398
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:06,636
You're a hero.

399
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,903
And the girl? Is she with you?

400
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:11,665
- Yes.
- No.

401
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:16,162
She lost all of her things... money,
bread... so I had to...

402
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,077
- All right, all right.
- No, really! We...

403
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:22,154
- Just be careful with fire.
- Okay.

404
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:24,588
What's that?

405
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:30,226
Well, Comrade Lieutenant,
it's sort of canned meat.

406
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,273
Who did you take it from? From them?
Give it back immediately.

407
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:36,772
But they gave it to me voluntarily.

408
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:40,071
Voluntarily?
Two days under arrest!

409
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:41,605
- For what?
- Five days?

410
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:43,912
- But I...
- Repeat the order!

411
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:48,217
- Five days...
- How disgraceful.

412
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:57,532
I told you: He's a beast.

413
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:15,084
Now we don't have to be afraid
of any beast.

414
00:46:15,593 --> 00:46:17,221
Beast!

415
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,732
Alyosha, it's so pleasant
when you think badly of someone,

416
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,876
only to discover that he's good.

417
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:25,097
Yes, that lieutenant is a good man.

418
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,569
Very.

419
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:45,693
Do you believe in friendship?

420
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:49,431
Of course I do. On the front,
you'd be lost without it.

421
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,701
No, I know that.
I mean between a boy and a girl.

422
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:57,537
Some girls are even better
than boys.

423
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:01,877
I think so, too.

424
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:05,720
But there are some who believe
that they can only be in love.

425
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,381
Nonsense.

426
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,646
I used to be friends with a girl.

427
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,080
We were friends
and didn't think at all about love.

428
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:16,493
- Maybe you were in love and didn't notice.
- With her? No.

429
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:20,300
- Maybe she was in love with you.
- She was just a little girl.

430
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:22,899
Our neighbor Zoika.

431
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,572
No, love is something different.

432
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:40,932
Alyosha, would you like
to have a friend?

433
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,071
A true friend,
to have your whole life?

434
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,002
Me, too! Why do you think I'm traveling?
Do you think...

435
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,076
You're doing the right thing,
going to him. You're a good girl.

436
00:47:52,266 --> 00:47:54,581
- That's not the only reason.
- You're a good girl.

437
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:57,586
You're not some sort of floozy.

438
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:03,157
No, Alyosha,
you don't know anything.

439
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:14,770
You know what, Alyosha?
- What?

440
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,175
I'm so thirsty. Aren't you?

441
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:24,686
Yes.

442
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,765
- A quick stop?
- A quick stop.

443
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:03,194
<i>The evening news, July 2 7th.</i>

444
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:08,208

Stop! Stop!

455
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:52,639
Can you take me to Uzlovaya?
I missed my train.

456
00:51:00,694 --> 00:51:02,994
- Have you heard the news?
- Yes.

457
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:07,458
Damn it!

458
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:11,193
I haven't slept for two days.

459
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,904
What can you do!

460
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,578
Here, crank it.

461
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,610
What a truck.
We're the same age.

462
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:04,115
My son's on the front.
Field Post Office 1 39.

463
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:06,663
Have you heard of it?

464
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:08,963
No.

465
00:52:48,116 --> 00:52:51,128
Don't fret, little fellow.
We'll get there in time.

466
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:06,450
- Stay back, soldier!
- This is my train!

467
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,793
You're mistaken.
Where are you going?

468
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,138
- To Georgievsk.
- That train left an hour and a half ago.

469
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,141
Alyosha!

470
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:50,655
Shura!

471
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,822
- Shura, you're still here.
- Yes.

472
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:04,145
Here, you forgot this.
- Shura, you're brilliant!

473
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:08,862
- It was my fault you didn't get back.
- Silly girl! I thought I'd never see you again.

474
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,322
Well, I waited.

475
00:54:15,535 --> 00:54:16,828
I'm so thirsty.

476
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,232
- You still haven't had anything to drink?
- No, I was afraid I'd miss you.

477
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:22,462
My little Shura.

478
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:30,544
Well, let's go.

479
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:39,598
- Soon you'll be home.
- You, too.

480
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:47,639
Don't worry, Shura.
He'll get better.

481
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:53,383
Alyosha, I've never met
a fellow quite like you before.

482
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:04,322
Alyosha, who is
that handkerchief for?

483
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:08,066
It's a gift for my mother.

484
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:11,082
- Really? The soap, too?
- What soap?

485
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,577
The soap in your bag.

486
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:17,476
- Let's go.
- Where?

487
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:19,381
- I have to give it to someone.
- The soap?

488
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:24,024
Yes, I promised.
Good thing you reminded me.

489
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:26,922
It's not far... Chekhov Street.

490
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,230
Is this Pavlov a friend of yours?

491
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:01,490
No, I don't know him at all.
We met by chance.

492
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,872
He was on his way to the front.

493
00:57:06,337 --> 00:57:08,306
Chekhov Street.
- So close.

494
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:36,046
Grandma, where's building 7?

495
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,981
Right here.

496
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:47,262
Who are you looking for?
- The Pavlovs.

497
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:48,794
They're alive!

498
00:57:49,185 --> 00:57:51,902
Are you looking
for Lizaveta Petrovna or the old man?

499
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,505
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- She now lives on Semyonovskaya Street.

500
00:57:57,643 --> 00:58:00,764
And the old man is at the institute, where
the people who were bombed out live.

501
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:02,544
- Which is closer?
- Semyonovskaya Street.

502
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:05,092
Mitya will take you there.

503
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:08,588
- Grandma, look what I found!
- Good.

504
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,819
Mitya, take these people to see
Lizaveta Petrovna.

505
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:18,726
Mitya, this man is from the front.
- He's going to miss his train. Come on.

506
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:21,001
Let's go.

507
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:38,955
- Don't touch my bubbles!
- Kid, do the Pavlovs live here?

508
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:41,362
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- Over there.

509
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:59,282
You have to knock.
The bell doesn't work.

510
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,705
We're looking for Lizaveta Petrovna.

511
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:21,012
Please come in. That's me.

512
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:28,146
You must be...

513
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,943
I'm from the front.
I brought you a package.

514
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:38,651
Pavlov must have sent you.

515
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,596
Yes.

516
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:44,146
Please come in.

517
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,854
Excuse me for just a minute.
I'll be right back.

518
00:59:59,954 --> 01:00:02,195
<i>Someone's here from the front
with a package from Pavlov.</i>

519
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,894
<i>What should I do?
- Tell the truth.</i>

520
01:00:04,002 --> 01:00:05,231
<i>I can't.</i>

521
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:07,937
<i>What's the problem?
At least he'll know the truth.</i>

522
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:10,509
<i>- I beg you!
- Well, fine.</i>

523
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:15,441
Please excuse me.

524
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:18,075
It's just so unexpected.

525
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,690
So, you're from the front?

526
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:24,514
From the front.

527
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:30,129
Your husband sent me.
He asked me to give you this.

528
01:00:32,938 --> 01:00:35,203
- What is it?
- Soap.

529
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,098
Oh, soap.

530
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:39,508
Thank you.

531
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:43,141
Maybe you'd like some tea?
- No, we have to go.

532
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:46,344
- Why?
- I don't have enough time.

533
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:01,579
Tell me.

534
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:05,416
How is he?
- Pavlov?

535
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:09,157
He's fine.
He's worried about you.

536
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,446
Thank you.

537
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:22,889
Don't tell him
about what you've seen here.

538
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:28,714
Although maybe...

539
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:32,213
the truth is better.

540
01:01:33,992 --> 01:01:37,256
Don't look at me like that.
You're still young.

541
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:52,771
Who are you here to see?

542
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:55,183
- We're looking for Pavlov.
- Vasilii Yegorovich!

543
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,182
It's for me.
Sergei sent him!

544
01:02:58,535 --> 01:03:02,737
How is he?
- Don't worry, everything's fine.

545
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:05,133
Your son sent me.

546
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:08,459
Here, he sent you a little package.

547
01:03:12,546 --> 01:03:13,968
- Soap!
- He's alive?

548
01:03:14,074 --> 01:03:16,202
Of course he's alive!

549
01:03:17,279 --> 01:03:19,251
Alive.

550
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,277
This means he's alive.

551
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,217
Thank you.

552
01:03:24,738 --> 01:03:26,725
So this is a present from him.

553
01:03:27,073 --> 01:03:29,078
Grandpa, lie down.
You're not supposed to...

554
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:32,628
- Is he wounded?
- Not at all. He's perfectly healthy.

555
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:37,958
What's the matter with me?
Please sit down.

556
01:03:38,175 --> 01:03:41,326
Someone get them a little stool.

557
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:45,374
Here, sit down.
Tell me about him.

558
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:47,881
How's he doing there?

559
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:58,227
Well, he's a good fighter.

560
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,264
You could even say excellent.

561
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:06,769
Everyone respects him
for his courage.

562
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:10,009
He's a brave man.

563
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:13,470
The commander always says
we should follow Pavlov's example.

564
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,520
He's a steadfast soldier
and a true friend.

565
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:19,130
Everyone in the regiment loves him.

566
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,715
Yes, yes.

567
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:23,982
Even as a boy,
everyone loved my Sergei.

568
01:04:31,491 --> 01:04:33,982
Well, we have to go.

569
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,703
Would you like some tea?

570
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:39,645
Thanks very much.
We don't have the time.

571
01:04:41,231 --> 01:04:44,529
We have to go. - Please excuse
us, but he really has to go.

572
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,595
I understand. It's war.

573
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:50,172
Tell Sergei that I'm proud of him.

574
01:04:50,857 --> 01:04:52,621
Everything's fine.

575
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,496
But don't tell him about this.
It's all temporary.

576
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,071
Better he not worry.

577
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,526
And tell him...

578
01:05:02,784 --> 01:05:06,665
that Liza, his wife, is working.

579
01:05:09,017 --> 01:05:12,298
She sends her regards
and is waiting for him.

580
01:05:16,804 --> 01:05:18,293
I'll tell him.

581
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,895
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

582
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:26,857
Where are you going?
This is a war car.

583
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:28,274
- She's with me.
- Your wife?

584
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:29,401
- Yes.
- No.

585
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,980
Work it out first, then drag her on.

586
01:05:32,915 --> 01:05:35,315
Citizen, you're not allowed.
It's a war car.

587
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,458
Was it really so hard
for you to say yes?

588
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:45,696
Alyosha, my dear,
go on without me.

589
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,858
You've already lost half a day
because of me.

590
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:50,267
I'll be fine by myself.
It's not far from here.

591
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:52,931
Go, Alyosha, go.

592
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:55,803
- Put this on.
- Why?

593
01:05:55,962 --> 01:05:57,846
Put it on, I said!

594
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:05,397
Hold it.

595
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:22,654
Keep moving! Keep moving!

596
01:06:23,149 --> 01:06:25,050
Let's go, let's go!

597
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:33,036
- What's wrong?
- Someone stepped on my coat.

598
01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:39,182
Well, this is it, Alyosha.

599
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:42,386
Yes. Don't forget me, Shura.

600
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:48,988
Alyosha, don't be angry with me,
but I've deceived you.

601
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,819
How?

602
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,331
I don't have a fiancé.
I don't have anyone.

603
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:57,550
I'm going to my aunt's.

604
01:08:58,106 --> 01:09:00,236
Please don't be angry.

605
01:09:01,465 --> 01:09:03,305
I'm so silly, aren't I?

606
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:06,178
What did you do that for?

607
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:08,687
I was scared of you.

608
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:10,947
Are you scared now?

609
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:16,530
The train! Hurry, Alyosha, hurry!

610
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,373
Shura, wait! My address!

611
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:28,309
Write to me!
To the village of Sosnovka.

612
01:09:30,248 --> 01:09:33,444
The village of Sosnovka! Shura!

613
01:09:39,903 --> 01:09:41,951
I can't hear you!

614
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:04,802
When I told you
I didn't have anyone else,

615
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,606
I was admitting that I love you.

616
01:12:09,976 --> 01:12:12,745
Why didn't you say anything?

617
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:17,641
You don't love me.

618
01:12:33,743 --> 01:12:35,377
Wait, Shura.

619
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,774
I have something to tell you.

620
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,010
Let me through.

621
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:44,422
Let me off this train.

622
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:23,897
Are you traveling far, comrade?

623
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:31,246
To Sosnovka, just over the bridge.
It's about another 10 kilometers.

624
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:33,081
We're from the Ukraine.

625
01:13:33,194 --> 01:13:37,521
We fly like birds in autumn,
not knowing where we're going.

626
01:13:38,151 --> 01:13:40,055
Empty words.

627
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:43,827
We're going to the Urals.
Our factory is there. Our sons are there.

628
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,391
Is that thunder?

629
01:14:14,497 --> 01:14:17,440
- Going home?
- Yes.

630
01:14:17,813 --> 01:14:19,304
For long?

631
01:14:19,592 --> 01:14:22,934
There was more time, but now it's just
for a night. My leave ends at dawn.

632
01:14:23,169 --> 01:14:25,287
How awful.

633
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:30,753
A whole night at home...
you're very lucky!

634
01:14:33,082 --> 01:14:35,023
Do you have a girlfriend?

635
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:36,893
Yes.

636
01:14:37,118 --> 01:14:39,663
Only she's not in Sosnovka.
I lost her.

637
01:15:15,756 --> 01:15:18,216
Save the children! The children!

638
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,478
Step aside, soldier.

639
01:17:15,313 --> 01:17:18,361
- Get out of the way.
- Good-for-nothing.

640
01:17:27,082 --> 01:17:29,243
<i>Comrades, I already told you:</i>

641
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:33,311
We're only taking
wounded women and children.

642
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:38,282
Everyone else will have
to stay behind and wait.

643
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:41,894
A train will be here
in exactly two hours.

644
01:17:42,275 --> 01:17:45,299
Yes, Grandma, in two hours.

645
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:49,101
Two hours!

646
01:18:35,426 --> 01:18:37,346
Have you lost your head?
Are you tired of living?

647
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,967
Friend! Take me to Sosnovka!

648
01:18:39,158 --> 01:18:41,450
- I can't.
- It's only 10 kilometers.

649
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:42,908
I told you, I can't.

650
01:18:43,108 --> 01:18:45,805
I've come from the front to see my mother.
I'll hug her and go right back.

651
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:48,213
And I should go to the slammer
because of you? Get off!

652
01:18:48,364 --> 01:18:51,480
To hell with you! You pig!

653
01:20:03,335 --> 01:20:06,165
Girls, that was Katerina's boy,
Alyosha!

654
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:09,443
- Katerina's in the fields.
- Go get her... quickly!

655
01:21:05,722 --> 01:21:07,457
You're back, Alexei Nikolaevich.

656
01:21:07,615 --> 01:21:09,049
Zoika.

657
01:21:10,019 --> 01:21:11,594
I didn't recognize you.

658
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:16,098
Do you know where my mother is?
- In the fields.

659
01:21:16,382 --> 01:21:18,637
Have a seat and rest.

660
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:20,731
Have a bit of tea
until Aunt Katya gets here.

661
01:21:20,879 --> 01:21:23,926
I can't. I have to go now.
A car is waiting for me.

662
01:21:24,655 --> 01:21:26,305
- Now?
- Now. Right this minute.

663
01:21:26,643 --> 01:21:28,509
But what about Aunt Katya?

664
01:21:46,673 --> 01:21:49,354
- She's not here. Let's go to the fields.
- They'll send me to jail!

665
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:51,710
- It's on the way.
- It's right nearby.

666
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:54,780
They're gonna get me
for this anyway. Let's go!

667
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:46,365
Alyosha!

668
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:34,568
You've come back, my son.
You've made your mother happy.

669
01:23:34,672 --> 01:23:36,513
I've been waiting,
thinking about everything...

670
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:39,741
- How are you, Mama?
- Like everyone else.

671
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,978
I'm going through the war.
Work is hard.

672
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:44,350
There are no men... all women.

673
01:23:44,455 --> 01:23:46,856
My dear, you've come back.

674
01:23:47,026 --> 01:23:49,461
Alyosha, have you seen Ivan?

675
01:23:49,563 --> 01:23:55,196
- When is the war going to end?
- Leave him alone. He just got back.

676
01:23:55,632 --> 01:23:59,173
Let's go, Alyosha.
You can have a bite to eat and rest.

677
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:03,578
- Wait, Mama. I'm in a rush.
- Where are you rushing to?

678
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:07,276
I have to travel on.
I'm just stopping by for a minute.

679
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:10,878
What do you mean, son?

680
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,944
- I don't understand.
- I have to go. Right now.

681
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:23,302
Let's just talk for a moment.

682
01:25:02,376 --> 01:25:04,222
I wanted to fix the roof.

683
01:25:04,495 --> 01:25:07,602
You've grown. You're so thin.

684
01:25:07,698 --> 01:25:09,596
It's just from the trip.

685
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,562
You're not sick, are you, Mama?

686
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:14,500
I don't have time to be sick.

687
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:18,274
Are you shaving already?

688
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,171
Do you smoke?

689
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:32,787
I have to go.

690
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:35,862
I won't let you!

691
01:25:54,951 --> 01:25:57,920
- Forgive me, Mama.
- For what, Alyosha?

692
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:01,021
Forgive me, Mama.

693
01:26:01,314 --> 01:26:03,561
What's wrong, Alyosha?

694
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:09,501
I'll survive. I'll get by.
I'll wait for you to come home.

695
01:26:12,729 --> 01:26:15,805
I didn't wait for your father,
but I'll wait for you.

696
01:26:19,587 --> 01:26:23,380
Alyosha! Have you seen Ivan
on the front?

697
01:26:23,528 --> 01:26:26,756
When is the war going to end?

698
01:26:54,404 --> 01:26:57,398
I'll be back, Mama!

699
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:34,000
<i>That's all we have to tell you
about our friend Alyosha Skvortsov.</i>

700
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:38,281
<i>He could have become
a remarkable man.</i>

701
01:27:38,397 --> 01:27:42,480
<i>He could have become a builder
or beautified the land with gardens.</i>

702
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:48,326
<i>He was, and in our memory
will forever remain, a soldier...</i>

703
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:51,362
<i>a Russian soldier.</i>

704
