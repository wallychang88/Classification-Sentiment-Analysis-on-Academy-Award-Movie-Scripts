1
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,890
Keep it rolling, we'll just
get, like, a bonus one of these.

2
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,172
Could somebody wipe him down?
He's sweating a little bit.

3
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,049
Eyes on the prize 2,
march 3rd, 1989...

4
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,352
Bill O'Neal interview.

5
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,726
Looking back on your
activities in the late '60s, early '70s,

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,566
what would you tell your son
about what you did then?

7
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,488
Look at them
flames lightin' up the sky

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,162
ain't never seen fire
shootin' up so high

9
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,573
look at them
flames lightin' up the sky

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,792
look at them flames
lighting up the sky

11
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,453
I ain't never seen fire
shooting up so high

12
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,422
are you listenin' people
to what I'm sayin'?

13
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,585
'Cause it sure looks to me
like them niggas ain't playin'

14
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,739
them niggas ain't playin'

15
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,991
them niggas ain't playin'

16
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,335
them niggas ain't playin'

17
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,718
people are rebelling
because of conditions,

18
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,473
and not because of individuals.

19
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,147
No individual creates a rebellion.
It's created out of the conditions.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:54,278
Revolution is the only solution

21
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,529
revolution is the only solution

22
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:05,118
- revolution is the only solution
- Revolution

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,912
okay. Who is this?

24
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,077
Huey p. Newton.

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,253
And where is huey?

26
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,539
In jail.

27
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,404
The first thing that
the black panther party did, of course,

28
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,589
in Oakland, was fo set up
an armed patrol

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,090
in order to ensure

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,639
that black people were not harassed
and intimidated

31
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,808
by the local police department.

32
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,726
And if the police
arrested the individual,

33
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,055
we'd follow him to the jall
and bail the individual out,

34
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,643
whether he was a panther or not.

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,171
Panthers are the vanguard, man.

36
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,436
We're talking about tearing shit down
from the bottom,

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,850
startin' at the bottom, goin' up.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,569
A non-capitalistic state.
That's what we're talkin' about.

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,197
Yeah, we armed.
We a armed propaganda union,

40
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,121
but we spend most of our time
working with these programs

41
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,448
serving the people.

42
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,417
Free medical clinic,
free breakfast children program,

43
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,211
the inter-communal institute
in liberation schools,

44
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,880
free legal aid,
education for the community.

45
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,503
The black panthers

46
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,961
are the single greatest
threat to our national security.

47
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,219
More than the Chinese.
Even more than the Russians.

48
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:08,682
Our counter-intelligence program
must prevent the rise of a black Messiah

49
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,057
from among their midst.

50
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,857
One with a potential
to unite the communist,

51
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,311
the anti-war,
and the new left movements.

52
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,175
We don't fight fire with fire,
we fight fire with water.

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,029
This man.

54
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,969
You don't fight racism with racism.
We gonna fight with solidarity.

55
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,529
Fredrick Allen Hampton.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,740
We ain't gonna fight capitalism
with black capitalism,

57
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,871
we gonna fight capitalism
with socialism.

58
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,248
Fuckin' crowns. Of course.

59
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,838
All right, playtime's over,
all right?

60
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,193
Everybody grab a fucking wall.

61
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,521
What the hell is this?
I just paid O'Mally last week.

62
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,783
You hear me?

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,241
Do I look like some
two-bit shakedown artist to you?

64
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,410
What the fuck does this say?
The initials.

65
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,824
FBI?

66
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,621
FBI, that's right, big guy.

67
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,994
Hey, where you going?
Come back here, clown.

68
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,955
Everybody, hands on the fucking table.

69
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,910
Come here!

70
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,483
Man, we in here mindin'
our own business.

71
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,827
We ain't doin' nothin' to nobody.

72
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,339
Yeah, yeah, yeah, spread 'em open.

73
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,290
Fuck off me, pig.

74
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,385
What you got in there?

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,531
Don't y'all motherfuckers ain't got shit
to do tonight?

76
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,408
Oh, you just minding your
fucking business, huh?

77
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,432
What's this?

78
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,136
What's that? Fuckin' idiot.

79
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,331
I swear to god, ain't no pig worse
than a nigga with a badge.

80
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,458
- Little Pontiac, huh?
- All right, time out.

81
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,001
All right, big man,
you goin' downtown.

82
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,105
What? Yep.

83
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,524
That gto out there,

84
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,418
- the red one, that belong to you?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,924
Well, it was reported stolen
two months ago.

86
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,675
- Let's go, let's go. Yep. Yep, yep.
- Hell, no! That's my car!

87
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,563
Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,094
- Let me go.
- Be easy, be easy, all right?

89
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,948
I got the papers on it and everything.

90
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,900
You're under arrest
for Grand Theft Auto.

91
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,556
- I didn't do nothin'!
- Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge.

92
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,351
Say, man, what the fuck is the FBI doing
lookin' for a stolen car, huh?

93
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,956
Y'all ran out of niggas to assassinate?

94
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,293
- Motherfucker.
- Shit!

95
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,707
Hey, hey, hey, tough guy. No wise eye.

96
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,005
You be easy, right? No funny eye.

97
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,427
He ain't nothin' but a kid.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,340
You ain't no fucking cop, nigga.

99
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,762
Stay the fuck back!

100
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,017
Get him!

101
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,550
- Get out the car!
- Fall back!

102
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,535
Oh, shit!

103
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,741
Get your ass out here!

104
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,431
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

105
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,036
Get that out of my fucking chest! Shit!

106
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,499
Ahh!

107
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,869
Get the fuck off my shit!

108
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,337
Fuck off this shit!

109
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,335
Punk motherfucker!

110
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,153
Special agent Mitchell, FBI.

111
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,032
Almost as spiffy as yours.

112
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,676
Now, tell me, why the badge?

113
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,808
Why not just use a knife or a gun
like a normal car thief?

114
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,857
A badge is scarier than a gun.

115
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,575
Would you mind explaining that for me?

116
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,994
Any nigga on the streets
can get a gun, sir.

117
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,254
A badge is like you got
the whole damn army behind you.

118
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,752
I better hold on to this, then.

119
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,264
Were you upset
when Dr. king was murdered?

120
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,734
What?

121
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,397
Were you upset
when Dr. king was murdered?

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,325
I don't know.

123
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,495
You can be honest.

124
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,118
Well, I was a little bit, yeah.

125
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,704
And what about Malcolm X?

126
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,959
I ain't ever thought about all that.

127
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,342
You just never thought about it?

128
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,264
No.

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,473
You're looking at 18 months
for the stolen car

130
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,269
and five years
for impersonating a federal officer.

131
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,485
Or you can go home.

132
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,774
That reflected the population
and the culture

133
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,130
of the 80% black student body.

134
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,511
So they're bringing in Dr. Charles hurst
from Howard university to be president.

135
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,632
And they're gonna call it
Malcolm X college from now on.

136
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,514
It's in this spirit of activism,

137
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,601
and on behalf of the
Wright junior college of black caucus,

138
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,401
I am proud to introduce

139
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,028
deputy chairman Fred Hampton
of the Illinois black panther party.

140
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,728
I don't need no mic. Can y'all hear me?

141
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,582
Yeah!

142
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,669
Right on.

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,091
Malcolm X college, I can dig it.

144
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,299
Dr. Charles hurst, direct from Howard.
Right on.

145
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,105
So, what?

146
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,932
You think the students over there
gonna be free now?

147
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,734
Oh, they'll let you change the name
of your college, or your own name,

148
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,942
throw on a dashiki. 'Cause guess what?

149
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,489
They still gonna drag
your black ass to vietham

150
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,866
to shoot a poor rice farmer
or get shot your damn self.

151
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,957
That's the difference between revolution

152
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,078
and the candy-coated facade
of gradual reform.

153
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,955
Reform is just the masters
teaching the slaves

154
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,335
how to be better slaves.

155
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,134
Under reform, you could take
the motherfucking masters out,

156
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,303
and the slaves still be doin'
all the work for 'em.

157
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,716
There's a man called a capitalist.

158
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,350
Don't matter what color he is,
black, white, brown, red, don't matter.

159
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,020
Because the capitalist has one goal.

160
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,022
And that is to exploit the people.

161
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,320
He can have on a three-piece suit
or a dashiki,

162
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,821
'cause political power doesn't flow
from the sleeve of a dashiki.

163
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,699
Political power flows
from the barrel of a gun.

164
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,685
We in the black panther party
don't believe in no culture

165
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,074
except revolutionary culture.

166
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,496
What we mean by that is a culture
that will free youl!

167
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,627
Don't give me no five-and-dime costume
of a medicine man or a witch doctor

168
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,125
or whatever you think
the motherland look like.

169
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,806
Give me the righteous threads
of a Mozambican frelimo fighter.

170
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,976
Give me... give me a ak-47,

171
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,559
or some bandoliers
like they got in Angola!

172
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,397
Give me some Colt .45s for the folks
that are trying to free themselves!

173
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,706
Brother.

174
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,603
A dashiki ain't gonna help you

175
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,227
when they come up
in here with them tanks

176
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,626
like they did in Henry horner.

177
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,079
You need tools, brother.

178
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,165
We got the tools at 75th and Madison.

179
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,020
Can you spare
a little change, brother?

180
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,508
Hi.

181
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,269
Evenin'

182
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,847
thought your speech
was really interesting.

183
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,982
Well, thank you, sister.

184
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,152
Do you like poetry?

185
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,117
I mean, it's cool,
but as Che Guevara said...

186
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,994
"Words are beautiful,
but action is supreme," you dig?

187
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,495
I dig. Right on.

188
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:40,124
But you were up on that stage
using words, so...

189
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,801
Maybe next time,
choose 'em a bit more carefully,

190
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,880
instead of tearin' down the folk
who you call yourself recruitin',

191
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,925
just because they demonstrate
a little black pride.

192
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,772
But just so you know, you are a poet.

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,816
Somebody define war for me.

194
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,900
War is a violent conflict
between two or more parties.

195
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,241
Would you say we at war
with the pigs, comrade Palmer?

196
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,137
Chairman, I'd take it
a step further and say

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,106
that every ghetto across the nation
should be considered occupied territory.

198
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,165
Right on.

199
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,125
Well, how about politics?

200
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,462
How would you define politics,
brother winters?

201
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,297
Uh...

202
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,753
You know, elections.

203
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,223
Elections can be part
of politics, certainly.

204
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,393
But we in the party

205
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,356
ascribe to chairman mao's definition
of politics.

206
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,647
He said, "war is politics
with bloodshed,

207
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,933
"and politics is war without bloodshed."

208
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,897
Say it with me, y'all.

209
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,107
"War is politics with bloodshed.

210
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,238
"Politics is war without bloodshed."

211
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,070
Now, what that mean?

212
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,740
It mean every time the pigs shoot down

213
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,696
an unarmed brother
or sister in the street,

214
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,740
mayor daley pulled the trigger.

215
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,163
It mean tricky dicky Nixon

216
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,745
is the fattest,
most filthy pig in the pen.

217
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,337
So, how we win this war?

218
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,177
What's our most lethal weapon?

219
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,889
Guns? Grenades?

220
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,883
Rocket launchers?

221
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,431
These niggas got rocket launchers?

222
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,390
There's strength in numbers.

223
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,233
Power anywhere there's people.

224
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,153
And in order to overthrow this racist,

225
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,456
fascist, nefarious U.S. government,
it's gonna take everybody.

226
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,896
Black panther paper!
Free your mind for just a quarter.

227
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,080
Sorry, I'm on my way to work.

228
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,540
Well, I'm at work, sister.
I work for you.

229
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,206
Information is raw material
for new ideas.

230
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,459
Oh, you got kids?

231
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,797
Your friends got kids? Yeah.

232
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,300
Well, we got a breakfast program
feedin' 300 kids a week.

233
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,285
Because we've grown so accustomed
to being poor,

234
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,595
we think it's normal for our kids
to go to school hungry.

235
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,519
We think it's normal for us
to go to the hospital with a runny nose

236
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,437
and come home in a body bag.

237
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,141
So, our job as the black panther party

238
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,852
is to heighten the contradictions.

239
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,965
I pledge allegiance...

240
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,320
I pledge allegiance...

241
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,568
To my black people.

242
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,027
To my black people.

243
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,450
I pledge to develop...

244
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,034
I pledge to develop...

245
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,517
My mind and body
to the greatest extent possible.

246
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,874
My mind and body
to the greatest extent possible.

247
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,451
I will learn all that I can...

248
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,161
I will learn all that I can...

249
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,026
In order to give my best to my people
in the struggle for liberation.

250
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,257
In order to give my best
to my people

251
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,709
in the struggle for liberation.

252
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,638
So, the people can decide
if they wanna overthrow the government

253
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,138
or not.

254
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,499
These two people are waiting to see you
from vista.

255
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,888
Also, brother cohran called.

256
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,628
He wanted to know if you willing
to speak at a fundraiser at the theater,

257
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,688
and somebody named Stanley uhuru

258
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,153
said he wanted to speak to you
about a credit union.

259
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,158
What's that?

260
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,240
EKG machine.

261
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,401
For the clinic,
when we get it up and running.

262
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,531
Mm-hmm.

263
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,501
The poet. What a pleasant surprise.

264
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,921
I saw your ad in the paper
lookin' for a new speechwriter.

265
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,676
I figured I'd better come lend a hand.

266
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,327
Well, that must have been a misprint.

267
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,118
See, I don't write speeches, sister.

268
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,599
I just get up on stage and speak truth
to the people.

269
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,387
Oh, it shows.
The lack of preparation, that is.

270
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,434
It got you here.

271
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:30,028
"We want land, bread, housing,
education, clothing...

272
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,655
"Justice, and peace."

273
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,945
"Housing, justice, peace."

274
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,327
Life, Liberty, happiness.

275
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,851
I mean, it's all right there
in the declaration of independence.

276
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,116
But when poor people demand it,
it's a contradiction.

277
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,706
It's not democracy, it's socialism, dig?

278
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,399
We can do something after this,
if you want to.

279
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,833
O'Neal, stand up.

280
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,434
What is the party line
in regards to our sisters, comrade?

281
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,316
Um...

282
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,570
Anybody?

283
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,369
"Do not take liberties
with women."

284
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,169
Oh, come on now.
I ain't takin' no goddamn...

285
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,487
These aren't just your sisters.
They're your sisters-in-arms.

286
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,075
Act like it.

287
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,498
Twenty push-ups for discipline.

288
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,629
Captain harmon...

289
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,294
Count 'em out.

290
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,543
What's wrong, O'Neal?

291
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,928
Down to the ground!

292
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,261
You scared of a little dirt?

293
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,264
I could have a sister
put a towel down for ya.

294
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,274
You ain't tell me
it was gonna be like this.

295
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,001
These motherfuckers ain't no terrorists.

296
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,560
Shit, they terrorizing me.

297
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,323
What can I do to help?

298
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:10,370
The goal is to get close to Hampton.
So, think.

299
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,876
What does he need

300
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:18,128
that maybe your uncle Sam
might be able to help you provide?

301
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,015
A car.

302
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,064
Fred don't drive no more.
'Cause the pigs always...

303
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,275
Shit, the police.

304
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,981
No, that's good.

305
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,987
You're becoming a panther.

306
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,483
The pigs are always
followin' him around,

307
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,661
givin' him bullshit traffic violations,
right? So,

308
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,789
if you want me to get close to Fred,

309
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,200
give me a car.

310
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,717
Jimmy, come on, man.

311
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,469
Say, chairman,
that wasn't no goddamn pig

312
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,016
you was eatin' out there, was it?

313
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,432
Somebody gotta show the pig
who's boss, man.

314
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,522
All right, y'all ready to split?

315
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,318
Y'all got weapons? Give 'em here.

316
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,954
Now, Judy,
you is out of your rabbit-ass mind

317
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,962
if you don't get
your motherfuckin' boot off my shit.

318
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,044
Shit.

319
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,674
Yo, winters,
how many pistols you got, man?

320
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,933
What about you?

321
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,312
Mine's in the glove box.
Motherfucker.

322
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,651
In case we gotta haul ass outta there.

323
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,718
Chairman,
that's the crowns' pool hall.

324
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,074
Exactly. Stay sharp.

325
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,659
Hey, chairman, what are we doin' here?

326
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,164
Getting the crowns' attention.

327
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,083
Evenin', brothers and sisters.

328
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,975
I wanted to hip y'all to a new
free breakfast program

329
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,939
opening on the south side next week.

330
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,113
Free for the babies.

331
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,759
All you gotta do
is drop your little ones off

332
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,614
and we'll take care of the rest.

333
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,114
Stop on by to Saint Andrew's
and check us out.

334
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,142
And if you're on the West Side
or you got family on the West Side,

335
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,623
we at the better boys club,
Monday through Friday.

336
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,001
The Illinois black panther party
has a mandate

337
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,170
to feed every hungry kid in Chicago.

338
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,695
I'm not talkin' about handing out
turkeys on Thanksgiving, that's charity.

339
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,459
Save that for the pushers
and the preachers

340
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,341
who call themselves doin' you a favor
after they done sucked you dry.

341
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,467
Fuck charity.

342
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,428
The black panther party believes
in progression.

343
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,101
Now, what that mean?

344
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,100
That mean, first,
you have free breakfast,

345
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,856
then you have free healthcare,

346
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,064
then you have free education.

347
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,926
Next thing you know, you look up,
you done freed your motherfuckin' self!

348
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,236
Know where you at, motherfucker?

349
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,033
This is crowns territory.

350
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,032
We don't want no trouble, brother.
We just passin' through.

351
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,701
Besides, the rap we on
is a political one.

352
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,756
- It shouldn't really concern y'all.
- Nigga, don't lecture me on politics.

353
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,670
The crowns protected Martin Luther King
when he was here in 1966.

354
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,961
And he got his head split open.

355
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,242
Damn near killed by a mob of crackers
throwin' Irish confetti.

356
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,176
Bang-up job y'all did.

357
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,973
Hey, hey, hey! Get the fuck back!

358
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,429
Get the fuck back, nigga! Back up!

359
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,477
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

360
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,434
No need for that, brother.

361
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,690
We on our way.

362
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,604
But dig, I got a message
for the big man.

363
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,486
Tell him the panthers wanna sit down
with the crowns.

364
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,860
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

365
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,574
You sure you wanna go sit down
with the crowns, chairman?

366
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,929
Hell, yeah.

367
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,678
Imagine the panthers,
the stones, the crowns,

368
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,185
and the disciples fighting
under one revolutionary army.

369
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,346
Them pigs ain't ready for that.

370
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,685
Shit.

371
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,566
I'll tell y'all one thing.

372
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,194
I'm bringin' my motherfuckin' pistols
to that goddamn meeting.

373
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,781
And you hear me, chairman? Shit.

374
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,282
Maybe one of yours, too, nigga.

375
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,990
All you need is a pool stick,
ain't that right, O'Neal?

376
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,202
You see him swinging
that thing around?

377
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,536
Hey, don't you underestimate my skill,
god damn it! None of y'all!

378
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,631
You got heart, bill.

379
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,751
You wild, but you got heart.

380
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,125
Wild bill.

381
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,636
Wild bill! Wow! Wild bill!

382
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,343
Man, tell me they ain't call you that
in maywood!

383
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,808
Nah, man,
they ain't call me nothing.

384
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,062
Nah?

385
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,582
Shit, I mighta heard it once or twice.

386
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,597
See, I knew it! I knew it! Wild bill!

387
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,981
Yeah!

388
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,379
God damn it, harmon,
you and these goddamn cognomen.

389
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,768
- Oh, man...
- Wild bill!

390
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,188
Pool stick to a gun fight, man.

391
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,917
Wild bill.

392
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,682
Come on in,
make yourself at home in the den.

393
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,557
This is Samantha.

394
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,734
What made you think
you could trust Roy Mitchell?

395
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,567
Uh, I'd rode around in his car.

396
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,574
I had dinner with him
at his dinner table.

397
00:24:56,078 --> 00:25:00,822
Um... you know, he was, at one point,
for me, he was like a role model.

398
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,456
When I didn't have one, you know?
We had very few role models back then.

399
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,417
We had Martin Luther King, Malcolm X,

400
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,540
Muhammad Ali.

401
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,467
I had an FBI agent.

402
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,304
You know, I investigated the schwerner,
chaney, Goodman murders

403
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,387
down in Mississippi in '64.

404
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,188
You familiar?

405
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,819
Well...

406
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,649
A couple kids was trying

407
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,777
to register negroes to vote.
That's all they were doing.

408
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,861
They got arrested
on bogus speeding charges

409
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,536
by the sheriff's deputy,

410
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,122
who hand-delivered them to the klan.

411
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,628
And they shot 'em, of course.

412
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,002
Cut off chaney's penis.

413
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,138
This,

414
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,801
what you and I are doing, is...

415
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,975
What?

416
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,551
Is the other side of that coin.

417
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,145
Don't let Hampton fool you.

418
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,112
The panthers and the klan
are one and the same.

419
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,740
Their aim is to sow hatred

420
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,993
and inspire terror.

421
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,491
Plain and simple.

422
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,201
Now, I'm all for civil rights,

423
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,461
but you can't cheat your way
to equality.

424
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,754
And you certainly
can't shoot your way to it.

425
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,512
Yep.

426
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,773
Anyway, I'm going to go
get those dogs going.

427
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,858
No, no, sit down. You're a guest.

428
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,070
Uh, if you want a taste
of the good stuff,

429
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,074
there's a bottle of scotch
in this bottom cabinet there.

430
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,950
You can help yourself.

431
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,203
Hey, how much money you make, man?

432
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,629
It's a... it's a living.

433
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,459
So, if I... say, I get you,
like, some good information.

434
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,968
Somethin' nobody else knows.

435
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,712
Is there some kind
of bonus or somethin'?

436
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,766
Well, I'm counting on it, bill.

437
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,856
But, to answer your question,
you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

438
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,610
Make yourself at home.

439
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,950
Did he say when this meeting's
taking place?

440
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,613
No, just that Hampton wants
to unify the black gangs.

441
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,079
You know, he'd probably help us
write the darn thing

442
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,834
for a couple more bucks.

443
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,037
What fun would that be?

444
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,095
What the fuck do you know?

445
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,349
I know I've definitely heard 'em
say "dig in" before.

446
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,055
Oh, really? Yeah.

447
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,719
Use it in a sentence.

448
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,108
Oh. Okay.

449
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,355
These crowns, well, they ain't nothin',

450
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,784
but a bunch of jive sissies.

451
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,827
Deputy chairman Fred Hampton
of the Illinois black panther party.

452
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,125
Fred Hampton,

453
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,044
the great orator of the West Side!

454
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,008
Your name's been ringing out, blood.

455
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,919
It's your world, brother steel.

456
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,050
Hmm.

457
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,679
So, what can I do for you?

458
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,889
Well, I wanna know
what we can do for each other.

459
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,042
Y'all was doin' some great work

460
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,806
mobilizing young brothers
on the south side,

461
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,768
and we a part of a national organization

462
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,264
dedicated to the liberation
for oppressed people everywhere.

463
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,314
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

464
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,194
This nigga got some
million-dollar words, don't he?

465
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,699
They wasn't lyin'.

466
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,991
It's not just talk, brother.

467
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,455
Our breakfast program feeds
over 3,000 kids a week.

468
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:03,587
Motherfucker, the crowns feed
more babies than general mills.

469
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,780
Now, who you think employs
all their mommies and daddies?

470
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,841
Well, right on, brother, right on.
But question is, can you do even more?

471
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
Hmm?

472
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,848
There's over 5,000 crowns in Chicago.

473
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,807
Between your manpower
and the panther's political platform,

474
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,476
we can heal this whole city.

475
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,687
And if we take care of Chicago,

476
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,867
shit.

477
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,367
Come on, man.

478
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,622
You mind if I read you something,
brother Hampton?

479
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,871
Somebody dumped a whole bunch
of these pamphlets

480
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,957
on our front yard the other day,

481
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,755
and I just thought they might be
of interest to you.

482
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,924
- Do you mind if I...
- Go ahead.

483
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,261
"Word on the street

484
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,924
"is that the crowns got more rats
than a cheese factory.

485
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,136
"Where you think
they get all their money from?

486
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,272
"The pigs run their whole operation.

487
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,729
"Well, lemme tell you what, chump.

488
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,192
"When you lie with pigs,
you don't just get flies,

489
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,359
"you get panthers,

490
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,532
"itching

491
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:16,247
"to blow your big, uncle Tom,
watermelon-head off.

492
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,080
"Because what's a rat
to a big, black jungle cat?"

493
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:22,999
Get your ass out here!

494
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,442
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

495
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,752
"When the panthers are done
with the crowns..."

496
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,005
Shit.

497
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,013
"They won't have a watermelon-head
left to wear a crown on.

498
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,594
"Dig in?"

499
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,388
"Dig in?"

500
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,931
That you? This your work?

501
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,641
- Brother, come on...
- Dick Tracy!

502
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,466
I see you traded in your badge for...

503
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,147
Nigga, you know not to speak outta turn.

504
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,319
It's that motherfucker

505
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,130
- that stole ant's car.
- Shut up!

506
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,655
Apologize.

507
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,825
Sorry. Speak up.

508
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Sorry!

509
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,548
If that was us murder mouthin',
where our guns at, huh?

510
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,217
We came to y'all headquarters unarmed.

511
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,310
So, who do you think wrote it, then?

512
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,477
The pigs, who else?

513
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,479
The pigs don't write, blood.

514
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,225
The feds do.

515
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,316
They pulled the same shit
on Martin and Malcolm.

516
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,442
Mm-hmm.

517
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,573
And what happened to them?

518
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,445
Same shit that's gonna happen
to all of us.

519
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,819
At least they died for the people.

520
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,572
We should be so lucky.

521
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,063
You gonna need this.

522
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,863
Tread lightly, blood.

523
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,804
Hey, chairman. Chairman.
Let me take that off your hands.

524
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,480
Maybe the disciples
will be more receptive.

525
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,859
You can bet the disciples
got one of them fed letters, too.

526
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,106
The pigs got ahead of us.

527
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,373
Ah. So, what, you ridin' with me?

528
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,709
You got your piece on you, comrade?

529
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,049
Yeah, it's in the glove box.

530
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,627
Why? What's up?

531
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,618
Come on, Judy. You know what...

532
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,666
What was all that shit about a badge?

533
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,588
Badge?

534
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,826
Man, what the fuck is your... ow!

535
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,919
All right, all right, all right!

536
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,175
Calm down! Calm the fuck down!

537
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,303
Can I talk to her? Can I talk to her?

538
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,344
All right.

539
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,640
Y'all ain't gonna believe me, all right?
But I used to...

540
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,794
I used to pretend I was a fed
back when I used to boost cars...

541
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,683
Shh. “When I used to boost cars.

542
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,193
What kinda fucking sense does that make?

543
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,112
A pig boosting cars.

544
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,192
Now, what I would do is I would pretend.
I show 'em a fake badge, right?

545
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,736
And then I say
your car is reported stolen.

546
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,413
And then I'd hop in it,
and I'd just ride. Just go.

547
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,771
Before anybody knew the difference,
I was in the wind, dig what I'm sayin'?

548
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,315
You would be surprised
what they believe.

549
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,659
You put on one of them coats
and the Humphrey bogart hat...

550
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,001
You steal this car?

551
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,583
Yeah, no. Yeah, from a pimp.

552
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,502
And a pimp believed you were a fed?

553
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,170
Okay, so, I...

554
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,597
What kinda amateur-hour macks
you be knowin' out here, man?

555
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,220
I hot-wired this shit, all right?

556
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,562
All right?

557
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,722
- Do it again.
- What?

558
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,603
You say you hot-wired this shit,

559
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,184
so do it again.

560
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,027
Okay, look, look, uh...

561
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,218
I ain't got no goddamn tools on me
right now to do it right this second.

562
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,732
Comrade, reach in my boot.

563
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,948
Oh, come on now, y'all.

564
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,167
All right,
give me the motherfucker, man.

565
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,418
Shit.

566
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,198
All right, give me a second.
Give me a second.

567
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,974
Shit.

568
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,595
Come on, come on, come on...

569
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,410
Come on, baby.

570
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,041
Are you happy?

571
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,954
How did you get keys to a hot car?

572
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,591
Now, you think in your mind,
I'm gonna pick up a stone fox

573
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,134
in this bad motherfucker right here,

574
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,712
and start it up with a goddamn
screwdriver in the ignition?

575
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,428
I had my boy replace the lock,
motherfucker. Come on, man.

576
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,225
God dawg, man.

577
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,056
Can you get
that motherfucker off me now?

578
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,106
Shit.

579
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,229
Wild bill.

580
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,387
They don't
attack me because I'm a Muslim.

581
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,821
They attack me 'cause I'm black.

582
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,991
They attacked all of us
for the same reason.

583
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,953
All of us catch hell
from the same enemy.

584
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,021
- We're all in the same bag...
- In the same bag.

585
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,785
- In the same boat.
- In the same boat.

586
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,612
- Economic exploitation...
- Economic exploitation.

587
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,843
- And social degradation.
- And social degradation.

588
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,534
- All of 'em from the same enemy.
- All of 'em from the same enemy.

589
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,536
- The government has failed us.
- The government has failed us.

590
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,246
- You can't deny that.
- You can't deny that.

591
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,683
Any time you're living
in the 20th century, 1964,

592
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,644
and you walking around here
singing "we shall overcome,"

593
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,378
- the government has failed you.
- The government has failed you.

594
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,569
Keep going.

595
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,276
Mm-mm.

596
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,537
Well, do you know his speech
the black revolution?

597
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,133
"Sometimes,
when a person's house is on fire...

598
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,809
"And the person to whom
the house belongs to is asleep...

599
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,434
"If someone comes in yelling 'fire, '

600
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,898
"instead of the person to whom
the house belongs to being thankful...

601
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,927
"They make the mistake of charging
the one who awakened them

602
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,441
"with having set the fire.

603
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,777
- "I hope that..."
- "I hope that

604
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,456
"this little conversation tonight
about the black revolution

605
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,662
"won't cause many of you

606
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,954
- "to accuse us of igniting it..."
- "Igniting it..."

607
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,735
- "...when you find it at your doorstep."
- "...When you find it at your doorstep."

608
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,965
Well, you gotta do the voice.

609
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,655
"When you find it at your doorstep.”

610
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,679
Mm-hmm.

611
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,220
I listen to him every morning.

612
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,183
I feel like he never lets folks
put words in his mouth,

613
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,470
and no matter what,
he doesn't get flustered or angry.

614
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,273
I'd like to be like that someday.

615
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,651
Right on.

616
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,326
Anyway, I didn't mean to interrupt.

617
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,379
You want some coffee?

618
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,758
Sure.

619
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,883
How you take it?

620
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,005
Black, and sweet.

621
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,016
What?

622
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,767
I did not expect you to be shy.

623
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,098
Oh, I'm not shy.

624
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,858
Okay.

625
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,988
We ain't talkin' about some
hippies playing bongos in the park.

626
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,315
These the same motherfuckers
hit Dr. king with a brick.

627
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,239
I don't know how I feel about
goin' up in there without my pistol.

628
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,323
Right on.

629
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,991
Best you stay behind, then.

630
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,539
Displace maybe two,
three times as many of us.

631
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,123
Well, they might think it's easy
to throw out the white trash,

632
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,051
but they better fuckin' burn it!

633
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,056
Whoo.

634
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,301
You're Fred Hampton.

635
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,642
You must be the preacherman.

636
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,060
Well, I'm a fan of y'all's paper.

637
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,361
Funnies, especially.

638
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,488
That flag is some
motherfuckin' bullshit.

639
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,579
Comrade.

640
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,240
Take it easy, comrade.

641
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,655
It's just up there to remind us
of our Southern heritage.

642
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,325
When I look at that,
I don't see no flag hanging.

643
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,960
I see my uncle hanging from a tree.

644
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,901
And a bunch of white devils like y'all
smiling around his body.

645
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,525
Who the fuck
you think you're talkin' to?

646
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,654
Hey, cool it, cool it!

647
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,158
- You're in our house.
- Hey, cool it!

648
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,138
Look, we oppressed your people
for a long time...

649
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,262
I didn't oppress shit.
And my folks grew up poor.

650
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,097
They were sharecroppers.

651
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,312
Aka the overseer.

652
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,281
What if the overseer
had banded with the slaves

653
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,599
and cut the master's throat?

654
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,936
What then, comrade?

655
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,067
We might not be
in this funky-ass ghetto right now.

656
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,908
I'm not talking about the West Side
or the south side.

657
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,206
I'm talkin' this filthy-ass motherfucker
right here.

658
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,127
Shit.

659
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,336
We almost got into it with a rat
over a parking space.

660
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,297
I bet y'all babies gettin' the same
bullshit education.

661
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,049
Y'all payin' the same taxes

662
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,132
to get your heads whooped in
by the same motherfuckin' pigs.

663
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,767
Ain't that a trip?

664
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,186
We pay them, huh?

665
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,307
We pay the pigs
to run us off of our corners.

666
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,609
Let me ask y'all somethin'.

667
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,698
If this building caught fire right now,
what would y'all worry about?

668
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,243
Water and escape.

669
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,450
If somebody were to ask you,

670
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,142
"what's your culture
during this fire, brother?"

671
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,997
"Water, that's my culture.”

672
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,206
"Well, how about your politics?"
"Water and escape."

673
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,795
Well, guess what,
America is on fire right now,

674
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,594
and until that fire is extinguished,

675
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,298
don't nothin' else mean a goddamn thing.

676
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,156
So, rednecks and puerto ricans.

677
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,901
In Chicago.

678
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,074
That motherfucker Fred,
he could sell salt to a slug.

679
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,431
Nice work, bill.

680
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,877
Chicago's the most segregated city
in americal

681
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,091
not shreveport!

682
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,002
Not Birmingham!

683
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,463
But we here to change that.

684
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,640
The black panthers, the young lords,
and the young patriots

685
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,725
are forming a rainbow coalition

686
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,726
of oppressed brothers and sisters
of every color!

687
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,440
Cha cha, tell 'em
why we gathered here today.

688
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,444
Last week,

689
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,698
our brother, Manuel ramos,

690
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,657
was shot in the head
and killed by an off-duty pig.

691
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,123
So, we caught the pig
and turned him over to his fellow pigs.

692
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,377
And for some reason,

693
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,678
we expected justice.

694
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,845
Well, let's see what they do,
now that we're in front of the pigpen,

695
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,682
and we demand
an independent investigation!

696
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,355
No more pigs in our community!

697
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,465
Off the pigs!

698
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,229
No more pigs in our community!

699
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,154
Off the pigs!

700
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,986
No more pigs in our community!

701
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:46,907
Off the pigs!

702
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,739
No more pigs in our community!

703
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,659
Off the pigs!

704
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,570
No more pigs in our community!

705
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,622
Uh, your feet cold.

706
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,246
Why your feet so cold?

707
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,082
No! Get 'em off of me!

708
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,379
My feet cold, your feet cold.

709
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,422
No, unless you... they're like...

710
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,735
But that's socialism, man.

711
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,961
Well, you gotta warm 'em up, though.

712
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,020
Well, how you think
mao did the long march, huh?

713
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,288
The Chinese would warm
these feet left and right.

714
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,143
You saying
I'm a foot capitalist?

715
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,889
You really gonna call me
a foot capitalist, chairman?

716
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,601
So, summer of '69,

717
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,445
the rainbow coalition is in full swing.

718
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,149
Fred's influence is growing.
What happens next?

719
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,276
I want him off the street.

720
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,811
Charge him with something. Anything.

721
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,701
But get his black ass off the street.

722
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,353
Y'all don't see there's
kids in here? Huh?

723
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,355
Of course, you're gonna wait
till you get to a free breakfast program

724
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,539
to pull somethin' like this!

725
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,336
- Bunch of cowards!
- Deborah...

726
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,667
- Tighten up.
- You disgust...

727
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,082
- Come on, now.
- You disgust me!

728
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,339
Show some discipline.
Tell rush to get me a lawyer.

729
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,907
What was he arrested for?

730
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,637
Don't worry, y'all, I'll be right back.

731
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:51,725
Ice cream.

732
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,762
Yeah, he was accused of taking

733
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,810
7/0-something dollars' worth
of ice cream.

734
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,944
And I think he got two fo five for that,
if I'm not mistaken.

735
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,986
And how did Fred
going to prison affect the party?

736
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,031
How didn't it? You know,
membership decreased.

737
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,829
Donations started dwindling.

738
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,788
Because I was so good
at installing alarms,

739
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,165
you know, buzzers and things like that,

740
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,164
rush decided to promote me
to security captain.

741
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,969
Whoa!

742
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,551
Damn it, man!
What the fuck are you doin'?

743
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:34,761
We got a visitor.

744
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,721
Brother on the run from the pigs.

745
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,722
Can't be too careful.

746
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,553
All right, all right, god damn it.

747
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:40,972
Put that shit down.

748
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,232
Shit, man.

749
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,563
Got to watch that shit, man.

750
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,150
Who's that?

751
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,241
Security captain bill O'Neal,
motherfucker. Who are you?

752
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,408
I'm George sams.

753
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,945
Security captain
for the new haven chapter.

754
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,707
Pardon the paranoia.

755
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,115
Hey, we got a rat, man.

756
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,453
What?

757
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,334
They smoked one out.

758
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,086
- In new haven.
- How? How?

759
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,123
They put a squeeze on that motherfucker,
that's how, nigga.

760
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,757
Now, I didn't say that.

761
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,923
I said the brother got some discipline

762
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,672
in the area of the nose and the mouth.

763
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,094
And then, the brother started to show
some cowardly tendencies, so,

764
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:24,315
boiled some water,
gave him a little more discipline.

765
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,071
We held a trial first.

766
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,899
Well, shit, where he at now?

767
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,697
He's at the bottom of the river
with the rest of the trash.

768
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,953
Shit, nigga,
what you think he did?

769
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,578
Shit, I would have killed
that motherfucker, too.

770
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,984
Killed him dead. I'd have beat the shit
out that nigga, too,

771
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,214
before I...

772
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,462
I would have shot that nigga,
stabbed his ass, or...

773
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,253
Man, y'all lucky I wasn't there.
I would...

774
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,214
Boy...

775
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,885
Motherfucker, please.

776
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,579
All right, player,
all right, all right.

777
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,968
Bitch motherfucker.

778
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,405
- Does anybody else know about me?
- No.

779
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,410
- Huh?
- No.

780
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,411
From the bureau?

781
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,948
No. No, my superiors know

782
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,722
- I have a man on the inside, but...
- Huh?

783
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,330
My superiors know I have a man
on the inside, but that's it.

784
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,372
No one knows your identity.

785
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,295
Are you sure?

786
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,507
I swear on my kids, okay?

787
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,513
What has got you all spooked?

788
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,174
Oh, man, it...

789
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,437
Okay, this panther from new haven
came down, you know, and, uh...

790
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,460
And he talkin'
about they caught an informant,

791
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,817
and they tortured him,
and they killed him, Roy, all right?

792
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,945
Who did?

793
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,238
His name is George sams.

794
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,153
George sams.

795
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:01,075
And who's the fella they killed,
this informant?

796
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,988
His name is Alex rackley.

797
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,700
It's a guy outta New York.
I don't know, I ain't never met him.

798
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,118
But, shit, Roy...

799
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,957
Where is sams hiding now?

800
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,421
He's hidin' at the office
for now.

801
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:15,426
He say he's gonna skip town
and, you know, get outta here.

802
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,300
With this intel,
I can get authorization for a raid.

803
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:24,639
What?

804
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,625
- Don't worry, bill.
- What the fuck are you talking...

805
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,127
I will give you a heads-up,
so you can make yourself scarce, okay?

806
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,233
Roy, are you fuckin' listenin' to me
right now?

807
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,982
They poured boiling water all over
this motherfucker, you hear me?

808
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,280
Yes, I understand. I'm not surprised.

809
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,528
What did I tell you?
No different from the klan.

810
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,994
Now you see.

811
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,079
Look, now, y'all gonna have to come up
off some serious fuckin' dough

812
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,705
for this, all right?

813
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,633
I will make sure
you're properly compensated.

814
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,865
Discipline in the area of the nose...

815
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,889
Yeah?

816
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,516
Sir.

817
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:06,184
A panther on the run from Connecticut
is hiding out here in Chicago.

818
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,223
Says he was part of a group
that killed another panther.

819
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,853
An informant.

820
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,027
George sams.

821
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,523
Warrant's being written up as we speak.

822
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,688
We're going in on Wednesday.

823
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:19,701
How'd you know?

824
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,448
Sams is one of our guys.
Warrant's just a pretense.

825
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,581
So, sams is the informant?

826
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,908
Mm-hmm.

827
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,666
So, he didn't really kill, uh...

828
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,507
Alex rackley?

829
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,425
No, he did.

830
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,012
Well, he claims two other guys
were the triggermen,

831
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,714
but what's he gonna say?

832
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,182
Forgive me, I'm confused.

833
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,525
So, this kid, Alex rackley,

834
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,523
was labelled an informant
and then killed...

835
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,691
Mm-hmm.

836
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,273
Pby an actual FBI informant.

837
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,115
And we're just letting him walk
for murder?

838
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,370
It's beautiful.

839
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,453
He's on the lam, right?

840
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,711
So, any time he goes
into a panther office,

841
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,338
we get a warrant
for harboring a fugitive.

842
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,801
He's in the interview room right now
with our liaison guys,

843
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,174
planning the next stop
on his little tour.

844
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,433
Wow. That's, uh...

845
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,893
Takes a thief
to catch a thief, Roy.

846
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,895
We got a snitch.

847
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,424
What the fuck is you talkin' about?

848
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,688
How the fuck did the pigs know
sams was even here?

849
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,696
Y'all ever think about that? Huh?

850
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,222
That motherfucker
run his mouth so much,

851
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,390
he probably outed his damn self.

852
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,575
No, nigga.
Because they took the donor rolls,

853
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,459
you understand what I'm saying?
They went straight for the safe.

854
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,232
Then, they went straight
into the weapons cabinet,

855
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,212
which is right
in the fuckin' slop closet.

856
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,861
It's like they knew
where everything was.

857
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,525
- Hey, smarten up, brother.
- What?

858
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,365
You're fallin'
right into the pigs' trap.

859
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,269
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man?

860
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,510
You know, Jimmy,
maybe you a goddamn pig.

861
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,037
- You ever think about that?
- What? Man, fuck you, nigga!

862
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,427
Hey! Hey! Hey! Cool it!

863
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,605
You ever do that shit again,
motherfucker...

864
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,810
Both of y'all, show some discipline!

865
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,688
- Are you okay?
- There's a goddamn rat in here, Bobby!

866
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,644
And when I find him,
I'm gonna smoke him out.

867
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,801
You motherfuckers hear me?
I'm gonna smoke him out.

868
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,565
You thought new haven was bad?

869
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,743
You keep fuckin' with me!

870
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:26,846
- You keep fuckin' with me!
- Cool it!

871
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,870
Cool it, O'Neal!

872
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,529
God damn it!

873
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,018
Dear comrade Deborah,

874
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,106
I dreamt of you the other night,

875
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,023
and for a second, I thought I was home.

876
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,302
Pardon the delay in writing you. I am...

877
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,234
Co!

878
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,819
- It was not by choice.
- Col

879
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,578
the pigs do everything in their power
to keep us isolated.

880
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,087
Because they know,
the day we get organized,

881
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,789
it's over for their asses.

882
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,925
Not having books, I find myself
playing old speeches in my head,

883
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,515
and I keep comin' back to this line
from Dr. king...

884
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,431
“Let us not wallow
in the valley of despair,”

885
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,563
because make no mistake, comrade,

886
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,566
this is the fuckin' valley.

887
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,561
But where some see despair,

888
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,526
I see ground zero for the revolution.

889
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,032
Two thousand brothers
who know who the enemy is.

890
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,492
Who don't need the contradiction
to be heightened.

891
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,202
Because in menard,

892
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,080
the contradictions don't get
more black and white.

893
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,006
I mean, a lot of these brothers
came here politicized, too.

894
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,341
They just need organizing.

895
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:08,840
By the time I'm through,

896
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,047
I might fuck around
and have the pigs reading fanon.

897
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,855
I have so many questions
about how you doing,

898
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,728
about how the party's doing.

899
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,110
But ain't no way you're gettin'
a kite to me in this hellhole.

900
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,480
God forbid, one of the party members
gets sent over,

901
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,566
they could let me know
how y'all are farin'.

902
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,244
But I'd rather be left in the dark.

903
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,864
The last thing I want
is y'all up in here with me,

904
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:38,918
or worse.

905
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,044
Tell the comrades to be careful.

906
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,684
Especially when they out
patrollin' the pigs.

907
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,552
A brother who just got in here told me
they been vampin' extra heavy

908
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,178
since the summer started.

909
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,930
Y'all stay safe.

910
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:02,226
In revolutionary love, chairman Fred.

911
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:07,228
Officers! Now, what crime
have these brothers perpetrated?

912
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,317
Get the fuck outta here.

913
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,523
No, see, I live here.

914
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,533
Now, y'all get the fuck up outta here.

915
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,537
Shit.

916
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,421
- Jake.
- Hey, reg.

917
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,716
The fuck you doin' up in here?

918
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,768
I sure as shit know
a squirrel like you ain't got the clap.

919
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,063
Nah, man. My comrade, Palmer,
got shot by the pigs.

920
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,731
I'm lookin' in on him.

921
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,059
All right, brother. Be careful.

922
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,823
No visitors allowed.

923
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,368
Yeah, but the nurse told me
visiting hours are till 10:00 P.M.

924
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,366
Not for your pal here.

925
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,202
Can I at least leave him the books?

926
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,707
You may not.

927
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,846
"If we must die,
let us not be like hogs."

928
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:17,798
Come on.

929
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,533
"Hunted and penned
in an inglorious spot."

930
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,039
Do us both a favor and get lost.

931
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,770
"While around us
bark the mad and hungry dogs,

932
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,431
"making their mock at..."
Winters?

933
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,599
Jimmy! Hey, how you holdin' up, man?

934
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,810
You got five seconds to fuck off.

935
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,604
- One. Two. Three.
- Shit.

936
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,699
All right, that's it.

937
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:35,993
All right.

938
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,204
Hey, I'MMA get with you, Jimmy.

939
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,690
Hey, Williams,
is that Harriet tubman?

940
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,000
You made it out. You're good.

941
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,502
Oh, I'm sorry. It's aunt jemima.

942
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,213
I love the pancakes, miss.

943
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,302
What's up, guys?

944
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,676
I just want you all to know

945
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,011
you can thank the black panther party

946
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:05,016
for the increased police presence
in your neighborhood.

947
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,185
A glorious group of cop-killers.

948
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,393
I'm about to fuckin' move in over here.

949
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,696
I'm about to get my fuckin' couch,
a fuckin' television set.

950
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,364
- Is the back clear?
- Clear.

951
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,388
- You got a whistle?
- Fuck it, bring the kids.

952
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,139
Escort comrade Deborah
out the back to the safe house.

953
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,243
What? Why?

954
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,825
I'll take Deborah. Come on, babe.

955
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,143
You don't even know where it is.

956
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,282
I ain't goin' nowhere.

957
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,105
I don't know
about you, but I believe

958
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,915
they wake up
at fucking 7:00 A.M.

959
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,794
I can protect myself.

960
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,000
I know you can.

961
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,299
But you don't got just yourself
to think about anymore.

962
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,342
I didn't wanna have to say it
like this, but I...

963
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,390
I recognize what you're going through,

964
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,602
with the chairman being locked up
and everything, and I just...

965
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,443
Does he know?

966
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,032
Deb, I...

967
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,972
Now, Judy,
you know this ain't nothin'

968
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,256
they probably gonna leave here,
go get some donuts or some shit.

969
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,253
Maybe.

970
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,947
I'll tell you what they definitely
not gonna do, though,

971
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,051
and that's come up in here.

972
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,883
Not again. White, you guard the rear.

973
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,218
Hey, panthers!

974
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,678
If you really give a fuck
about these people out here,

975
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,180
you'll come down.

976
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,720
You little motherfuckers think
it's cool to shoot a cop?

977
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,230
Make sure she gets home safe.

978
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,602
Today's the day.

979
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,692
Today's the fuckin' day!

980
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,488
Either you fucks come down
or we're comin' up!

981
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,615
Gun!

982
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,121
10-1, we need backup.
Black panther headquarters.

983
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,246
Hey, kid, clear the fuckin' sidewalks!

984
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,793
Move! Kid! Kid!

985
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,082
Who's got the room?

986
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,442
Get off the fuckin' sidewalk!

987
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,568
I got the shooter!

988
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,192
- What the fuck you doin'?
- I'MMA cover you from the roof.

989
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,864
- O'Neal, where are you going?
- Trust me,

990
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,848
it'll make better sense
when they call for backup,

991
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,471
and they're goin' to call for backup.

992
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,222
- Hey.
- What's up?

993
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,836
I'MMA go secure the roof, all right?

994
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,191
- Right on.
- All right.

995
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,362
Fuck.

996
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,577
Fuck.

997
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,723
Watch your backs!

998
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,849
Look at that window!

999
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,113
Hold your positions!

1000
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,061
Do you guys see
any other weapons besides those?

1001
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,085
Is there any visuals?

1002
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,257
Sniper!

1003
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,550
God...

1004
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,038
I hate you! You swine!

1005
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,251
Keep 'em back!

1006
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,429
White! You okay?

1007
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,440
Fuck, I'm out!

1008
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,136
Stop shootin'! We comin' out!

1009
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,990
Comin' out!

1010
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,992
We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1011
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,996
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1012
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,957
God damn it! God damn it, cease fire!

1013
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,504
Come out with your hands up!

1014
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,285
Comin' out! We're comin' out!
Don't shoot!

1015
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,345
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,642
Drop your weapon!

1017
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,849
- Move in! Move in!
- Motherfucker!

1018
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,025
- No!
- Let her go!

1019
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,232
That's a woman, man!

1020
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,280
What the fuck happened?

1021
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:24,480
What you doing?

1022
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,898
Get 'em in the fuckin' wagon!

1023
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,430
Get in the building.
I need to blow the building!

1024
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,160
I need explosives inside the building!

1025
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,239
Keep 'em back! Keep 'em back!

1026
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,672
Let 'em go! Let 'em go!

1027
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,213
They're gonna burn it down.
They're gonna burn it down!

1028
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,380
Nol get off of me! No!

1029
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,766
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1030
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,047
It's over.

1031
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,000
Mitchell.

1032
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,957
Hey, listen, I'm out, Roy.
I'm out!

1033
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,463
Calm down. Calm down, bill.

1034
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,624
Don't you tell me
to fuckin' calm down, all right?

1035
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,959
I was almost killed, man!

1036
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:12,137
Now, Fred's in jail, I did the damn job,
and I'm out!

1037
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,510
No, that's not how it works.

1038
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,370
What the fuck do you mean,
"that's not how it works"?

1039
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,496
Why don't you give me one good reason

1040
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,320
why I don't just book it
outta here right now?

1041
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,432
Because...

1042
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,273
Because, as I've mentioned,

1043
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,351
it's a year and a half
for the stolen car,

1044
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,270
and five years
for impersonating a federal officer.

1045
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,736
And if you run, I will hunt you down,
you understand...

1046
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,696
Man, shut the fuck up!

1047
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,031
Fuck!

1048
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,125
- What do we need?
- What do you mean?

1049
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,002
You the handyman. Oakland says
rebuild immediately. What do we need?

1050
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,588
We need a goddamn white flag, Bobby!
You don't see this shit?

1051
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,587
- Don't you understand this shit is...
- God damn!

1052
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,549
They burnt the shit
out this motherfucker.

1053
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,742
You're goddamn right, they did.

1054
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,966
Watch your mouth, man!

1055
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,763
Y'all need help?

1056
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,428
Yeah, little brother.

1057
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,098
Um, go on down to the store
and get us a couple of trash cans.

1058
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,479
That's how you rebuild, comrade.

1059
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,531
Hey! Hey! Can I help y'all?

1060
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,456
We came to ask y'all that.

1061
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,079
Got some bodies if you need 'em.

1062
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,085
Look, I know y'all got an army
and all that,

1063
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,838
but figured y'all could use
some reserves.

1064
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,959
Oh, right on.

1065
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,782
Y'all know how to use a tape measure?

1066
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,922
'Cause this needs measurin'
right here, all right?

1067
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,349
And then that drywall right there
needs to be measured out and flushed,

1068
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,768
you know, how I got it here.

1069
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,083
And the rest of y'all can grab
some of these paint rollers,

1070
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,768
and help 'em with that wall.

1071
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,811
Yeah, right there is good.

1072
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:58,410
Los Angeles leaders
bunchy Carter and John huggins.

1073
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,705
Well, former leaders.

1074
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,706
Chalk marks, all that's left.

1075
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,254
Our friend, Mr. cleaver,

1076
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,716
on the lam in Algeria.

1077
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,299
A gift from our friends at Langley.

1078
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,220
Hmm. Oh.

1079
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,926
Look who's here.
Our old friend, Bobby seale.

1080
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,765
You recognize this
from the evening news, all bundled up.

1081
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,064
It must be very cold
in that Chicago courtroom.

1082
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,567
Speaking of seale,

1083
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,612
if the seale verdict
does not fall our way,

1084
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:38,650
we have a witness who'll testify
he ordered a hit in Connecticut.

1085
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,411
I believe you're familiar
with George sams, agent Mitchell?

1086
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,667
Yes, sir.

1087
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,458
Very well.
Have a seat, gentlemen.

1088
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,520
How are the boys, Jack and Tyler?

1089
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,098
Good, sir.

1090
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,944
Thank you. Uh...

1091
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,857
Tyler just started little league.

1092
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,989
Kid's got quite an arm on him.

1093
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,871
And your daughter, Samantha,

1094
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:29,417
she must be, what,
eight months now, is it?

1095
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,297
That's right.

1096
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:41,301
She's growing fast every day.

1097
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,222
They always do, don't they?

1098
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,383
Tell me...

1099
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,643
What will you do
when she brings home a negro?

1100
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,355
When she brings home a negro?

1101
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,239
Your daughter, Samantha.

1102
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:05,157
What will you do the day
she brings home a young negro male?

1103
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,830
She's an infant, sir.

1104
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,377
I'm well aware.

1105
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,924
And that's not an answer to my question.

1106
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,728
She won't.

1107
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,771
Why not?

1108
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,901
Because...

1109
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:51,538
Respectfully, director,
why are we talking about my daughter?

1110
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,455
You killed in Korea.

1111
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,546
Yes.

1112
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,420
Not for country.

1113
01:08:57,342 --> 01:09:01,381
Maybe that's why you enlisted.
But you killed for survival.

1114
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,336
You would have done anything

1115
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,007
to get back home safe
to your family, wouldn't you?

1116
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,016
Of course.

1117
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,309
Think of your family now,
agent Mitchell.

1118
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,692
When you look at Hampton,
think of Samantha,

1119
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,738
because that's what's at stake
if we lose this war.

1120
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,778
Our entire way of life.

1121
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,073
Rape, pillage, conquer.

1122
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,244
You follow me?

1123
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,869
I do, sir.

1124
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,342
- Hampton's in menard doing two to five.
- Hampton is getting out,

1125
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,419
while the state supreme court
considers his appeal.

1126
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:44,676
In the interim,

1127
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,555
your cl is our best chance

1128
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,304
at neutralizing him, agent Mitchell.

1129
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:56,644
Maybe it's time to use O'Neal
more creatively.

1130
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,527
You look beautiful, you know that?

1131
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,320
- You know that?
- Mm-hmm_

1132
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,131
Whoo!

1133
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:05,882
Now, y'all save that shit

1134
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,770
for when you get back
to the house, all right?

1135
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,843
Careful, now.

1136
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,561
Whew!

1137
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,396
You look good, chairman!

1138
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,644
How ya feelin'?

1139
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,980
I miss y'all motherfuckers, man!

1140
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,482
Come on, man!

1141
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,176
Yeah, so where you wanna go? You hungry?
What? What do you want?

1142
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,735
Headquarters.

1143
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:35,909
Mm-hmm.

1144
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,032
Shit, headquarters it is, boy.

1145
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,979
How'd y'all...

1146
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,981
But it was burned down. I saw...

1147
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,916
Then the whole
neighborhood came out.

1148
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,616
The pushers, the grannies,
the crowns. Everybody.

1149
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,194
'Specially this one right here.

1150
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,725
- He practically led the charge.
- Come on, now, man.

1151
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,786
Don't be modest, brother.
You almost lived here.

1152
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,807
Power.

1153
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,469
Anywhere there's people,

1154
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,935
there's power.

1155
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,939
Right on.

1156
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,442
Thank you, brother.

1157
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,043
Chairman!

1158
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,711
On!

1159
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,084
I was wondering
why it was so quiet, man.

1160
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,210
I was like,

1161
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,404
"these motherfuckers
better be out here

1162
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,488
"feedin' these babies overtime

1163
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,031
if they're not gonna welcome
a brother home, god damn it!"

1164
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,261
Come on, man!

1165
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,721
You made it.

1166
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,852
Oh, man,
I missed y'all motherfuckers, man.

1167
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,580
- We missed you, too, man!
- Oh, my god.

1168
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,640
You know I missed you, too, man!

1169
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,931
Yeah, brother. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1170
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,337
All right, let me outta here!
Let me outta here! Let me outta here!

1171
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,241
You the man.
You stay in here and man up!

1172
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,219
Black panther party headquarters.

1173
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,358
All that complainin'...

1174
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,416
Right on,
how's it going, brother?

1175
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,589
Rush?

1176
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,663
I feel your pain, sister.

1177
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,257
But we at war, you know?

1178
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,001
He's gone.

1179
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,234
- Excuse me, sister.
- All right.

1180
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,261
What's up?

1181
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,311
Jimmy Palmer died.

1182
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:10,814
What? How?

1183
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,966
Can we talk about this outside,
Fred, please?

1184
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,217
He was shot while you were gone.

1185
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,219
Comrade, why is this the first
I'm hearin' about this, man?

1186
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,243
Who was shot?

1187
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,281
Jimmy Palmer.

1188
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,988
Yeah, he's fine. Y'all know that.

1189
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,664
He died, Jake.

1190
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:25,794
Last night.

1191
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:26,962
Nah, that's impossible.

1192
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,114
I just talked to him the other day.

1193
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,049
- Anybody got the number for loretto...
- He was moved to the county hospital.

1194
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,511
Get this fuckin'...

1195
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,714
Get this shit off of me.
Hey, motherfuck...

1196
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,473
They killed him.

1197
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,634
They fuckin' killed him.

1198
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,975
Jake.

1199
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,402
Jake.

1200
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,062
Jake!

1201
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,990
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1202
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,623
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!
Chairman Fred!

1203
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,332
I'm free.

1204
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,080
I'm free, y'all!

1205
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,212
I need everybody
to repeat after me! I am...

1206
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,390
I am...

1207
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,431
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1208
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,133
- I am...
- I am...

1209
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,081
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1210
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,561
- I am...
- Lam...

1211
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,209
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1212
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,643
- I am...
- Lam...

1213
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,418
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1214
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,935
- I am...
- Lam...

1215
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,713
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1216
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,946
- I am...
- Lam...

1217
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,758
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1218
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,268
Drummer,
lemme hear the people beat!

1219
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,537
This is what we call the people beat.

1220
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,787
Started in 1966 by huey Newton
and Bobby seale.

1221
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,828
It's the beat that manifests
in you, the people.

1222
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,746
They can't never stop the party

1223
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,569
unless they stop the people!

1224
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,881
Well, ain't you high? Ain't you high?

1225
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,092
I'm high off the people!

1226
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,347
- I'm high!
- I'm high!

1227
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,391
- I'm high!
- I'm high!

1228
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,721
- High, high, high, high, high...
- High, high, high, high, high...

1229
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,390
- Off the people!
- Off the people!

1230
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,775
So, if you were asked
to make a commitment at age 20,

1231
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,025
and you said, "I'm too young to die,"
then you're dead already!

1232
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,788
If you dare to struggle,
you dare to win!

1233
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,417
If you dare not struggle, then,
god damn it, you don't deserve to win!

1234
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,253
Right. Right.

1235
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,009
Put a fist in the air
for comrade Jimmy Palmer.

1236
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:39,936
Jimmy Palmer died a revolutionary death.

1237
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:46,113
He stood face-to-face and toe-to-toe
with pig daley's henchmen,

1238
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,950
and made the greatest sacrifice
one could ever make.

1239
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,742
Right on!

1240
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:02,584
I don't believe I'm gonna die
in no car wreck!

1241
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,544
I don't believe I'm gonna die
slippin' on no ice!

1242
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,264
I don't believe I'm gonna die
'cause I got a bad heart!

1243
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:13,011
I believe I'm gonna die
doin' what I was born for!

1244
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,680
I believe I'm gonna die
high off the people!

1245
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:20,067
I'm gonna die for the people,
'cause I live for the people!

1246
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:23,859
I live for the people,
'cause I love the people!

1247
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,993
And as for them bloodthirsty,
murderous pigs...

1248
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,781
Well, some of you might be
in the audience right now, huh?

1249
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,704
Sittin' on a tape recorder,
gun in your hand!

1250
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,873
Well, lemme make it plain.

1251
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,834
Kill a few pigs,
get a little satisfaction.

1252
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:49,759
Right on. Right on.

1253
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,347
Kill some more pigs,
get some more satisfaction.

1254
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,647
Kill 'em all
and get complete satisfaction!

1255
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,152
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1256
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,738
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1257
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,784
It's not a question of violence
or non-violence.

1258
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:22,338
It's a question of resistance to fascism
or non-existence within fascism!

1259
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:27,297
You can murder a liberator,
but you can't murder liberation!

1260
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,804
You can murder a revolutionary,
but you can't murder a revolution!

1261
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,638
And you can murder a freedom fighter,
but you can't murder freedom!

1262
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,596
- I said I am...
- I am...

1263
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,544
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1264
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,058
- I am...
- I am...

1265
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:44,753
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1266
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,153
- I am...
- Lam...

1267
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,840
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1268
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,318
- I am...
- Lam...

1269
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,762
- A revolutionary!
- A revolutionary!

1270
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,055
Drummer,
lemme hear the people beat!

1271
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,556
Lemme hear the people beat!

1272
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,242
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1273
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,449
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1274
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,539
Right! Right!

1275
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,670
Put your fists in the air!

1276
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,297
Right!

1277
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,309
Winters, fuck you doin' here?

1278
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,137
Lookin' for some answers.

1279
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,014
Answers to what?

1280
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,231
Remember I saw you not too long ago
at the hospital?

1281
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,530
Yeanh.

1282
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,863
The pigs took my man outta there.

1283
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,013
I don't know nothin' about that.

1284
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,245
No, look, I was thinking
maybe you could ask a couple questions.

1285
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,697
And fuck my money up?

1286
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,374
Nigga, do you have any idea

1287
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,497
how treacherous them crackers is
down there?

1288
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,816
- I don't want no parts of that.
- Reg, please. Please, man.

1289
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,174
Look, man, I'm cold and I'm hungry.
Now, get out my way.

1290
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,006
Come on, brother!

1291
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,594
I ain't your brother!

1292
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,928
Now, get the fuck off my porch
before you end up like your boy did.

1293
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,557
Man, fuck...

1294
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,438
No, I just wanted to know what happened.
Reg! Hey, reg!

1295
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,268
I just wanted to know
what happened to my friend!

1296
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,611
Reg!

1297
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,321
Yeah.

1298
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,983
Reg!

1299
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,778
Across the street
from the oil refinery.

1300
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,621
Uh, lawn... lawndale and 45th.

1301
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,419
He... he's got a gun. A big one.

1302
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,867
What are you doin'?
That's private! It's private...

1303
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,586
You think you gonna be a bad mother?

1304
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:09,799
It was a question.

1305
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,798
Why you gotta ask yourself that?

1306
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,132
I don't... I don't know.

1307
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:20,516
Maybe the fact that I'm bringin' a child
into a war zone.

1308
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:24,137
These aren't considerations
you have to make.

1309
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:25,729
You get to go out there,

1310
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,730
talk about dyin' a revolutionary death

1311
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,480
and how your body belong
to the revolution,

1312
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:34,609
because you don't have another person
growin' inside your body.

1313
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,111
So, you regret it?

1314
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,196
- What?
- Havin' my baby.

1315
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,871
Do you?

1316
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:54,212
When I dedicated my life to the people,
I dedicated my life.

1317
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,130
You dig?

1318
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,678
And it wasn't till menard
when I realized what that...

1319
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,308
When I realized what that meant.

1320
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,563
'Cause in order to survive in there,

1321
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,728
a part of me had to die, man.

1322
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:20,238
You couldn't have told me that,
when I got out,

1323
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,409
that I have...

1324
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:28,249
That I'd had every reason to live.

1325
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,467
So, do you regret it?

1326
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,675
Do you?

1327
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:44,971
Uh...

1328
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,142
I wanna... I wanna
share somethin' with you.

1329
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:05,821
"Like the masses, I was in awe,

1330
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,958
"when I first laid eyes
on all the things you are.

1331
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,670
"I heard that speech,

1332
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,249
"and when that indent
pierced your cheek,

1333
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,130
"I knew we'd make noise.

1334
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:27,559
"What magic a philistine
and a poet could create."

1335
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,290
A philistine?
Who you callin' a philistine?

1336
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,181
You're seriously
interrupting me right now?

1337
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:39,276
"What magic a philistine
and a poet could create.

1338
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,943
"However contradictory,
it would seem that it's fate.

1339
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:51,079
"We educate, we nurture,
we feed, and we lobby.

1340
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:56,205
"Perhaps we're here for more
than just war with these bodies.”

1341
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,711
Let's go!

1342
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:09,177
"Will my comrades
think me treasonous?

1343
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,763
"Can it please have your dimples?

1344
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:17,313
"Will my chairman
look at me differently?

1345
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,479
"Will its eyes have your twinkle?

1346
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:29,784
"Will our child be the apple of his eye?
Or constantly get the compromise?

1347
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:35,586
"The rata-tat-tat of gunfire,
the clink of jail cells, lullabies.

1348
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:39,130
"We scream,

1349
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:43,131
"and we shout,
and we live by this anthem,

1350
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:48,056
"but is power to the people
really worth that ransom?

1351
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,968
"Cause that's
what a mother does.

1352
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:55,018
"She gives the world
the most precious things that she loves.

1353
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:58,316
"And I love you,
and I love our baby, too,

1354
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,071
"and there's nothing more radical
than seein' that through.

1355
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:07,568
"Born pure to the blood,
with the heart of a panther.

1356
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,364
"So, no regrets.

1357
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,285
"I know my answer.”

1358
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,021
Oh, shit.

1359
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,818
Please.

1360
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,572
Please.

1361
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:30,738
Please.

1362
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,410
Please, no!

1363
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,955
Hey!

1364
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,201
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1365
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,500
Hey. Hey, don't shoot me. Don't shoot.
Please don't kill me. Don't kill me.

1366
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,833
I'm not a rat. I'm not a rat, I swear.

1367
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,027
Thank you.

1368
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,734
You're welcome.

1369
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,275
Do you want me to get that?

1370
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,700
It's probably one of them crank callers.

1371
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,788
As if it ain't bad enough
I'll never see my son again.

1372
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,788
You think the mothers
of those police officers

1373
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:09,003
that killed the soto brothers
are getting harassed like this?

1374
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,337
Please.

1375
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,140
I know what you're gonna say, but...

1376
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:24,056
No. No, stop. Stop that.

1377
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,187
I'm sorry, Mrs. winters.

1378
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,447
Let's talk about something else.

1379
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,071
How's Deborah?

1380
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,206
Tired of being pregnant.

1381
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,161
Yeanh.

1382
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,916
Yeanh.

1383
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,790
Tell her to Cherish it.

1384
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,834
All of it.

1385
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,679
Those early days are...

1386
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:04,054
You know, even when I think
about Jake in my mind,

1387
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,564
he's always seven.

1388
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,316
That's how I remember him.

1389
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:11,315
My little boy.

1390
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:18,443
I remember,
one time in church, he said...

1391
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:20,821
"Mama, may I be excused?"

1392
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,614
I said, "why, Jake?"

1393
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:25,249
You know, figuring he was bored
or something.

1394
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:30,418
And he goes, "mama, I gotta pass gas."

1395
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,428
Sound like Jake.

1396
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:35,756
Yeanh.

1397
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:42,478
Yeah.

1398
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,935
So well-behaved.

1399
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,519
Just the sweetest little thing.

1400
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,115
Mmm.

1401
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:02,700
Those folks, though,

1402
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:07,041
they try to paint my Jake
as some cold-blooded killer.

1403
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:13,294
He did that. He did that.

1404
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,178
But that ain't all he did.

1405
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:22,261
Tell 'em about my Jake, chairman.

1406
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:23,182
I will do.

1407
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:24,559
Please.

1408
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,684
Yes.

1409
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:43,366
It don't seem fair
that that's his legacy.

1410
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:51,422
Here.

1411
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,749
C-4.

1412
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,384
Yeah, we got enough there,

1413
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,461
we could blow up city hall,
some more shit.

1414
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:00,674
Fuck is wrong with you?

1415
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:01,909
Calm down, comrade, calm down.

1416
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,798
What you mean,
what's wrong with me, man?

1417
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:06,309
Are y'all fuckin' crazy?
We're not gonna win this war,

1418
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,266
so we gotta do somethin' big
and we gotta do it now!

1419
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,563
You out your mind?

1420
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,009
Man, "complete satisfaction,"
ain't that what the fuck you told me?

1421
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:19,614
"Kill 'em all, complete satisfaction."

1422
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:20,611
But I didn't mean it like that.

1423
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:23,535
- I did not mean it like that.
- I call you "comrade" 'cause we at war!

1424
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,741
You're the one
that gave me the game, man!

1425
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:27,246
Know Jimmy Palmer?

1426
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,621
All right, you remember little Bobby?

1427
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,711
Franko diggs? Thomas Lewis?

1428
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,749
Bunchy Carter? Jake winters?

1429
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,003
All you lookin' to do
is add more names to that list.

1430
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:45,052
You bomb city hall, they gonna bomb us.

1431
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,512
I'm ready to die
for the people, chairman.

1432
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:51,975
How about you?

1433
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,438
Is it a goddamn revolution or what?

1434
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:58,186
Huh?

1435
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,425
Get this shit
the fuck outta here!

1436
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:00,359
Why the fuck is we doin' it?

1437
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:01,635
What are we doin' this shit for?

1438
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,366
Get this shit
the fuck outta here, you fuckin' idiot!

1439
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,247
Well, then fuck it, then! I'm out!

1440
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,457
This whole shit gonna crumble!

1441
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:17,580
Motherfucker!

1442
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,248
Fuck is you talkin' about, nigga?

1443
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,351
God damn it!

1444
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,733
Shit.

1445
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:04,176
FBI, how may I direct your call?

1446
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:07,430
Uh, special agent Carlyle
for director hoover.

1447
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,765
Hello.

1448
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,477
Director hoover, good afternoon, sir.

1449
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:20,311
I am calling with good news.
With great news.

1450
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,728
Two hours ago,

1451
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:24,860
the Illinois supreme court
denied Hampton's appeal.

1452
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:27,275
He's going back to menard.

1453
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,027
I know.

1454
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,492
Well, that's what we wanted, right?

1455
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:40,873
Prison made huey Newton a celebrity.

1456
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,551
It made eldridge cleaver
a best-selling author.

1457
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:50,511
Prison is a temporary solution.

1458
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,356
What you doing?

1459
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,767
Goin' through old shit.

1460
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,821
My mom used to babysit him, you know?

1461
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,080
Not all the time,

1462
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:18,786
but his family lived across the street,
so every now and then, she'd watch him.

1463
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,002
We didn't go to the funeral.
It was too much for her.

1464
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:27,594
I don't even think I saw the photo
till months later.

1465
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,967
But I remember when I did.

1466
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:35,761
Thinkin', "there's people in this world
who want to do that to me?

1467
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,272
"Or my brother?

1468
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:40,432
"Or my sister?"

1469
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:45,270
That's when I knew I had to protect 'em.

1470
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:49,608
I mean, looking at that photo,
how could you not feel that way?

1471
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,789
Now, here I am.

1472
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,997
About to go back to menard.

1473
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,461
Where I won't be able
to protect anybody.

1474
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,714
Not even my own son.

1475
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,802
The party will protect him.

1476
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,639
You hear me?

1477
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,474
The people will protect him.

1478
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:40,662
Here, take this.

1479
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:42,077
Yes, sir.

1480
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,880
Hey. Roy boy.

1481
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,048
How are you?

1482
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:52,637
Look, man, sorry I'm late.
I just, you know...

1483
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:54,714
How's it goin'?

1484
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,014
It's groovy, right?

1485
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:11,614
What can I do for you, Roy?

1486
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,198
You've been
to Hampton's apartment, right?

1487
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,119
Right.

1488
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,996
A lot of guns there?

1489
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,498
Of course.

1490
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:25,333
Good. I need you to draw me
a blueprint of the place.

1491
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:29,670
Uh, you must not...

1492
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:32,339
Fred's goin' back to menard, man.

1493
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,555
Uh, I think it was his appeal
getting revoked or somethin' like that.

1494
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:37,386
No, I'm aware.

1495
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:42,350
All right, well, if you're aware,
then, um, I don't understand.

1496
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:49,857
You don't have to understand, bill.
You just have to draw me that blueprint.

1497
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,950
- Listen, Roy.
- Uh-huh.

1498
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:08,709
You got him, man. You know, you won.

1499
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,172
Fred's...

1500
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,047
What more do you want?

1501
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:24,346
Are you gonna kill him, Roy?

1502
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:27,901
Huh?

1503
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:43,498
I saw you, you know.

1504
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:46,709
What?

1505
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,829
That day at the speech.

1506
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:51,581
I watched you.

1507
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:56,010
I remember thinking to myself,
"either this guy

1508
01:38:56,848 --> 01:39:00,090
"deserves an academy award,

1509
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,058
"or he really believes this shit."

1510
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:05,762
Hey, come on, man, now,
I was doin' my goddamn...

1511
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,646
I was doin' the job
that you told me to do.

1512
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:09,133
I was doin' what the fuck you said.

1513
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,255
- The fuck are you talkin' about, man?
- Tell you what, though.

1514
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,066
Let's say I put a call
in to new haven pd,

1515
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:18,070
get 'em to send me a few snapshots
of your friend,

1516
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,026
Alex rackley,

1517
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:23,997
after they dragged him from the river,
cigarette burns all over his body,

1518
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,661
skin peeling off,

1519
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:30,370
where the panthers poured boiling water
all over his cock.

1520
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:39,549
If they did that to rackley,

1521
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,006
imagine what they'll do

1522
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,810
when they find out
their security captain is a fucking rat.

1523
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,186
A fucking rat.

1524
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,079
Fuck, Roy.

1525
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,954
They name all these ships,
like Apollo and all that, right,

1526
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:28,219
after black people,
but ain't no black astronauts, right?

1527
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,681
Well, I like seein' you smile.

1528
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:35,564
How about we continue this at my pad?

1529
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,736
Have a nightcap.

1530
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:42,071
I got more than enough alcohol,
you know?

1531
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,239
All right.

1532
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:47,993
Hi

1533
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:50,874
I'm Darlene.

1534
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:54,170
Hey. Bill.

1535
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,548
What brings you out so late, bill?

1536
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,094
You know, it's quiet.
Nobody know who the hell I am.

1537
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:03,967
Mm-hmm. You know?

1538
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:05,881
Mysterious.

1539
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:11,391
So, what do you do, mystery man?

1540
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:12,931
Um...

1541
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:15,516
I used to work for the FBI.

1542
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:26,077
Top me off while I run to the ladies',
eliot ness.

1543
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:33,871
Shit.

1544
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,997
They let niggas work for the FBI now?

1545
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,745
Is that right? Why don't
you get me an application, brother?

1546
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:42,884
Mr. FBI man, huh?

1547
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:44,678
Hey, man. Would you shut the fuck up?

1548
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:46,972
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God damn it.

1549
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:49,015
Mitchell warned me about you.

1550
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:51,310
What?

1551
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,811
Yeanh.

1552
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:54,559
What?

1553
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,105
Look here, just relax.

1554
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:02,446
Okay, we hidin' in plain sight.
Nobody know we in here.

1555
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,993
Check this out, man. I got this article
I want you to read right here.

1556
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:11,076
Yeah, right, it's the article
in this paper. Very important.

1557
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:13,912
I need you to let the chairman read it
tomorrow night.

1558
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,503
And put that in his drink.

1559
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:28,302
I don't know what the fuck
you talkin' about, man. I don't...

1560
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,595
Fuck outta here with that shit.

1561
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:34,541
- My mistake.
- All articles and shit, man.

1562
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:36,180
No, no, it's all good,
that's my mistake.

1563
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,517
No, I guess I had the wrong guy.

1564
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,356
Sorry about that.

1565
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:44,154
Lemme get outta here.

1566
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,137
Hey! Hey!

1567
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,423
Who are you, man?

1568
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,343
Hey, don't worry about it, slick.
Man, just go back inside.

1569
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:16,979
Nigga, I'm not gonna poison him,
you hear me?

1570
01:43:17,233 --> 01:43:18,973
You fuckin' hear me?

1571
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:23,394
Come on, man, you watch too many movies.

1572
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:25,813
Look, all it's gonna do
is just make him sleepy.

1573
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,322
You want him to go easy, right?

1574
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:29,905
Who the fuck are you, man?
Tell me your fuckin' name!

1575
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,990
You know... did Roy send you?

1576
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:35,285
If you a fed,
then show me a fuckin' badge!

1577
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:39,789
Hey! Show me a fuckin' badge, man!
Please!

1578
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,080
Shit.

1579
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:23,625
Consider that a gift...

1580
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,415
From the crowns.

1581
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:33,760
Ain't no shame in runnin'.

1582
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,425
It's not like they giving you a choice.

1583
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,346
Yeah, maybe he's right, chairman.

1584
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:40,937
(Go overseas.

1585
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:45,435
Like you said, start an international
proletariat revolution.

1586
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,897
At least that way,
you're still in the fight.

1587
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:00,704
So, what about Cuba?

1588
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:02,789
Nuh-uh.

1589
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,456
Cuba's not an option? Why not?

1590
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:07,634
Algeria.

1591
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:08,917
Shit.

1592
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:21,513
Mark Clark, deputy minister of defense,
peoria chapter.

1593
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:31,239
Central ordered me to come down here
to check out how y'all do things,

1594
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:32,989
here in the windy city.

1595
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,525
Yeanh.

1596
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:37,282
And your name, comrade?

1597
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:38,498
Bill

1598
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:39,582
- bill?
- Mm-hmm_

1599
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,911
Bill.
What cadre are you in, bill?

1600
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:44,293
Man, I'm not even in no...

1601
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:46,670
Thinking about joining up?

1602
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:49,548
Right on. Right on, bill.

1603
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,710
You know, I started off
in the naacp myself.

1604
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:54,344
Then I had to leave.

1605
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:56,130
Them negroes move too damn slow for me.

1606
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,385
I know a guy.

1607
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,221
Kites up checks, passports,

1608
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:01,097
driver's licenses,
things of that nature.

1609
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:04,810
Yeah, but how far we gonna get
when one of us is 37 weeks pregnant?

1610
01:46:04,984 --> 01:46:06,940
You could be in Havana
in less than 24 hours.

1611
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:08,964
And they have some of
the best doctors in the world.

1612
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:10,966
Yeah, okay, let's just hope
that's not the day

1613
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,447
that Nixon decides
to nuke that motherfucker.

1614
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:17,155
Look, Algeria,
they got minister eldridge.

1615
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:18,769
Not to mention bungalows by the sea.

1616
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:20,934
But the Cubans
got ocean for days.

1617
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:23,119
You know how long it'll take
to get to Algeria?

1618
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:25,501
That Cuba's a hop and a skip away.

1619
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,412
There is a network
of safe houses headin' south.

1620
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:29,871
I could put a call into central.

1621
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:33,383
Y'all spendin' all this time talkin'
about me goin' to Algerian bungalows,

1622
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:34,885
when you need to be talkin' about

1623
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:37,338
how we gonna build
this motherfuckin' medical clinic.

1624
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:45,559
Is the party about me
or is it about the people?

1625
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:49,652
Hmm?

1626
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,411
Chairman...

1627
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:03,493
It's a 5-year bid.

1628
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,582
You know how many people we could save
in five years?

1629
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:13,583
With a medical clinic
in the middle of the West Side?

1630
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:22,883
As far as I'm concerned,
that's an easy decision.

1631
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:24,847
Doc.

1632
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,931
You run it.

1633
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:36,864
Name it after Jake.

1634
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,864
So, when people hear
the name Jake winters,

1635
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:45,823
they think about healin'.

1636
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:48,461
And lovin'.

1637
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:52,378
Like he loved us.

1638
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:01,631
And when I get out,

1639
01:48:05,688 --> 01:48:07,929
me and Deb can have our second.

1640
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,985
And third,

1641
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:20,195
- and fourth...
- Okay. Easy now.

1642
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,806
I was gonna cap it at five, baby.
Five's a good number, right?

1643
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,661
How 'bout we see how you do
with the one?

1644
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:25,908
Mm-hmm.

1645
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:35,631
Speaking of children, chairman,
I'm gonna go and get back to my family.

1646
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:37,133
Take care, comrade.

1647
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,593
All right. See you in the morning.

1648
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:40,962
Comrade.

1649
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:55,893
Right. Come on, baby, you eat.

1650
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,771
Come on. This'll get you strong.

1651
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:01,720
- This'll raise the blood.
- That's way too much.

1652
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:03,154
Oh, what? What?

1653
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:04,701
That's too much.

1654
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,288
What's up?

1655
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:16,255
I thought I'd get another drink.

1656
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:19,670
You want a refill, chairman?

1657
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:55,729
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

1658
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,811
Look.

1659
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:07,782
Hey. Hey.

1660
01:51:07,911 --> 01:51:09,276
Wake up.

1661
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:11,828
Somebody at the door.

1662
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:13,739
Hey, Tracy.

1663
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,208
I'MMA wake the chairman.

1664
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,180
I'm comin'!

1665
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:34,055
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1666
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:36,436
Deb, get down!
Get down! Get down!

1667
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:40,641
No! Nol

1668
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:49,403
Chairman!

1669
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:53,328
Chairman, wake up!

1670
01:51:53,498 --> 01:51:54,783
Wake up! Chairman!

1671
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,415
Chairman! Chairman! Wake up!

1672
01:51:57,586 --> 01:51:58,586
Chairman, wake up!

1673
01:51:58,754 --> 01:52:01,461
Wake up! Wake up! Chairman!

1674
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,623
Turn on the fucking lights!

1675
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,400
We can't! We've been shot!

1676
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:08,339
Turn on the light
or you'll get shot more!

1677
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:23,854
Come on, come on!

1678
01:52:24,947 --> 01:52:27,654
Betty... get up. Get up.

1679
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:43,809
We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1680
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,497
Come here! Come here!

1681
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:48,958
How many are in there?

1682
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:51,233
Just stop shootin'!
Stop shootin'!

1683
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:53,297
We got a pregnant sister in here,
god damn it!

1684
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:55,682
Everyone out! Now!

1685
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:04,562
I said now!

1686
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:16,740
Get over here!

1687
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,744
Keep those hands up!

1688
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:36,180
What do you know? We got a broad here.

1689
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:37,883
Take her!

1690
01:53:38,103 --> 01:53:39,809
Come here!

1691
01:53:41,023 --> 01:53:42,103
Get her.

1692
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,067
Looks like he's gonna make it.

1693
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,232
He's good and dead now.

1694
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,098
Bill

1695
01:54:19,811 --> 01:54:21,767
good to see ya. Come on in.

1696
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:31,653
Hey. Relax...

1697
01:54:32,074 --> 01:54:35,532
It's just us. I know you don't trust me,
but it's true.

1698
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:44,954
Why'd you call me here, man?
What do you want?

1699
01:54:48,382 --> 01:54:49,462
Hey?

1700
01:54:59,518 --> 01:55:00,928
Take it.

1701
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:12,145
You don't have to if you don't want to,
but I think you'll be glad you did.

1702
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:32,297
They're for a gas station in maywood.

1703
01:55:34,428 --> 01:55:36,043
It's yours.

1704
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:41,298
There's a lot of money in gas.
Consistent money.

1705
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:43,429
Legal money.

1706
01:55:45,063 --> 01:55:47,850
You own your own business now, bill.

1707
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:51,608
You're free.

1708
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,696
What do you need? You need a drink?

1709
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,827
- No, I don't need anythin'...
- You need a drink?

1710
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,734
- Excuse me.
- Fuck.

1711
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:02,743
Can you get this man a scotch?

1712
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:09,626
So, where are things with the party?

1713
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:12,245
Any news?

1714
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:16,959
Fred's dead, man.

1715
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:20,261
I ain't no goddamn panther no more.

1716
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:26,301
You sure about that?

1717
01:57:11,316 --> 01:57:14,274
What would you tell
your son about what you did then?

1718
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:25,453
I think I'll let your documentary
put a cap on that story. I don't know.

1719
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,954
I don't know what I'd tell him,
other than...

1720
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:31,617
I was part of the struggle.

1721
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,706
That's the bottom line.

1722
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,047
I wasn't one of those
armchair revolutionaries.

1723
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:41,130
One of those people
that wanna sit back now

1724
01:57:41,304 --> 01:57:44,717
and judge the actions
or inactions of people

1725
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:47,974
when they sit back on the sideline
and did nothing.

1726
01:57:48,562 --> 01:57:50,848
At least I had a point of view.

1727
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:52,439
I was dedicated.

1728
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:55,357
And then I had the courage
to get out there

1729
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,768
and put it on the line, and I did.

1730
01:57:58,405 --> 01:57:59,440
Um...

1731
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:03,532
I think I'll let history speak for me.

1732
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:09,286
Stoppin' down.

1733
01:58:11,293 --> 01:58:12,453
Call when it's speed.

1734
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,907
Remember this.

1735
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:56,789
Prayer is good.

1736
01:58:57,756 --> 01:59:02,420
If Fred could be murdered
while he slept,

1737
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:05,465
remember what can happen to you,

1738
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:08,722
while you're on your knees
facing that bed.

1739
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:12,304
Our brother Fred Hampton

1740
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:14,155
our brother Fred Hampton

1741
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:17,563

02:00:00,777 --> 02:00:04,565

02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,817

02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:08,819

1757
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,198
- Power to the people
- Power to the people

1758
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:14,241
we've got the free-breakfast program

1759
02:00:19,796 --> 02:00:21,912
We always say
at the black panther party,

1760
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,730
that they can do
what they want to, to us,

1761
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,008
we might not be back.
I might be in jail, I might be anywhere,

1762
02:00:27,178 --> 02:00:29,169
but when [I leave,
you can remember I said,

1763
02:00:29,347 --> 02:00:31,633
with the last words out of my lips,
that I am...

1764
02:00:31,808 --> 02:00:32,672
I am!

1765
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:33,767
A revolutionary.

1766
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:35,815
And you're going to have to
keep on saying that.

1767
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:37,957
You are going to have to say
that I am a proletariat.

1768
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:39,061
I am the people.

1769
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:41,848
I'm not the pig.
You've got to make a distinction.

1770
02:01:16,728 --> 02:01:19,219
All the smoke in the air

1771
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:21,721
feel the hate when they stare

1772
02:01:21,816 --> 02:01:24,273
all the pain that we bear

1773
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:27,147
oh, you better beware

1774
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,320
their guns don't play fair

1775
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:31,773
all we got is a prayer

1776
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:34,359
it was all in their plans

1777
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:37,446
wash the blood from your hands

1778
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:40,240
freedom for the brothers

1779
02:01:40,335 --> 02:01:43,122
freedom 'cause they judge us

1780
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:45,420
freedom from the others

1781
02:01:45,507 --> 02:01:47,964
freedom from the leaders keepin' us

1782
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:50,458
freedom gonna keep us strong

1783
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:52,919
freedom if you're just long gone

1784
02:01:53,014 --> 02:01:56,177
freedom ain't free at all

1785
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:59,301
don't see it, do you?

1786
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:04,355
There's no one
there's no one like you

1787
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:09,402
while we're standing
we could never lose

1788
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:13,858
I will always
always fight for you

1789
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:19,238
I will always
always fight for you

1790
02:02:38,017 --> 02:02:40,383
And so institution

1791
02:02:40,478 --> 02:02:42,639
causes so much confusion

1792
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:48,066
seems the only solution
is a new revolution

1793
02:02:48,152 --> 02:02:52,816
we can't take it no more
no, it can't be ignored

1794
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:58,527
when they knock on your door
will you be waiting for more?

1795
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:01,279
Freedom 'cause they need us

1796
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:04,036
free from having seen us

1797
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:06,368
freedom, won't you free us

1798
02:03:06,462 --> 02:03:08,828
freedom doesn't hang from the trees

1799
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:11,414
freedom from injustice

1800
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:16,048
freedom from corruption
they're aiming for destruction

1801
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:19,973
you know they're gonna see it through

1802
02:03:21,102 --> 02:03:25,220
there's no one
there's no one like you

1803
02:03:25,315 --> 02:03:29,729
while we're standing
we could never lose

1804
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:34,859
I will always
always fight for you

1805
02:03:35,533 --> 02:03:39,947
I will always
always fight for you

1806
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:46,332
see it through

1807
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:50,253
there's no one
there's no one like you

1808
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:55,130
I will always
always fight for you

1809
02:03:55,720 --> 02:04:00,510
for you, for you fight for you
