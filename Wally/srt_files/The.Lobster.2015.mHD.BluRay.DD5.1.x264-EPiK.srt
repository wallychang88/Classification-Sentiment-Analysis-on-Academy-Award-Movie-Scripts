1
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,890
I'm really sorry.

2
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,930
Does he wear glasses or contact lenses?

3
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:16,771
Glasses.

4
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,428
You'll have to hurry up.

5
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,630
He decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.

6
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,930
His back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past

7
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,890
when the pain was intolerable.

8
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,650
He was thinking his wife
didn't love him at all any more.

9
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,830
He didn't burst into tears and he didn't think
that the first thing people most people do

10
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,371
when they realize someone
doesn't love them anymore is cry.

11
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:27,250
Sir, do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me?

12
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:30,857
That'll do. Thank you.

13
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,650
Have you ever been on your own before?

14
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,000
No, never.

15
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:42,171
Are you allergic to any foods?

16
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,142
No.

17
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,450
Your last relationship
lasted how many years?

18
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,685
Around 12.

19
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,170
Do you remember how long exactly, sir?

20
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:52,257
11 years and one month.

21
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,142
- Sexual preference?
- Women.

22
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,257
However, I had one homosexual
experience in the past,

23
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,714
in college.

24
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,570
Is there a bisexual option available?

25
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,428
No, sir, this option is no longer available
since about last summer,

26
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,410
due to several operational problems.

27
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,530
I'm afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered

28
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,828
as a homosexual or a heterosexual.

29
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,090
I think I should be registered
as a heterosexual.

30
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,314
- Any children, sir?
- No.

31
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:35,857
And the dog?

32
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,810
My brother. He was here a couple of years
ago but he didn't make it.

33
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:40,285
You might remember him:

34
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,885
medium build, 48 years old,
bald patch, blond hair.

35
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,885
I'm afraid not, sir.

36
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,514
OK, I would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters.

37
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,114
And sign it, please.

38
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,942
That will do. Thank you very much.

39
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:07,028
OK, so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts.

40
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,800
These are only for the couples.

41
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,010
You can use facilities for individual
sports, such as squash and golf.

42
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,171
You can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days.
You'll be staying in a single room.

43
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,650
If everything goes well and you make it,
you'll be moved to a double room.

44
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,228
I'm afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings.

45
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,350
We will provide everything you need.

46
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,371
As far as garments, accessories
and shoes are concerned.

47
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,257
- You can keep this.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,010
Shoe size, please?

49
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,685
Forty-four and a half.

50
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,571
Forty-four of forty-five?
There are no half sizes.

51
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,457
Forty-five.

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,290
If you need a haircut,
call reception one day ahead.

53
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,970
Smoking is not allowed.

54
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,742
That way you'll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired

55
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,942
and your breath won't smell when you kiss.

56
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:28,770
Enjoy your stay.

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,457
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,

58
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:34,470
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,

59
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,110
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?

60
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,830
- That's right.
- Great.

61
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,885
His room number was 101.

62
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,885
A tranquilizer gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed.

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,850
On the table were 20 tranquilizer darts,
a black plastic watch,

64
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,800
a pair of sunglasses and a cologne for men.

65
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,290
Inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers,

66
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,514
four identical button-down shirts
in white and blue,

67
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,371
a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer,

68
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:27,428
a striped tie and a white bathrobe.

69
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,370
He looked out the window.

70
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:41,800
The unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground.

71
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,800
"Thank God they wear those
waterproof ponchos," he thought.

72
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,657
Room 195.

73
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,742
Two loners, two extra days.

74
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,057
Room 272.

75
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,400
One loner, one extra day.

76
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,542
Hello. I'm the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner.

77
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,230
We'd like to welcome you.

78
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:23,510
You're one of the lucky ones.

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,342
You have one of our superior rooms,
which means you have a view.

80
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,330
- Did you read the leaflet?
- Yes, I did.

81
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,571
Very good. Now the fact
that you'll turn into an animal

82
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,800
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here

83
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,771
is not something that should upset you,
or get you down.

84
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:41,714
Just think as an animal you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.

85
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:43,810
But even then, you must be careful.

86
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,685
You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.

87
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,890
A wolf and a penguin
could never live together,

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,430
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus.

89
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,390
That would be absurd.

90
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:56,990
Think about it.

91
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:01,190
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

92
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,428
But it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically,

93
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,142
for all possible outcomes.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,750
Now, have you thought of what animal
you'd like to be if you end up alone?

95
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,000
- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?

96
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:16,200
Because lobsters live
for over 100 years,

97
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,285
are blue-blooded like aristocrats

98
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:24,730
and stay fertile all their lives.

99
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,742
I also like the sea very much.

100
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:33,170
I water-ski and swim quite well,
since I was a teenager.

101
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:38,000
I must congratulate you. The first thing
most people think of is a dog,

102
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,310
which is why the world is full of dogs.

103
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:43,750
Very few people choose an unusual
animal, which is why they are endangered.

104
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,914
A lobster is an excellent choice.

105
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:48,000
Could you stand for us, please?

106
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,800
This is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something

107
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,210
rather than just one.

108
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,628
We tend to forget that from time to time.

109
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,990
The handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow.

110
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,990
- It's alright, Bob.
- I hope you enjoy your stay with us.

111
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:08,514
Goodbye.

112
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,470
Have a good day.

113
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,810
Good morning.

114
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,730
Room 101.

115
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,050
44 days left.

116
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,410
Breakfast is served.

117
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,742
Sit where you like.

118
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,171
His first day was one he'd never forget.

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,942
Near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back.

120
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:01,800
Later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds.

121
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:05,057
Next to her sat her best friend.

122
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,257
He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee,

123
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,710
and thought about his wife for a moment.

124
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:18,200
A woman who seemed to like
butter biscuits

125
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:22,485
offered one to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.

126
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,914
He then looked behind him
and saw a woman

127
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:31,657
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless.

128
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,685
And some others in the couples area,

129
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,571
whom he'd never meet
during his stay at the hotel.

130
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,428
That morning, he was really hungry.

131
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:49,828
He could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing.

132
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,171
- Hello.
- Hello.

133
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:56,250
I've decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend.

134
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,485
Let me introduce you. This is Robert.

135
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,310
He stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp.

136
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,510
Pleased to meet you.
I'm staying in room 101.

137
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,714
I'm on the same floor. I'm 186.

138
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,010
- Would you like to join us?
- Why not?

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,070
One of these days, it's gonna be me
on one of those yachts.

140
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,571
What are those yachts?

141
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,571
It's the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one.

142
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,210
15 days of vacation,
just a couple, alone.

143
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,570
- Didn't you read the leaflet?
- I did.

144
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,085
Have you seen John's leg?

145
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:49,850
No.

146
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,600
John, would you show your leg?

147
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:57,610
Oh, yeah.

148
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,400
Room 187, day two.

149
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,914
Hello, everyone.

150
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:17,000
My mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman

151
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,960
who was better at math than she was.

152
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:24,680
She had a postgraduate degree, I think,
whereas my mother was only a graduate.

153
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,060
I was 19 at the time.

154
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,300
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.

155
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,260
I really missed her.

156
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,600
I found out she'd been moved to a zoo.

157
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,742
I often went there to see her.

158
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,640
I'd give her raw meat.

159
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,228
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,

160
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:49,485
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,

161
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,571
so I used to give a little
bit to each of them.

162
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,860
One day,
I decided to enter the enclosure

163
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:00,971
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.

164
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,914
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

165
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:07,220
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,

166
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,180
all but two, who stood motionless.

167
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:13,514
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.

168
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:20,057
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.

169
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:23,657
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,

170
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,420
which is also my defining characteristic.

171
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,760
My wife died six days ago.

This is only my second day here,

Woman walks with man.

300
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,020
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,

301
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,660
is to wash your body
and your head really well.

302
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:19,400
How do you know?

303
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:22,457
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.

304
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,480
No waiters know about the procedure,

305
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,228
they're not allowed inside that room.

306
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:29,057
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin,

307
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,200
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.

308
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:38,380
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body

309
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,180
with a laser or scalpels.

310
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,885
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen.

311
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,180
That makes total sense.

312
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,080
I mean, I suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work

313
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,800
than fowls, for example.

314
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,240
Exactly.

315
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,314
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts

316
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:59,800
into the casks outside
the hotel's restaurant

317
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:02,485
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.

318
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,200
Why is that?

319
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,960
The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

320
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,828
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

321
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:17,714
I think I saw a woman with a limp.

322
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:19,514
It's just a sprained ankle.

323
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:23,085
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.

324
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,428
That's a shame.

325
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,000
That is a shame indeed.

326
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,314
One night on the coach, he sat next to
the woman who liked butter biscuits.

327
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:41,914
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,

328
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,314
just trying to avoid talking to her.

329
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,480
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.

330
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,600
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

331
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:54,885
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.

332
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:59,000
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.

333
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:02,500
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

334
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:04,714
And that was a really good one.

335
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,540
These biscuits are for Bob.

336
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:11,390
I want you to give them to him

337
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,314
whenever you want to reward him
for something.

338
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,257
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.

339
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,480
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?

340
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:22,657
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.

341
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:27,028
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

342
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,228
if that's your thing.

343
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,714
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.

344
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:33,285
But let's not talk about him.

345
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,820
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.

346
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,340
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.

347
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,540
I haven't caught any the last few nights.

348
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:45,260
Hope you catch lots too.

349
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:46,942
Thank you very much.

350
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,720
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,

351
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm gonna kill myself
by throwing myself out of one of the rooms.

352
00:31:57,914 --> 00:31:59,320
Out of the window.

353
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:02,040
I want you to know that.

354
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:04,500
My room is on the first floor.

355
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:08,080
"I hope I catch some loners today,"
she said.

356
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,660
"And I hope you catch lots too."

357
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,542
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,

358
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,600
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,

359
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:23,420
320, maybe, or one higher up.

360
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,657
480, that would be even better.

361
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,885
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.

362
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,914
He then looked out at the woods

363
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:39,114
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.

364
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,542
Not bad. Bit higher.

365
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:51,171
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?

366
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,285
A lobster.

367
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:04,257
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

368
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,960
Why don't you become parrots too?

369
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,020
And then we'll all be together.

370
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,860
You're a complete idiot,

371
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,660
picking one of the few animals
that can talk

372
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,914
when you have a speech impediment.

373
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,740
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

374
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,828
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

375
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,828
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,

376
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:28,114
and they'll suck out what little
flesh you have with their mouths.

377
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,200
You're pathetic, both of you.

378
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,685
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.

379
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,360
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,

380
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,320
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.

381
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,280
Or when we're on one of our trips.

382
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,220
Friends.

383
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,371
I'm not afraid.

384
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,600
Room 187, please.

385
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,942
It's no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples.

386
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,700
Hello.

387
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,220
- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.

388
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,342
Thank,

389
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,700
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

390
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:06,860
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

391
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,714
I like all strokes equally.

392
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,514
You know, I love breaststroke.

393
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,500
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,

394
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,114
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."

395
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:16,400
And then they laugh.

396
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:20,940
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.

397
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,628
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,

398
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,820
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.

399
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,857
- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.

400
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,000
Really?

401
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,571
Ah, no.

402
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,200
This happens to me all the time.

403
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,771
It's really, really annoying.

404
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,485
I know. I have a nosebleed problem too.

405
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,500
I saw what you did.
It must have hurt.

406
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,400
Is it coming out?

407
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,660
No.

408
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,942
- Yes.
- Can I use a tissue?

409
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,028
Yes.

410
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,142
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.

411
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,900
What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,

412
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,260
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal

413
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,140
or to have a nosebleed
from time to time?

414
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:13,857
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.

415
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:15,380
- Exactly.
- Mm.

416
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,085
- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.

417
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,171
I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.

418
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:33,700
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.

419
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,600
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.

420
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,000
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room

421
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,400
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.

422
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:49,760
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,

423
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:53,120
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.

424
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:57,140
We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.

425
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:03,828
- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.

426
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:05,428
Congratulations.

427
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,360
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely

428
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,742
by our staff and by me personally.

429
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,940
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,

430
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,260
that you cannot resolve yourselves,
you will be assigned children.

431
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,914
That usually helps, a lot.

432
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:36,460
Good morning, room 101.

433
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:38,828
Seven days left.

434
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:41,180
Breakfast is served.

435
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,800
You have really nice hair.

436
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,428
I know.

437
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:28,228
Look.

438
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,600
How do you like mine?

439
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,640
Well, I think you have quite dry hair.

440
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,085
The color is OK, though.

441
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,080
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

442
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,971
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.

443
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,400
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.

444
00:39:56,228 --> 00:40:00,257
And even if someday I lose my hair,
there are things I can do to get my hair back.

445
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,942
I can have a hair transplant.

446
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,600
- You can always tell when someone's had a hair transplant.
- I know.

447
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:08,457
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.

448
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:12,914
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.

449
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:18,040
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?

450
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,580
I'm still thinking about it.

451
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,914
Morning, ladies.

452
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,571
So today is your last day.

453
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,640
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.

454
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,060
What I always say in these situations is,

455
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,060
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...

456
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,657
for example,
read a work of classic literature

457
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,220
or sing a song you really like.

458
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,180
It would be silly to choose

459
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,342
for example a walk in the grounds,

460
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,771
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

461
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:03,342
because those are things
you can do as an animal.

462
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,342
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,

463
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:10,200
which is really very touching.

464
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,180
"We always sat together at school.

465
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:17,657
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

466
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:19,914
because you always gave the best advice.

467
00:41:20,657 --> 00:41:23,720
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,

468
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,257
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.

469
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,380
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

470
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:35,057
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,

471
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,100
because you're an admirable person,

472
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,914
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.

473
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,980
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.

474
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,840
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.

475
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,320
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.

476
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:53,920
I'll miss you.

477
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,720
And however many new girlfriends I make in
a few days when I move back into the city,

478
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:01,420
I don't think I'll find another as true."

479
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,580
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,

480
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,828
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland
and Richard Dreyfus. Alone.

481
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:12,840
Excellent choice.

482
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,257
Lovely film.

483
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,040
Please leave a message.

484
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:40,000
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,

485
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,057
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

486
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,480
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

487
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,428
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

488
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,760
We'll talk later.

489
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:54,542
Bye.

490
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,360
One day, as he was playing golf,

491
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,680
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend

492
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,314
that you do have feelings when you don't

493
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,100
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.

494
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:17,028
He also thought that he liked her accent,

495
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,020
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.

496
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:23,000
So he decided that she was the one.

497
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,571
During the hunt, he would follow her,

498
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:29,771
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,

499
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:34,240
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquilizer ones.

500
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,142
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"

501
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:41,860
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,

502
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:44,460
"I hope he dies right away."

503
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,340
Did anyone see what happened?

504
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,680
What happened?

505
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,840
She jumped from the window of room 180.

506
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,800
There's blood and biscuits everywhere.

507
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,640
I hope she dies right away.

508
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
On second thoughts

509
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,360
I hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies.

510
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,680
I just hope her pathetic screams
can't be heard from my room.

511
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,680
Because I was thinking about having
a lie-down and I need peace and quiet.

512
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,360
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.

513
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,520
The last thing I need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly.

514
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,060
I can't hear you with all this screaming.

515
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,580
We'll talk some other time
when it's quieter.

516
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,980
Goodbye.

517
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,380
Goodbye.

518
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,280
One message.

519
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,

520
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,900
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

521
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,320
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

522
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:39,400
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

523
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:41,680
We'll talk later.

524
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:43,680
Bye.

525
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:48,600
Mind if I join you?

526
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:59,142
Martini?

527
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,860
I think we are a match.

528
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,820
Yes, I think so too.

529
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:05,057
The keys to the double room, please.

530
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:16,100
I wish you the best of luck.
We all wish you the best of luck.

531
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,000
Do you normally sleep
on the left side of the bed or the right?

532
00:47:35,257 --> 00:47:37,440
- The right. You?
- The left.

533
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,428
Perfect.

534
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:02,771
Spread your legs.

535
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,180
Should I turn off the light
or would you like to read?

536
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,828
I'd like to read.
Does the light bother you?

537
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:24,685
No.

538
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:26,742
I'm not bothered by light or noise.

539
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:29,085
I'm a deep sleeper.

540
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

541
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,980
Congratulations.

542
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,420
- Thank you.
- This is our new daughter.

543
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,100
Her name's Elizabeth.

544
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,485
Elizabeth, give the nice man a kiss.
He's a friend of mine.

545
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,800
The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl.

546
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:06,885
Come on, move away.

547
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:08,540
Don't cry, Elizabeth, you should thank me.

548
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,800
Now you'll have a limp
and be more like your father.

549
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:19,480
What was that sound?

550
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,057
Did you say something?

551
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:22,371
No.

552
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:27,428
Do you mind if we fuck in a position
where I can see your face?

553
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:28,342
Sure.

554
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:38,340
Turn the light on please,
so I can see you better.

555
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:34,371
Good morning.

556
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,480
Morning.

557
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:43,480
I killed your brother.

558
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,257
I left him to die very slowly.

559
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,685
He may not be dead yet even as we speak.

560
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,600
I was kicking him for ages.

561
00:50:52,971 --> 00:50:54,285
Doesn't matter.

562
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,160
He whined a little,
a strange kind of bark.

563
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,085
Something like this.

564
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,040
It must have been from the pain.

565
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:11,314
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

566
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:13,971
You really are a deep sleeper.

567
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,460
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'd love some.

568
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:21,885
As soon as I wash my face
and brush my teeth, though.

569
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:29,114
I can't wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night,

570
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:32,228
about that student of
yours at the university

571
00:51:32,314 --> 00:51:34,457
and his awful final project.

572
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:55,020
It's really a very funny story.

573
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,485
His name was Ryess -

574
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,885
R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.

575
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:09,980
These aren't tears, it's just water.
I just washed my face.

576
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,240
I knew you were lying.
I can't understand why you did it,

577
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,320
when you know as well as anyone that a
relationship cannot be built on a lie.

578
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,680
We're going to the hotel manager right now
and you'll get the punishment you deserve.

579
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:24,360
What's the punishment for this?

580
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,880
They turn you into the animal
no one wants to be.

581
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,480
I saw your partner running back that way.

582
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,085
He looked frantic.

583
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,685
Is everything OK?

584
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,560
At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,

585
00:54:45,971 --> 00:54:48,542
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother.

586
00:54:48,657 --> 00:54:50,200
Take her legs, please.

587
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,714
He thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again,

588
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,680
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach.

589
00:55:04,457 --> 00:55:06,771
But then he thought
there wouldn't be much point,

590
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:09,257
because she was already unconscious

591
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:12,142
and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kicks, or the knife.

592
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:17,942
You have to shoot me
so they won't suspect I helped you.

593
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:20,085
A hotel maid helped him.

594
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,685
He couldn't understand why she did it.

595
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,371
So he decided to turn her into an animal.

596
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,514
He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.

597
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:49,485
I asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into,

598
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:52,028
but he always gave me the same answer:

599
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,171
"That's none of your concern."

600
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:06,060
That night,
he left the hotel once and for all.

601
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,685
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed.

602
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,380
But he was headed towards us.

603
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,420
This was the start of his new life.

604
00:56:46,142 --> 00:56:49,720
And back then, he didn't know
how much it hurts to be alone,

605
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:56,885
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain-relief ointment on your back,

606
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:58,971
and you are constantly in pain.

607
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,840
I found him in the woods.

608
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,800
He escaped from the hotel.

609
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,260
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

610
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:54,300
- No.
- That's a pity.

611
00:57:55,085 --> 00:57:56,714
We need a doctor around.

612
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:59,660
We had one, but they caught him
a couple of months ago.

613
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:01,620
I'm an architect.

614
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,060
That's OK.

615
00:58:04,457 --> 00:58:05,500
So, welcome.

616
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:08,600
You can stay with us
for as long as you like.

617
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:12,285
You can be a loner until the day you die.
There is no time limit.

618
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:13,800
Thank you very much.

619
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:29,380
By the way,

620
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:33,640
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.

621
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,960
And any such acts are punished.

622
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,057
Is that clear?

623
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:41,280
Can I have a conversation with someone?

624
00:58:41,942 --> 00:58:43,240
Of course you can.

625
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:46,660
So as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that.

626
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,220
That applies to dance nights as well.

627
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,057
We all dance by ourselves,
that's why we only play electronic music.

628
00:59:05,885 --> 00:59:07,320
What happened to your mouth?

629
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,620
He can't speak.
He was given the Red Kiss.

630
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,620
What's the Red Kiss?

631
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,400
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,

632
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:20,480
and we forced them to kiss each other.

633
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:22,440
That was a couple of days ago now.

634
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,942
But the cuts were deep and they're still in pain.
They were flirting, you know.

635
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:40,260
Some punishments
are worse than other punishments.

636
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,460
Having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved.

637
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:49,160
And having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit

638
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,200
is worse than having your leg kicked.

639
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,057
The punishment I am afraid of
isn't the Red Kiss but another one,

640
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,085
that is called the Red Intercourse.

641
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,220
I have never seen it happen,
but it's not difficult to imagine what it means.

642
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,028
Oh, my God, I am so afraid of it.

643
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:18,860
Move.

644
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:22,080
Hide.

645
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,440
Move.

646
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,714
Hide.

647
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:37,714
That was the first time I saw him.

648
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:41,057
He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.

649
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:43,720
He seemed quite presentable.

650
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,685
The next day, in the city,

651
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,571
he found out that I was short-sighted too.

652
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,700
That night in my sleep,

653
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,200
I dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city,

654
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,342
with a large well-lit kitchen,

655
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:07,320
and I was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse.

656
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:10,914
And he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse.

657
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,085
And as he was fucking me,
a thug came into the kitchen,

658
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:25,000
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us,

659
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:28,285
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one.

660
01:01:28,628 --> 01:01:30,320
I woke up terrified.

661
01:01:41,428 --> 01:01:42,860
Try harder.

662
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:46,542
Don't give up. You know you should
have been more careful.

663
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:52,400
Try harder or they'll find you and you'll
be turned into an animal - a weak one.

664
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,971
We must get a move on now.
It's really too dangerous to stay here.

665
01:01:58,057 --> 01:02:01,600
If you manage to free yourself,
run as fast as you can and come find us.

666
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,600
If you manage to free yourself
but think you'll die from the bleeding,

667
01:02:04,742 --> 01:02:05,857
go straight to your grave.

668
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:08,457
Have you dug your own grave?

669
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,571
Yes.

670
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:11,428
Very good.

671
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,400
That's enough for now.

672
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,257
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.

673
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,171
They're delicious and quite rare.
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.

674
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:31,100
You're going to need a pig.
They're impossible to find otherwise.

675
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,514
- I know.
- Don't be long.

676
01:02:32,514 --> 01:02:34,628
- Gotta get them back in 50 minutes.
- OK.

677
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:02,600
Hello, David.

678
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,057
Hello, Robert.

679
01:03:07,142 --> 01:03:09,171
What you did to that woman was dreadful.

680
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,600
She killed my brother.

681
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:13,220
I would have done the same thing
if she'd killed you.

682
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:16,914
You're like a brother to me. Oh,
you're my best friend in the whole world.

683
01:03:17,485 --> 01:03:19,820
I don't think I'm your best friend
in the whole world.

684
01:03:20,514 --> 01:03:22,514
You used to spend much more time
with John.

685
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,942
Oh, who's John?

686
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,942
- John, the Limping Man.
- Oh, yeah.

687
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,740
I didn't even remember his name.

688
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:30,485
Or his face.

689
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,420
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.

690
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:36,971
Nevertheless, did John make it?

691
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:41,220
They're getting ready for the yacht.

692
01:03:41,514 --> 01:03:42,914
It all begins this week.

693
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,342
Everyone says they're gonna make it
as they're perfectly suited

694
01:03:46,342 --> 01:03:48,914
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing.

695
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,857
- That's great.
- You're not thinking about coming back?

696
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,914
You know, if you told the hotel manager
about your brother,

697
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,200
she'd probably forgive you.

698
01:03:56,228 --> 01:03:58,628
No, it's really nice to be on your own.

699
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,628
There's no one tying you down.

700
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:04,580
You listen to music whenever you like,
you masturbate whenever you want,

701
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,540
go for walks whenever you like,

702
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,500
have a chat whenever you like.

703
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,380
I don't miss companionship at all.

704
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:14,380
I just miss you,
'cause you were my one true friend.

705
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,600
Are you gonna shoot me?

706
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,660
I'm afraid so.

707
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,228
I only have two days left.

708
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:24,620
What did you say?
I can't understand the way you speak.

709
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:28,880
I'm going to shoot you. I only
have two days left, I need more time.

710
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:30,771
Do you actually believe another day
will make a difference?

711
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,514
Have you seen how ugly you are?

712
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:35,285
You haven't got a chance.
If I was a woman, I ...

713
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:42,720
Don't tell anyone I helped you.

714
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,260
If you want to repay me, there is a way.

715
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,540
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.

716
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,340
Do you promise?

717
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,100
- Yes.
- Bye.

718
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:53,500
Bye.

719
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,200
[In French] - Hello
- Hello

720
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:43,885
[In Fr.] -You brought what I asked for?
-Of course.

721
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,942
[Fr.] The gun is in the pocket with the electronic keys
with the numbers of the double rooms.

722
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,300
[Fr.] Try not to lose the keys, I need to return them.

723
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:05,771
[Fr.] I propose we act on Saturday.  After the ball, everyone is tired,
and most employees are gone on the week-end.

724
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:12,300
[Fr.] -And the shampoo?
-I forgot. I'll bring two bottles next time.

725
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:18,600
[Fr.] Do you know how fantastic you are?
Please make a note for the shampoo so you don't forget.

726
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,300
[Fr.] - I need to tell you something.
- What?

727
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:33,685
[Fr.] This is my last mission. I can't do it anymore.
I can't stand living in that horrible mansion with that fat dentist.

728
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:41,200
[Fr.] He keeps asking if I've flossed.  He makes me clean my
teeth after every meal, no matter how small it is.

729
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:47,700
[Fr.] After we're finished setting up for the big night,
you can come and live with us.  I'll find another mole.

730
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:53,257
[Fr.] I don't think I'll ever find someone as
efficient as you, but I need to respect your wishes.

731
01:06:53,628 --> 01:06:58,657
[Fr.] Be patient just a few more days, and don't
forget to take your birth control pill. Ok?

732
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,685
[Fr.] -Thank you.
-No, thank you. You were fantastic.

733
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:35,714
You carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head.

734
01:07:38,685 --> 01:07:44,142
You then slice open its belly and stuff it
with well-washed red and green peppers,

735
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,800
not too spicy,
and a little garlic and mint.

736
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:56,828
You then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh

737
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:02,400
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour.

738
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,885
That's my favorite food,

739
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,828
rabbit.

740
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:38,828
Woman, brunette, 50 years old.

741
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:41,980
Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.

742
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,914
My husband's away on a business trip.

743
01:10:43,942 --> 01:10:45,980
Yeah, OK. Can I have a look?

744
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:54,940
Hands.

745
01:11:04,485 --> 01:11:06,942
No dirt under her nails
or mud on her shoes.

746
01:11:07,628 --> 01:11:09,257
9 Belsize Road.

747
01:11:09,885 --> 01:11:11,514
- So your husband is away?
- Yes.

748
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:13,342
- Where?
- Far.

749
01:11:13,371 --> 01:11:15,800
Good morning, sir. Are you here alone?

750
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,542
Good morning, Officer.

751
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:20,457
No, I'm here with my partner.

752
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:24,028
She's inside one of the stores,
shopping right now.

753
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,257
Can I see your certificate, please?

754
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,660
My partner keeps it in her purse.

755
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,514
You see, I am losing it all the time.

756
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,028
I see.

757
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:37,742
And what store is she shopping in?

758
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,640
Oh, here she is.

759
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:49,360
I'm sorry, darling.

760
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,885
They had such a huge variety
of pain-relief ointment.

761
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:55,971
I bought you this one.
I hope it's the one you were looking for.

762
01:11:56,085 --> 01:11:57,680
That's wonderful, dear.

763
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,140
Can I have my certificate, please?

764
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:04,914
Of course, darling.
Would you like to see mine also, Officer?

765
01:12:05,485 --> 01:12:07,000
No, that's OK.

766
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:09,514
Thank you, sir.

767
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:12,657
- You have a good day.
- Thank you, Officer. You have a good day.

768
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,885
- Madam.
- Sir.

769
01:12:19,971 --> 01:12:23,400
If I'm walking too slowly,
just say, and I'll pick up my pace.

770
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:25,360
This pace is fine.

771
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:30,640
Maybe don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palm's getting a little sweaty.

772
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:32,400
- Better?
- Yes.

773
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,380
Much better.

774
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:38,828
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?

775
01:12:38,857 --> 01:12:43,085
Yes, contact lens solution
and a Parker Rollerball.

776
01:12:44,857 --> 01:12:46,660
I didn't know you were short-sighted.

777
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,200
I'm short-sighted too.

778
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:18,200
Will you stay a few days?

779
01:13:19,114 --> 01:13:20,828
I'm afraid not, Papa.

780
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:23,057
We're heading back again today.

781
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,714
Tomorrow I'm going away
on a business trip.

782
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:28,257
You know how demanding my job is.

783
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,220
Don't ask if I can stay a few days
every time I come.

784
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,514
Do you all work for the same company?

785
01:13:37,057 --> 01:13:38,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

786
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:42,840
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.

787
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:44,628
Do you agree?

788
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,480
- It's a rather good company.
- It is.

789
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,514
- One of the best, I'd say.
- Mm.

790
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,485
The only problem with the job

791
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:56,942
is that I don't have enough time
for my wife and kids.

792
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,457
We have four beautiful children.

793
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:06,628
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

794
01:14:06,628 --> 01:14:07,542
Thank you.

795
01:14:11,628 --> 01:14:13,780
But even if we'd never had children,

796
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,940
I would never dream of leaving my wife.

797
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:21,000
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own,

798
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,200
we'd go on trips.

799
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:28,257
We'd go to Portofino in Italy
or go to a Greek island for the summer.

800
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:33,171
And so our relationship
would be as intense as it was at the start.

801
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,360
I love my wife so much

802
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:42,040
I could die for her.

803
01:14:44,971 --> 01:14:46,640
That's how much I love her.

804
01:14:58,657 --> 01:15:00,971
For your first day in the city,
you did great.

805
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:06,600
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.

806
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,300
Thank you very much.

807
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,900
When did you become short-sighted?

808
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:24,060
When I was 16.

809
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,685
You?

810
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:27,460
When I was 12.

811
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:31,060
What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?

812
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,171
I don't remember.

813
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,900
- Do you have astigmatism too?
- Yes.

814
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,260
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back

815
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:52,657
on the bits you can't reach on your own?

816
01:15:55,257 --> 01:15:56,600
I'd like that.

817
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:13,628
Here?

818
01:16:14,257 --> 01:16:15,600
A little lower, please.

819
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:17,457
- Here?
- Yes.

820
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,300
"Hello, everyone, and good luck.

821
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,780
The room numbers are as follows:

822
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:55,314
room 306, the hotel manager
and her partner.

823
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,371
They both,

824
01:16:56,371 --> 01:16:58,228
they both have nice voices.

825
01:16:58,342 --> 01:17:01,280
Room 240: couple who both love to ski.

826
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:06,040
Room 282: couple who
both studied social sciences.

827
01:17:06,514 --> 01:17:10,000
Name of yacht Bliss:
couple prone to nosebleeds."

828
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,540
You and you take 306.

829
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,500
You and you take 240.

830
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:27,460
You take 282.

831
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,920
And you two, take the yacht.

832
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,885
Can I go to the yacht?

833
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,480
OK, then, so you take the yacht.

834
01:17:34,771 --> 01:17:36,800
And you take 282.

835
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:40,657
And us three,
we'll take the manager's room.

836
01:17:40,942 --> 01:17:42,400
We have 40 minutes.

837
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,280
You need to speak with the manager.

838
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,200
Wake up.

839
01:18:34,571 --> 01:18:35,520
Get up.

840
01:18:38,085 --> 01:18:39,460
Sit in that seat over there.

841
01:18:41,142 --> 01:18:42,700
Put your hand behind your back.

842
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:48,171
A basketball weighs
between 550 and 650 grams.

843
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,700
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

844
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,885
Yes.

845
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:57,142
The weight's different
for men's and women's games,

846
01:18:57,142 --> 01:18:59,085
but that's roughly how much it weighs.

847
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,371
Do you know how much a volleyball weighs?

848
01:19:02,057 --> 01:19:04,028
No, but I'd like to find out.

849
01:19:05,628 --> 01:19:07,571
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

850
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:09,342
I have something to tell you.

851
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:12,228
His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.

852
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:16,200
He bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood, or something like that.

853
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:19,142
Or he cuts it with a penknife
when you're not looking.

854
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,300
You two are not suited.

855
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:25,085
Shut up. Dad, tell him to leave.
I'm sleepy.

856
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,220
And, and I'm quite sure
that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood,

857
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:30,142
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup

858
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:32,660
or red watercolor paint
or something like that.

859
01:19:33,114 --> 01:19:35,171
Or beetroot juice.

860
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:38,820
Do you love her?

861
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,257
With all my heart.

862
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:47,114
How much do you love her,
on a scale of 1 to 15?

863
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:52,740
14.

864
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,320
14 is a very impressive score.

865
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,960
He loves her very much indeed.

866
01:19:59,657 --> 01:20:01,314
Who do you think we should kill?

867
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:04,314
Who will be able to live
on their own better?

868
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:13,580
Here's a knife, Mum. Kill him.

869
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,220
You'd better get out while you still can.

870
01:20:17,457 --> 01:20:18,400
OK.

871
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,940
That's all I came to say, anyway.

872
01:20:32,857 --> 01:20:33,828
You.

873
01:20:34,828 --> 01:20:38,514
If this woman dies,
d'you think you'll manage on your own?

874
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,485
Or will you get involved
with someone else?

875
01:20:40,514 --> 01:20:41,257
No.

876
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,740
I can live alone, she can't.

877
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,420
I'm on my own for hours
when she's running the hotel.

878
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,880
I like sitting in the room.

879
01:20:51,942 --> 01:20:54,400
It relaxes me, calms me.

880
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,257
I like it a lot.

881
01:20:59,657 --> 01:21:02,660
I can definitely live on my own.

882
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:04,857
Be quiet.

883
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,180
Take it.

884
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,580
Shoot her.

885
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:32,360
No.

886
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,020
No, no.

887
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:36,980
No, God, no.

888
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,285
I'm going to fucking kill your arse.

889
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:56,800
Don't you fucking care?

890
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:24,140
Where were you?

891
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,620
I was looking for you.

892
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,160
I was masturbating
behind those trees over there.

893
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,400
Why aren't you dancing?

894
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,371
My leg's a little sore.

895
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:38,320
Did you dig your grave?

896
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,000
Not yet.

897
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:42,740
I don't mean to pressure you,

898
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:45,257
or to ruin the mood
now that we're celebrating,

899
01:22:45,314 --> 01:22:47,171
but at some point you'll have to do it.

900
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,628
Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave
for you or to carry your corpse.

901
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:54,680
We'll throw some dirt over you
but that's about it.

902
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:57,171
Tomorrow find a spot you like,

903
01:22:57,657 --> 01:23:00,980
where the ground isn't too rocky,
and make a start.

904
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:05,140
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.

905
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:22,371
As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and I said to him,

906
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:27,120
"Honey, the dinner's ready.
However, I'm not sure I can eat right now.

907
01:23:27,314 --> 01:23:29,285
One of my front teeth hurts a lot.

908
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,040
Can you take a look please, dear?"

909
01:23:31,942 --> 01:23:33,742
"Yes, sure, no problem," he said.

910
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:38,320
And the minute he turned his head,
I took the drill and I shoved it into his chest.

911
01:23:41,571 --> 01:23:44,285
That story sounds really interesting
but I have to leave.

912
01:23:44,428 --> 01:23:47,257
I just remembered I left some batteries
next to a tree down there.

913
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,942
And the last thing I want is to lose them.
Sorry.

914
01:23:59,885 --> 01:24:01,942
Did you catch rabbits?

915
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:04,840
- No, someone brought me them.
- Who?

916
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:06,342
A friend of mine.

917
01:24:06,657 --> 01:24:08,400
- Do you want one?
- No.

918
01:24:10,885 --> 01:24:13,040
You don't need to accept rabbits
from other people.

919
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,280
If you need more rabbits, just ask,
and I'll bring you more.

920
01:24:18,485 --> 01:24:20,800
Catching a rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.

921
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,200
There's no need for you
to be indebted to the others.

922
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:25,400
Thank you very much.

923
01:24:26,714 --> 01:24:28,571
The man who brought you the rabbits,

924
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,857
is he short-sighted?

925
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,720
I don't know. I don't think so.

926
01:24:34,114 --> 01:24:35,080
OK.

927
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:49,060
Is that a sparrow up in that tree?

928
01:24:50,828 --> 01:24:52,460
I can't really see that far.

929
01:24:52,628 --> 01:24:54,060
But I don't think so.

930
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,171
- Are you short-sighted?
- No.

931
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:57,380
You're lying.

932
01:24:57,714 --> 01:24:58,714
It's the truth.

933
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:06,280
What does it say here?

934
01:25:07,171 --> 01:25:08,740
YKK.

935
01:25:09,257 --> 01:25:11,885
You knew that already.
All zips say the same thing.

936
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,771
I'm not short-sighted.

937
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:16,057
I don't understand
why you won't believe me.

938
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:19,171
I can see really clearly.
I used to be a pilot.

939
01:25:19,228 --> 01:25:20,940
You're wearing contact lenses.

940
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:24,428
I don't wear contact lenses.
I'm not short-sighted, I swear.

941
01:25:24,428 --> 01:25:26,914
You are.
You think I'm an idiot and can't tell.

942
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,380
Let me see.

943
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,980
Let me see. I want to see your eyes.

944
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,220
Look up.

945
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:39,942
Look up.

946
01:25:41,885 --> 01:25:42,900
Up, up.

947
01:25:44,114 --> 01:25:45,460
Look down now.

948
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,340
Look left.

949
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,300
Look right.

950
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:53,780
Up again.

951
01:26:01,228 --> 01:26:02,342
I'm sorry.

952
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:06,020
I thought you were trying to fool me.

953
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,300
I'm sorry.

954
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,640
For this synchronization exercise,
we have to fully concentrate,

955
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:20,285
as we both have to press "play"
at exactly the same time.

956
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,914
Why don't we just use one headset?

957
01:26:24,114 --> 01:26:25,720
Because that's the whole point.

958
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:27,680
This is an exercise for us.

959
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:30,640
We have to be totally synchronized.

960
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:32,371
OK.

961
01:26:38,428 --> 01:26:40,228
- I'm ready.
- OK.

962
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:46,314
Five, four, three,

963
01:26:46,885 --> 01:26:48,060
two,

964
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:54,980
♪ Where The Wild Roses Grow

965
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:23,660
♪ If I show you the roses will you follow?

966
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:29,780
♪ They call me the Wild Rose

967
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:35,340
♪ But my name is Elisa Day

968
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,220
We've developed a code
so that we can communicate with each other,

969
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:51,980
even in front of the others,
without them knowing what we are saying.

970
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:55,640
When we turn our heads to the left,
it means,

971
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:58,120
"I love you more
than anything in the world."

972
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:01,514
And when we turn our heads to the right,
it means,

973
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,542
"Watch out, we're in danger."

974
01:28:05,457 --> 01:28:08,685
We had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up

975
01:28:08,828 --> 01:28:13,457
"I love you more than anything in the world"
with "Watch out, we're in danger."

976
01:28:15,142 --> 01:28:17,514
When we raise our left arm, it means,

977
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,685
"I want to dance in your arms."

978
01:28:20,257 --> 01:28:23,685
When we make a fist and put it
behind our backs, it means,

979
01:28:23,742 --> 01:28:24,942
"Let's fuck."

980
01:28:26,485 --> 01:28:29,500
The code grew and grew as time went by.

981
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:32,885
And within a few weeks,
we could talk about almost anything

982
01:28:32,914 --> 01:28:35,100
without even opening our mouths.

983
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,371
Stop it.

984
01:30:07,657 --> 01:30:09,940
That's enough.
Show my parents some respect.

985
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,542
They are playing you music.

986
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:16,685
- That's OK.
- No, Mother, it is not OK.

987
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,085
Please continue.

988
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:22,800
Do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else?

989
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:25,280
Something else.

990
01:30:49,057 --> 01:30:51,200
Didn't her parents play beautifully?

991
01:30:54,228 --> 01:30:55,714
Yes, they did.

992
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:57,285
It was wonderful.

993
01:31:04,114 --> 01:31:06,514
We love each other and we suit each other.

994
01:31:06,714 --> 01:31:09,457
And that's the reason
why we've decided to leave the woods

995
01:31:09,485 --> 01:31:11,780
and stay together forever in the city.

996
01:31:21,371 --> 01:31:23,380
Tomorrow during the hunt,

997
01:31:23,914 --> 01:31:27,940
we're going to disappear and everyone
will think we've been captured,

998
01:31:28,257 --> 01:31:32,000
and that we're going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something.

999
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,180
I think the first thing I'm going to do

1000
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,971
when I get into the city
is buy a bathrobe.

1001
01:31:52,114 --> 01:31:56,560
And then we'll go to a pool with a
high diving board, perfect for diving.

1002
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,240
"And we'll do
lots of different things together,

1003
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:01,057
serious things, not silly ones,

1004
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:05,171
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together."

1005
01:32:05,857 --> 01:32:10,971
[In Fr.] -It stops there. There are notes
on the back, but I don't think it's important.
-Read the notes.

1006
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:17,114
"Portofino. Italian fishing village
and upmarket resort,

1007
01:32:17,142 --> 01:32:19,371
famous for its picturesque harbour.

1008
01:32:19,828 --> 01:32:21,971
Population: 439.

1009
01:32:22,457 --> 01:32:23,920
Beaches nearby:

1010
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:28,542
Paraggi Beach, Camogli,
Chiavari and Lavagna.

1011
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:33,942
Serifos: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades."

1012
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:39,314
[In Fr.] - Where did you find that?
- By the river.

1013
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:44,114
[Fr.] Give it to me. I'll take care of it.

1014
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,600
Can you imagine why I brought you
to such a quiet place today?

1015
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,028
No.

1016
01:33:07,257 --> 01:33:10,000
Because I think it's the perfect spot
for your grave.

1017
01:33:58,857 --> 01:34:00,714
Now cover yourself with soil.

1018
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,771
Use you hands.

1019
01:34:20,371 --> 01:34:21,771
Over your face too.

1020
01:34:21,885 --> 01:34:24,742
You wouldn't want your face to get
eaten by dogs, would you?

1021
01:34:52,085 --> 01:34:55,114
If you die before me,
I'll visit you as often as I can.

1022
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:57,000
I promise.

1023
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:10,980
I think we should leave right now.

1024
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,142
The three of us coming here instead of

1025
01:35:16,028 --> 01:35:18,800
two or four is very dangerous.

1026
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:22,480
Why didn't we think of that earlier?

1027
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:26,371
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us.

1028
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:31,100
I suggest that we leave
the first chance we get.

1029
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,142
Right now, in fact.

1030
01:35:35,485 --> 01:35:36,971
Don't be afraid.

1031
01:35:38,171 --> 01:35:39,900
No one will suspect a thing.

1032
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:43,640
I bet you weren't expecting this surprise.

1033
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:48,057
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it is.

1034
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:52,440
Still, I'd like a few days
just to think it over, so that

1035
01:35:53,885 --> 01:35:58,780
I could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city.

1036
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:03,420
What's there to think about?

1037
01:36:03,828 --> 01:36:07,600
If it's better to see clearly
or to be short-sighted? Is that it?

1038
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,000
That's absurd, you know that.

1039
01:36:11,410 --> 01:36:13,657
Anyway, this doctor is the best there is.

1040
01:36:13,828 --> 01:36:16,460
And it's really very difficult
to get an appointment.

1041
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:19,180
I called him months ago
to get him to see you today.

1042
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:12,828
She's blind.

1043
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,742
Thank you.

1044
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:44,114
Throw down your knife and stand up.

1045
01:37:47,314 --> 01:37:49,880
Why did you have to blind me?

1046
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:51,800
You could have blinded him.

1047
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:54,520
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1048
01:37:54,885 --> 01:37:57,000
The drugs are messing with your head.

1049
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,200
If I were you, I would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing.

1050
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,500
Now get up and give me your knife

1051
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,660
or I'll hit you and take it by force.

1052
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,942
- Here I come.
- I swear I'm going to kill you.

1053
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:26,600
Let go of my hair, you're hurting me.

1054
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,828
Just think, that when someone goes blind

1055
01:38:50,628 --> 01:38:52,700
one of the other senses

1056
01:38:53,714 --> 01:38:55,160
is heightened.

1057
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:33,742
You could also catch a dog in the woods

1058
01:39:33,857 --> 01:39:35,657
and train it to guide you.

1059
01:39:36,714 --> 01:39:38,514
Dogs can do that, you know.

1060
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:41,542
I'll help you catch a dog myself.

1061
01:39:43,257 --> 01:39:46,714
Now calm down,
or I'm going to leave you here

1062
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:50,100
and I don't think you'll manage
to find Meeting Point 2 on your own.

1063
01:40:04,028 --> 01:40:05,714
Are you enjoying the view?

1064
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,485
Sure.

1065
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:12,857
What happened to your hand?

1066
01:40:14,457 --> 01:40:19,057
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and I cut myself by accident.

1067
01:40:19,057 --> 01:40:22,257
You look handsome today,
did you get your hair cut?

1068
01:40:22,485 --> 01:40:23,520
Thank you.

1069
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:25,228
No, I didn't get a haircut.

1070
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:27,440
I'm going to get my hair cut today.

1071
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:29,000
Look what I brought you.

1072
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:32,657
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm so hungry, I'll eat it right away.

1073
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,700
It's a bigger flashlight.

1074
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

1075
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:39,314
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit.

1076
01:40:40,057 --> 01:40:42,085
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen.

1077
01:40:42,085 --> 01:40:43,060
Oh.

1078
01:40:44,428 --> 01:40:46,057
Are you ready for tonight?

1079
01:40:46,714 --> 01:40:48,360
Of course I am.

1080
01:40:52,057 --> 01:40:55,171
I want to tell you something
but please don't be angry.

1081
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:58,140
OK. What's wrong?

1082
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,600
I can't see anything.

1083
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,257
I'm blind.

1084
01:41:03,571 --> 01:41:05,000
What do you mean?

1085
01:41:06,228 --> 01:41:10,080
There's no point in lying to you,
you'll find out sooner or later.

1086
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,942
Our leader blinded me in the city.

1087
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,371
She must have realized
that I love you and you love me

1088
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:23,285
and that we were going to run away
to the city together.

1089
01:41:25,428 --> 01:41:26,571
I'm sorry.

1090
01:41:29,257 --> 01:41:30,900
You can't see at all?

1091
01:41:32,485 --> 01:41:34,140
No, not at all.

1092
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:38,080
And when you asked if I'd had my hair cut?

1093
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:42,840
I was just saying that

1094
01:41:44,714 --> 01:41:47,228
so you wouldn't realize
that I can't see.

1095
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:51,600
I'm sorry.

1096
01:41:52,485 --> 01:41:53,820
Don't cry.

1097
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:55,860
Crying will make your eyes hurt more.

1098
01:41:59,857 --> 01:42:01,428
We'll find a way.

1099
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,400
What blood type are you?

1100
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,640
B.

1101
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:38,028
♪ From the first time I saw her,
I knew she was the one

1102
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:41,485
♪ As she stared in my eyes and smiled

1103
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:45,171
♪ And her lips were the color of roses

1104
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:49,514
♪ That grew down the river
all bloody and wild

1105
01:42:54,142 --> 01:42:56,771
Do you like berries?
Blueberries, blackberries?

1106
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:58,485
- No, no.
- Mm.

1107
01:43:00,571 --> 01:43:01,885
Can you play the piano?

1108
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:03,857
No.

1109
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:12,942
Plastic cup.

1110
01:43:13,142 --> 01:43:15,485
That's right. Very good.

1111
01:43:18,342 --> 01:43:19,714
Do you speak German?

1112
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:23,800
No.

1113
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,540
I could teach you German.

1114
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,342
But it would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics,

1115
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,200
not fluently, so there's no point.

1116
01:43:33,885 --> 01:43:37,142
You know, German is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to learn,

1117
01:43:37,457 --> 01:43:40,040
because its grammar is very complicated.

1118
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:44,942
I brought you something.

1119
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:49,085
It's a fish.

1120
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:50,314
Oh.

1121
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:56,428
♪ On the second day,
I brought her a flower

1122
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:01,057
♪ She was more beautiful
than any woman I'd seen

1123
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:05,000
♪ And I said,
Do you know where the wild roses grow

1124
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:08,085
♪ So sweet and scarlet and free

1125
01:44:14,142 --> 01:44:15,120
Kiwi.

1126
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:18,171
That's right, ten out of ten again.

1127
01:44:20,428 --> 01:44:21,771
Can I give you a kiss?

1128
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:28,600
I can't thank you enough
for all the activities and games

1129
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:28,628
and for keeping me company,
I can't thank you enough
for all the activities and games

1130
01:44:28,628 --> 01:44:30,514
and for keeping me company,

1131
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:33,285
but you know we can't do that any more.

1132
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:39,914
Would you like to play another round of
Touch-Guess-Think-Win?

1133
01:44:40,057 --> 01:44:42,371
No, that's enough for today.

1134
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:46,940
In any case, I've run out of things
to test you with.

1135
01:44:47,085 --> 01:44:47,828
Oh.

1136
01:44:48,942 --> 01:44:50,400
Maybe tomorrow

1137
01:44:50,914 --> 01:44:52,960
or one of these days.

1138
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:54,485
Tomorrow morning?

1139
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:56,400
We'll see.

1140
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:03,060
- Bye.
- Bye.

1141
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:37,571
Good afternoon.

1142
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,371
How are you?

1143
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:43,057
Fine.

1144
01:45:44,514 --> 01:45:45,714
I'm hungry.

1145
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:49,120
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days.

1146
01:45:50,885 --> 01:45:52,800
Or things for me to touch and guess.

1147
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:56,171
I've got good news.

1148
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:58,285
I've had a great idea.

1149
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:00,885
Have you a minute?

1150
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:03,542
What kind of idea?

1151
01:46:06,685 --> 01:46:08,220
I raise my left foot,

1152
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:13,080
I bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice.

1153
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:17,000
I bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times.

1154
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,700
I lie face down, I kneel down.

1155
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,685
I touch my left cheek

1156
01:46:23,657 --> 01:46:24,980
and then lie face up.

1157
01:46:31,914 --> 01:46:34,240
Are you sure you're prepared to do that?

1158
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:41,520
Yes, of course I'm sure.

1159
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,120
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.

1160
01:46:49,428 --> 01:46:50,280
When?

1161
01:46:52,085 --> 01:46:53,080
Tomorrow.

1162
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,171
Tomorrow.

1163
01:48:53,742 --> 01:48:55,514
We should speed up a little.

1164
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,457
I can't go much faster.

1165
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,320
The trousers are too tight. I'm sorry.

1166
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,600
It was dark and I couldn't see clearly.

1167
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:09,060
And I didn't have time to try them on.

1168
01:49:10,057 --> 01:49:11,085
I'm sorry.

1169
01:49:13,628 --> 01:49:14,800
Never mind.

1170
01:49:18,428 --> 01:49:19,971
There's a bus coming.

1171
01:49:44,857 --> 01:49:46,400
It was the hotel coach.

1172
01:49:47,285 --> 01:49:48,657
They didn't see us.

1173
01:50:14,685 --> 01:50:15,771
Profile.

1174
01:50:26,514 --> 01:50:27,571
Fingers.

1175
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:36,857
Elbows.

1176
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,114
Would you like me to show you my belly?

1177
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,257
No.

1178
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,228
I, I remember your belly very well.

1179
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,857
Smile.

1180
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:30,580
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.

1181
01:51:30,742 --> 01:51:31,600
Certainly.

1182
01:51:45,942 --> 01:51:46,857
Thank you.

1183
01:51:56,514 --> 01:51:58,200
I'm going to do it with a knife.

1184
01:51:58,914 --> 01:52:00,628
Do you want me to come with you?

1185
01:52:00,885 --> 01:52:02,371
I'd rather you didn't.

1186
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:04,942
Don't worry.

1187
01:52:06,057 --> 01:52:09,171
It's strange at first,
but then you get used to it.

1188
01:52:10,285 --> 01:52:12,420
And your other senses are heightened --

1189
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:15,228
touch, for example, and hearing.

1190
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,114
I know.

1191
01:52:28,028 --> 01:52:29,457
I won't be long.

1192
01:53:57,114 --> 01:53:58,514
Thank you very much.
