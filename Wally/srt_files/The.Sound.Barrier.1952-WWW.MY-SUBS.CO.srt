jumped on by 20-plus Focke-Wulfs.

I tried to pull out
of a flat-out dive just now.

00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,583

Of course not, you clot,
or I wouldn't be here, would I?

29
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,499
There was a lot of buffeting too.

You know, all prospective
father-in-laws are a bit frightening.

35
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,708
- After all, mine was.
- Yours wasn't the great John Ridgefield.

36
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,874
What, just because he makes
a few aeroplanes?

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,041
A few aeroplanes? He owns
a hundred ruddy acres of factory,

38
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,583
he's a millionaire twice over
and Sue's his only daughter.

- Good.
- Why Ridgefields, though?

76
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,166
- Because I went and married a Ridgefield.
- You don't say?

77
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,583
I'm on my way now to get

- I've heard a lot about you.

I'm glad you had the sense
to pick a flyer.

you were my father-in-law.

Well, glad to meet you
and welcome to Ridgefields.

102
00:09:58,792 --> 00:09:59,833
Thank you.

103
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,791
Oh, your dad's at a board meeting.

104
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,999
I was asked to tell you
he won't see you before dinner.

105
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,291
- Are you coming to dinner?
- No, I haven't been asked.

106
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,124
- Oh.
- I suppose he wants to keep it family.

107
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,041
But you are family, Will.

108
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,874
- Of course, I'm coming to the do tonight.
- Oh, dear, is there a do?

- 12,000.

115
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,874
- 12,000?
- Yes, we've got another 8,000 at Hillbank.

117

119

Those are test-beds, aren't they?

120
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,374
Is this top-secret
going to win the war, Will?

121
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,624
A good deal more than win the war,
if you ask me.

122
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,416
- Hello, Factor, how are you?
- Very well, thank you, madam.

123
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,958
- This is my husband.
- Welcome, sir.

124
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,291
He called me madam. I realise now
I've been "Miss" for far too long.

125
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,249
I simply love being madam.

126
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,249
However hideous your threshold,
do you know what my duty is?

127
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,208
- No, what?
- I'll show you.

128
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,458
- Tony, no!
- Hang on to your hat.

129
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,958
- This could be quite a drop.
- Tony!

131
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,333
Tony, drop me.
You're not strong enough.

132
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,416
- Not strong enough?
- No, you're not.

133
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,333
- Which way?
- This way, sir.

134
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,958
- Right, here we go.
- This way.

Blimey.

139
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,208

140
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,083

141
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,083
Chris!

142
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,791
- How are you, darling?
- Hello, Sue.

143
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,958
- Meet your new brother-in-law.
- How do you do?

144
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,791
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Too late to say congratulations?

145
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,708
- Not at all.
- Congratulations.

146
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,833
- Oh, Chris, what is that?
- You ought to know. It's the RAF badge.

147
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,041
- You get it when you pass the interview.
- Oh, I had no idea.

148
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,708
I thought you were going
into the navy.

149
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,958
I've changed my mind.
Did you get my present?

150
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,874
Oh, darling, thank you so much.
It was a lovely present.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,249
- We adored it, didn't we?
- Oh, yes, rather. We adored it.

152
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,708
Good. Er, let's have a drink.

153
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,833
- What was it?
- Paperweight.

154
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,958
- When are you going in?
- About six months, I think.

155
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,583
In the meanwhile, I'm learning to fly.

156
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,666
Dad's put one of his ex-pilots on
to teaching me over at Hillbank.

157
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,874
Tiger Moth.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,416
Darling, how exciting.
Have you gone solo yet?

159
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,499
Not yet. I think I may tomorrow.

160
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,333
- Whisky?
- No, thank you, darling.

161
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,958
Not for me, thanks.
No, it's too early.

162
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,083
Since when have you taken
to swigging whisky?

163
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,833
I'm not at school now, Sue,
I'm in the RAF.

164
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,458
Well, practically, anyway.

165
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,124
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Good luck tomorrow.

166
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,749
- Thank you.
- How many hours dual have you done?

167
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,333
Rather a lot, 14.

168
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,791
That's not too bad. I remember a fellow
who did 20 before they passed him.

169
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,374
I don't suppose his name
was Ridgefield, though.

170
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,416
How many hours dual did you do
before you went solo?

171
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:10,083
Tony's an exceptional case.
One of the great geniuses of the air.

172
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,083
Ah, like Dad.

173
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,666
He went solo after only
two-and-a-half hours dual.

174
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,708
Really?

175
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,791
Would you like to know something
rather shocking? I get airsick.

176
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,499
You shouldn't worry,
you'll soon get over that.

177
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,541
- Yes?
- Yes.

178
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,249
(Chiming)

179
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,208
- What the heck is that?
- Dressing gong.

180
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,124
Chris, give me a quarter of an hour
for my bath,

181
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,999
and then come up
and talk to me, will you?

182
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,833
- I won't be a second.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:47,291
- Approve?
- Terrific.

184
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,083
He's just been telling me about
that do on the Gestapo prison.

185
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,208
You must have used a thumbscrew
to get that out of him.

186
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,708
I had to, practically.
It was a wonderful thing, Sue.

187
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,916
They had to come in at 50 feet
and fly slap down the main street.

188
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,124
But of course you'll know it all.

189
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,291
I'll be able to shoot a line
about my new brother-in-law now.

190
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,374
Looks as if I'll need one.

191
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,708
You're a bit unhappy about it all,
aren't you, darling?

192
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, no. Not really.

193
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,416
Why don't you reapply
for a ground job?

194
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,958
- What would Dad say if I did that?
- Well, does it matter?

195
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,958
You know it does.

196
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,833
Anyway, I don't want to let him down,
Sue. Heaven knows I don't.

197
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,541
- Chris.
- Hm?

198
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,874
Would you let me talk to him?

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,374
No, thanks awfully, Sue.
If anyone's got to talk to him, I've got to.

200
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,583
As a matter of fact, I half thought
I might tackle him about it tonight.

201
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,166
Not about a ground job,
I mean RAF ground job.

202
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,374
- But, well, commandos or something.
- Commandos?

203
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,749
Well, I've jolly well got to show him
it isn't a matter of guts.

204
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:02,666
Look, you're either born to fly
or you're not. I'm not, I'm really not.

205
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,458
Darling, you go downstairs
and give yourself another whisky,

206
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,708
then take him aside
and tell him exactly how you feel.

207
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:15,583
- It's going to be jolly difficult.
- Well, I'll be there behind you.

208
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:32,124
- Darling. I'd almost forgotten.
- Come on, you two.

209
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,499
Here's to you both.

210
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,166
- To us.
- To us.

211
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,291
- (J. R.) You can tell them that from me.
- Father.

212
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:43,374
(Man) I don't like it, J. R. We may find
the Ministry will never agree to it at all.

213
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,791
(J. R.) There's a simple answer.
We stop production on the 696 altogether.

214
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,999
- Nervous?
- Nervous? I'm scared stiff.

215
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,083
- I haven't a second. Good night.
- (Man) Good night, J. R.

216
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,791
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Susan.

217
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:04,249
- This is Tony.
- So, this is Tony.

218
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,208
The DFC and Bar I know about.
What's the AFC for?

219
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,291
Oh, just for bumbling around.

220
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,833
They don't usually give that
for bumbling around.

221
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,499
Well, I'm very glad
to meet you at last, Tony.

222
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,999
I must say, I'm surprised at Susan
falling for a flyer.

223
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,541
Christopher, lad,
I've just had Fletcher on the phone.

224
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,583
He says he hopes
you may go solo tomorrow.

225
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,624
- Yes, Dad, I know.
- Well done.

226
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,749
Who knows, we may make
a pilot of you yet.

227
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,666
- What time is it to be?
- At 10:30.

228
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,499
Well, let's go in.

229
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,416
You sit here, will you, Tony?
Place of honour.

230
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,749
- Quite a room, eh?
- Yes, quite a room.

231
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,833
I hope you like the pictures.
There's some of them quite well known.

232
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,958
Of course, Susan hates them all,
I know that.

233
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,374
Yes, I sent her to Oxford
to get an education,

234
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,999
and all she comes back with is
a passion for donkey-tailed daubs

235
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,208
and modernistic music.

236
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,416
Where she gets her tastes from,
I don't know.

237
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,041
- Certainly not from me or her mother.
- Mother liked modern music very much.

238
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,624
First I've heard of it.
If she did, she didn't let on to me.

239
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,999
- No.
- This is lobster Dominique.

240
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,999
A sort of speciality de la maison.

241
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,791
No, not for Mr Christopher.
He's flying tomorrow.

242
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,041
Fletcher says young Jackson's
gone solo after six hours.

243
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,083
Yes, he's rather good.

244
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:21,916
Is this fellow running a sort
of flying kindergarten over there, sir?

245
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,833
No, just the two boys.
Jackson, that's my head of airframes,

246
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:29,333
his son's waiting to go into the RAF too,
so I've let Fletcher take him on as well.

247
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,749
Won't do them any harm
to get a start, eh, Tony?

248
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,999
No, you'll probably shatter
your RAF instructor

249
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,833
by going solo in about 20 minutes.

250
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,999
That's right, something like that
won't look so bad on the record.

251
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,208
14 hours wouldn't have been so good.

252
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,666
(Distant jet engine thrust)

253
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,624
That's the same noise
we heard this afternoon.

254
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,499
- It comes from the test-beds, doesn't it?
- Yes, I heard you were asking questions.

255
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,624
Well, I tell you what. I'm giving
this party down at the works,

256
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,208
and on our way - well, you're
a member of the family now -

257
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:04,749
I don't suppose it'll do any harm
for you to have a look at our little secret.

258
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,541
(Thrust continues)

259
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,958
I think it's the most exciting sound
I've ever heard.

260
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:12,374
It isn't only the sound
that's exciting, Tony boy.

261
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,249
- Evening, Joe.
- Good evening, J. R.

262
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,874
- How's the missus?
- She's all right. That stuffs done her good.

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,374
- Told you it would. Good evening, Mike.
- Good evening, J. R.

264
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,499
Hm. Put up the lights.

265
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:39,708
- What the heck is it, sir?
- It's the aircraft engine of the future.

266
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,833
- Where's the propeller?
- There is no propeller.

267
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,749
How does it keep the aircraft
in the air, then?

268
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,708
- By propulsion.
- Propulsion?

269
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:49,624
Yes. Jet propulsion.
Come on, I'll show you.

270
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,583
You two had better stay there.

271
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,458
- By the way, don't call me sir.
- What do I call you?

272
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:01,124
Susan calls me Father, Chris calls me
Dad. You can take your choice.

273
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:08,083
Now, this is something
quite extraordinary.

274
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,749
Like all great inventions,
from the wheel to radar, perfectly simple.

275
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,208
Yes, you can smile, I know
it looks complicated, but the beauty is

276
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,583
how little there is to it
and how much power comes out of it.

277
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:23,291
Now, there's a fan here
in the front which draws in air.

278
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,999
- The air's heated here with paraffin.
- Paraffin?

279
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,874
Ordinary paraffin.
Hot air blows out here at the end.

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,333
It comes out at such terrific force
that that alone drives the aircraft.

281
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:37,416
- Who invented it? One of your men?
- No, a chap called Whittle.

282
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,458
- Whittle? Englishman?
- Yes.

283
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:44,083
We aren't the only firm working on them.
De Havilland and Rolls are ahead of us.

284
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,083
(Klaxon blares)

285
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,083
(Engine warms up)

286
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,583
(Thrust intensifies)

287
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,958
Excuse me.

288
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:09,499
(Engine turns off)

289
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,749
Well, Susie,
how do you like our new toy?

290
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,416
- What did you think of it, Chris lad?
- Wizard, wasn't it?

291
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,958
- Wizard, Dad.
- Come on, we'll be late for the party.

292
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,499
Come on, now.

293
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,541
Come on.

294
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,124
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, J. R.

295
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:45,083
I'm getting out now.
Are you ready for the joyride?

296
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,249
Yes.

297
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,749
Sure you wouldn't like to have
another circuit with me?

298
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,124
No, thanks.

299
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,166
You'd rather not have me bawling
in your ear, eh, I suppose?

300
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,541
- Are we in time, Chris?
- Bang on.

301
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,583
- Thanks for coming.
- Is that your rival?

302
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:06,041
Yes. Good approach.

303
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,791
- Good morning, Fletcher.
- Morning.

304
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,541
- Have some food with us afterwards.
- Thanks, I'd love to.

305
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:14,291
- All set?
- There's nothing to it.

306
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,208
All the best, darling.

307
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:21,874
By the way, Ridgefield, just for once
you can make any sort of landing you like.

308
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,666
I'm going to have a drink.
Only try to get her down in one piece,

309
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,333
there's a good chap.

310
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,333
(Engine purrs)

311
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,416
A very bad turn.

312
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,708
Hm, better.

313
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,166
Hasn't he learned anything at all?

314
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:24,041
He'll be all right.
You can't get hurt from those things.

315
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,749
(Alarm wailing)

316
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,208
Sue!

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,916
- Chris!
- Sue! Sue, stay here!

318
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,833
(Man) Quickly!

319
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,791
(♪ MALCOLM ARNOLD:
"The Sound Barrier")

320
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,374
(Music over dialogue)

321
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,041
What about that?

322
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,374
Why, it's fantastic.

323
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,583
- It's the future 901?
- That's it.

324
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,874
- What's her landing speed?
- It's high at the moment,

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,208
but we're working on that.

326
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,749
Well, I have to go to the works at 1:00
so I shan't be back before your train goes,

327
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,708
so I'll say goodbye now.

328
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,833
Goodbye, Tony, it's nice to have you
in the family. Especially now.

329
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,624
Thanks, it's nice being in the family.

330
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,208
- Come and see me again soon.
- I will.

331
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:09,583
You... You know how I feel
about this awful business.

332
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,416
Mm. I had Fletcher
on the phone today,

333
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,291
he says it need never
have caught fire at all

334
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,416
if he hadn't forgotten
to switch off.

335
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:21,083
- Heaven knows he had plenty of time.
- Here, I'm awfully sorry.

336
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,166
- What are your plans for after the war?
- Plans?

337
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,416
I only ask because
if you've nothing definite in mind,

338
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:29,374
I'd like you to know there's always
a job at Ridgefields for you.

339
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,708
- Well, what sort of a job?
- (He chuckles)

340
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,624
- You mean... test pilot?
- Well, that's the thing I had in mind.

341
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:46,208
Well, don't say anything now.
Think it over. You've plenty of time.

342
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,791
- Well, goodbye, Sue.
- Goodbye, Father.

343
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,249
Write to me and let me know.

344
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:03,708
- Would you like a drink, darling?
- No, thank you.

345
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,874
(Aeroplane overhead)

346
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,333
(Tony) 'Ridgefield Tower,

- What-ho.
- What-ho.

375
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:08,124
- How was the wonder kite?
- What do you think?

376
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,291
- Can I take her out tomorrow?
- No, Windy. She's my baby.

377
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,916
- I've nothing on AM.
- Oh, yes, you have. I've got a job for you.

378
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,541
I promised to deliver a Vampire
for De Havillands.

379
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:20,958
- Where to?
- Cairo.

380
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:24,124
Cai... Cairo! Ooh, whizzo!

381
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,416
- (Phone rings)
- Er, don't tell the wife.

382
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:29,874
Hello? Hello, darling.

383
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,124
Yes, just a few minutes ago.
Hey, what's for dinner?

384
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:39,249
No. Piece of cake.
No, really.

385
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,208
I shan't be long.
Goodbye.

386
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,958
- Here, Windy, let's have that back.
- Here, I say...

387
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:49,916
I just remembered
there's a type I know in Cairo

388
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,624
and I could do with a little sun myself.

389
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,874
Never mind, you have a nice
quiet weekend at Shoreham.

390
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,166
- Well, how was it?
- All right.

391
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,291
- Did you take her flat out?
- No, nothing like.

392
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,166
- Pity.
- Why pity?

393
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,916
I thought our intrepid air ace might be
the first man through the sound barrier.

394
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,083
There ain't no such thing.

395
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,833
You ought to check up
on your supersonics,

396
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,708
not to mention the popular press.

397
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,958
What's so ruddy peculiar
about the speed of sound?

398
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,249
We all know exactly what it is,
don't we?

399
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,624
750 miles per hour
at ground level.

400
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,291
If we go slower than that,
we can hear ourselves going,

401
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,874
and if we go faster,
we can hear ourselves coming.

402
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,541
It's a mere matter of acoustics.

403
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,833
- Hello, Miss Mitchell.
- Good afternoon.

404
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:49,333
(Tony's voice) '19,000, Mach 0.7.

405
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,249
'Slight buffeting commencing on wings.

406
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:57,124
'18,500. Buffeting increasing.

407
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:02,041
'17,500. Mach 0.8.
Buffeting's rather bad.'

408
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,833
She's shaking to pieces.
The whole ruddy issue's disintegrating.

409
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,583
Don't do that.
You'll give me heart failure.

410
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,333
'I'm throttling back and pulling out.'

411
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,333
What an exquisite voice I do have,
to be sure.

412
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:16,249
- Coming for a drink?
- No, got too much work to do.

413
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:19,874
How's the 902 coming along?

414
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,458
I want J. R. to find a name for her.

415
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,416
Something that would suggest
the highest speed yet flown.

416
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:33,541
- How about the "Line Shoot"?
- There won't be any line shoot about her.

417
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,874
- She'll do it all right.
- Do what?

418
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,583
The speed of sound.

419
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,166
What would happen if you put
the wings on back to front?

420
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,874
Oh, go away. Go away.

421
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:55,958
- Will...
- What?

422
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,624
- Seriously...
- Uh-huh.

423
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,416
Apart from the buffeting
and heavy controls

424
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,583
and general wangling about
and other little things we know about...

425
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:10,874
what exactly does happen
to an aeroplane at the speed of sound?

426
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:16,708
I don't know.
And shall I tell you something, Tony?

427
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,083
- What?
- No one else in the world does either.

428
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,791
- Darling?
- Cooee!

429
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,458
- How was it?
- Piece of cake.

430
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,624
It's always a piece of cake.

431
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,124
- Sherry?
- A little one.

432
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,749
- What was your day like?
- Pretty good.

433
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,291
- Tony?
- Uh-huh?

434
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,583
- I've got the most wonderful news.
- Have you?

435
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,916
Two bits of wonderful news, in fact.

436
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:13,374
Only one's not quite so wonderful
as the other.

437
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,041
- So I'll start with the less wonderful.
- Uh-huh.

438
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,999
You know that little house
at Andrew's Corner, Broom Cottage?

439
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,291
- Mm-hm?
- I think we can have it.

440
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:26,416
- But that belongs to that fellow Franklin.
- Mm, but he's leaving.

441
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:31,583
- Oh. But this place isn't so bad, is it?
- No, of course not.

442
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,999
But, darling, don't you see
what a difference it would make

443
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,916
if we had a place
that really belonged to us?

444
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:39,666
Oh, I see all that.
But the old man will hate us leaving him.

445
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,541
- He'll hate you leaving him.
- He'll hate his daughter leaving him too.

446
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,499
Oh, darling, don't you yet know
after two years

447
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,458
what Father and I really feel
about each other?

448
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:50,499
- I know you don't exactly see eye to eye...
- Eye to eye?

449
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,874
He's always despised me
for not being born a son.

450
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,999
- Darling...
- It's true.

451
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,624
Just as later he despised Chris

452
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,166
for not turning out
the sort of sort of son he wanted.

453
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,166
Well, I can't despise him in return,
because I admire him.

454
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:08,666
I admire him tremendously
for what he's done.

455
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:14,249
As for what he is... Well, all I can say,
it's best I should live out of his house.

456
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,749
(♪ Gentle piano music)

457
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
What was the other
wonderful piece of news?

458
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,916
It'll keep.

459
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,958
Dinner.

460
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,541
Were there any other symptoms
besides this buffeting?

461
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:40,374
Well, I noticed that the controls got...
hard at Mach 0.85, in rather a funny way.

462
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,124
- What height was that?
- 18,000.

463
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,583
Hm. There's no doubt about it,
we're just on the fringe of the problem.

464
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,583
- Father?
- Mm?

465
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:53,499
- What problem?
- Supersonics.

466
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,166
- The sound barrier?
- Yes. That's a newspaper phrase.

467
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,916
And like most of them,
pretty misleading.

468
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,208
- You mean there isn't a barrier?
- Oh, there's a barrier all right.

469
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:07,041
But it's... spread out,
on either side of the speed of sound,

470
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:11,499
- from roughly between Mach 0.85...
- Mach? What Mach?

471
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:15,791
You see, it's a way we have of measuring
the speeds at which we fly.

472
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:19,333
We no longer fly at miles per hour,
we fly at Mach numbers.

473
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,458
Now, Mach 1 is the speed of sound.

474
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,958
But why sound?

475
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,749
What makes a barrier?
Is it sound?

476
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,249
- It's a combination...
- It's air.

477
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:35,458
You see, Sue, there's a limit
to the speed at which air itself can move.

478
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:40,541
Now, this rule's travelling
at 30 mile an hour, let's say.

479
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,541
(Swishing)

480
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,833
You can hear the air whistle
as it moves out of its way.

481
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,249
But if it were travelling
at 750 mile an hour,

482
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,416
the speed of sound, Mach 1,

483
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,791
the air could no longer
move out of its way,

484
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,916
because it just can't move that fast.

485
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:01,458
It'd pile up in front of the rule,
or the aircraft,

486
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,791
making, if you like, a barrier.

487
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,708
Now, we don't exactly know
what happens to an aircraft

488
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:10,249
when it gets into these conditions.

489
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,958
Tony knows it buffets
as he gets near to them.

490
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:16,958
Some say the craft would go
right out of control,

491
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:20,791
others that it'll break up altogether.
Now, I don't believe that, Sue.

492
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:24,916
I believe that with the right aircraft
and the right man,

493
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,624
we can force our way
through this barrier,

494
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,333
and once through, there is a world.

495
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:37,916
A whole new world, with speeds
of 1,500 to 2,000 mile an hour,

496
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,791
within the grasp of man.

497
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,541
And Tony here may be the first man
to see that new world.

498
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,916
Well, let's go, shall we?

499
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,791
Do you think the Americans
will beat us to it?

500
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:54,833
They may, but we're two years ahead
in jet-engine development.

501
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:58,124
I think it's between ourselves, Vickers
and De Havillands at the moment.

502
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,166
It's a pity De Havillands will have
their 108 up before our 902.

503
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:05,749
Oh, by the way, Will wants a name
for her. Got any ideas, Dad?

504
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:10,249
- Yes. Prometheus.
- Prometheus? Who was he?

505
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:13,708
- (Susan) He was a Greek god.
- Who stole fire from heaven.

506
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,916
Oh, yes, I remember.
Came to a sticky end, didn't he?

507
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,458
He did. But the world got fire.

508
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,958
How long before I can have a crack
at this thing, Dad?

509
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,458
Not long, but you've got quite
a bit of homework to do first.

510
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,291
You'd better get started
right away.

511
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,916
"A Theory of Supersonic Shockwaves."
I shan't understand a word of this.

512
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:35,124
There's nothing to understand.
That's the trouble.

513
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,166
That fellow spends 50 pages
telling us he doesn't know a thing.

514
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:41,583
- But you'd better read it, all the same.
- I shall need you to do some explaining.

515
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,916
You go up to the observatory,
I'll be with you in a minute.

516
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,708
All right.

517
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,999
- How's the new telescope working?
- It's good, but it might be better.

518
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:53,958
I think one day I'll build myself
a proper observatory out in the park.

519
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:57,416
- Father, answer me a question, will you?
- Yes?

520
00:42:59,084 --> 00:43:01,999
Is the ability to travel
at 2,000 miles an hour

521
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,541
going to be a blessing
to the human race?

522
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,749
Well, I'd say that's up
to the human race.

523
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:12,083
As a member of it,
I can't feel unduly optimistic.

524
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:17,333
In fact, if that's all that lies
beyond this barrier,

525
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:20,333
what purpose is there
in risking lives to pierce it?

526
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:27,291
Well, I could talk about national security,
beating the potential enemy bomber,

527
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:31,166
flying to New York in two hours,
but that's not the real point.

528
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,583
The real point is,
it's just got to be done.

529
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,083
What purpose did Scott have
in going to the South Pole?

530
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:44,083
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew.

531
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:50,458
Hm. This coffee's bitter.

532
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:58,291
Yes, I got it at Weymouth's
in the high street.

533
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,416
Franklin tells me
you've been looking at his house.

534
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,249
Yes, Father, I made him an offer.

535
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:07,708
That house is not suitable either
for my daughter or my chief test pilot.

536
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:10,999
Franklin won't accept your offer.

537
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,249
- How do you know?
- For, my dear Susan,

538
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,749
Mr Franklin likes
his present job very much.

539
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:21,708
And I have no doubt, no doubt at all,
he'll be anxious to keep it.

540
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:35,999
Goodnight, darling.

541
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,083
- Tony?
- Mm?

542
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:42,874
Will you try not to use
"piece of cake" talk for a moment?

543
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,416
I'll try not to.

544
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,291
How dangerous is it going to be?

545
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:54,458
Well, exploring the unknown
must always be a little... chancy.

546
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,041
Yes, I see.

547
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:00,666
Darling?

548
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,833
I did go and see the doctor
this morning.

549
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,291
When?

550
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:15,666
- End of December.
- Oh, how clever of you.

551
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:18,041
We'll save money on
the little brat's birthday presents.

552
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,708
Certainly not. Even if arrives on
Christmas Day, he will still get two lots.

553
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,124
We might give him
a false birthday in June.

554
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,499
That's right, darling. Say "him".
Say "him" whenever you think about it.

555
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,208
A psychologist chap I know says
there is something in that theory.

556
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:32,541
- Tony?
- What?

557
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,749
Must it be you?
This sound barrier...

558
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,624
- Must it be you?
- Yes, darling, I'm afraid it must.

559
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:44,833
- Couldn't someone else?
- No, Sue, it's my pigeon.

560
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:51,833
I promised myself when you took this job
that I'd never nag you about it, Tony,

561
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:56,666
and I really wouldn't have done
if you'd just gone on testing aeroplanes,

562
00:45:56,792 --> 00:46:00,333
but I find now I'm married
not only to a test pilot,

563
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:06,458
but married to an explorer as well.
It's a bit unfair, Tony, really it is.

564
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:08,499
Darling, I hate it.

565
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,291
I'll think about it, darling,
I promise you.

566
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:13,458
I'll think most awfully hard about it.

567
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:20,791
- Hey. Do you remember Philip Peel?
- Of course.

568
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,083
Like to fly with me tomorrow
and have lunch with him?

569
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:28,041
- Fly... Hey, will he be all right?
- According to modern theory, yes.

570
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:31,458
- He'd like to very much.
- Good.

571
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:35,833
(Whispers) Now, it's strictly unofficial,
so not a word to anyone.

572
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,583
Not even Dad.
We should be back by dinner.

573
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,916
- All right?
- Yes.

574
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,958
- Where are we going, Tony?
- Cairo.

575
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:53,374
- Funny, I thought you said Cairo.
- Oh, I did say Cairo.

576
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,124
Don't be silly.

577
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,541
(Tony) You all right?

578
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,333
Fine.

579
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:21,333
Ridgefield Tower from Glassjar 1 -0,
clear for take-off?

580
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,708
1 -0, clear for take-off.
Have a good time.

581
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,416
(Engine revs up)

582
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,874
We're starting to climb now.
We use too much fuel down here.

583
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,166
- How high are we going?
- About 40,000.

584
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:26,666
Eight miles.

585
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:36,541
- Is our engine all right?
- I think so. Why?

586
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,916
- I can hardly hear it.
- (Tony chuckles)

587
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:45,499
Glassjar 1 -0, this is Ridgefield Tower.
Transmit for a fix.

588
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:51,374
(Tony) 'Ridgefield Tower,
this is Glassjar 1 -0 transmitting for a fix.

589
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,416
'On course, 156,
altitude 25,000 feet. Over.'

590
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,083
(Controller) Your position is Dover.

591
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:10,541
Darling. France.
Cap Gris-Nez.

592
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,749
Belgium, and Holland on the horizon.

593
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,083
Paris.

594
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:32,458
There you are. See the Arc de Triomphe
and all the avenues branching off it?

595
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:37,291
- (Susan) I can't see the Eiffel Tower.
- Well, look ahead, you can see the Alps.

596
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,791
We'll go over the top
if the weather's OK.

597
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,416
Geneva Tower,
this is Glassjar 1 -0.

598
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,791
Mediterranean.

599
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,749
You'll be able to see Athens
in a moment.

600
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:43,041
(Susan) The Earth is beginning to look
awfully small and insignificant.

601
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:46,499
- I don't know that I like it.
- You're being old-fashioned, darling.

602
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,249
Why worry about the poor old Earth?
Look up there!

603
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,624
There's our future. Space.
You can't make that insignificant.

604
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,916
Down there's had it.

605
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,249
(Jet engine overhead)

606
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,833
Hey. There's the Comet.

607
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:53,791
- One ladder!
- You're lucky to have one.

608
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,541
(Man) Tony!

609
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,333
Phil!

610
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,083
- It's good to see you.
- How are you?

611
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:04,208
- And Sue, how are you?
- Wonderfully well, Phil.

612
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:05,541
Isn't this exciting?

613
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,041
- Good trip?
- Piece of cake.

614
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,958
I see you haven't widened
his vocabulary much.

615
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:14,958
- I say, this is the Vampire, isn't it?
- Uh-huh. Night fighter.

616
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,499
I suppose I couldn't take her
on a quick circuit, could I?

617
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,499
No, you certainly couldn't.

618
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,749
I always said you'd get bored
becoming an oil magnate.

619
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,124
I'm not bored with it.

620
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,874
It's just that I haven't flown anything
for 18 months, that's all.

621
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,791
If you want to fly,
you'd better take that job at Ridgefields.

622
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,583
The offer's still open.

623
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:35,333
I'd better go and check in
at the flight office.

624
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:38,208
- Look, meet us over there by the Jeep.
- Ah-ha. OK.

625
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,499
- What job at Ridgefields, Philip?
- Test pilot.

626
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:45,458
He mentioned it in his last letter,
but I didn't take him seriously.

627
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:47,874
I didn't think he was high enough
to scatter jobs about.

628
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,624
- He is, you know.
- Does he get on with the great man?

629
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,624
- He calls him Dad.
- Oh.

630
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,708
Phew, it's hot.

631
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,666
Oh, Tony, why did you bring
that awful thing?

632
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,124
You know how I hate it.

633
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,333
When I got your wire,
I thought you must be tight.

634
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,499
I probably was.

635
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:10,124
- I say, how are you going to get back?
- Get back? Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

636
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:14,291
Why don't you try going by sea?
It's a nice restful trip. Only 15 days.

637
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:18,416
- Fifteen...? Tony, you mean to say...?
- Don't worry, we'll think of something.

638
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,791
Why not ask Cunningham?

639
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:22,208
He tests the Comet between here
and London most days.

640
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:25,041
No, rival firm.
No, we'll catch a lift somewhere.

641
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:27,624
Hey, where are you taking us
for lunch?

642
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,708
To an open-air place.
Jess is meeting us there.

643
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:31,458
- Oh, good.
- It's the best food in Cairo.

644
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,624
Hooray!

645
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,958
To think you were in England only
this morning, it seems like a miracle.

646
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:39,333
I can't quite believe it myself.

647
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:41,666
- I'm so glad, Jess, to meet you at last.
- So am I.

648
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,041
I can never realise
you don't know each other.

649
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,708
- Here's to us.
- (All) To us.

650
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:49,708
- How are the children?
- Fine, thank you.

651
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:53,124
- Isn't that Cunningham?
- Yes, I think it is.

652
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,541
Darling, do you think I ought to swallow
my pride and cadge that lift home?

653
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,666
I certainly do.
If we have to go back by boat,

654
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:02,958
I shall be wearing these trousers
for a fortnight.

655
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,999
(Engines roar)

656
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,624
How much would they pay you
as a test pilot?

657
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,541
What? Oh, about 200 a year less
than I'm getting at the moment.

658
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:18,541
Oh well, I expect
we'll manage somehow.

659
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:22,708
They're off!

660
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:44,333
Home. In five hours.

661
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,374
Thanks, John,
she's a nice steady old crate.

662
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,291
(John) Go on!

663
00:55:56,417 --> 00:56:00,958
- Who was it said, "Oh, to be in England"?
- Browning. But he wasn't!

664
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:09,458
- Oh, Tony, it was a wonderful trip.
- I knew you'd love it.

665
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:12,999
Love it? I shall treasure it
all my life. Every single moment.

666
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,958
Darling, stop a minute, will you?

667
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:17,083
(Whistles) Paper.

668
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,166
Thank you.

669
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:24,374
I remember you telling me once that one
of the reasons you love flying so much

670
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,708
was that you found
a sort of peace up there

671
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,291
that you couldn't find
anywhere on Earth.

672
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,249
When we seemed to be hanging
up there between heaven and Earth,

673
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:35,458
I found a strange,
secure sort of peace too.

674
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:39,083
Almost like the feeling one gets in
one of those especially comfy dreams.

675
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,374
I never thought it would be like that.

676
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,708
Darling, will you stop
at the office block for a moment?

677
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,999
- I want to see Dad about something.
- Of course.

678
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,208
I've just spoken to them.

679
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:54,333
- And do they know what happened?
- No more than you read there.

680
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:55,583
And what speed?

681
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,458
The fastest yet achieved
anywhere on Earth.

682
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:09,333
"Disintegrated... Wreckage lies
scattered over a mile-wide area."

683
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:14,249
It looks as if it really
had exploded in the air.

684
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,416
- But they must know more than this.
- They don't. There's nothing left to tell.

685
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:22,041
- They may have hit something.
- Aye, he hit something, all right.

686
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,791
He hit the speed of sound.

687
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:28,958
Well, it looks as if I might
have been wrong after all.

688
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:30,624
You can't get through this thing.

689
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,999
That was a great aircraft,
flown by a great pilot.

690
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,166
- Yes, I know.
- Well...

691
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:39,499
Do we go on?

692
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,583
Well, that's for you to decide, isn't it?

693
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,083
Yes, I suppose it is.

694
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,999
I wanted to know
how you feel about it.

695
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,583
Could we get a full report on all this
and could I look at it? It might help us.

696
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,249
Oh, and if you're sending a wire,
you might put my name on it too.

697
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,208
He was a good bloke,
old Geoffrey.

698
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:23,958
I'd better say it at once. I'm going on
with this sound-barrier business.

699
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:26,999
Why, Tony?

700
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:30,708
It's difficult to explain.

701
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:33,833
I just feel it's got to be done,
that's all.

702
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,499
By you?

703
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,499
Yes, by me.

704
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,833
Was... he married?

705
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,583
Yes, I believe he was.

706
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,833
Is there anything I can say
that will stop you, Tony?

707
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:07,458
No, Sue. Nothing.

708
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:10,541
Don't you see, I...
I can't let the show down now?

709
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:14,708
Let the show down? Is there no thought
in your mind of letting me down, or him?

710
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:18,291
- Oh, Sue...
- If only I could understand, Tony.

711
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,874
But I can't, you see.

712
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,958
I can only see a great wall
in the sky

713
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,791
strong enough
to smash an aircraft to pieces.

714
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:29,708
And beyond it, nothing.
Nothing at all.

715
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:35,416
I'm sorry, Sue.

716
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,208
Darling...

717
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:48,041
I promise you
I did mean to speak to Dad

718
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,833
and ask him whether I mightn't
give up this job, but after...

719
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,666
Well, after this, how could I?

720
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:57,041
Don't you see what he'd
have felt about me if I had?

721
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,708
I've heard those words before, Tony.

722
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:03,083
Christopher said them to me
the night before he was killed.

723
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:07,249
He was scared too
Father might think he was a coward.

724
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,708
Oh, it isn't that.

725
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:12,874
It's just... I don't want him to think
I'm ratting on a job

726
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,874
because someone else
got killed doing it.

727
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,583
- Where are you going?
- I can't face him tonight.

728
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:22,583
- Oh, darling.
- Leave me alone.

729
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:34,458
Oh, Sue is not feeling very well.
She's not coming down.

730
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:37,124
Oh. Sorry.

731
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:53,499
You know,
when I first started flying,

732
01:00:53,625 --> 01:01:00,291
some people, religious people,
thought what we were doing was wrong.

733
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:03,833
They thought it was
breaking a law of nature.

734
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:07,666
Sounds funny now, of course,
but they used to say,

735
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,874
"If God had meant us to fly,
he'd have given us wings."

736
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:16,708
Now, this sound barrier...

737
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:22,666
People might feel again that God had
put it there for his own good purpose.

738
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:27,916
That it can't be broken.
That it would be wrong to try.

739
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:35,541
Now, I wouldn't blame anyone
who believed that. I...

740
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:37,958
I wouldn't blame them at all.

741
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:42,499
Do you believe that, Tony?

742
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:46,208
No, Dad. If I believe anything,
it's the exact opposite.

743
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,999
Oh, if only I were 30 years younger.

744
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,583
Well, sorry about Sue.
We'll get Factor to send her up a tray.

745
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:57,833
Let's go in, shall we?

746
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:04,624
(♪ MALCOLM ARNOLD:
"The Sound Barrier")

747
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:46,166
(Engine roars)

748
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,916
(Intensifying engine thrust)

749
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:46,166
(Jet engine thrust)

750
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,416
- (Doorbell rings)
- (Boy) Mummy, somebody at the door.

751
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:02,916
Yes, dear, I know.

752
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:07,749
Oh, Sally, don't play on the stairs, dear.
I've told you before.

753
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:14,208
- Hello, Jess. Am I disturbing you?
- No, of course not. Do come in.

754
01:05:14,334 --> 01:05:17,083
I was shopping
and I thought I'd drop in.

755
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,083
- Hello, Bobby.
- I made this.

756
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:20,833
Oh, isn't that lovely?

757
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:24,499
Jess, I wanted to speak to Philip
rather urgently. Is he in?

758
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:27,499
No, but he'll be back quite soon,
I expect. Let's go in here.

759
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:31,708
Oh, I do think
you've done this charmingly.

760
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:34,874
You know this is the house
I'd set my heart on, don't you?

761
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,041
Why did you want this when you've got
that big house almost to yourselves?

762
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,166
I just did.

763
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,208
Here he is and I haven't got
the pie in the oven. Excuse me.

764
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:45,874
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, sweetie.

765
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,124
- Look who's here again. Isn't that nice?
- Oh.

766
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,124
I'm just getting lunch.

767
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,916
- Hello.
- Hello. I was passing and I thought...

768
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:57,833
Well, it was a nice thought.
Come on, come and sit down.

769
01:05:57,959 --> 01:05:59,499
- How was the flight?
- Wonderful.

770
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,541
Tony was kind
about my flying too.

771
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:04,041
- No regrets, then?
- None at all.

772
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,624
Why does everyone I'm fond of
have to be a test pilot?

773
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,958
Why can't they sit in offices
like the rest of humanity?

774
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:11,458
The rest of humanity
doesn't know what it's missing.

775
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,958
(Jet engine overhead)

776
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:22,999
When Tony's flying these days...
I try to go to the cinema.

777
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,333
You can't hear the sound
so clearly in there.

778
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,374
Philip...

779
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,916
How does Jess feel about all this?

780
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:35,749
Oh, I think she accepts it
just as a job like any other.

781
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,958
I wish I were like Jess.
I'm not very brave, I'm afraid.

782
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,791
When's he testing
the Prometheus at full speed?

783
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:48,624
- I don't know.
- You do, I think.

784
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,791
But perhaps
it's best you shouldn't tell.

785
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:57,166
- What's he doing at this minute?
- He's up for half an hour on a routine test.

786
01:06:57,292 --> 01:07:00,749
- Will you stay for lunch?
- Oh, won't that be difficult for Jess?

787
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,749
- Has she enough?
- She'll manage somehow.

788
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:08,374
Susan, you mustn't worry, you know.
There's no better pilot in this country.

789
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:17,083
Philip, I believe to have courage,
one must also have understanding.

790
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,749
If only I could understand
the purpose of it all.

791
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:26,999
You know, I don't think that sort
of understanding comes from up here.

792
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,583
Only from here.

793
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,833
Oh, Jess, lay on another place,
will you? Susan's staying for lunch.

794
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:39,833
- Well?
- Tomorrow at 3:00.

795
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:42,291
- What, the full test?
- Yeah.

796
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,791
That's good work, Will.

797
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,666
She's still nose-heavy
over Mach 0.90.

798
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:56,458
- Well, give up the test if you're worried.
- Of course I'm worried! Wouldn't you be?

799
01:07:56,584 --> 01:07:59,874
Tony says it's not serious.
He can correct easily.

800
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,249
He doesn't want to wait any longer.
Nor do I.

801
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:05,041
- You need a rest, Will.
- Of course I need a rest!

802
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:08,249
I've needed a rest for over 35 years.

803
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,083
- Give me a drink.
- You know where to find it.

804
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:21,791
- Where is Tony now?
- He's over with the new test pilot.

805
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:25,374
That boy's a good flyer, by the way.
Tony says he's better than him.

806
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,541
That's not true.
No one's better than Tony.

807
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:34,499
Tony hasn't got it up here.
That's what a pilot needs nowadays.

808
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,374
Brains and imagination.

809
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,958
- Isn't that what they've always needed?
- Maybe. Well, here's hoping.

810
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,958
(Jet engine overhead)

811
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:04,458
- Well, what is it, Dad?
- A galaxy in Andromeda.

812
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:11,916
- And how far away is that?
- Oh, about 700,000 light years.

813
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,583
You mean that what I am seeing now

814
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:16,708
is the way this galaxy looked
700,000 years ago?

815
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:19,624
- That's right.
- Hm.

816
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:24,624
- I'm looking at the past, then, aren't I?
- In a manner of speaking.

817
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,374
- Is there a way of looking into the future?
- Yes.

818
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,791
- How?
- Through that telescope.

819
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,666
What you see there is the past,
the present and the future, all in one.

820
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:45,333
The process of continuous creation.
Stars die, stars are born.

821
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:48,041
No beginning, no end.

822
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,041
Yes, you can see into the future
out there, all right.

823
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,208
- Nice hobby you've got here.
- Passes the time.

824
01:09:57,334 --> 01:10:00,833
- Well, goodnight.
- Tony?

825
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:06,166
- You hardly knew Christopher, did you?
- Well, just that one night.

826
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,958
Susan blames me for his death,
doesn't she?

827
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:15,166
Oh, that you needn't answer.
I know she does.

828
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:20,874
I just wondered if you blame me too.
You can tell me the truth, I can take it.

829
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,458
Do you, Tony?

830
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:25,624
No.

831
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:32,416
Hm. Well, goodnight, Tony boy.
Happy landings for tomorrow.

832
01:10:33,542 --> 01:10:34,999
Piece of cake.

833
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:51,416
Oh, sorry, darling.
I didn't mean to wake you.

834
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:56,166
- You're very late, Tony.
- I've been gassing with the old man.

835
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:59,291
Are you flying tomorrow?

836
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:03,208
Just the usual bumble around.

837
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,958
- What time?
- Three o'clock.

838
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,958
- I'll see that film at the Palace.
- Mm.

839
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,708
It's a good one, I hear.

840
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,208
- Darling?
- Mm-hm?

841
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:19,458
Do you mind if we call him John?

842
01:11:21,584 --> 01:11:23,333
I think I do.

843
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,916
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, my love.

844
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,333
- Pity.
- What?

845
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:37,416
- That I didn't meet you ten years ago.
- Why?

846
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,624
I'd have had ten years longer
of being married to you.

847
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,583
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

848
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:57,291
Tony?

849
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:04,499
Oh, Tony.

850
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:11,916
Crash crew, this is Control, testing.
How do you hear me?

851
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:16,583
Roger. Stand by in crash position
on runway 2-0.

852
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,708
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

853
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,041
(Jet engines revving)

854
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,874
(Tweeting)

855
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:15,833
(Tony) 'Ridgefield Tower
from Glassjar 1 -0. Clear for take-off?'

856
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,416

857
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:19,124

860
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:44,083
(Tony) 'Ridgefield Tower,
this is Glassjar 1 -0.

Flying level 30,000 feet.

Conditions pretty near perfect.
Visibility unlimited.

01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,999
I'm going up another ten to 40,000.

OK, here we go.

869
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:18,541
Mach 0.90.

870
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,916
No buffeting, trim correct,
increasing speed.

(Intense buffeting and thrust)

875

Port wing dropping!
Air brakes open! Throttling back!

876
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,124
(Grunts and moans)

877
01:18:03,792 --> 01:18:08,124
(Tony) 'OK.
At that speed, nothing serious.

'Right, I'm going up
to 40,000 feet again for the full go.'

880
01:18:23,584 --> 01:18:25,749
Hello, Tony, this is Will.

881
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:28,791
Did you correct that nose-heavy trim
before opening air brakes?

882
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:31,416
All right, Will, you old hen.

883
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:34,916
Everything you said would happen
did happen. All in order, don't fuss.

884
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,708
What about your nose-heavy trim?
Did you correct?

885
01:18:37,834 --> 01:18:42,874
'Of course I corrected.
I told you I was climbing again, didn't I?'

886
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:18,374
OK, 40,000. Straight and level.

887
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,249
All set. Hang on a minute.

888

- Bail out.

It's coming up to Mach 1!

898
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,083
Bail out. Bail out!

899
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,749
(He screams)

900
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,249
Tony!

901
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,874
(Alarm wails)

902
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:12,124
(Controller) Crash, square able 7.

903

01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:16,374
(Moans)

907
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,249
Get back!

908
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:29,749
- Why did you come here?
- I wanted to.

909
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,916
I wanted to.

910
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,083
Halt!

911
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:43,541
(She pants)

912
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:45,958
Here, you'd better sit down.

913
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,708
- Is... Is Father here?
- No.

914
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:55,583
He was here for an hour or more,
but he's gone now.

915
01:23:57,084 --> 01:23:58,499
Oh, Will.

916
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:04,458
I don't know what to say to you,
Susie, love. I don't know what to say.

917
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:11,791
I can't go on, of course.
I've had my fill of designing aeroplanes.

918
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:17,624
Still I don't know where it went wrong.
I can't fathom it.

919
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,208
Oh, I suppose I've got too old.

920
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,249
What are you going to do?

921
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:30,249
I don't know. I... hadn't thought.

922
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:35,708
- I must go somewhere, I think.
- No, Susie love, please, don't.

923
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:37,958
I'm thinking of J. R.

924
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:42,958
I know how things are between you,
but don't leave him alone now.

925
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:44,666
Not for a bit, anyway.

926
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,041
I must go now, Will.

927
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:54,291
Please don't blame yourself.

928
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:58,166
Tony knew... he was up against
something he couldn't beat.

929
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,791
Come on, I'd better take you home.

930
01:25:39,584 --> 01:25:42,166
(Tony's voice)
'AII set. Hang on a minute.

931
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,958

(Tony screams)

942
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:41,333
- Sue.
- Jess.

943
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:49,249
Get Dr Peyton, Philip.

944
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,833
Come along, we'll go upstairs.

945
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,666
- It is a boy, isn't it?
- Yes.

946
01:28:20,584 --> 01:28:22,583
(Baby moans)

947
01:28:24,209 --> 01:28:27,208
(She weeps)

948
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:33,749
Oh, it's Tony.

949
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:45,124
- We name this child...
- John Anthony.

950
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,583
John Anthony, I baptise you
in the name of the Father,

951
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,333
and of the Son,

952
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,333
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

953
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:58,583
Now, smile, please.

954
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,291
He's here. The car's outside.
Oh dear, I hoped he wouldn't.

955
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,416
Oh, don't panic, Jess.

956
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:10,083
Ah, how do you do?

957
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,916
- Well, hello, Sue.
- Hello, Father.

958
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:22,208
Hello, young fella.
Did you christen him Tony?

959
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:26,749
No, John.
It was what Tony wanted.

960
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:31,999
- Hm. He's a fine baby.
- Yes, isn't he?

961
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,541
- Oh, Sir John, can I tempt you to this?
- Oh, thank you, Mrs Peel.

962
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,624
- It's a charming house you have.
- Glad you like it, Sir John.

963
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:42,708
I haven't had a chance yet
of congratulating you, Father.

964
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:44,958
Mm. Quite a surprise.

965
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:47,416
I hear the new airliner
is a great success.

966
01:29:47,542 --> 01:29:52,624
Mm. We hope so.
Now, here's a small present for... John.

967
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,541
Thank you.

968
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:58,208
The Chinaman, he says,

969
01:29:58,334 --> 01:30:01,749
"Me no likey plitty lady.
Me likey plitty drinky."

970
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,666
- Hello, Will.
- Hello, J. R.

971
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:07,291
Delighted to see you looking
so much better. How was Bognor?

972
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,333
- Oh, very restful, very quiet.
- I'm glad you're back.

973
01:30:10,459 --> 01:30:12,833
- I'm not back.
- Oh.

974
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:16,666
Well, when you're at Bognor,
you might have a look at this.

975
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:19,583
I'd like your views.

976
01:30:19,709 --> 01:30:21,416
- Byfield's work?
- Yes.

977
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:26,083
- What's his idea in that?
- To increase stability.

978
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:31,374
The way I see it, J. R.,
a good aircraft has...

979
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,999
It's got to have something
sort of... inevitable about it.

980
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,291
Now, look. This thing could be
changed a hundred different ways.

981
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:39,999
For example...

982
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:44,833
Do you know what you are, J. R.?
You're a vile seducer.

983
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:51,291
Oh, by the way, I hear
you've made a new Prometheus.

984
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:55,083
- What's the idea?
- It's too good an aircraft to lose, Will.

985
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:58,208
It's the best that came out
of England since the war.

986
01:30:58,334 --> 01:31:04,124
- No. It failed, J. R.
- It wasn't the aircraft that failed, Will.

987
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:07,541
Now, you come
and see me on Monday.

988
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:27,624
Well, this may not be
the time to tell you,

989
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,874
but I've been watching
your work very closely,

990
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,458
and now Makepeace is leaving us,

991
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:34,333
I've decided to promote you
to chief test pilot.

992
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:37,249
- Oh, thank you, Sir John.
- In the firm, I'm still known as J. R.

993
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:40,333
- Take up the new Prometheus tomorrow.
- Yes, J. R.

994
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:42,166
Take her up every day
for the next few weeks.

995
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:44,666
- No specific tests, just get used to her.
- Right.

996
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:47,666
Goodbye and thank you.
A charming party.

997
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:54,749
Oh, and Peel? Not above Mach 0.90
until further orders.

998
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:06,083

1000
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:50,833
- Philip?
- I think so.

(Barking)

1002
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,416
Hello, darling.

1003
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,499
Come on. Up we get.

1004
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:07,624
- Has John been good?
- Yes.

1005
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,374
He doesn't seem to mind
the noise at all.

1006
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,041
- Jess?
- Mm-hm?

1007
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,541
You've both been
very good to me here.

1008
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:20,374
I don't think you'll ever realise
how grateful I am.

1009
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,416
- Why this all of a sudden?
- I think I've got that flat in London.

1010
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:27,416
Oh dear, I'm sorry.
We shall both miss you terribly.

1011
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:28,874
I shall miss you.

1012
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,374
Couldn't you find something
a little nearer here?

1013
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,791
I don't want him to grow up at Ridgefields
in the shadow of his grandfather.

1014
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,916
(Jet engine overhead)

1015
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:42,916
Come on, darling.

1016
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:56,624
- Why not stick the nose on the tail?
- I'll stick your nose on your tail.

1017
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:02,541
- Will?
- What?

1018
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,583
Is it possible that at the speed of sound,
the controls are reversed?

1019
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:10,208
At the speed of sound, Philip,
anything's possible. Why?

1020
01:34:10,334 --> 01:34:14,124
During the war once,
I put a Spitfire into a flat-out dive.

1021
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,916
No particular reason,
just youthful high spirits.

1022
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,791
I think now that I hit
the sound barrier.

1023
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:24,749
I remember that the more
I pulled on the stick,

1024
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:28,499
the harder the nose went down.
The same thing happened this morning.

1025
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,874
You're not supposed to do
a high Mach number!

1026
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,499
I know, but I did.

1027
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,666
Both times, I had the feeling that
if I'd had the guts to put the stick forward

1028
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:40,374
instead of pulling it back,

1029
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,249
I could have pulled out
without having to lose speed.

1030
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:46,291
What do you think?

1031
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:49,333
There's nothing in the books
to suggest for one second

1032
01:34:49,459 --> 01:34:51,708
anything so Edgar Allan Poe-ish.

1033
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,666
Rather depends on the books,
doesn't it, Will?

1034
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,249
There were books once
that said the Earth was flat.

1035
01:34:59,084 --> 01:35:01,083
(Phone ringing)

1036
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:09,708
Yes?
Oh. He's here.

1037
01:35:11,667 --> 01:35:13,333
It's J. R., for you.

1038
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:18,083
- Hello?
- (Jet engine overhead)

1039
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:25,166
Peel here, J. R.
Yes? What, now?

1040
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:27,874
Well, yes, of course.

1041
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,208
What have I done?
He sounded grim as blazes.

1042
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:41,833
Here's Daddy.

1043
01:35:41,959 --> 01:35:43,166
I'm sorry I'm late, darling.

1044
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:45,749
We started, darling.
The children have to have their hair cut.

1045
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,833
- I had to see the old man.
- You've got it, then?

1046
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:50,291
- I've got what?
- Well, the rise, of course.

1047
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,874
Oh, blast it. I forgot to ask him.

1048
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,499
- You forgot to ask him?
- Yes. I'm sorry, darling.

1049
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,208
Oh, really! What a husband.

1050
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:03,666
- (Girl moans)
- Bobby, go out and play on the lawn.

1051
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,791
Here we are.
That's it, you come with me.

1052
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:08,374
- Nice flight, dear?
- Yes, thanks. Wonderful.

1053
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,499
I've got something hot for you
in the oven.

1054
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:16,416
What does he want?

1055
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:20,499
- You won't tell Jess, will you?
- No.

1056
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:22,666
He asked me to take
the Prometheus up

1057
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:26,458
and reproduce exactly the conditions
under which Tony crashed.

1058
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:31,291
Could I have the bread, please?

1059
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:36,583
Thanks.

1060
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:41,333
- At the same speed?
- Well, faster, if possible.

1061
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:44,041
When?

1062
01:36:44,167 --> 01:36:46,708
I shall take her up this afternoon
for a high Mach number,

1063
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,874
and if that's all right,
full crack tomorrow.

1064
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,374
Are you going to do it?

1065
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,708
Look, I don't have to, you know.

1066
01:36:54,834 --> 01:36:57,333
This was merely a suggestion,
not an order.

1067
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:00,874
Hm.

1068
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,208
That's the situation, Sue.
I don't have to, but I must.

1069
01:37:05,334 --> 01:37:08,708
- Why must you?
- Well...

1070
01:37:08,834 --> 01:37:10,583
It's a bit hard to explain.

1071
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:13,874
I only know that if I don't accept
your father's suggestion,

1072
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,541
I should never want to fly again.

1073
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:21,124
And as flying, I've now found out,
is my life, well, I...

1074
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,916
There we are, darling.
I hope it's still all right.

1075
01:37:25,042 --> 01:37:26,624
It looks lovely.

1076
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,124
Fancy you forgetting to ask
for the rise.

1077
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:32,791
I shouldn't worry about it.
I don't think he'll... object now.

1078
01:37:32,917 --> 01:37:35,333
Is it safe to buy the coats
for the children?

1079
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:39,666
Oh, good. Now they'll look smarter
than those stuck-up Harrison kids.

What's the test scheduled

The details are on the sheet.

1086
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,874
There's one quite important detail
that isn't.

1087
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,291
At what Mach number
is my machine to fly?

1088
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:08,291
Mach 1.

1089
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:10,541
Wasn't Tony enough for you?

1090
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,666
We learnt a lot from Tony's crash.

1091
01:38:14,792 --> 01:38:18,874
Just enough to know that to fly
at the speed of sound is death.

1092
01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:26,833
- Haven't you had enough of that?
- No.

1093
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:30,874
Ever heard of pilotless aircraft?

1094
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,291
This problem can't be solved
with pilotless aircraft.

1095
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:36,374
Not in years, anyway.

1096
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,208
Well, what are a few years
one way or another?

1097
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:42,416
Important to me.
I may not have so many of them.

1098
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:46,041
Trying for a peerage now, huh?

1099

any too happy for you.

Oh. Good evening, Sue.

01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:42,374
Good evening, Father.

1106
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:46,624
Well, you don't often give me
the pleasure of seeing you these days.

1107
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,083
How's my grandson?

1108
01:39:49,209 --> 01:39:51,249
- He's very well.
- Good.

1109
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,958
- Father?
- Yes?

1110
01:39:55,084 --> 01:40:00,166
- Are you going on with this test tomorrow?
- What's that to do with you?

1111
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,666
Did Philip tell you what happened
to him this afternoon?

1112
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:05,791
Yes. I've just been reading
his report.

1113
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:10,291
For a good ten seconds,
he was completely out of control.

1114
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:12,249
What are his chances
if that happens tomorrow?

1115
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,291
Well, it might not happen tomorrow.

1116
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:17,291
Please put off the test, Father.

1117
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,374
No.

1118
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:23,249
You're prepared to let Philip
go the way of Tony?

1119
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:26,208
Well, we don't know the way of Tony.

1120
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:29,749
That's Philip's job tomorrow,
to find out how Tony was killed.

1121
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,916
And Tony was finding out
how Geoffrey de Havilland was killed,

1122
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:35,791
and another pilot will find out
how Philip was killed.

1123
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:37,583
And each time,
we'll learn a bit more.

1124
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:40,958
So that one day in the distant future,
Ridgefields will build an airliner

1125
01:40:41,084 --> 01:40:42,791
that'll go to New York in three hours.

1126
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:43,999
Two.

1127
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,791
So that a few people
who can afford the fare

1128
01:40:45,917 --> 01:40:47,499
will spend an occasional weekend
in New York,

1129
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,583
and Ridgefields shares
will go up and up.

1130
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:53,041
My dear Susan, what kind of man
do you think I am?

1131
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:57,833
I don't know.
I... really don't know.

1132
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:04,791
What sort of a man
with two deaths on his conscience

1133
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,458
could risk burdening it with a third?

1134
01:41:06,584 --> 01:41:09,083
A man whose only human feeling
is a passionate worship

1135
01:41:09,209 --> 01:41:11,249
for a pile of bricks and mortar
called Ridgefields?

1136
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:14,583
My dear Susan, if you were to tell me
that only by giving up Ridgefields

1137
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:17,249
and going back to where I started,
could I find out

1138
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:19,916
what happens to an aircraft
at the speed of sound,

1139
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:22,791
I'd say, "All right, Susan,
my girl, it's a deal."

1140
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:26,208
- I don't believe that.
- That's because you can't understand it!

1141
01:41:26,334 --> 01:41:28,124
You make imaginary sacrifices
for yourself,

1142
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,333
but it's other people's lives
you really sacrifice.

1143
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,583
You think I felt nothing
at Tony's death?

1144
01:41:32,709 --> 01:41:35,499
What else can I think,
when a few hours after his death

1145
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:37,208
I find you listening to his voice?

1146
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:40,208
Our ways are different
in so many things,

1147
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:43,624
I expect our ways of feeling grief
are different too.

1148
01:41:44,584 --> 01:41:48,416
Well, I don't suppose
you've any more to say to me.

1149
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:52,416
Yes, I have, Father.
I'm taking John to live in London.

1150
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:54,916
Oh? Indeed?

1151
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:58,666
You know why I'm taking your grandson
away from you, don't you?

1152
01:42:00,209 --> 01:42:03,124
You want me to think of you
as a man with a vision.

1153
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,333
Well, that vision has killed
both my husband and my brother.

1154
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:08,833
And while I'm alive,
it's not going to kill my son too.

1155
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,916
There are evil visions as well
as good ones, you know, Father.

1156
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:16,874
That's why I'm taking my baby away.

1157
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,666
Thanks, Windy. Tell them I'll be out
in two minutes, will you?

1158
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,249
OK.

1159
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,208
You sent for me, Father.

1160
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:19,291
Well, thank you for coming.
I've... I've got something to say.

1161
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,166

01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:55,041
Erm, before you go off, I...

1166
01:43:55,167 --> 01:44:00,166
I wanted to know what school
you've got John down for.

1167
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:03,541
- Is that all you wanted to say?
- No.

1168
01:44:03,667 --> 01:44:07,041
Good schools are not two a penny.
You've got to think.

1169
01:44:08,584 --> 01:44:10,333
But surely there's plenty of time.

You'll do me a favour, will you?

1260
01:52:05,625 --> 01:52:07,166
Of course.

1261
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:12,833
You don't tell anyone what happened
in this office this afternoon.

1262
01:52:14,084 --> 01:52:15,666
Do you think I would?

1263
01:52:53,042 --> 01:52:57,708
I say, a chap called Sound just looked in.
He's absolutely livid with you, old boy.

1264
01:52:57,834 --> 01:52:59,916
He says he's going to bump
his speed up next time.

1265
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:03,916
Oh, good, I've found you in.
I want to show you this.

1266
01:53:04,042 --> 01:53:06,458
- Lord & Mason's won't take it back...
- Look, darling...

1267
01:53:06,584 --> 01:53:09,874
we've got to make up our minds now.
Do you think the colour's too much?

1268
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,458
They've got a sort of beigey colour
with stripes going down here, and I...

1269
01:53:13,584 --> 01:53:15,166
It seemed a bit dull to me, but...

1270
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:17,749
Look, darling, pay attention.
This is very important.

1271
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:21,124
- Is it all right?
- Yes, I'm sorry, darling. Yes, it's fine.

1272
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:24,208
Good, that's lovely.
I'll be able to get back in time.

1273
01:53:24,334 --> 01:53:26,999
Well, bye-bye, darling.
See you at home.

1274
01:53:28,209 --> 01:53:30,124
(Chuckles)

1275
01:53:38,584 --> 01:53:40,208
(Sobbing)

1276
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:04,499
Hm. I thought I heard a car.

1277
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:07,333
I wondered if it could be you.

1278
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:12,708
He has a look of Tony.

1279
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,291
His eyes.

1280
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,708
- What's that?
- It's the moon.

1281
01:54:20,834 --> 01:54:22,833
I never knew it could look
so unfriendly.

1282
01:54:22,959 --> 01:54:25,624
It's an unfriendly universe.

1283
01:54:27,542 --> 01:54:28,999
Do you believe that?

1284
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:32,666
Unfriendly only because
it's unconscious of our existence.

1285
01:54:32,792 --> 01:54:36,249
- That's a depressing conception.
- Doesn't depress me.

1286
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:39,541
In our fight with the universe,
it gives us the advantage.

1287
01:54:40,792 --> 01:54:44,541
- Must it always be a fight?
- Well, I think it must.

1288
01:54:44,667 --> 01:54:47,666
It wasn't for nothing we were given
so many weapons to fight with.

1289
01:54:47,792 --> 01:54:52,083
- Such as?
- Imagination, for one thing.

1290
01:54:52,209 --> 01:54:54,916
Which some people call vision,
don't they?

1291
01:54:56,084 --> 01:54:58,374
Yes, some people do.

1292
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,333
And I suppose another weapon
is courage.

1293
01:55:02,084 --> 01:55:05,291
- Daddy, why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

1294
01:55:05,417 --> 01:55:08,041
How alone you must've been.

1295
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:10,999
Even Will had more imagination
than me...

1296
01:55:12,292 --> 01:55:13,749
I am sorry.

1297
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:16,208
You've no need to be.

1298
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:20,041
(John exclaims)

1299
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:22,124
- I must put John to bed.
- Yes.

1300
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:26,541
- He's no right to be up as late as this.
