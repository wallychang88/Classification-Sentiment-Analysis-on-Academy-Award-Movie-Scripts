for them.

the wrong tree.

anybody about that,

you must realize

145

this isn't
the sort of decision
I can make overnight.

will be the beginning
of a delightful association

for all of us.

159
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,315

the beginning

we will all look back

00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,893
Good night,
senator.

165
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,195
And you will
think it over,
Professor?

166
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,197
I'll do better
than that, senator.

167
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,833
I'll have my wife
think it over.

168
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,968
Good night.

169
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,803
Good night, Mr. Wilson.

170
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,975
Was that really
big ed himself?

171
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,143
In person.

172
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,879
What did he want?

173
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,082
Oh, nothing
of any importance.

174
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,518
He... he merely wants me
to run for governor.

175
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,787
Governor?

176
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,788

177
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,056

178
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,292
And why not?

179
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,928
What did you tell him?

180
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,297
Oh, that
I'd think it over

181
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,432
and, of course,
ask your permission.

182
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,203
Woodrow, you didn't.

183
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,974
Have I ever done
anything foolish

184
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,442
without asking
your permission?

185
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,419
Woodrow,

186
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,088
I know
you haven't any
personal ambition

187
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,489
just to hold office,

188
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,058
but you must admit

189
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,060
the opportunity
is rather unusual.

190
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,062
So it is.
So it is.

191
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,064
You must get awfully
tired sometimes

192
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,465
of a mere
talking profession.

193
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,067
You're quite right,
my dear.

194
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,069
I will admit
there are moments

195
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,471
when the academic life
has its drawbacks,

196
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,074
but the idea
of a man my age

197
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,077
suddenly giving up
a nice, comfortable
way of life

198
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,080
and launching out
on a sea of ifs and buts

199
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,415
sounds like
the account of a fool.

200
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,052
But you've always
been interested
in politics.

201
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,055
Only as an observer
on the sidelines, my dear.

202
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,924
How about the time
you were a student

203
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,559
at the university
of Virginia

204
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,429
and wrote your father
that you'd decided
to be a senator?

205
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,466
And had cards printed...
"senator Thomas
woodrow Wilson."

206
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,068
A youthful
indiscretion.

207
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,070
I was young then,
young lady.

208
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,072
Very young.
About your mental age.

209
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,606
Besides, you know
perfectly well

210
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,209
I have certain
responsibilities
to Princeton.

211
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,578
You know your work
at Princeton is done.

212
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,181
You believe
in the principles
of Democratic equality,

213
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,084
the abolition
of any special
privileged class.

214
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,485
If these things
are worthwhile,

215
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,021
don't they apply
to all the people,

216
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,289
not just to Princeton?

217
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,957
You mean
you really think

218
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,959
I should seriously
consider it?

219
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,394
Oh, I do, woodrow.

220
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,062
I most assuredly do.

221
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,498
We all do,
father.
We all do.

222
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,500
You'd make
a beautiful governor.

223
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,534
Of course.

224
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,403
I declare,
I never met

225
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,139
such a collection
of ambitious women
in my life.

226
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,074
If I do
go into this...

227
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,476
And mind you,
I'm not saying I will...

228
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,479
I warn you and you
and you and you,

229
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,082
you'll have to kiss
all the babies.

230
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,151
That's one thing
I draw the line on.

231
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,352
[Laughter]

232
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,523
How about a locomotive?
You ready?

233
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,058
Hip! Hip!

234
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,727
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,296
Fight! Fight! Fight!

236
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,132
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!

237
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,133
Princeton!

238
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,134
Princeton!

239
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,368
Princeton!

240
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,637
Yay!
Yay!

241
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,551
Do you really think
they'll like him?

242
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,553
Mother, stop worrying.
They'll love him.

243
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,555
But he's never had
any experience

244
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,157
with people
like these before.

245
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,159
Neither have they
had any experience

246
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,361
with a man
like father before.

247
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,236
[Band stops playing]

248
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,408
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

249
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:19,712
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

250
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:23,150
Many of my friends
are very much worried

251
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,118
about this campaign.

252
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,520
They tell me
I'm conducting it

253
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,589
in the worst
possible way

254
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:34,594
because, it appears,
I'm asking you people
to think.

255
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,030
[Crowd laughs]

256
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,501
On the other hand,

257
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,138
my opponents
are even more worried

258
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,540
because they expected
my speeches

259
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,543
to be mere academic
lectures on government

260
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,612
filled with
glittering generalities

261
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,581
that have nothing to do

262
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,150
with the situation
in new Jersey.

263
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,787
Apparently, they've
deluded themselves
into thinking

264
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,790
that I have
no political experience.

265
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,126
Good heavens.
No political experience?

266
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,128
I wonder
if these gentlemen

267
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,530
have ever attended
a faculty meeting

268
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:14,701
or seen the wives of
the trustees in action.

269
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,536
[Laughing]

270
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,240
That's all very amusing,
Mr. Wilson.

271
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,142
But why don't
you tell us

272
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,711
what kind of deal
you've made with the bosses?

273
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,579
Sit down!
Sit down!

274
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,682
I've made no deal
with anyone.

275
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,152
I suppose
you're going to deny

276
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,554
that there's even
such a thing

277
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,823
as a boss system
in new Jersey!

278
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:40,560
No. The existence
of the boss system
is notorious.

279
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,430
Then what are you
going to do about it?

280
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:47,467
Bend all my energies
to breaking it up!

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,736
[Cheering and applause]

282
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,175
When you say bosses,

283
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,611
do you mean
big ed Jones,

284
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,213
Jim beeker,

285
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,814
and ed Sullivan?

286
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,253
Who's that?

287
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,654
Joe tumulty,

288
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,789
one of them Irish lawyers
in the legislature.

289
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,358
Claims to be a democrat,

290
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,293
but he ain't
voted right once.

291
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,562
Come on!
Shut up!

292
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,665
Shut up!
Keep quiet, you hear?

293
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,134
[Woman]
Aah!

294
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,202
Quiet!

295
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,570
Everybody, quiet!

296
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,776
All right.

297
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,777
Go ahead.

298
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,313
Thank you, judge.

299
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,748
Of course
I mean big ed.

300
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,317
I feel about him

301
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,320
exactly as I feel
about every other boss,

302
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,922
whether he's a democrat
or a republican.

303
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,657
Yay!
Yay!

304
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,760
Senator Jones understands
exactly how I feel.

305
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,529
In fact,

306
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,665
just so there would be no
misunderstanding about it,

307
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,868
he has given me his word

308
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,872
that in no circumstances
would he permit his name

309
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,409
to be presented
to the legislature

310
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,844
as a candidate
for re-election

311
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,314
to the United States senate,

312
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:12,819
an office for which
I consider him
utterly unfitted.

313
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,822
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

314
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,262
What do you say,
big ed?

315
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,839
Heh heh heh heh.

316
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:37,877
I say the candidate
speaks for the party.

317
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,913
Yay!
Yay!
[Band plays]

318
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,959
Fight! Fight! Fight!

319
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,795
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!

320
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:56,863
Princeton!

321
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,265
Princeton!

322
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,499
Princeton!

323
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,900
Yay!
Yay!

324
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,642
Mother!

325
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,280
Suppose somebody
sees you.

326
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,914
Let them!

327
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,260
Great, great. He'll win.

328
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,661
Yeah? Suppose
he means it?

329
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,298
Nonsense. They had him
in a corner.

330
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,665
What else could he say?

331
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,667
Just the same,
I don't like

332
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,636
the cut of that
fellow's jaw.

333
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,272
I tell you,
he's something new
in politics...

334
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,673
A scholar
and a gentleman

335
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,309
with ideals
and principles.

336
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,576
You can't beat that

337
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,578
when it comes
to electioneering.

338
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,283
Wasn't he wonderful?

339
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,285
The most idiotic
campaign speech

340
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,721
in the whole history
of politics.

341
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,723
I don't understand.

342
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,292
He means what he says.

343
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,872
Gentlemen!

344
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,442
Your attention,
please!

345
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,077
9:18 P.M.

346
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,714
Returns from
22 counties.

347
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,550
Wilson leading

348
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,951
by 40,000.

349
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,052
Majority!

350
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,087
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

351
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,357
Good work, boys.
I'm proud of you.

352
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,958
* for he's
a jolly good fellow *

353
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,993
* for he's
a jolly good fellow *

354
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,029
* for he's
a jolly good fellow *

355
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,098
* which nobody can deny

356
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,067
nice smile now.
Get closer.

357
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,704
Mr. Wilson,
will you step
on the other side?

358
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,574
All of you,
look this way, please.

359
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,976
Where do you expect
to live, Mrs. Wilson?

360
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,978
We haven't made
our plans yet.

361
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,714
What will
you girls wear to
the inauguration?

362
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,982
We haven't decided.

363
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,617
What jewelry
will you wear?

364
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,718
None.

365
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,119
That's right.
The Wilson girls

366
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,654
don't believe
in jewelry.

367
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,390
We do. We just
haven't any.

368
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:04,791
If you'll step
over here...

369
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,393
What's your
first move, governor?

370
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,827
Have you made
any appointments?

371
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,496
Gentlemen, if you'll
wait a minute,

372
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,931
I'll be glad
to write out
a statement.

373
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,733
Just give us
some personal stuff.

374
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,402
Quite an upset,
Professor.

375
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,670
Any election's an upset,
young man,

376
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,006
if you're unfortunate
enough to be elected.

377
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,675
Lean closer to Mrs. Wilson,
governor.

378
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,678

put up with this
in my home?

379
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,080
Every day until
the end of your life.

380
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,717
You might as well
get used to it.

381
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,718
Smile.

382
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,952
Hold still!

383
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,969
The legislature
has had sufficient time

384
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,639
to digest the contents
of this bill, gentlemen.

385
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,006
Therefore, I must insist

386
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,609
that it be brought
to a vote immediately

387
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,010
regardless
of the opposition.

388
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,012
You're right.
We have the votes.

Yes, tumulty?

392

393

excuse me?

398

402
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,106
Thank you, sir.

403
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:31,110
Well, you sent
for me, governor?

404
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,679
Yes.

405
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,681
Did you authorize
this statement

406
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,484
to the effect
that you have decided

407
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,851
to be a candidate

408
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,953
for the
United States senate?

409
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,724
At the insistence of many
of my friends, governor.

410
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,126
But you publicly stated
that in no circumstances

411
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,795
would you be
a candidate.

412
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,963

a lot of things

of a campaign.

414

To go back on your word

415
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,168
so soon
after the election

416
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,770
would be outrageous
and indecent.

417
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,171
Oh, come, come, come,
governor.

418
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,140
People don't take
these matters

419
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,709
as seriously as you do.

420
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,944
They've probably
forgotten all about it.

421
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,714
I beg to differ
with you, senator.

422
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,016
I haven't forgotten,
nor have the people.

423
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,119
Surely if the party feels
Uncle Ed's their man...

424
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,888
Those who elected me
have already
decided he's not.

425
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:18,991
Hold on, governor.
Let's get one thing clear.

426
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,894
I nominated you.
I elected you.

427
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,897
Then you should've
exercised better judgment
in your choice.

428
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,135
Would you be satisfied

429
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,003
to announce
your opposition publicly

430
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,972
and let it go at that?

431
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,974
If you insist
on going through

432
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,576
with such
bald-faced deceit,

433
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,010
I shall have
no recourse

434

but to fight you
with every means
in my power.

435

Well, looks to me
as if the Professor

436

will give us
the bum's rush

437

whole show himself.

438
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,055
I consider your
language coarse

439
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,823
and your manners
offensive.

440
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,192
However, you seem
to have grasped
the idea perfectly.

441
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,162
I don't want to quarrel
with you, governor.

442
00:24:56,195 --> 00:25:00,166
I know how seriously you
take all these reform issues

443
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,101
and how hard
you've worked.

444

is a nice, long rest.

We know you're aiming
for the white house.

for the nomination

organization's
against you?

understand it.

a nice fellow, too.

I didn't like

fellow's jaw.

is the way

be a whole lot better

We're in!

729
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,259
Governor!

730
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,727
Governor!

731
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,596
We're in! We're in!

732
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,030
We're in, governor!

733
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,734
You've been nominated
on the 46th ballot!

734
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,570
Oh, papa! Oh, daddy!

735
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:45,637
Congratulations,
governor.

736
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,739
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

737
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,241
[Playing hail to the chief]

738
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,321
They're playing
hail to the chief.

739
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,756
Congratulations,
governor.

740
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,924
Is this your work?

741
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,926
I've had them
waiting two days.

742
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,928
What if I hadn't
been nominated?

743
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,329
I made arrangements
with them

744
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,332
to fold up their tents
like the arabs

745
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,201
and silently
steal away.

746
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:08,353
When I speak to you
of business and government,

747
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,956
of capital and labor,

748
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:15,360
of privilege
and equal opportunities,

749
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,362
my only purpose...

750
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,732
Is to rehabilitate
democracy

751
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,969
and to prove to the world

752
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:26,071
that the Democratic system

753
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:31,977
can successfully meet
the economic, industrial,

754
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,380
and social problems
that confront us.

755
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:36,848
Because I believe,

756
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,384
as Lincoln did,

757
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,987
that democracy...

758
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,990
With all its faults
and failures,

759
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,993
if properly guided
and interpreted,

760
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,396
holds the future
of the world.

761
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:54,032
My great dream is...

762
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:57,035
That as the years go on,

763
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:01,206
the world will turn
to America more and more

764
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,975
for those moral inspirations

765
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,378
which lie at the basis
of all freedom.

766
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,381
And that America...

767
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,985
Will come into the full
light of the day

768
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:17,422
when all the world
shall know

769
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:20,025
she puts human rights

770
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:23,028
above all other rights

771
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,996
and that her flag...

772
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,433
Is not only the flag
of America,

773
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:31,369
but the flag of humanity.

774
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:48,253
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!

775
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:19,384
I thought you'd
like to hear these.

776
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,387
"I cordially congratulate
you on your election

812
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,550
I have no feeling
of triumph tonight.

813
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:38,089
Only a sense
of solemn responsibility.

814
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:40,959
I know...

815
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,462
Only too well...

816
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:48,233

Mr. president,
I'm hoover,
the chief Usher.

838
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,348
How do you do?

839
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:18,716
This is Mrs. Wilson.

840
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,152
How do you do,
Mr. hoover?

841
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,553
My daughters...
Miss jessie,

842
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,155
miss Margaret,
miss Ellen.

843
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,124
Perhaps you
and Mrs. Wilson

844
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,593
might like
to inspect your
living quarters

845
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:29,594
before lunch.

846
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,828
Thank you. I would.

847
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,563
This way,
please.

848
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,104
We'll take
the elevator up.

849
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,579
It's this way, sir.

850
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,486
Big, isn't it?

851
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,054
[Laughter]

852
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,193
Who's this?

853
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:04,862
That's
Mrs. John Tyler.

854
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,464
Oh, yes.

855
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,735
Look, father, here's
a picture of president taft.

856
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,238
Yes. Very good, too.

857
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,278
Oh, mother,
it's lovely!

858
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,181
I thought it was
going to be
overpowering,

859
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:26,184
and it's not at all.
It's just a home.

860
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:27,585
Does it amaze you

861
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,554
that our predecessors
had good taste?

862
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:33,191
Come see my room.
I'm sure it's where
Abigail Adams

863
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:34,592
hung out
her laundry.

864
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,895
That was the east room.
I looked it up.

865
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,597
Look!

866
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,766
Mistress Dolly Madison.

867
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,602
Don't anyone dare tell me
she didn't sleep here.

868
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,604
Can't you almost
feel them?

869
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,607
Heavens, you don't think
the house is haunted?

870
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,210
A lot of them
were extremely reluctant

871
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,445
to leave here
during their lifetime.

872
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,154
"Of January 1st, 1863,

873
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:06,557
"whereby four million slaves
were given their freedom

874
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,194
"and slavery
forever prohibited

875
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,262
in the United States."

876
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,770
Imagine,
and in my room.

877
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,272
Miss Nell,
guess what.

878
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,241
They've got three
automobiles here

879
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,642
and an electric,

880
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,244
and
the chauffeur said

881
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,247
we could use them
whenever we wanted.

882
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,182
Not bad for a family

883
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:33,584
that never even owned
a horse and buggy.

884
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:37,222
Oh, I wish we would have
an inaugural ball tonight.

885
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:38,589
It'd be such fun.

886
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,591
Father hates
a lot of fuss.

887
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,659
I know, but tonight,

888
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,261
I wish he was
a republican.

889
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:44,495
Shh!

890
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,605
President Lincoln's
bed.

891
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,247
He must've been
an awfully big man.

892
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,482
He was.

893
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:08,286
My dears, your father and I have
a gift for each of you

894
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,587
in commemoration
of this day.

895
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,256
Oh, mother!

896
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,790
How sweet!

897
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,563
Oh, mother.

898
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,765
Oh, it's exquisite.

899
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:24,235
It's the most
beautiful ring
I've ever seen.

900
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:27,538
Oh, a bracelet watch.

901
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,241
Mother, it's just
what I've always wanted.

902
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,310
Ohh...

903
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,544
Oh, look.

904
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,846
Mother.

905
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,915
Diamond pendant.

906
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,386
Oh, it's too beautiful.

907
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,787
But why did you...

908
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,789
I mean, how did you...

909
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,924
I borrowed money
from the bank

910
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,526
to pay my campaign
expenses,

911
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,528
and this
was left over.

912
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,530
Oh, woodrow,
it's too nice.

913
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,766
Perhaps, but I've
got a better job now...

914
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,568
Shorter hours,
more pay.

915

[Knock on door]

916
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:00,805
Come in.

917
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,407
Excuse me,
Mr. president,

918
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,808
but luncheon
is served.

919
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,410
Oh, thank you...

920
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:06,411
Simms, sir.

921
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:07,678
Thank you, Simms.

922
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,447
Howdy, miss Ellen.

923
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,716
You don't remember
me, do you?

924
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,983
Why, no, I...

925
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,819
My family lived
right behind yours

926
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,421
in Rome, Georgia.

927
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:18,823
My mother did
your mother's washing

928
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,925
for close on
to 30 years, I reckon.

929
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:24,495
How nice to have
someone from down home.

930
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:25,796
Yes, indeed,
miss Ellen,

931
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,499
it's going to be
mighty nice for me, too,

932
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:31,035
having ladies
and gentlemen around
that speak my language.

933
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,269
[Giggling]

934
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:18,983
I don't know
what I came for.

935
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,685
He didn't want
my advice.

936
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:22,753
Once he's made up
his mind,

937
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,755
nothing in heaven
will change it.

938
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:25,756
Bye, Joe.

939
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,692
Goodbye, senator.

940
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,960
At least he listened
to our side of it.

941
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,897
He was polite, but
somehow he makes me feel

942
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,465
like an unruly
schoolboy.

943
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,133
I catch myself
being afraid

944
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,736
he's going to rap me
over the knuckles.

945
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,638
Good morning,
gentlemen.
Senator lodge.

946
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,906
Morning, senator.

947
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,741
Didn't expect
to find you here.

948
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,477
Oh, yes. We Republicans
still do business

949
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:47,778

Will you announce me
to the president?

955

Yes, of course,
senator.

956

Won't you
sit down, sir?

957

waiting, do you?

972

we'd finish
this list tonight.

Helen, I told you
what you were
getting into

994

when you took
this job as
Ellen's secretary.

but you didn't say

00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,053
what a white house
wedding's like.

997
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,655
It's all
jessie's fault.

to get married...

What about your own wedding?

01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:42,392
Of course
we promise.

1088
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,528
But, mother,
it's ridiculous of you

1089
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,063
to talk like this.

1090
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,133
You'll be up and about
in no time.

1091
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,968
You know it.

1092
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:13,023
I'm sorry, Mr. president.

1093
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,327
Excuse me,
governor.

1094
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,996
Senator Carter glass
telephoned.

1095
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,065
He wants to know,
can he see you
this afternoon

1096
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:57,968
about that
federal reserve
bank matter?

1097
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,440
He'll have to
excuse me.

1098
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:06,476
I can think
of nothing while
Ellen's like this.

1099
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,946
All right, governor.
He'll understand.

1100
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,016
Father, you
promised mother

1101
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,618
you'd play golf
this afternoon.

1102
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,120
I know.

1103
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,323
But I can't.

1104
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,473
I can't bear the thought
of her suffering.

1105
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,476
Father, she
wouldn't want you
to feel like this.

1106
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,479
She's always been
the most radiant
person I've known.

1107
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:45,115
For 30 years,
I've never
had a thought

1108
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:46,516
in which
she didn't enter.

1109
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,018
I can't...

1110
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:52,622
I couldn't go on
without her.

1111
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:02,933
I'll never forget
the first time
I ever saw her.

1112
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:07,071
I was practicing
law in Atlanta.

1113
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:11,075
I had to go to Rome,
Georgia, on business.

1114
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:14,511
Her father was
the presbyterian minister.

1115
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:17,047
I went to his church.

1116
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,385
I'm afraid I couldn't
have told you

1117
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,553
what the sermon
was about.

1118
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,989
She saw you, too.

1119
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:27,391
She always
said she was glad

1120
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,960
she had on
her prettiest hat.

1121
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:33,998
I don't think
any two people
were ever so happy.

1122
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:37,134
When I was teaching
at bryn mawr

1123
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,502
and at Princeton

1124
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:41,105
when you girls
were babies...

1125
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:48,112
It's this place
that's killing her.

1126
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,547
She's been happy
here, father,

1127
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,549
and so proud of you.

1128
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:56,186
No. She's done too much.

1129
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,755
I didn't realize it.

1130
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,958
She wouldn't
have been happy
doing any less.

1131
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,338
Well, Grayson?

1132
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:17,507
She's sleeping now.

1133
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,077
So far as I can tell,

1134
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,080
there's been no great change
since yesterday,

1135
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:24,981
just a gradual
weakening.

1136
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:33,090
There's no hope?

1137
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,495
Medical science
is not the last word,
Mr. president.

1138
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:41,398
We can only wait
and see.

1139
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:01,185

[Piano plays]

1142
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:51,728
If there were
only something
we could do,

1143
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,398
some way
we could help.

1144
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,268
It's difficult.

1145
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,412
Extra! Extra!

1146
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,880
Lusitania torpedoed
off coast of Ireland.

1147
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:13,550
Over 100 American
lives lost.

1148
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:14,951
Extra! Extra!
Dirty huns!

1149
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,520
Ought to be wiped out,
the lot of them.

1150
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,922
German sub sinks
lusitania.

1151
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:21,391
Over 1,500 die.

1152
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:23,593
Lusitania torpedoed
by German sub.

1153
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,262
It's cold-blooded
murder.

1154
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:26,796
Wholesale slaughter.

1155
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,432
[Ding ding]

1156
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,834
We'll be at war
with Germany in a week.

1157
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:34,404
It's not our war.
Why should we
get involved?

1158
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:35,672
If Americans
don't want to get hurt,

1159
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,374
let them stay home.

1160
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,777
I bet Teddy Roosevelt
would know what to do.

1161
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,381
Over 100 American citizens
murdered on the high seas,

1162
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:47,384
and that man
in the white house

1163
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:48,785
too proud to fight.

1164
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,387
But we have
no choice.

1165
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,789
These huns must be
taught a lesson.

1166
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,392
We can't watch the world
slipping into anarchy.

1167
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:56,860
We've got
to declare war.

1168
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:58,862
No, no, no!

1169
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,798
Our people were warned
to stay off that ship.

1170
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,400
How do we know

1171
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,635
that it wasn't
carrying munitions?

1172
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:07,804
Nonsense. That's nothing
but German propaganda.

1173
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:09,806
Congress is all set
to act.

1174
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,408
It'll back us up.

1175
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,809
What about
the people?

1176
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,778
Don't worry.
They're good and mad.

1177
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,713
Read your newspapers.

1178
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:19,816
Mr. president,
do you know people
are saying openly

1179
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,686
that this administration
lacks courage?

1180
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,889
They may call me
a coward or anything else,

1181
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,857
but I won't be rushed
into this war.

1182
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,460
You'll overlook
the most
dastardly crime

1183
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:33,730
of which any
civilized nation has
ever been guilty?

1184
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:36,500
No. I shall warn
the German government

1185
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:37,901
in the strongest terms

1186
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,903
that in future
it will be held

1187
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,371
to strict accountability.

1188
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:42,772
Another note?

1189
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:44,374
Yes. Another note.

1190
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,876
These Germans
pay no attention
to notes.

1191
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,279
The only thing
they understand
is force.

1192
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,281
I'm not
so much concerned

1193
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:53,283
with what
the Germans do

1194
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:55,919
as I am with our own
responsibility,

1195
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:59,456
which is to keep out
of this war if possible,

1196
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:01,858
so that
at the right time,

1197
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:05,862
we can offer ourselves
as the only nation in the world

1198
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:07,864
with sufficient strength
and influence

1199
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:11,335
to bring about
a decent and lasting peace.

1200
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,871
The vast majority
of Americans

1201
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:17,474
expect me
to keep my head

1202
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,644
and save them
from this awful mess.

1203
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,879
I don't want them
to say

1204
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,881
when the casualty lists
come in,

1205
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:27,884
"why did Wilson
have to move so fast?

1206
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,487
Why didn't he make
one more effort?"

1207
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,523
Have you considered
what this policy
of uncertainty

1208
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:34,824
is doing
to our economy?

1209
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:36,826
Cotton down
to 6 cents,

1210
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,429
our goods rotting
on the docks,

1211
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:41,398
afraid to put to sea,

1212
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,767
our farmers
and railroads
facing ruin.

1213
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,503
I haven't thought
to consider this war

1214
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,472
in terms
of dollars and cents.

1215
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:51,941
Nor have the fathers
and mothers
of this country.

1216
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,510
No, gentlemen.

1217
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,945
It would be the easiest
thing in the world

1218
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,514
for me as president

1219
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,450
to ask for
a declaration of war.

1220
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:03,853
The man on horseback
is always a hero.

1221
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:09,092
But I wouldn't have
to do the fighting.

1222
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,461
Some poor farmer's boy

1223
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:13,863
or the son of some
great family

1224
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:16,500
would have to do
the fighting

1225
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,368
and the dying.

1226
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,372
When I ask them
to do that,

1227
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:24,741
I want to be very sure

1228
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:29,679
that what they're
dying for is worthwhile.

1229
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,921
Good morning.

1231
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:00,076
Oh, thank you,
my dear.

1232
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:10,520
You really should
be in bed, father.

1233
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:12,522
It's very late.

1234
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:13,857
Yes.

1235
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:16,926
I'll go along
directly.

1236
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:26,936
It would be nice
if we could
run away from it all.

1237
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,974
You know,
once upon a time,

1238
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:33,977
your mother and I
did just that.

1239
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,912
I'd been working
very hard

1240
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:38,882
on the first draft
of mere literature.

1241
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,451
Without telling anyone
at the university,

1242
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:44,854
we slipped out
for a holiday
in the country...

1243
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:48,925
And it was just about
the most perfect
two weeks

1244
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,126
I've ever known.

1245
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,530
We tramped
in the hills,

1246
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,965
slept in the sun,

1247
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:59,969
and walked alone at night
under the stars.

1248
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:08,712
Your mother was
a very wonderful woman,
Margaret.

1249
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,850
She had
that rare quality

1250
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:18,488
of always being close
to you when you wanted her,

1251
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:20,557
when you needed her.

As long as it suits
her convenience.

1260
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,889
I suppose
we'll have to go along

1261
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,290
with Wilson's
preparedness program.

1262
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,125
Not his preparedness
program... ours.

1263
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,927
We started it.

1264
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,898
We pushed it when
he would have nothing
to do with it.

1265
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,900
Now he's claiming
it for himself

1266
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,902
because he thinks
it's good politics.

1267
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:41,938
Never mind that.
It has to be done.

1268
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,907
Not only will we
have to go along,

1269
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,642
but we'll have
to lead the way,

1270
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:47,243
put aside
any thought of party

1271
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,212
and do what we can
to save this country.

1272
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:05,061
Well, Mr. president,

1273
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:07,030
Teddy Roosevelt
can't say

1274
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,899
that you haven't
adopted at least
one of his policies.

1275
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,935
Thank you, Joe.
What's that?

1276
01:16:11,968 --> 01:16:13,770
The strenuous life.

1277
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,251
Oh, it's the president.

1278
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,887
And looking the worse
for wear, I'm afraid.

1279
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,288
Hello, cousin woodrow.

1280
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,290
Come in. Come in.

1281
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,861
Cousin woodrow,
I want you to know
my friend Mrs. galt.

1282
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,295
I'm delighted,
Mrs. galt.

1283
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,296
Mr. president.

1284
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,865
You know Dr. Grayson.

1285
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,833
Very well,
for a long time.

1286
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:46,670
Have you forgotten?
I introduced you
to Edith.

1287
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:48,872
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

1288
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:51,274
We've been for a walk
in the rain.

1289
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:54,277
Edith came here for tea
with Margaret and me.

1290
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,246
Tea? Sounds delicious.
May we come, too?

1291
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,915
Shall we let them?

1292
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,283
As patriotic citizens,

1293
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:03,386
I don't see how we can
very well say no.

1294
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,227
You're from the South,
Mrs. galt?

1295
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,896
Yes. I have the honor

1296
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,899
to be born in the same
state as you... Virginia.

1297
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,333
She's a descendant
of pocahontas.

1298
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,902
Well, that is Virginia.

1299
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,904
We shan't keep you
waiting long.

1300
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:24,207
Oh, don't hurry. Give us
time to freshen up a bit.

1301
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,775
Excuse me.

1302
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,345
Charming woman.

1303
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,180
Very.

1304
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,352
Do you play golf,
Mrs. galt?

1305
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,921
Oh, yes, Mr. president.

1306
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:40,924
And this will give you
an idea how well.

1307
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:43,927
The last time, I was
200 yards from the green.

1308
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,329
I asked my caddie
if he thought

1309
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:49,032
I could make it
with my mashie,

1310
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:51,334
and he replied,

1311
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,937
"yes, ma'am,
you can make it,

1312
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,906
allowing you hits it
often enough."

1313
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:22,766
We're going down
the potomac next weekend
on the yacht.

1314
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:24,801
Would you care
to join us?

1315
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,269
Oh, I'd love to,

1316
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,172
but I promised to visit
the Hastings in Virginia.

1317
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,775
That's a shame. I'd
hoped you could come.

1318
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,177
Cousin woodrow will be
terribly disappointed.

1319
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,213
The president
asked for me?

1320
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:03,306
"You're the only
woman I know

1321
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,308
"who can wear
an orchid.

1322
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:09,178
Generally, it's the orchid
that wears the woman."

1323
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:46,215
I think this is
my favorite spot
at the white house.

1324
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:48,317
It is lovely.

1325
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:50,319
I asked Margaret
and the others

1326
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,889
to leave us alone
for a while

1327
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:56,359
that I might have
an opportunity to say
something to you.

1328
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:57,793
Yes?

1329
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:03,299
I need you, Edith.
Will you be my wife?

1330
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,568
Mr. president.

1331
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,872
I know this comes
as a shock to you.

1332
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,506
Perhaps I've been
too impulsive,

1333
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,542
but if I'm to continue
to make opportunities
to see you,

1334
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,144
I must speak.

1335
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:18,882
But how can you be sure?

1336
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,517
You've only known me
a few months.

1337
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,890
Time isn't always measured
in weeks or months.

1338
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:28,324
In the past year,

1339
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,927
I've lived a lifetime
of loneliness and heartache.

1340
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,196
You've changed all that,

1341
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:36,299
given me hope that happiness
is still possible.

1342
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,237
Have you spoken
to your daughters?

1343
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,072
Yes.

1344
01:20:43,106 --> 01:20:46,309
They tell me they already
love and admire you

1345
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,913
and that nothing would
make them happier.

1346
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:52,315
But I've never
thought of you

1347
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,550
except
as the president.

1348
01:20:56,552 --> 01:21:00,356
And, besides,
I've had no training

1349
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:03,459
that would befit me
for the responsibilities
of such a life.

1350
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:06,595
Would you rather
I had not spoken?

1351
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,898
Oh, no.

1352
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:12,301
There isn't any woman
who wouldn't be touched

1353
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:15,905
to be told that
she could be of help

1354
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:18,908
to a man in your position
in times like these...

1355
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:22,912
But I'd have to have time
to know you and to see you

1356
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:24,647
and to be with you.

1357
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,883
Do you want to see me?

1358
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:32,088
Yes, I do.

1359
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,195
Then I'll wait...

1360
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:43,933
And in all fairness
to you,

1361
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:46,635
there's something
you should understand.

1362
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:51,340
There's a spotlight
on this house.

1363
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:55,478
Everyone who comes here
is observed and discussed.

1364
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,381
Everything I say
is quoted...

1365
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,618
Sometimes even correctly.

1366
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,022
No matter how I try,

1367
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,690
I can't protect you
from gossip.

1368
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:09,292
I'm not afraid
of gossip.

1369
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:12,261
It would be even worse
if I came to your house.

1370
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:15,298
But surely you have
the right to choose
your own friends.

1371
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:19,302
In this job, I'm not sure
I have any rights at all.

1372
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,703
This gossip
you speak of,

1373
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:23,339
would it hurt you,
what you're doing?

1374
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:25,441
It's you I'm thinking of.

1375
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:30,513
Well, then, I suggest
we go on exactly as
we have in the past...

1376
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:35,684
But as to being
your wife,

1377
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:39,288
if I have to say
yes or no now,

1378
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:42,358
then I'm afraid
the answer must be no.

1379
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:47,296
Won't you at least
give me the hope

1380
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:50,033
that you might
change your mind...

1381
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:54,170
That maybe when you
know me better...

1382
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:59,342
I'd be less
than a woman,
Mr. president,

1383
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,744
if I didn't reserve
that right.

1384
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:11,687
[Take me out
to the ballgame plays]

1385
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,689
Mr. president.

1386
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,432
Yay!
Yay!

1387
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:35,311
That's her.

1388
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,219
Yes. An election
coming up, too.

1389
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:48,691
There's no use beating
about the bush, Edith.

1390
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,294
You know about
the whispers,

1391
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:54,330
the gossip
that's going on.

1392
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,300
He heard about it today.

1393
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:00,436
Naturally, he would be
the last to hear.

1394
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:04,307
I've never seen him
so angry in my life.

1395
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,309
His lips went white.

1396
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,177
His hands shook.

1397
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:11,314
I think if he could
get his hands on those
scandalmongers,

1398
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,681
he'd forget he's president.

1399
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,717
Oh, no,
he mustn't do that.

1400
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,821
What's worse,
some of his own friends
are mixed up in it.

1401
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:20,823
They're afraid
that a second marriage

1402
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,791
will prevent
his re-election.

1403
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:37,840
What do you think?

1404
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:39,442
That his own
political fortunes

1405
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:42,345
don't make
any difference to him.

1406
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:44,380
It's you.

1407
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:50,353
Nothing must
stand in the way
of his re-election.

1408
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:51,887
I'd never
forgive myself

1409
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,324
if I were the cause
of his defeat.

1410
01:24:55,358 --> 01:25:00,263
Edith, he's the president
of the United States,

1411
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:03,299
but first of all,
he's a man,

1412
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:06,269
and he loves you.

1413
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:11,307
To do what he has to do,
he... he needs you.

1414
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,243
Thank you, Dr. Grayson.

1415
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:16,779
It was very kind
of you to tell me
all this.

1416
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:22,718
I'll write him
my decision.

1417
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,487
Thanks, Edith.

1418
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:30,693
[Typing]

1419
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:39,302
Hello, Joe,
what's the news?

1420
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:41,704
Not a thing.

1421
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,306
How's with you?

1422
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,707
Oh, all right.

1423
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,774
Mm-hmm.

1424
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,311
No notes
to Germany?

1425
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:50,313
Nope.

1426
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,548
No sinkings?

1427
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,284
No.

1428
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:56,685
No messages
to congress

1429
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,256
about us being
too proud to fight?

1430
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:05,928
Sorry. Just
the usual routine.

1431
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:25,681
Jumping Jupiter!

1432
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,284
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

1433
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:30,286
The story. The list.

1434
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,289
The announcement has just
been made of the engagement

1435
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:35,691
of Mrs. Norman galt
of Washington, D.C.

1436
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:38,561
And woodrow Wilson, president
of the United States.

1437
01:26:45,568 --> 01:26:47,836
[Hail to the chief plays]

1438
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,606
[Applause]

1439
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:13,756
His imperious majesty
appears to be

1440
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,358
in good spirits tonight.

1441
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:18,694
Time will remedy that.

1442
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22,731
Do you really think
we have a chance to
defeat him in November?

1443
01:28:22,765 --> 01:28:26,502
Not defeat, senator,
obliterate.

1444
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:50,359
You can't enjoy the convention
without a hot dog!

1445
01:28:50,393 --> 01:28:53,662
Buy it hot! Buy it now!

1446
01:28:53,696 --> 01:28:57,666
* we take out hats off to you,
Mr. Wilson *

1447
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:01,470
* our hats are off to you

1448
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:03,606
* you're the man
of the hour *

1449
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:05,574
* you stood like a tower

1450
01:29:05,608 --> 01:29:08,844
* and no one could do
for the red, white, and blue *

1451
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:10,946
* you're the right kind
of man *

1452
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,881
* in the right kind
of place *

1453
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:14,783
* like Washington
and Lincoln *

1454
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:16,151
* you set the pace

1455
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,053
* we know at home
and abroad *

1456
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:19,922
* your pen is greater
than the sword *

1457
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:23,726
* we take our
hats off to you *

1458
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:31,066
* I didn't raise my boy
to be a soldier *

1459
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:37,940
* I brought him up
to be my pride and joy *

1460
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:40,876
* who dares
to place a musket *

1461
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:44,112
* on his shoulder

1462
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:52,855
* to shoot some other
mother's darling boy? *

1463
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:56,692
* he's got those big
blue eyes like you, daddy *

1464
01:29:56,725 --> 01:30:01,697
* reminds me of you
all the time *

1465
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,801
* when he grows
to be a man *

1466
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:12,508
* I'll give him up
to Uncle Sam *

1467
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:18,447
* just like I did with you

1468
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:25,721
* daddy mine

1469
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,691
we must rid ourselves
of this college sissy

1470
01:30:28,724 --> 01:30:33,529
and once again
substitute action
for elocution!

1471
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:36,131
He kept us
out of war!

1472
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:41,036
Woodrow Wilson
is the most incompetent...

1473
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:44,607
Vacillating...
Insincere...

1474
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:50,613
And cowardly leader
this nation has ever endured!

1475
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:54,149
He kept us
out of war!

1476
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:57,753
Wilson and his dynasty,
his heirs and assigns,

1477
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:01,056
anybody who with bended knee
has served his purposes,

1478
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:04,092
must be driven
from all control,
from all influence

1479
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:07,696
upon the government
of the United States!

1480
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:10,666
While we watch
a world in flames,

1481
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:14,737
we must not forget
what is happening
here at home

1482
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,104
under our very noses.

1483
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,707
Private initiative
is being stifled,

1484
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:21,710
business is being
put into a straitjacket,

1485
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:25,748
all under this false claim
that this is democracy.

1486
01:31:25,781 --> 01:31:27,716
When, as a matter of fact,

1487
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,718
it is nothing
but the blundering

1488
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:31,720
of a starry-eyed idealist.

1489
01:31:31,754 --> 01:31:35,724
Re-elect woodrow Wilson!

1490
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:39,728
He kept us out of war!

1491
01:31:39,762 --> 01:31:42,631
[Playing dixie]

1492
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:56,712
"A weak and imbecile man,"

1493
01:31:56,745 --> 01:32:00,949
"the weakest I ever knew
in a high place."

1494
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:06,088
"If I wanted
to paint a despot,

1495
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:07,656
"a man perfectly regardless

1496
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,659
"of every constitutional
right of the people,

1497
01:32:10,693 --> 01:32:12,695
I would paint
his hideous form."

1498
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:14,062
That's outrageous!

1499
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:16,665
"When he goes out
of office next march,

1500
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:19,668
"the whole country
except thieves, cowards,

1501
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:22,705
"public plunderers,
officeholders,
and traitors

1502
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:24,072
will rejoice."

1503
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:26,909
Woodrow,
that's the last straw.

1504
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:29,211
You've got to do
something about it.

1505
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:32,247
They've no right
to say such things
about you

1506
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,816
even to win an election.

1507
01:32:33,849 --> 01:32:35,217
They weren't talking
about me.

1508
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,820
That's what they said
about Abraham Lincoln

1509
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:40,255
when he was running
for re-election in 1864.

1510
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,925
[Laughter]

1511
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,359
I understand
Teddy Roosevelt says

1512
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:45,994
you're the most
incompetent man

1513
01:32:46,028 --> 01:32:47,930
to ever occupy the office,

1514
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:49,965
worse even than
Thomas Jefferson.

1515
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:51,299
[Laughter]

1516
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:54,102
Frankly, I've been
much more concerned

1517
01:32:54,136 --> 01:32:56,705
with what our own side's
been saying.

1518
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:00,275
All this prating
about "he kept us
out of war,"

1519
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:04,647
as if I can see
what is or is not to be.

1520
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:07,683
Any little German
lieutenant can put us
into the war tomorrow

1521
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:10,719
by some new outrage
on the sea tonight.

1522
01:33:10,753 --> 01:33:14,757
Would you mind very much
if you should be defeated?

1523
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:18,661
I don't suppose
any man wants to see
his policies repudiated.

1524
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:21,263
I heard that betting
in wall street

1525
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:24,266
closed at 10-8
against you, father.

1526
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:26,635
I hope you didn't
take any of it.

1527
01:33:26,669 --> 01:33:28,637
Governor.
Yes, tumulty?

1528
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:31,707
Governor,
the New York times

1529
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:35,010
has just conceded
the election to Mr. Hughes.

1530
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,749
Why, it's only 9:00.

1531
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:42,718
How can they be sure?

1532
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:45,754
They're still at
the polls in the west.

1533
01:33:45,788 --> 01:33:48,023
Yes...

1534
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:50,025
It does seem a bit early.

1535
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:51,026
Coffee, tumulty?

1536
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,661
Thank you, governor.

1537
01:33:52,695 --> 01:33:56,098
However, the times
is generally right.

1538
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:02,938
In the meanwhile,
I see no reason to despair.

1539
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,339
The government's
not going to collapse

1540
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,974
just because I've
been left at home.

1541
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:08,777
Hughes is an honest man
and a very capable one.

1542
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:10,412
As a matter of fact,

1543
01:34:10,445 --> 01:34:12,915
his own party referred to him
as Wilson-with-whiskers.

1544
01:34:12,948 --> 01:34:15,317
With whiskers.

1545
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:18,386
Of course, my wife may feel

1546
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,256
the country's judgment's
a bit warped.

1547
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:25,093
I can only think

1548
01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:28,363
that you'll be free
from all this worry.

1549
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:30,933
Waiting for election returns

1550
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:34,269
is like a hen
sitting on a nest,

1551
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:37,305
except that the hen
uses better judgment

1552
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,241
than a politician...

1553
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:42,410
She never cackles
until after she's
laid the egg.

1554
01:34:42,444 --> 01:34:46,014
[Laughter]

1555
01:34:48,316 --> 01:34:50,886
May we talk
to Mr. Hughes?

1556
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:52,921
The president
has gone to bed.

1557
01:34:52,955 --> 01:34:54,890
He has left word that he
was not to be disturbed.

1558
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:57,860
Well, when the president
wakes up, give him this

1559
01:34:57,893 --> 01:35:00,162
and tell him you're not
so sure he's president
after all.

1560
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:08,236
Thank you.

1561
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:11,273
Well, Mr. president,
we can do this
all over again.

1562
01:35:11,306 --> 01:35:12,875
Another four years.

1563
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,276
Yes, another four years.

1564
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:16,278
Congratulations,
Mr. president,

1565
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:18,881
and the public's to be
congratulated, too...

1566
01:35:18,914 --> 01:35:20,182
For their good judgment.

1567
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,349
Thank you.

1568
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,385
I never gave up
for one minute.

1569
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:26,288
I did. I'd have
sold out pretty cheaply
election night.

1570
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:28,857
You just got by
in the electoral college,

1571
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:31,894
but you polled three million
more popular votes
than in 1912,

1572
01:35:31,927 --> 01:35:34,262
and that's not to be
laughed at.

1573
01:35:34,296 --> 01:35:37,299
Why on earth
any man should want
a job like this

1574
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:39,902
for another four years
is beyond me.

1575
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:41,303
[Laughter]

1576
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:43,538
But I confess,
I did want it.

1577
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,807
Mr. president.

1578
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,908
Baker.

1579
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:11,366
Mr. secretary.

1580
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:12,567
Has the president retired?

1581
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,336
Yes, sir.

1582
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,839
Wake him.
Tell him Mr. Lansing,
secretary of state,

1583
01:36:16,872 --> 01:36:19,241
his excellency
count Von bernstorff,
the German ambassador,

1584
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:22,277
are here,
and that we must
see him at once.

1585
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,312
Will you wait
in the east room, sir?

1586
01:36:24,346 --> 01:36:25,480
Thank you.

1587
01:36:54,109 --> 01:36:55,310
Mr. president.

1588
01:36:55,343 --> 01:36:56,945
Mr. Lansing.
Your excellency.

1589
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,947
What is it, gentlemen?

1590
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:00,615
I'm sorry to disturb you
at such an hour,

1591
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,918
but count Von bernstorff
has just handed me

1592
01:37:02,951 --> 01:37:04,519
another note
from his government.

1593
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:06,554
Beginning tomorrow,
Germany will resume

1594
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:09,124
its policy of unrestricted
submarine warfare.

1595
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,859
We have
no other choice.

1596
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:12,928
And will sink on sight
and without warning

1597
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:14,930
any neutral vessel
entering European waters.

1598
01:37:14,963 --> 01:37:16,431
With certain exceptions,
of course.

1599
01:37:16,464 --> 01:37:18,934
One American ship
will be permitted to leave

1600
01:37:18,967 --> 01:37:20,936
a designated port
each week,

1601
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:24,139
provided it is properly
lighted and marked.

1602
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:26,474
We deeply regret
the necessity
of this decision.

1603
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:29,044
We sincerely hope
it will not interfere

1604
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:32,881
with your noble efforts
to bring about peace
with our enemies.

1605
01:37:32,915 --> 01:37:34,349
Sit down, sir.

1606
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:38,386
We also have received
indisputable proof

1607
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,055
within the last hour

1608
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:42,490
that the German government
has been using

1609
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:45,493
our own state department
cables to foment trouble

1610
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,095
between this country
and Mexico.

1611
01:37:47,129 --> 01:37:48,196
What?

1612
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,497
With California,
new Mexico,

1613
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,566
and parts of Texas
as bait.

1614
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,235
I deny
any such thing.

1615
01:37:53,268 --> 01:37:55,403
The proof is overwhelming,
Mr. president.

1616
01:37:55,437 --> 01:37:57,405
There can be no doubt.

1617
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:59,874
Count Von bernstorff...

1618
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:05,580
For more
than two years,

1619
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:08,183
this government
has exercised
every restraint

1620
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:11,553
in its efforts
to remain neutral
in this conflict,

1621
01:38:11,586 --> 01:38:14,456
but you and your
military masters

1622
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:17,225
apparently
are determined to
deny us that right.

1623
01:38:17,259 --> 01:38:18,226
But I assure you...

1624
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,062
Every way we turn,

1625
01:38:20,095 --> 01:38:23,932
we run into a blank wall
of German cruelty
and stupidity.

1626
01:38:23,966 --> 01:38:26,434
Every time we think
we've escaped,

1627
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:29,271
you blindly
and deliberately
block us

1628
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:30,638
with some
new outrage.

1629
01:38:30,672 --> 01:38:32,374
Mr. president...
Sit down.

1630
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:36,044
Won't you Germans
ever be civilized?

1631
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:38,613
Won't you ever learn
to keep your word...

1632
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:42,217
Or to regard other peoples
as men, women, and children,

1633
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:45,220
not as inferiors
to be treated
as you please,

1634
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,522
in the name of
your discredited
German culture

1635
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:48,656
and race superiority?

1636
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:50,025
I wish to withdraw...

1637
01:38:50,058 --> 01:38:52,394
We are not
exactly fools!

1638
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,729
We know about the spies
you've sent among us

1639
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,265
in an effort to
corrupt our opinions

1640
01:38:57,299 --> 01:38:58,633
through lies and rumors

1641
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:00,202
and of your
ceaseless attempts

1642
01:39:00,235 --> 01:39:02,304
to sabotage
our industry and commerce.

1643
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:04,606
Unfortunately,
some of our own people

1644
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,075
have fallen in
with your plans.

1645
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:08,743
Day after day,
I see them

1646
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:11,346
going up and down
this country,

1647
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:13,381
crying out
in their innocence

1648
01:39:13,415 --> 01:39:16,584
that this is just
another European war
that can't touch America,

1649
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:20,088
building up
a false illusion
of safety and security,

1650
01:39:20,122 --> 01:39:23,358
appealing to our ancient
traditions of isolation...

1651
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:25,760
While you smile
behind their backs

1652
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:28,630
and go right ahead
with your evil plans

1653
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:31,266
of world conquest
and exploitation.

1654
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:32,467
I bid you
good night.

1655
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,369
You will wait!

1656
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:37,505
Is your kaiser
so contemptuous

1657
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:39,607
of American
military prowess?

1658
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,644
Does he think
we're so weak
and disunited

1659
01:39:42,677 --> 01:39:45,247
just because we prefer
peace to war

1660
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,782
that we will not fight
in any circumstances?

1661
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:50,252
Or is he
so drunk with power

1662
01:39:50,285 --> 01:39:52,754
that he can't understand
that such action

1663
01:39:52,787 --> 01:39:56,524
will unite this nation
as never before
in its history

1664
01:39:56,558 --> 01:39:59,294
and that he has
made it clear at last

1665
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:03,331
that this is, in truth,
a fight for freedom
and decency

1666
01:40:03,365 --> 01:40:06,334
against the most evil
and autocratic power

1667
01:40:06,368 --> 01:40:08,603
this world
has ever seen?

1668
01:40:10,138 --> 01:40:11,106
Mr. Lansing.

1669
01:40:11,139 --> 01:40:12,540
Mr. president.

1670
01:40:12,574 --> 01:40:14,476
You will hand his excellency
count Von bernstorff

1671
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:15,777
his passports immediately.

1672
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,545

01:41:55,577 --> 01:42:00,748
of the solemn...
And even tragic character

1687
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:04,352
of the step
I am taking...

1688
01:42:04,386 --> 01:42:07,655
And of the grave
responsibilities

1689
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:11,393
which it involves,

1690
01:42:11,426 --> 01:42:15,330
I advise that the congress

1691
01:42:15,363 --> 01:42:17,499
declare the recent course

1692
01:42:17,532 --> 01:42:20,568
of the imperial
German government

1693
01:42:20,602 --> 01:42:26,641
to be in fact
nothing less than war

1694
01:42:26,674 --> 01:42:29,544
against the government
and people

1695
01:42:29,577 --> 01:42:31,913
of the United States

1696
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:37,785
and that it formally accept
the status of belligerency

1697
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:41,689
which has thus
been thrust upon it.

1698
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:43,525
Whoo!

1699
01:42:57,605 --> 01:42:59,941
In so doing,

1700
01:42:59,974 --> 01:43:04,346
let us make clear
to all the world

1701
01:43:04,379 --> 01:43:08,916
what our motives
and objectives are.

1702
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:15,657
We have no selfish ends
to serve.

1703
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:18,793
We desire no conquest,

1704
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:21,396
no dominion,

1705
01:43:21,429 --> 01:43:24,232
no material compensation

1706
01:43:24,266 --> 01:43:28,803
for the sacrifices
we shall freely make.

1707
01:43:30,672 --> 01:43:33,641
We are but one
of the champions

1708
01:43:33,675 --> 01:43:37,279
of the rights
of mankind.

1709
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:39,781
We shall be satisfied

1710
01:43:39,814 --> 01:43:44,519
when those rights
have been made as secure

1711
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:50,558
as the faith and freedom
of nations can make them.

1712
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:53,395
It is a fearful thing

1713
01:43:53,428 --> 01:43:59,667
to lead this great,
peaceful people into war.

1714
01:43:59,701 --> 01:44:05,507
But the right is more
precious than peace,

1715
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:08,776
and we shall fight
for the things

1716
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:13,548
which we have always carried
nearest our hearts...

1717
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,384
For democracy,

1718
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:20,388
for the right of those
who submit to authority

1719
01:44:20,422 --> 01:44:25,527
to have a voice
in their own government,

1720
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,932
for the rights and liberties
of small nations,

1721
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:34,536
for a universal
dominion of right

1722
01:44:34,569 --> 01:44:39,073
by such a concert
of free peoples

1723
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:45,079
as shall bring peace
and safety to all nations

1724
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:51,285
and make the world itself,
at last, free.

1725
01:44:59,494 --> 01:45:01,463
Through such a task,

1726
01:45:01,496 --> 01:45:08,403
we can dedicate our lives
and our fortunes...

1727
01:45:08,436 --> 01:45:11,639

who know that
the day has come

1731

1732
01:45:25,086 --> 01:45:29,791
to spend her blood
and her might

1733
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:36,431
for the principles
that gave her birth
and happiness...

1734

And the peace
which she has treasured.

01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:10,271
There's someone here
who wants to say
goodbye to you.

1777
01:50:10,304 --> 01:50:12,606
Come in. Come in.

1778
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,909
Felton.

1779
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:17,144
Hello, Mr. president.
Mrs. Wilson.

1780
01:50:17,178 --> 01:50:19,080
Congratulations,
lieutenant.
Thank you.

1781
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:22,083
I don't want
to take your time,
Mr. president.

1782
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:25,119
I just wanted
to say so long

1783
01:50:25,152 --> 01:50:26,688
before I shoved off.

1784
01:50:26,721 --> 01:50:28,089
You're
leaving soon?

1785
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:31,425
I'm afraid that's
a military secret,
sir.

1786
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:32,660
Yes.

1787
01:50:32,694 --> 01:50:34,395
Yes. Quite right, too.

1788
01:50:34,428 --> 01:50:37,031
Well, take care
of yourself, felton.

1789
01:50:37,064 --> 01:50:38,399
Yes, sir, I will.

1790
01:50:38,432 --> 01:50:42,036
And... Don't be
too impatient with us.

1791
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,404
No, sir.

1792
01:50:43,437 --> 01:50:46,307
I'll try
not to be.

1793
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,275
Well, son...

1794
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:52,046
Goodbye.

1795
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:53,447
Goodbye, sir.

1796
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,749
Goodbye, lieutenant,

1797
01:50:54,782 --> 01:50:56,050
and... Good luck to you.

1798
01:50:56,083 --> 01:50:57,218
Thank you.

1799
01:50:57,251 --> 01:51:00,121
Thank you
for coming to see me.

1800
01:51:01,789 --> 01:51:03,390
Thank you very much.

1801
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,659
Very much.

1802
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:12,133
Goodbye, sir.

1804
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:00,447
It's her,
I tell you.

1805
01:52:00,481 --> 01:52:02,083
Oh.
It couldn't be.

1806
01:52:02,116 --> 01:52:03,450
I'm sure of it.

1807
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:05,419
Ah, don't kid me.

1808
01:52:05,452 --> 01:52:08,022
Why don't you
go and ask her?

1809
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:09,456
Find out
for yourself.

1810
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:11,225
O.K., I will.

1811
01:52:21,502 --> 01:52:23,070
Thank you, ma'am.

1812
01:52:23,104 --> 01:52:24,071
Lady...

1813
01:52:24,105 --> 01:52:25,306
Coffee.

1814
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:29,443
They've been trying
to tell me

1815
01:52:29,476 --> 01:52:31,478
that you're
the president's wife.

1816
01:52:31,512 --> 01:52:32,947
Really?

1817
01:52:36,117 --> 01:52:38,485
They can't
string me.

1818
01:52:38,519 --> 01:52:41,122
You don't think
I look the part?

1819
01:52:41,155 --> 01:52:42,456
I say you don't.

1820
01:52:44,125 --> 01:52:47,094
I agree, but when you
come back from France,

1821
01:52:47,128 --> 01:52:49,496
if you come
to the white house,

1822
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:52,066
I'll do my best
to look as I should,

1823
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:55,136
or better still,
speak to the president
himself about it.

1824
01:52:55,169 --> 01:52:56,971
There he is.

1825
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:06,080
Slippery,
aren't they?

1826
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:07,381
I'll get you
another.

1827
01:53:07,414 --> 01:53:09,016
You are the... the...

1828
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:11,986
Even the president
has to do kp
occasionally.

1829
01:53:12,019 --> 01:53:13,387
Hiya,
Mr. president.

1830
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,322
How are you,
young man?

1831
01:53:15,356 --> 01:53:18,359
I never thought
I'd be shaking hands
with you.

1832
01:53:18,392 --> 01:53:21,328
I can't wait
to write home about this.

1833
01:53:21,362 --> 01:53:23,230
Only they'll never
believe it.

1834
01:53:23,264 --> 01:53:24,832
Hello, Mr. president.

1835
01:53:24,866 --> 01:53:26,067
Where are you from?

1836
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,168
Milwaukee, sir.

1837
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:28,502
German?

1838
01:53:28,535 --> 01:53:30,938
My father was German.
I'm just an American.

1839
01:53:30,972 --> 01:53:31,973
And you?

1840
01:53:32,006 --> 01:53:33,207
My name's vespucci,

1841
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,042
but I'm just
an American, too.

1842
01:53:35,076 --> 01:53:37,945
I guess there's
something funny
about all of us.

1843
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:39,947
Mike here's
a bohunk.

1844
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:41,282
Me? I'm just Irish.

1845
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:44,285
Tex here claims he's
just from plain Texas.

1846
01:53:44,318 --> 01:53:48,222
Nobody told me
any different yet.

1847
01:53:48,255 --> 01:53:51,525
Well, this is all
very interesting, boys.

1848
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:54,161
I want you
to remember it.

1849
01:53:54,195 --> 01:53:56,497
Here we are,

1850
01:53:56,530 --> 01:54:00,434
men of all races, with
different backgrounds
and ancestries,

1851
01:54:00,467 --> 01:54:03,104
working together
for a common purpose.

1852
01:54:03,137 --> 01:54:04,972
That's what's made
America what it is,

1853
01:54:05,006 --> 01:54:06,974
and that's what
the whole world

1854
01:54:07,008 --> 01:54:08,976
must learn to do
someday.

1855
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:11,345
I know there are people
who say

1856
01:54:11,378 --> 01:54:14,381
this is just another war
to protect
the great fortunes

1857
01:54:14,415 --> 01:54:17,018
or for some other
economic reason,

1858
01:54:17,051 --> 01:54:19,386
but don't believe them.

1859
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:22,356
If anybody
tries to tell you

1860
01:54:22,389 --> 01:54:26,994
that universal peace
is just an idle dream...

1861
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:28,930
Tell him he's a liar.

1862
01:54:28,963 --> 01:54:31,966
Say your president said
that you're
fighting this war

1863
01:54:31,999 --> 01:54:35,069
so there won't have
to be any more wars,

1864
01:54:35,102 --> 01:54:37,905
and that when we
get through with it,

1865
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:40,975
we're going to sit down
with other people
who feel as we do

1866
01:54:41,008 --> 01:54:44,045
and work out some plan
which will make it
unnecessary

1867
01:54:44,078 --> 01:54:47,581
for boys like you
and your sons

1868
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:50,451
to have to go out
and shoot one another.

1869
01:54:52,186 --> 01:54:54,255
Maybe we'll call it
a... a league,

1870
01:54:54,288 --> 01:54:56,323
maybe something else,
but whatever it is,

1871
01:54:56,357 --> 01:54:58,492
that's what you're going
to France for,

1872
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:01,095
and with the help
of God,

1873
01:55:01,128 --> 01:55:04,365
that's what
you're going to get.

1874
01:55:04,398 --> 01:55:06,267
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1875
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,635
Company, fall in!

1876
01:55:08,669 --> 01:55:11,205
All right.
Get back on the train!

1877
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:15,009
What are you trying to do,
hold up the war?

1878
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:18,079
Take it easy. We've
just been talking
to the president.

1879
01:55:18,112 --> 01:55:19,080
Says you!

1880
01:55:19,113 --> 01:55:21,048
All right, you...

1881
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:22,649
See?

1882
01:55:22,683 --> 01:55:24,451
What did I
tell you?

1883
01:55:24,485 --> 01:55:25,719
Carry on, sergeant.

1884
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,388
Yes, sir.

1885
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:30,391
All right, men.
Get back on the train.

1886
01:55:31,525 --> 01:55:33,494
So long, soldiers.

1887
01:55:33,527 --> 01:55:35,429
Goodbye.

1888
01:55:38,499 --> 01:55:40,067
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

1889
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:42,069
Don't you worry
about this war.

1890
01:55:42,103 --> 01:55:44,505
We'll take care of it
for you.

1891
01:55:44,538 --> 01:55:46,107
Thank you,
soldier.

1892
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:48,175
Bye, sir.

1893
01:55:51,645 --> 01:55:55,116
For our part,
we see very clearly

1894
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:58,119
that unless justice
is done to others,

1895
01:55:58,152 --> 01:56:01,522
it will not
be done to us.

1896
01:56:01,555 --> 01:56:05,426
The program of the
world's peace, therefore,

1897
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:08,695
is our program,

1898
01:56:08,729 --> 01:56:11,532
and that program...

1899
01:56:11,565 --> 01:56:16,403
The only possible program...

1900
01:56:16,437 --> 01:56:20,574
Is based, as we see it,

1901
01:56:20,607 --> 01:56:24,145
on these 14 points.

1902
01:56:24,178 --> 01:56:27,181
Open covenants
openly arrived at.

1903
01:56:27,214 --> 01:56:29,450
Freedom of the seas.

1904
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:31,385
Self-determination.

1905
01:56:31,418 --> 01:56:32,419

casualty figures, Baker?

1910
01:56:52,539 --> 01:56:54,441
Yes, sir.

1911
01:56:57,144 --> 01:57:01,082
This is not one of my
most pleasant tasks,
Mr. president.

1912
01:57:01,115 --> 01:57:02,449
I know.

dead so far.

an approximation,

are not in.

are dying for.

No, thank you...

wouldn't be greater

02:00:30,324 --> 02:00:32,293
And if mistakes
were made,

1952
02:00:32,326 --> 02:00:33,727
you could
repudiate them.

1953
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,962
I hope no mistakes
will be made.

1954
02:00:35,996 --> 02:00:36,997
Lettuce
sandwich.

1955
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:38,365
I'll get you another.

1956
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:39,400
Don't bother.

1957
02:00:39,433 --> 02:00:40,667
Who'll
go with you?

1958
02:00:40,701 --> 02:00:41,835
Lansing and house.

1959
02:00:41,868 --> 02:00:43,670
I meant someone
from the senate.

1960
02:00:43,704 --> 02:00:46,407
Remember, they'll
have to approve
any treaty.

1961
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,575
Whom have you
in mind?

1962
02:00:48,609 --> 02:00:51,812
Senator lodge is chairman
of the foreign relations
committee...

1963
02:00:51,845 --> 02:00:53,780
And a very practical man.

1964
02:00:53,814 --> 02:00:55,316
Have one of these,
Professor.

1965
02:00:55,349 --> 02:00:57,551
Thank you, Edith.
Ah, one with meat in it.

1966
02:00:57,584 --> 02:00:59,353
That's the trouble.

1967
02:00:59,386 --> 02:01:01,755
Too many treaties
have been written
by practical men.

1968
02:01:01,788 --> 02:01:04,758
If I take anyone
from the other party,

1969
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:07,361
it'll be someone
like Henry white.

1970
02:01:07,394 --> 02:01:09,396
He's served in
our Paris embassy,

1971
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:10,631
he knows Europe...

1972
02:01:10,664 --> 02:01:12,466
May I point out,
Mr. president,

1973
02:01:12,499 --> 02:01:15,001
that this is the heyday of
nationalism among nations.

1974
02:01:15,035 --> 02:01:18,038
In Paris you'll meet
the ablest politicians
in the world...

1975
02:01:18,071 --> 02:01:20,407
Practical men...
Many of whom

1976
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:22,443
will be concerned
not so much with peace

1977
02:01:22,476 --> 02:01:24,478
as with national boundaries,
indemnities,

1978
02:01:24,511 --> 02:01:26,347
new balances of power.

1979
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:28,849
Many of our own people are
going to share their views.

1980
02:01:28,882 --> 02:01:31,885
It might be wise to have
a practical man along

1981
02:01:31,918 --> 02:01:33,954
to cope with such people.

1982
02:01:33,987 --> 02:01:36,623
Mac, I agree with you
as to the situation.

1983
02:01:36,657 --> 02:01:38,892
I disagree with you
as to the solution.

1984
02:01:38,925 --> 02:01:41,628
In a world full
of practical men,

1985
02:01:41,662 --> 02:01:44,398
more practical men
would hinder
rather than help.

1986
02:01:44,431 --> 02:01:46,800
Our great hope
lies not in me

1987
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,535
or in any other
individual,

1988
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:50,937
but in
the power of right.

1989
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:52,973
People
all over the world...

1990
02:01:53,006 --> 02:01:54,875
The common people...

1991
02:01:54,908 --> 02:01:58,879
Have set their hearts
and minds against
selfish nationalism.

1992
02:01:58,912 --> 02:02:02,416
They've paid
with their blood
and treasure.

1993
02:02:02,449 --> 02:02:03,784
I must go...

1994
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:06,487
Not alone, as president
of the United States,

1995
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:09,923
but as the spokesman
for these peoples of
whatever nationality.

1996
02:02:09,956 --> 02:02:12,526
Our own people
expect me to go.

1997
02:02:12,559 --> 02:02:14,828
To do anything less
would be unthinkable.

1998
02:02:14,861 --> 02:02:17,898
Well, I suppose
if your mind
is made up,

1999
02:02:17,931 --> 02:02:19,900
there's
nothing we can
do about it.

2000
02:02:19,933 --> 02:02:22,936
Still, if it
were up to me,
I'd take lodge,

2001
02:02:22,969 --> 02:02:24,805
put him right
out in front,

2002
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:26,673
make him help
carry the load.

2003
02:02:26,707 --> 02:02:28,675
I'd keep my eye
on the little...

2004
02:02:28,709 --> 02:02:30,076
Oh, excuse me,
Edith...

2005
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:32,813
On that little
goatee of his.

2006
02:04:27,761 --> 02:04:28,995
Thank you,
senator.

2007
02:04:29,029 --> 02:04:30,096
[Chuckling]

2008
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:31,598
They tell me
in Italy

2009
02:04:31,632 --> 02:04:32,766
they're even
burning candles

2010
02:04:32,799 --> 02:04:34,200
in front of
his picture.

2011
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:35,502
Kaiser woodrow.

2012
02:04:35,536 --> 02:04:37,037
Or is it
Saint woodrow now?

2013
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:38,605
He's having
a field day,

2014
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,641
but wait till
that old tiger
clemenceau

2015
02:04:40,674 --> 02:04:41,908
gets through
with him.

2016
02:04:41,942 --> 02:04:43,910
He'll be lucky
to keep his shirt.

2017
02:04:43,944 --> 02:04:45,812
It's America's
shirt I'm
worried about.

2018
02:04:45,846 --> 02:04:47,814
This'll put
a firecracker under him.

2019
02:04:47,848 --> 02:04:49,750
Maybe now he'll realize
there's such a thing

2020
02:04:49,783 --> 02:04:51,985
as the senate
and the constitution.

2021
02:04:52,018 --> 02:04:55,021
All this business about
remaking the map of Europe,

2022
02:04:55,055 --> 02:04:57,190
giving away this,
giving away that,

2023
02:04:57,223 --> 02:05:00,961
talking about America
not having any material
interest in this war...

2024
02:05:00,994 --> 02:05:02,929
What about the money
we lent them?

2025
02:05:02,963 --> 02:05:04,965
I don't think
we need to worry,
gentlemen.

2026
02:05:04,998 --> 02:05:06,600
We now have the names

2027
02:05:06,633 --> 02:05:08,602
of 37 members of the
United States senate

2028
02:05:08,635 --> 02:05:10,136
affixed
to this document.

2029
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:12,806
Senator lodge, you haven't
expressed yourself.

2030
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,775
Are you still with us?

2031
02:05:14,808 --> 02:05:16,076
My views
on this subject

2032
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:17,744
are well known,
gentlemen.

2033
02:05:17,778 --> 02:05:19,813
Nothing that has
happened in Europe
or elsewhere

2034
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:21,782
has caused me
to change them.

2035
02:05:21,815 --> 02:05:24,818
You'll introduce
the resolution
yourself?

2036
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:27,554
I should consider it
an honor, sir.

2037
02:05:27,588 --> 02:05:29,089
Thank you,
senator.

2038
02:05:30,824 --> 02:05:34,294
Mr. president, France
can accept no treaty

2039
02:05:34,327 --> 02:05:36,329
that does not include
the saone basin

2040
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:38,599
and all territory
west of the rhine!

2041
02:05:38,632 --> 02:05:40,867
But France has
no right to that land.

2042
02:05:40,901 --> 02:05:43,103
It belongs
to the people
who live on it.

2043
02:05:43,136 --> 02:05:44,771
They can
go where they please.

2044
02:05:44,805 --> 02:05:46,940
My government
demands the land
and its resources!

2045
02:05:46,973 --> 02:05:48,208
So do our people!

2046
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:50,010
That's impossible.

2047
02:05:50,043 --> 02:05:51,945
When the Germans
surrendered,

2048
02:05:51,978 --> 02:05:54,180
it was on condition
that we protect
their rights.

2049
02:05:54,214 --> 02:05:55,616
That's written
in the armistice.

2050
02:05:55,649 --> 02:05:57,183
You yourself
signed it.

2051
02:05:57,217 --> 02:05:59,786
The Germans forfeited
their rights in this war.

2052
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:01,221
They are murderers!

2053
02:06:01,254 --> 02:06:03,757
Monsieur clemenceau...

2054
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:06,727
I will never be a party
to such an agreement.

2055
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:10,196
It violates
everything we said
we were fighting for.

2056
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:13,299
To take part of Germany
and cede it to France

2057
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:15,135
is nothing
short of theft.

2058
02:06:15,168 --> 02:06:17,037
You live in America,
Mr. Wilson,

2059
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,939
with an ocean
on either side.

2060
02:06:18,972 --> 02:06:22,709
You can afford to be lenient
with your enemies.

2061
02:06:22,743 --> 02:06:25,145
If you won't abide
by the armistice,

2062
02:06:25,178 --> 02:06:26,947
I might as well
go home.

2063
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:30,150
If such a position
to our just claims
is continued,

2064
02:06:30,183 --> 02:06:31,918
I might as well
resign!

2065
02:06:31,952 --> 02:06:33,153
You're breaking
your word!

2066
02:06:33,186 --> 02:06:34,354
You are pro-German!

2067
02:06:34,387 --> 02:06:36,189
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

2068
02:06:36,222 --> 02:06:38,959
Let us consider
these matters calmly.

2069
02:06:38,992 --> 02:06:44,264
We all believe in the
self-determination clause
of the 14 points.

2070
02:06:44,297 --> 02:06:47,067
It is not right
to do wrong,

2071
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,969
even to make peace.

2072
02:06:50,704 --> 02:06:52,673
Besides, the covenant of
the league of nations

2073
02:06:52,706 --> 02:06:55,108
is sufficient guarantee
of France's safety.

2074
02:06:55,141 --> 02:06:56,843
Under its provisions,

2075
02:06:56,877 --> 02:06:59,279
there is not the slightest
shadow of a doubt

2076
02:06:59,312 --> 02:07:02,949
but that
the United States
and Great Britain

2077
02:07:02,983 --> 02:07:05,986
will instantly rise
to the defense of France

2078
02:07:06,019 --> 02:07:08,655
should Germany ever
again become hostile.

2079
02:07:08,689 --> 02:07:10,957
That's all very well,
Mr. president,

2080
02:07:10,991 --> 02:07:13,259
when you speak of
what America will not do,

2081
02:07:13,293 --> 02:07:16,863
but are you
prepared to guarantee
what America will do?

2082
02:07:16,897 --> 02:07:18,198
I am.

2083
02:07:19,766 --> 02:07:22,302
Are you aware that
a block of 37 senators

2084
02:07:22,335 --> 02:07:23,837
have signed a resolution

2085
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:25,739
stating that the league
as you propose it

2086
02:07:25,772 --> 02:07:27,373
is not acceptable
to the American people?

2087
02:07:27,407 --> 02:07:31,044
I am perfectly aware
of that document,
monsieur.

2088
02:07:31,077 --> 02:07:33,013
However, I should
like to remind you

2089
02:07:33,046 --> 02:07:35,749
that these men
do not compose
the entire senate,

2090
02:07:35,782 --> 02:07:38,318
nor do they reflect
the opinion of
the American people,

2091
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:40,420
regardless of party.

2092
02:07:40,453 --> 02:07:42,288
As a matter of fact,

2093
02:07:42,322 --> 02:07:45,258
some of the leading
members of
the republican party,

2094
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:48,428
including
former president
William Howard taft

2095
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:50,897
and
Charles Evans Hughes,

2096
02:07:50,931 --> 02:07:54,300
have expressed approval
of the league...

2097
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:58,471
And I will also
give you my word for
this, too, monsieur...

2098
02:07:58,504 --> 02:08:00,373
If these 37 men,

2099
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:03,910
who represent no opinion
but their own,

2100
02:08:03,944 --> 02:08:07,413
dare try to block,
to thwart, to betray

2101
02:08:07,447 --> 02:08:11,417
the first honest attempt
of the world to achieve
a permanent peace,

2102
02:08:11,451 --> 02:08:13,820
the American people
will rise in their anger

2103
02:08:13,854 --> 02:08:15,856
and smash them
as they would

2104
02:08:15,889 --> 02:08:17,991
an alien enemy
landing on their shores.

2105
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,728
Mr. president,

2106
02:08:21,762 --> 02:08:23,329
I bow to you.

2107
02:08:23,363 --> 02:08:28,101
Shall we resume
our discussion?

2108
02:09:12,112 --> 02:09:13,346
Now.

2109
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:24,250
I've asked you here
in the hope

2110
02:10:24,284 --> 02:10:26,252
that we might come
to some understanding

2111
02:10:26,286 --> 02:10:27,620
about the league of nations.

2112
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:30,290
I don't mean
to be facetious,
Mr. president,

2113
02:10:30,323 --> 02:10:33,026
but whose understanding...
Yours or ours?

2114
02:10:33,059 --> 02:10:35,095
One we can
mutually uphold.

2115
02:10:35,128 --> 02:10:36,897
In view of our
stated positions,

2116
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:39,065
I wonder if that isn't
expecting a great deal.

2117
02:10:39,099 --> 02:10:43,503
Senator, I'm sure
we all have one
purpose in common...

2118
02:10:43,536 --> 02:10:46,506
To serve the best
interests of
the American people.

2119
02:10:46,539 --> 02:10:48,909
Apparently, we have
very different ideas

2120
02:10:48,942 --> 02:10:51,177
as to what constitutes
their best interests.

2121
02:10:51,211 --> 02:10:54,347
In that case,
shouldn't we
at least try

2122
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:55,982
to reconcile
our differences?

2123
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:58,118
The treaty would have
been approved weeks ago

2124
02:10:58,151 --> 02:11:00,053
if it weren't attached
to your league.

2125
02:11:00,086 --> 02:11:02,588
Not my league,
senator.

2126
02:11:02,622 --> 02:11:04,557
As a matter of fact,

2127
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:07,160
I'd be more inclined
to call it your league,

2128
02:11:07,193 --> 02:11:09,562
for I seem to recall
that in 1916,

2129
02:11:09,595 --> 02:11:11,497
you yourself
advanced the thought

2130
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:14,100
that the nations
would have to
unite for peace

2131
02:11:14,134 --> 02:11:15,969
and that
an international
police force

2132
02:11:16,002 --> 02:11:17,270
would enforce it.

2133
02:11:17,303 --> 02:11:20,306
The fact that a man
has changed his mind

2134
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:23,609
does not bear
on the real merits
of any question,

2135
02:11:23,643 --> 02:11:26,479
and even if he happens
to be a convert,

2136
02:11:26,512 --> 02:11:28,481
some good work has
been done by converts

2137
02:11:28,514 --> 02:11:30,683
from the days of Saint Paul
to the present.

2138
02:11:30,716 --> 02:11:33,553
Besides, even in
my wildest dreams,

2139
02:11:33,586 --> 02:11:37,290
I never contemplated
placing American arms
and economic sanctions

2140
02:11:37,323 --> 02:11:39,259
every time some
ambitious ruler

2141
02:11:39,292 --> 02:11:42,062
coveted the lands and
resources of another.

2142
02:11:42,095 --> 02:11:45,165
We should constantly
be involved in broils
and quarrels

2143
02:11:45,198 --> 02:11:47,233
that are none
of our business.

2144
02:11:47,267 --> 02:11:52,072
Yet let me remind you
that in every discussion
of peace during the war,

2145
02:11:52,105 --> 02:11:53,373
we promised...

2146
02:11:53,406 --> 02:11:55,341
I beg your pardon.
You promised.

2147
02:11:55,375 --> 02:11:57,643
This government
promised...

2148
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:01,614
That...

2149
02:12:03,383 --> 02:12:08,254
Some way
would be found

2150
02:12:08,288 --> 02:12:10,256
to avoid
such catastrophes

2151
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:12,658
as we have just
been through.

2152
02:12:12,692 --> 02:12:14,527
Other nations
have accepted

2153
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,662
the principles
of the league.

2154
02:12:16,696 --> 02:12:20,133
It is inconceivable
that we who advanced it

2155
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:22,135
should go back
on our word.

2156
02:12:22,168 --> 02:12:24,137
If that is your
unalterable view,

2157
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:26,306
I'm afraid we shall
not get very far.

2158
02:12:26,339 --> 02:12:28,508
Just a moment,
senator.

2159
02:12:36,349 --> 02:12:38,718
Perhaps we've
made mistakes...

2160
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:42,688
All of us...

2161
02:12:46,026 --> 02:12:49,262
But regardless
of the treaty

2162
02:12:49,295 --> 02:12:52,532
or what you individually
may think of it...

2163
02:12:52,565 --> 02:12:56,236
Or of those
who wrote it,

2164
02:12:56,269 --> 02:12:59,772
let me remind you
that the league

2165
02:12:59,805 --> 02:13:04,144
is irrevocably
attached to it...

2166
02:13:04,177 --> 02:13:06,646
And the league...

2167
02:13:06,679 --> 02:13:11,651
Is the only hope...
The world has

2168
02:13:11,684 --> 02:13:14,387
to avoid wars
in the future.

2169
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:22,528
Unless you can advance
a better idea...

2170
02:13:22,562 --> 02:13:26,132
I beg of you
to consider that

2171
02:13:26,166 --> 02:13:28,601
and to help
save that hope.

2172
02:13:28,634 --> 02:13:32,205
I, too, have my ideals,
Mr. president,

2173
02:13:32,238 --> 02:13:35,275
and one of them is peace.

2174
02:13:35,308 --> 02:13:38,578
But a realistic peace
that we can surely maintain,

2175
02:13:38,611 --> 02:13:41,181
one which will not
siphon off the power

2176
02:13:41,214 --> 02:13:43,516
and prestige and resources
of the United States.

2177
02:13:43,549 --> 02:13:46,386
If you had wanted
my views on this matter,

2178
02:13:46,419 --> 02:13:48,421
you could very easily
have obtained them

2179
02:13:48,454 --> 02:13:50,456
before you went to Paris,

2180
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:53,393
before you made concessions
to the statesmen of Europe,

2181
02:13:53,426 --> 02:13:55,595
before you burned all
your Bridges behind you.

2182
02:13:55,628 --> 02:13:59,432
This is not
the age of miracles,
Mr. president...

2183
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,702
Nor of miracle workers.

2184
02:14:13,179 --> 02:14:17,083
America has
but two choices,
gentlemen...

2185
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:23,656
It must accept
a league of nations

2186
02:14:23,689 --> 02:14:27,393
or live with a gun
in its hand.

2187
02:14:28,828 --> 02:14:31,664
It's for the people
to decide.

2188
02:14:33,133 --> 02:14:34,300
Thank you
for coming.

2189
02:14:34,334 --> 02:14:35,468
Good day.

2190
02:14:37,603 --> 02:14:39,405
Good day, sir.

2191
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:41,807
Mr. president.

2192
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,757
Tumulty, you may start

2193
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:59,559
making arrangements
at once for our trip.

2194
02:14:59,592 --> 02:15:01,127
Governor, your health...

2195
02:15:01,161 --> 02:15:04,297
I'll have
no more haggling
with that man.

2196
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:05,698
I'll stump
the country

2197
02:15:05,731 --> 02:15:07,300
and let
the people know

2198
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:09,469
exactly
what's at stake.

2199
02:15:09,502 --> 02:15:11,771
But, governor, you know
what Dr. Grayson said.

2200
02:15:11,804 --> 02:15:13,773
You can't afford
to take the risk.

2201
02:15:13,806 --> 02:15:15,708
I promised
the young men
of this country

2202
02:15:15,741 --> 02:15:18,144
that we were
fighting this war
to end wars.

2203
02:15:18,178 --> 02:15:21,581
It's up to me
to see that we meant
what we said.

2204
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:23,115
Woodrow...

2205
02:15:24,584 --> 02:15:27,587
For my sake,
why don't you do
as they ask?

2206
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:29,322
Accept the senate
reservations

2207
02:15:29,355 --> 02:15:32,458
and get this awful
quarrel settled.

2208
02:15:32,492 --> 02:15:34,794
Don't you desert me,
too, Edith.

2209
02:15:34,827 --> 02:15:37,697
I... I couldn't stand that.

2210
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:41,334
My dear, I'm only
thinking of you,
of your health.

2211
02:15:43,369 --> 02:15:46,339
I have no right
to accept any changes,

2212
02:15:46,372 --> 02:15:47,740
and even if I did,

2213
02:15:47,773 --> 02:15:51,644
they'd come back tomorrow
with 46 more.

2214
02:15:51,677 --> 02:15:55,515
It's just a scheme to kill
the league entirely.

2215
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:59,385
Forgive me.

2216
02:15:59,419 --> 02:16:01,221
I should have known.

2217
02:16:05,925 --> 02:16:10,263
Whatever mistakes we've
made about disarmament,

2218
02:16:10,296 --> 02:16:13,566
boundaries, reparations,

2219
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:15,401
war colonies,

2220
02:16:15,435 --> 02:16:20,706
the league will be in a position
to arbitrate and rectify.

2221
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:22,942
[Train whistle blows]

2222
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:31,717
The league is the vital
and compelling part

2223
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:33,553
of the treaty.

2224
02:16:36,989 --> 02:16:42,328
But there can be
no united action,

2225
02:16:42,362 --> 02:16:47,333
no league of nations
in the true sense,

2226
02:16:47,367 --> 02:16:51,604
without America's
participation.

2227
02:16:55,375 --> 02:16:58,711
The isolation
of the United States

2228
02:16:58,744 --> 02:17:00,846
is at an end!

2229
02:17:16,362 --> 02:17:19,332
Mr. president,
you'll have to
give up this trip

2230
02:17:19,365 --> 02:17:21,634
and return to
Washington at once.

2231
02:17:21,667 --> 02:17:24,036
That's impossible.

2232
02:17:24,069 --> 02:17:26,772
It's not only
possible,
it's imperative.

2233
02:17:26,806 --> 02:17:30,042
But I can't stop now.

2234
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:33,413
People are beginning
to understand.

2235
02:17:33,446 --> 02:17:36,382
If I desert them now,

2236
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:38,784
they'll be confused
and misled.

2237
02:17:38,818 --> 02:17:42,788
40 speeches
in 17 states
in 22 days.

2238
02:17:42,822 --> 02:17:44,924
No one could
stand it.

2239
02:17:44,957 --> 02:17:48,060
I'm scheduled
to speak here in pueblo.

2240
02:17:48,093 --> 02:17:50,830
People are waiting for me.

2241
02:17:53,433 --> 02:17:56,636
There are several
points that still have
to be explained.

2242
02:17:56,669 --> 02:17:59,004
But you could
speak here
another time.

2243
02:18:01,407 --> 02:18:03,376
I wouldn't
ask you to stop

2244
02:18:03,409 --> 02:18:05,378
if I thought there was
the slightest chance

2245
02:18:05,411 --> 02:18:07,046
you'd be able
to go on,

2246
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:08,781
but you'll
kill yourself.

2247
02:18:14,454 --> 02:18:16,322
I must go on.

2248
02:18:20,993 --> 02:18:22,795
I'm all right.

2249
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:31,337
[Crowd cheering]

2250
02:18:36,742 --> 02:18:39,979
People of pueblo...

2251
02:18:40,012 --> 02:18:42,582
My fellow citizens.

2252
02:18:46,786 --> 02:18:54,026
I feel like asking
the secretary of war

2253
02:18:54,059 --> 02:18:59,932
to get the boys who went
across the water to fight

2254
02:18:59,965 --> 02:19:05,505
together on some field

2255
02:19:05,538 --> 02:19:08,641
where I could
go and see them...

2256
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:16,516
And I would stand up
before them and say,

2257
02:19:16,549 --> 02:19:26,426
"boys, I told you before
you went across the seas

2258
02:19:26,459 --> 02:19:30,696
"that this was a war
against wars,

2259
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:36,536
and I did my best
to fulfill that promise..."

2260
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:39,439
[Train whistle blows]

2261
02:19:39,472 --> 02:19:44,109
"But I am obliged
to come to you

2262
02:19:44,143 --> 02:19:48,981
"with mortification
and shame

2263
02:19:49,014 --> 02:19:54,987
and say I have been unable
to fulfill that promise."

2264
02:19:58,658 --> 02:20:01,026
"You are betrayed."

2265
02:20:02,762 --> 02:20:08,133
"You fought for something
that you did not get...

2266
02:20:08,167 --> 02:20:10,603
"And the glory
of the armies

2267
02:20:10,636 --> 02:20:13,606
"and the navies
of the United States

2268
02:20:13,639 --> 02:20:17,777
"is gone like a dream
in the night,

02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:21,481
"and there ensues upon it,

2270
02:20:21,514 --> 02:20:25,551
"in the suitable darkness
of the night...

2271
02:20:25,585 --> 02:20:28,521
"The nightmare of dread,

2272
02:20:28,554 --> 02:20:34,560
which lay upon the nations
before this war came."

2273

"And there will come
some time,

of the peoples
of the world."

2281
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:21,173
I will...

2282
02:21:29,081 --> 02:21:31,584
Thank you for coming.

2283
02:21:59,078 --> 02:22:01,213
[Wilson]
I am so tired.

2284
02:22:03,248 --> 02:22:04,817
Mr. tumulty,
will you please

2285
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:06,619
tell
the newspapermen

2286
02:22:06,652 --> 02:22:08,053
we're returning
to Washington
immediately?

2287
02:22:08,087 --> 02:22:09,088
Yes.

2288
02:22:09,121 --> 02:22:10,656
No.

2289
02:22:21,634 --> 02:22:23,803
[Train whistle blows]

2290
02:23:07,713 --> 02:23:11,951
His whole left side
is paralyzed,

2291
02:23:11,984 --> 02:23:15,054
but his mind
is perfectly clear
and untouched.

2292
02:23:16,989 --> 02:23:19,625
Will he recover?

2293
02:23:19,659 --> 02:23:21,794
He'll improve with time,

2294
02:23:21,827 --> 02:23:25,931
but for the present,
he needs rest and quiet,

2295
02:23:25,965 --> 02:23:28,067
release from every
disturbing problem.

2296
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,169
But how is
that possible?

2297
02:23:30,202 --> 02:23:33,038
Everything that comes
to the president
is a problem.

2298
02:23:33,072 --> 02:23:35,107
Wouldn't it be better
if he'd resign

2299
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:36,976
and let Mr. Marshall
succeed him?

2300
02:23:37,009 --> 02:23:38,878
No, no, no, Edith.

2301
02:23:38,911 --> 02:23:43,248
He's staked his life
on getting
the league ratified.

2302
02:23:43,282 --> 02:23:44,984
If he resigns now,

2303
02:23:45,017 --> 02:23:47,052
this incentive
to recovery
will be gone.

2304
02:23:47,086 --> 02:23:51,891
Besides, his resignation
would have a very bad
effect on the country.

2305
02:23:51,924 --> 02:23:54,727
For that matter,
on the whole world.

2306
02:23:58,898 --> 02:24:01,133
Our thought is that
you have everything

2307
02:24:01,166 --> 02:24:02,802
of an official
nature come to you.

2308
02:24:05,337 --> 02:24:07,740
You can weigh the importance
of each matter,

2309
02:24:07,773 --> 02:24:11,176
and, in consultation
with the heads of
the various departments,

2310
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:14,714
decide what he must see and
what can be left to others.

2311
02:24:14,747 --> 02:24:18,283
In this way, Edith, you can
be of great service to him.

2312
02:24:18,317 --> 02:24:20,319
No.

2313
02:24:20,352 --> 02:24:22,254
I can't do it.

2314
02:24:22,287 --> 02:24:24,223
It's too great
a responsibility.

2315
02:24:24,256 --> 02:24:26,291
Even though his life
may depend upon it?

2316
02:24:31,263 --> 02:24:34,734
In that case,
there's only one answer.

2317
02:24:34,767 --> 02:24:36,168
I'll try.

2318
02:24:49,248 --> 02:24:50,315
Here.

2319
02:24:50,349 --> 02:24:51,383
Yes, ma'am.

2320
02:25:10,770 --> 02:25:12,071
Well, Mrs. president...

2321
02:25:12,104 --> 02:25:13,505
Woodrow!

2322
02:25:13,538 --> 02:25:15,775
What's on tap for today?

2323
02:25:15,808 --> 02:25:18,210
Don't you dare
to call me that.

2324
02:25:18,243 --> 02:25:20,880
You know very well
I never even
made one decision

2325
02:25:20,913 --> 02:25:22,481
without
your knowledge
and consent.

2326
02:25:22,514 --> 02:25:25,885
I know it, and you know it,

2327
02:25:25,918 --> 02:25:27,987
but do our enemies
know it?

2328
02:25:28,020 --> 02:25:30,990
I'm not concerned
with what
our enemies know.

2329
02:25:31,023 --> 02:25:33,759
You should listen
to them, my dear.

2330
02:25:33,793 --> 02:25:35,494
You'd learn
a great deal.

2331
02:25:35,527 --> 02:25:37,362
Such as what,
cousin woodrow?

2332
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:42,267
Well, during the war,
for instance,

2333
02:25:42,301 --> 02:25:46,038
I never would have
dreamed that Edith
was a German spy

2334
02:25:46,071 --> 02:25:48,340
if I hadn't
kept my ears open.

2335
02:25:48,373 --> 02:25:51,510
Nor, I suppose,
did you bargain
with wall street

2336
02:25:51,543 --> 02:25:53,545
to bring on the war
in the first place.

2337
02:25:53,578 --> 02:25:55,214
For that matter,

2338
02:25:55,247 --> 02:25:58,450
I never would
have suspected
that I was insane

2339
02:25:58,483 --> 02:26:00,052
if the senate
hadn't sent

2340
02:26:00,085 --> 02:26:02,254
the honorable
Albert fall to
look me over.

2341
02:26:02,287 --> 02:26:04,189
Oh, that man.

2342
02:26:04,223 --> 02:26:07,159
I don't see how you
take it so calmly.

2343
02:26:07,192 --> 02:26:08,527
I'd scratch
their eyes out.

2344
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,396
Woodrow handled
senator fall
beautifully.

2345
02:26:11,430 --> 02:26:13,833
As he was leaving,
that gentleman said,

2346
02:26:13,866 --> 02:26:17,169
"Mr. president,
the senate is
praying for you."

2347
02:26:17,202 --> 02:26:19,171
And woodrow, without
batting an eye,

2348
02:26:19,204 --> 02:26:21,907
asked, "which way,
senator?"

2349
02:26:24,043 --> 02:26:27,312
I'm afraid
I'm much more concerned

2350
02:26:27,346 --> 02:26:31,583
with what my grandchildren
and their generation
think of me

2351
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:35,320
than I am with what
the present lords of
the earth have to say.

2352
02:26:47,933 --> 02:26:50,469
No memoranda today?

2353
02:26:50,502 --> 02:26:53,873
They've passed
the volstead act
over your veto.

2354
02:26:53,906 --> 02:26:56,141
Well, now we'll
have prohibition,

2355
02:26:56,175 --> 02:26:57,542
I trust.

2356
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:59,578
Well, tumulty.

2357
02:26:59,611 --> 02:27:01,613
Governor,
the democrats

2358
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:04,249
have nominated
James Cox of Ohio.

2359
02:27:04,283 --> 02:27:06,919
Cox on one side,

2360
02:27:06,952 --> 02:27:08,487
Harding on the other.

2361
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:10,489
Cox for the league,

2362
02:27:10,522 --> 02:27:12,324
Harding against it.

2363
02:27:14,093 --> 02:27:17,462
Well,
the lines are drawn.

2364
02:27:17,496 --> 02:27:20,933
It's clearly up to
the people to decide.

2365
02:27:46,191 --> 02:27:48,127
[Piano playing]

2366
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:55,400
Governor?

2367
02:27:55,434 --> 02:27:56,969
Yes, tumulty?

2368
02:27:57,002 --> 02:27:58,670
[Piano stops]

2369
02:27:58,703 --> 02:28:01,473
Governor, it appears
that senator Harding

2370
02:28:01,506 --> 02:28:03,508
has won an overwhelming
victory.

2371
02:28:03,542 --> 02:28:05,410
Mm-hmm.

2372
02:28:05,444 --> 02:28:08,948
Senator Harding
has issued a statement
to the American people

2373
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:13,285
declaring that
the league of nations
is now a closed incident.

2374
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:24,163
Thank you, tumulty.

2375
02:28:24,196 --> 02:28:25,430
Yes, sir.

2376
02:28:35,607 --> 02:28:37,476
Well, Edith?

2377
02:28:37,509 --> 02:28:40,445
Yes, woodrow?

2378
02:28:44,116 --> 02:28:48,287
If these good people
will excuse us.

2379
02:28:52,691 --> 02:28:53,692
Good night.

2380
02:28:53,725 --> 02:28:54,960
Good night.

2381
02:28:54,994 --> 02:28:56,295
Good night.

2382
02:28:56,328 --> 02:28:57,329
Good night.

2383
02:28:57,362 --> 02:28:58,430
Good night.

2384
02:28:58,463 --> 02:28:59,598
Good night.

2385
02:29:37,069 --> 02:29:38,370
Is that everything?

2386
02:29:38,403 --> 02:29:39,671
That's all, dear.

2387
02:29:41,173 --> 02:29:43,208
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson,
Mr. president.

2388
02:29:43,242 --> 02:29:44,443
Thank you.

2389
02:29:51,083 --> 02:29:54,786
I'm sorry I can't stay for
the inauguration ceremonies,

2390
02:29:54,819 --> 02:29:56,621
but Mr. Harding
and Mr. coolidge

2391
02:29:56,655 --> 02:29:58,623
have been kind enough
to excuse me.

2392
02:29:58,657 --> 02:30:01,560
I told them it was bad enough
for the senate to throw me down

2393
02:30:01,593 --> 02:30:05,164
without my stumbling
up the steps
on my own account.

2394
02:30:11,103 --> 02:30:13,672
Mr. president, I...

2395
02:30:13,705 --> 02:30:16,041
Eight years.

2396
02:30:16,075 --> 02:30:17,709
Goodbye,
Marshall.

2397
02:30:17,742 --> 02:30:19,211
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

2398
02:30:19,244 --> 02:30:20,312
Goodbye,
Mr. Marshall.

2399
02:30:20,345 --> 02:30:22,314
Mrs. Wilson.
Good luck, sir.

2400
02:30:22,347 --> 02:30:24,049
It was a pleasure
serving under you.

2401
02:30:24,083 --> 02:30:25,250
Thank you.

2402
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:28,387
Mr. president, I...

2403
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:30,089
Daniels, we've taken
a house in "s" street.

2404
02:30:30,122 --> 02:30:32,524
I hope to see you
there often.

2405
02:30:32,557 --> 02:30:34,126
Yes, indeed.

2406
02:30:34,159 --> 02:30:35,127
Thank you.

2407
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,761
God bless you.

2408
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:40,099
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

2409
02:30:40,132 --> 02:30:41,533
Goodbye, Alexander.

2410
02:30:41,566 --> 02:30:43,202
Goodbye.

2411
02:30:43,235 --> 02:30:46,105
It's a great
honor to have been
in your cabinet.

2412
02:30:46,138 --> 02:30:50,709
Houston, thank you for
your very able support.

2413
02:30:53,145 --> 02:30:54,546
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

2414
02:30:54,579 --> 02:30:55,780
Goodbye, Wilson.

2415
02:30:57,682 --> 02:31:00,085
Mr. president,

2416
02:31:00,119 --> 02:31:02,154
now that the United States
has rejected the league,

2417
02:31:02,187 --> 02:31:04,189
can we ever
hope for peace

2418
02:31:04,223 --> 02:31:06,658
or real understanding
between nations?

2419
02:31:06,691 --> 02:31:08,493
Yes.

2420
02:31:08,527 --> 02:31:10,462
I'm not one of those

2421
02:31:10,495 --> 02:31:12,431
who has
the slightest anxiety

2422
02:31:12,464 --> 02:31:15,500
about the eventual
triumph of the things
I've stood for.

2423
02:31:15,534 --> 02:31:17,469
The fight's just begun.

2424
02:31:17,502 --> 02:31:20,505
You and I may never
live to see it finished,

2425
02:31:20,539 --> 02:31:22,474
but that doesn't matter.

2426
02:31:22,507 --> 02:31:24,843
The ideals of the league
are not dead

2427
02:31:24,876 --> 02:31:28,113
just because
a few obstructive men
now in the saddle

2428
02:31:28,147 --> 02:31:29,881
say they are.

2429
02:31:29,914 --> 02:31:32,517
The dream
of a world united

2430
02:31:32,551 --> 02:31:35,887
against the awful wastes
of war

2431
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:40,392
is too deeply embedded
in the hearts
of men everywhere.

2432
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:43,128
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

2433
02:31:43,162 --> 02:31:44,529
Goodbye, Mr. Payne.

2434
02:31:44,563 --> 02:31:48,900
And I'll even make this
concession to Providence

2435
02:31:48,933 --> 02:31:53,405
it may come about
in a better way
than we proposed.

2436
02:31:56,508 --> 02:31:58,410
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

2437
02:31:58,443 --> 02:32:00,579
Just woodrow Wilson now.

2438
02:32:00,612 --> 02:32:03,248
You still have
one minute to go,
Mr. president.

2439
02:32:03,282 --> 02:32:05,150
Goodbye, sir.

2440
02:32:05,184 --> 02:32:06,485
Goodbye, Baker.

2441
02:32:06,518 --> 02:32:07,786
Goodbye, Edith.

2442
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:09,554
We hope to see you often.

2443
02:32:09,588 --> 02:32:11,656
Mr. president?

2444
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:13,825
Senator lodge.

2445
02:32:30,509 --> 02:32:32,244
Mr. president,

2446
02:32:32,277 --> 02:32:34,546
a joint committee of
the house and senate

2447
02:32:34,579 --> 02:32:36,248
is here to notify you

2448
02:32:36,281 --> 02:32:38,317
that congress
has completed
the business before it

2449
02:32:38,350 --> 02:32:40,219
and now stands ready
to adjourn,

2450
02:32:40,252 --> 02:32:44,689
unless you have some
further message.

2451
02:32:49,728 --> 02:32:51,896
The president has nothing
further to communicate.

2452
02:32:51,930 --> 02:32:54,766
[Clock chimes]

2453
02:33:12,751 --> 02:33:14,319
Good day, sir.

2454
02:33:15,854 --> 02:33:22,661
* long may our land
be bright *

2455
02:33:22,694 --> 02:33:29,568
* with freedom's
holy light *

2456
02:33:29,601 --> 02:33:32,904
* protect us

2457
02:33:32,937 --> 02:33:38,009
* by thy might

2458
02:33:38,042 --> 02:33:42,647
* great God

2459
02:33:42,681 --> 02:33:45,717
* our

2460
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:50,255
* king
