1
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,546
You didn't go to Boston.

2
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,048
No.

3
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,969
I tell that prick
I'm gonna have 1000 bucks,

4
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,054
I'm gonna have a thou.

5
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,098
I'm still 50 bucks short.

6
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,534
What's that got to do with anything?

7
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,642
Everything.

8
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,854
Business is business.

9
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,649
You gotta keep your word.

10
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,652
Your word is your reputation.

11
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:18,074
You lose your reputation,
and you're out of business.

12
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,718
Well, you're not talking about business,

13
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,327
you're talking about your own ego.

14
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,538
Ego, reputation, what's the difference?

15
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,248
Well, that's what I just said.

16
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,877
So, anyway,

17
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,730
looks like my customers are just gonna
have to wait till I get me 50 bucks.

18
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,922
Good.

19
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,175
Good? Shit.

20
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,803
Rich broads.

21
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,224
You never had to make
a buck in your life.

22
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,769
I have to go out and hustle every day.

23
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,565
What are you doing?

24
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,733
Just sitting there in the
bathtub on your fat ass.

25
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,069
We ain't got nothing here.

26
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,531
We can't move.

27
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,940
And we ain't got much left in
the old cookie jar either.

28
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,953
But, Frank, you promised...

29
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,415
Maybe we could stay off of the hard
stuff for a while and just smoke.

30
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,376
Yeah, yeah, but when I make this deal,

31
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,922
we ain't even gonna
have to leave the house.

32
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,758
We can just groove and groove.

33
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,928
You can go down and get yourself a
year's supply of peanut butter.

34
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,347
I can get the hi-fi out of hock.

35
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,474
I can go down to Netty's
and get me some brushes

36
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,268
and some paints and an easel
and a mile of canvas.

37
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,562
Who paints?

38
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,397
I paint.

39
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,079
You know I love you.

40
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,556
You got love, you don't need this stuff.

41
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,084
Is that the message?

42
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,755
Well, I love you, too.

43
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,216
So there.

44
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,279
You know, I was only kidding.

45
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,324
About your painting.

46
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,298
I really like your paintings.

47
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,336
You're not gonna take that
much yourself, are you?

48
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,361
You want a poke?

49
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,404
No.

50
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,026
You didn't ask me where I was today.

51
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,344
Where do you think I was?

52
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,785
Did you think I was with some other guy?

53
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,566
I went to my parents'.

54
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,735
What the hell did you go there for?

55
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,529
Well, it was near, my mother's
birthday was coming up, and

56
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,824
I don't like to be here all
by myself when you're away.

57
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,314
And anyhow... Well, why should
that freak you out so much?

58
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,621
It freaks me out.

59
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,166
You know it freaks me out.

60
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,640
How about some music?

61
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,795
Here.

62
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,515
It's okay.

63
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,006
You don't have to do it for me.

64
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,814
I understand about your parents.

65
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,443
That's got nothing to do with my parents.

66
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,537
Come on, Frank, let's make love.

67
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,125
Ouch!
That fucking radiator.

68
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,379
When are you gonna move the bed?

69
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,042
Where are you going?

70
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,752
I'm gonna get me that 50 bucks.

71
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,422
That's crummy.

72
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,470
You promised you weren't
gonna do that anymore.

73
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,360
You want me to sell them
our stuff, do you?

74
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,011
No!

75
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,539
So, instead of a trip, the teeny
boppers get vitamin pills.

76
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,182
I'm doing them a favor.

77
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,561
Shit. With a line like that,
I could run for mayor.

78
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,690
Frank, please don't go. I...
I don't feel very good.

79
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:52,695
Frank!

80
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:58,534
You'll be okay. I'll be right back.
It can't take too long.

81
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,871
Pop one up if you have to.
You'll feel great. See you.

82
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,574
How do I know it's any good, man?

83
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,160
It's so good, you'll
wish it wasn't so good.

84
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,828
I got beat last week.

85
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,498
That was last week.
Now is now.

86
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,122
How about a taste up front?

87
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,672
Sorry, man.
No samples.

88
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,590
It's too good.

89
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,039
Well, let me see it, man, okay?

90
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,427
Sure.

91
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,187
Here's a satisfied customer.

92
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,985
I don't need that, man.

93
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,363
Sit down.

94
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,744
Look, she's
a bum tripper.-

95
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,539
If your head's on straight,
like yours is, it's a groove.

96
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,290
It's dynamite.

97
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,001
It's you.

98
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:33,963
I'm hip.

99
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,893
You're a big help.

100
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,105
Frank, I don't feel so good.

101
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,857
Shit.

102
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,116
Take it.
No.

103
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,077
I said, take it.

104
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,621
Take it.

105
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,425
Now, go home.

106
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,219
Fifteen minutes, you'll be floating.

107
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,806
I just have one more pass to make,

108
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,309
and then I can
get the stuff. Okay?

109
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,439
And stop being such a drag,
for Christ's sakes!

110
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,441
Hey, honey, what are you doing?

111
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,542
Hey, wait a minute. Hey!

112
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,420
Hey! Take it easy.

113
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,338
Let me...

114
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,650
You'll be all right. You'll be...
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

115
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,594
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

116
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:27,803
Easy, easy, easy.

117
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:28,929
Let go.

118
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,264
Easy.

119
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,352
Nobody's going to hurt you.

120
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,770
That's it.
That's it.

121
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,624
Hello, Sergeant O'Connor? Mr. Miller
from the 2nd Avenue bargain store.

122
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,913
Fine, sir.

123
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,958
Well, we have a young girl
here who's flipped out.

124
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,960
Looks like she's OD'd on speed.

125
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,590
Hippie.

126
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,958
You better send an ambulance.

127
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,218
2nd and 7th.

128
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,222
Right.

129
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,683
Boy, you've got a weird
sense of humor, Sergeant.

130
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:18,646
Yes, sir.

131
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,148
Thank you. Goodbye.

132
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,910
She's coming down now
from the amphetamine.

133
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,413
One hundred milligrams of Thorazine
in the butt does wonders.

134
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,342
If you want her effects, you can
pick them up from the property room.

135
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,877
Would you like to see her now?

136
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,545
Yes. Yes, please, very much.

137
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,841
You won't have to stay here.

138
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,511
No, no, darling, you're
going to River Crest.

139
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,348
It's a beautiful place, not like here.
No locked doors.

140
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,476
And Dr. Bergman said you
could be out within a week.

141
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,022
And when you come home, darling,
we'll all go someplace.

142
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,649
Maybe the islands.

143
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,154
Frank would understand.

144
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,199
Now, look, Melissa, honey...

145
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:15,786
When you come out, we'll try again.

146
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,205
You know what I mean, talk it over and...

147
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,500
Maybe we haven't been
as open as we could.

148
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,838
We'll work it out, honey.
It'll be okay.

149
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,511
I don't think this is such a good idea.

150
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
You wanna go back?
I'll do it myself.

151
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,890
No, she'll be furious.

152
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,284
Well, now that she's out
of this environment,

153
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,685
maybe she'll come to her senses.

154
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,145
Good luck.

155
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,901
The smell, Bill, I'm getting
sick to my stomach.

156
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,071
I don't want to go up there. I don't...
I don't want to see it.

157
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,698
Christ! Will you
stop bitching?

158
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,199
This is your own daughter.

159
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,608
Couldn't you just once in your
life do something for her

160
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,888
without looking for some
convenient excuse not to do it?

161
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,040
Why, you bastard!

162
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,709
I'll say this for you, you're
consistent, you don't change.

163
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,879
Go to hell. And you
can do it yourself.

164
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,631
All right, I will.
It's no novelty.

165
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,154
Keep going, and make a right.

166
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,295
Okay.
Who's got 10 bucks?

167
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
No, wait a minute, let's see it first.

168
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,591
Sure.

169
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,137
Is it any good?

170
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,057
Yeah, yeah, it's dynamite. Dynamite.

171
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,434
You sure?

172
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,060
Yeah, yeah, would I kid you?

173
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,149
Look here.

174
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,318
Yeah.

175
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,527
Okay.

176
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,196
Ten bucks.

177
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,450
How long will it last?

178
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,286
As long as you want.
Depends on your head.

179
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,347
If we take it now, will
we be okay on the street?

180
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,040
Sure, sure, anywhere you want.

181
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,876
Have fun.
Yeah, thanks.

182
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,588
Hey, what's your name, man?

183
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,256
The Lone Ranger.

184
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,844
Okay, well, you go first.

185
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,056
No, that's okay, you can go first.

186
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,391
All right, scaredy-cat, here.

187
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,175
Who are you?

188
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,056
Melissa's in the hospital.

189
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,183
I'm picking up her clothes.

190
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,019
You're Daddy.

191
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,729
I should've recognized the nose.

192
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,773
How's she doing?

193
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,317
Why?

194
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,046
You want to bring her some more pills?

195
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,907
Don't sweat the small
stuff, she'll be okay.

196
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,541
And Melissa told us you were handsome.

197
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,793
Rugged, she said.

198
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,503
Strong.

199
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,923
Intense.
With great talent.

200
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:02,966
Yeah?

201
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,719
Yes.

202
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,138
But as far as I can see,
you're a weak little bastard

203
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,223
who couldn't paint
his way out of a toilet.

204
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,019
How's things in the advertising world?

205
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,105
We can't all be geniuses.

206
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,274
How are your toasters doing?

207
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:22,527
You know, Melissa's got a
real hang-up about you.

208
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,780
You done a real groovy job on her.

209
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,370
That's pretty good, from what
Melissa says about her old lady.

210
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,246
I see you still got some balls.

211
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,793
You shut up!

212
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,420
She's got a real thing about you.

213
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,899
When I met her, she was balling her
way up the aisle at the film...

214
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,549
Shut up!

215
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,594
And every now and then, she used
to like to try an old codger.

216
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,721
Shut up, you bastard!

217
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,909
You bastard!
You...

218
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,252
Get up! Get up, you filthy fucker!
Get up!

219
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,007
Get up!

220
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,949
My God.

221
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,703
My God.

222
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,583
Jesus!

223
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,637
The niggers.

224
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,366
The niggers are getting all the money.

225
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,518
Why work? You tell me,
why the fuck work

226
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,812
when you can screw, have
babies, and get paid for it?

227
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,357
Welfare. They got all
that welfare money.

228
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,735
They even get free rubbers.

229
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,946
Think they use them?

230
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,355
Hell, no. The only way they
make money is making babies.

231
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,910
They sell the rubbers

232
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,165
and then they use the money to buy booze.

233
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,756
Nobody has a right to booze
unless he earns the money.

234
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,717
It ought to be a law. You
don't work, you don't drink.

235
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,429
Yeah, the social workers,
the ones in welfare,

236
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,765
how come they're all nigger-lovers?

237
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,642
You ever notice that?

238
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,312
All those social workers
are nigger-lovers.

239
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,800
You find me a social worker who ain't a
nigger-lover and I'll massage your asshole.

240
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:11,983
I ain't queer.

241
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,823
Scotch and water.

242
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,825
Double for 90 cents, you save a dime.

243
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,915
I sweat my balls off 40 hours a
week in front of a fucking furnace,

244
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,835
and they get as much money
as I do, for nothing.

245
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,255
They got them living in
hotels at $50 a day,

246
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,674
$1,000 a month.

247
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,178
Now they want charge accounts.
Charge accounts.

248
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,722
I ain't even been inside Macy's,

249
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,131
and they want charge accounts.

250
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,637
All you gotta do is act black,
and the money rolls in.

251
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,442
Set fire to the cities, burn a few
buildings, you get paid for it.

252
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,112
Throw a few bombs,
you get money and jobs.

253
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,390
If you can't read, you got a
better chance of getting hired.

254
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,035
A lot of good my education did me.

255
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,921
And the kids, the white kids,

256
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,339
they're worse than the niggers.

257
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,747
Money don't mean nothing to them.

258
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,848
Motorcycles, marijuana, $5 records.

259
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,226
The dollar ain't worth shit.

260
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,855
I get a 30-cent-an-hour increase.

261
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,703
My wife bought better
hamburger last year.

262
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,111
I got a kid.

263
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,405
Screw him.
I got another kid.

264
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,575
Couldn't get into a regular college.

265
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,160
You want to know why?

266
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,580
My kid ain't dumb.

267
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,268
Couldn't get into college 'cause
they let the niggers in first.

268
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,253
That's how they're saving the cities.

269
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,923
They keep the smart niggers
busy wrecking the colleges.

270
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,594
Yeah, my kid's grades. Not
like those kids in Chicago.

271
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,388
Chicago!

272
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,917
They got no respect for the
President of the United States.

273
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,685
A few heads get bashed in,

274
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,374
they act like they got it in the ass.

275
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,356
Liberals.

276
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,484
Forty two percent of all
liberals are queer.

277
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:20,945
That's a fact.

278
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,115
The Wallace people took a poll.

279
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,912
And don't tell me about communists.

280
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,998
How can a kid be a communist?
Kids are idealistic.

281
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,627
Yes, PQ3 please.

282
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,754
They used to be idealistic.

283
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,924
Now they're going to those peace marches.

284
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,611
This is William Compton. Could you
tell me how my daughter is, please?

285
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,404
Melissa Compton. They're
so whacked out on drugs,

286
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,239
they gotta have candles to
see where they're going.

287
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,973
Well...

288
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,226
When will he be back?

289
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,228
The white kids.

290
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:54,916
Would you ask him to call me, please?

291
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,231
The rich white kids.

292
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,651
Yes, the number here is 7-2-4...
The worst, hippies.

293
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,320
Sugar tit all the way.

294
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,573
The cars, the best colleges,
vacations, orgies...

295
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:06,991
Yes, William Compton.

296
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,785
Christmas, Easter.

297
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,036
Thank you.

298
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,499
They go to someplace, like a
fancy resort, and have orgies.

299
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,876
Easter orgies.

300
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,040
The day Christ rose, they're
all screwing one another.

301
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,425
And the poor kids and
the middle-class kids,

302
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,803
they're all copying the rich kids.

303
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,681
They're all going the same
goddamn "screw America" way.

304
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,308
Hippies.

305
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,815
Joe. Joe, do me a favor.
Give us all a break.

306
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,693
Can it a while?

307
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,488
Here's a quarter.
Go play the juke box, okay?

308
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,328
Want to do it again?

309
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,899
What's the matter, Joe?
You got all those opinions,

310
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,133
and you can't pick a record?

311
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,343
Look at this shit music.

312
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,138
Those goddamn nigger-loving hippies,

313
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,308
they even fucked up the music.

314
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,756
I'd like to get my hands on
one of those little bastards.

315
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,980
I'd kill them. I'd like
to kill one of them.

316
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,510
They're getting away with murder.

317
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,485
Sex, drugs,

318
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,738
pissing on America, fucking up the music.

319
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,701
I'd like to kill one of them.

320
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:34,746
I would.

321
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:37,866
I'd like to kill one of them.

322
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,503
I just did.

323
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:45,423
Glad to hear it.

324
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:49,761
Hey, you're serious!

325
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:52,764
You're really serious!

326
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,019
For Christ's sake, you...

327
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,396
You had me going for it,
you had me believing you.

328
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,441
Jesus, you're a great kidder, mac.

329
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,613
You had me going for it. I went for it.

330
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,366
You're putting me on. Terrific.
What are you drinking?

331
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,576
Hey, Pete, give this guy a drink.

332
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,205
No kidding, you're all right, mac.

333
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,625
My name is Joe, Joe Curran.

334
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,294
What's yours?

335
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,254
Anyone here called William Compton?

336
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,280
He's all right, you know what I mean?

337
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,096
Anybody who can set me in like that...

338
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,765
Hello?

339
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:36,617
Anybody who can make me laugh...

340
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,142
Yes.

341
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,471
They're all right, you know?

342
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,145
Doctor?

343
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,066
She is?
Good. Good.

344
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,027
Yes, yes.
Tell her.

345
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,463
This world needs a lot of laughs.

346
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:50,863
Thank you.
Goodbye.

347
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,831
You know? You gotta be able
to laugh, to roll with it.

348
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:01,874
You know?

349
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,964
Hey, Compton, I bought you a drink.

350
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:09,966
What is this?

351
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,577
Where have you been?

352
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:23,414
Bill?

353
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,212
What in the world happened?

354
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,377
Where are Melissa's things?

355
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,260
What's wrong?

356
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,846
Look at yourself, darling. What happened?

357
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,690
Honey, you about ready to go to bed?

358
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,217
Yeah, I'm gonna watch
the 11:00 news.

359
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,201
Well, I'm gonna go on now.

360
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,577
Okay.

361
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,999
Okay, come on,
whore. Do it.

362
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:51,043
Come on, come on in there, get
it in there, come on, bitch.

363
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,546
Bastard. Get in there, you bastard.

364
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,554
Hi, honey.

365
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,599
What's for supper?

366
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,018
Guess.

367
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,311
Come on.

368
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,896
No, guess.

369
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,065
For Christ's sake, tell me.

370
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,109
It's on the stove, look.

371
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,070
You got covers on, come on.

372
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,825
We're having mashed potatoes,
the way you like them, lumpy,

373
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,536
and a nice piece of chuck
steak, the way you like it,

374
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,288
with onions and ketchup.

375
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,082
Heinz?

376
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,167
Yes, I'll never do that again,

377
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,002
buy the supermarket kind.

378
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,291
You're right about ketchup.

379
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,130
That's my girl.

380
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,802
And a nice piece of Jane
Parker chocolate fudge cake.

381
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,887
You know, I tell the guys
what a good cook you are.

382
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,854
You know, my sandwiches
are better than theirs.

383
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,019
How was Samantha Cartwright today?

384
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,562
Well, she wasn't on so very much,

385
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,273
but a lot happened to her.

386
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,858
She's in the hospital
having her kidneys removed.

387
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,861
And while she's in the
hospital, her daughter, Kim,

388
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,364
is being seduced by a lawyer,

389
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,867
and her son, Biff, is getting a little
crushed in an elevator accident.

390
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,289
And it looks like her husband, Derek.

391
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,711
Her husband is interested
in her best friend, Phoebe.

392
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,588
While she's having her...

393
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,799
While she's having her kidneys taken out,

394
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,467
you see the knife going in,

395
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,512
Derek gives Phoebe such a look.

396
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,310
That woman, she has such courage.

397
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,525
That's my favorite program,
<i>The Searching Light.</i>

398
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:19,483
How was Mabel Archer?

399
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:22,778
Well, looks like things
are looking up for her.

400
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:25,698
Looks like she's gonna have
a father for her baby.

401
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,092
Yeah, the guy who knocked her
up, he's gonna marry her?

402
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,701
No!

403
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,036
The guy she's in love with?

404
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,080
No. The gentleman she
met at the drugstore.

405
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,209
It looks like something's
happening between them.

406
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:38,836
What happened down the block?

407
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,923
The boys are out.

408
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,612
I see the boys are out.
What happened?

409
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:49,138
Well... Brian has a date with Patty,

410
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,182
the girl who wears the Indian headband?

411
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,910
She wears an Indian headband. Mary
Lou, are you gonna answer me?

412
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,526
Well...

413
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,530
They moved in.

414
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,242
They don't look so bad for colored, Joe.

415
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,537
Joe, what are you gonna do?

416
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,210
Shit, where's Phil?

417
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,423
He's out riding. He picked up
the Harley-Davidson today.

418
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:27,051
He got it? Shit.

419
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,889
I'm going to go downstairs. Call me.

420
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,698
Well, Joe, it's... It's not gonna
be very long. It's just gonna...

They got nice furniture for colored.

427
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,819
They have a real nice Castro
and a fancy bedroom suite.

428
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,241
The kids are cute.

429
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,535
They're clean, too.

Hello, Mr. Compton,
please.

451
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,235
Joe Curran.

452
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:15,946
Yeah, you do that.

453
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,705
Yes?

<i>There's a Mr. Curran
on the line.</i>

455
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,125
Who?

00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,335
<i>Joe Curran.</i>

457
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:34,131
I don't know him.
Tell him I'm busy.

458
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,504
Mr. Compton is
in conference.

459
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:41,639
Look, you just tell him that Joe Curran,

460
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,075
the guy he met in the bar the other
night and bought him a drink...

461
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,419
Tell him I wanna talk to him now.

462
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:47,978
Very well.

463
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:56,779
What?

464
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,627
He says he met you in a bar the
other night and bought you a drink.

465
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,122
Okay, I'll talk to him.

466
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,798
Hello?

467
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,132
Hello, Compton.

468
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:20,177
Listen, I wanna see you.

469
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,347
How did you get my number?

470
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,183
You're the only one in the book.

471
00:45:26,392 --> 00:45:28,018
The maid gave me your office.

472
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:30,729
Look, Compton, we got to get together.

473
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:34,233
Look, you meet me at the
Bowladrome around 6:00.

<i>That's Camwood and Grant

00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:41,615
<i>Okay?</i>

477
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,284
Yes, yes, yes, okay.

478
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:45,953
I'll see you then.

479
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:49,540
Okay.

480
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,821
Compton!
Hey! Over here.

481
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,034
Hey, you look okay, pal.

482
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,663
Hey, everybody, listen.

483
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:32,249
I want you to meet a great guy.

484
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,585
This guy's got real balls,
not no bowling balls.

485
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:41,383
This is Jack, Sam, Michael, he don't
like to be called Mike, and Art.

486
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,803
Hey, you like to bowl a frame?

487
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:47,014
Come on. Come on.

488
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,683
I bet you ain't had much
exercise for a couple of days?

489
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,226
Here we go.

490
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,555
Hey, you creeps, this guy's
gonna bowl a frame for me.

491
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,064
Come on, come on, show these bums.

492
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,275
My shoes, street shoes.

493
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:00,819
Fuck the shoes.
Come on.

494
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:02,905
Hey, Joe...

495
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,990
Maybe your buddy ought to stick to golf.

496
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,116
Golf?

497
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,454
Screw it, forget it.

498
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,793
This game's for morons, anyway.

499
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:19,254
Come on, you guys
got chalk in your brains.

500
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:21,423
Hey, Jack, finish the
string for me, will you?

501
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:22,792
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

502
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,981
Couple of beers, please, Sylvia.

503
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,406
Catch you later.

504
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,460
You know when it hit me?

505
00:47:58,669 --> 00:47:59,878
When I saw the paper.

506
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,506
The TV started me thinking.

507
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,177
The paper, I knew.

508
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,890
Couldn't get over it.
I couldn't get over it.

509
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,561
Why?

510
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,272
Why did you call me?

511
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,608
I wanted to meet you.

512
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,239
Hey, I know what you've been thinking.

513
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:33,708
You been thinking I was going to put
the old squeeze on you, didn't you?

514
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:38,187
That's what you been thinking, right?

515
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,752
Yes.

516
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:44,339
Well, the...

517
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:49,177
The thought had occurred to me.

518
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,598
Yeah, well...

519
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,269
I could blackmail you.

520
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:02,316
Hey! Hey, don't
worry about it.

521
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:05,777
I just wanted to shake your hand.

522
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,821
I mean, look.

523
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,241
There I am, sitting in a bar.

524
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,453
You know, drunk, and shooting off.

525
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,039
Just words.

526
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:19,333
You know, and you come in.

527
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:22,628
And you did it!
You did it.

528
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:26,715
I just talk about it, but you did it!

529
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:31,470
I mean... Look.

530
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:36,058
When I get drunk, you know,
I let off a lot of steam.

531
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,479
Drink up.

532
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,731
I know a better place.

533
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:50,781
Thank you.

534
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,040
Listen, nobody's gonna blame you.

535
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,878
A guy like that, your daughter.

536
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:08,256
Look, to plenty of people,
people with kids,

537
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:09,785
I'm telling you, you'd be a hero.

538
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:13,887
The guy was selling dope, right?

539
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:17,182
So now he can't make dope fiends
out of anybody anymore, can he?

540
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,018
Yeah, that's right.

541
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:23,021
God knows how many kids he hooked.

542
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,276
Maybe...

543
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,365
Maybe that's why I get this...

544
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,121
I had it a couple
of times lately. A...

545
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,915
A feeling of...

546
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,043
Pleasure?

547
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,506
Satisfaction.

548
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,591
Yeah, yeah, like in the war.

549
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,640
You remember how you felt
in the war sometimes,

550
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:55,762
after you killed a few of 'em?

551
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,889
You feel bad and you feel
good at the same time?

552
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,643
Yes, well, something like that.

553
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,062
But not exactly.

554
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:12,946
You make a lot of money.

555
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,239
How much?

556
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:17,174
What do you... What do you make an hour?

557
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,883
Well, they... They pay
us by the year, Joe.

558
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,169
I get...
I get four an hour,

559
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:30,017
plus some that I don't count because,
you know, the union keeps it.

560
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,841
That's 160 a week.

561
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,343
That ain't so bad.
It's not so bad.

562
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:37,095
I mean, shit, you can't live on it.

563
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,892
What do you make?

564
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,313
Sixty thousand.

565
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,524
Sixty thousand dollars a year!

566
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:53,278
You gotta be kidding.

567
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,784
Only movie stars make that kind of money.

568
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:01,912
The fucking president of my union
pays himself that kind of money.

569
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,375
Sixty thousand a year.

570
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,010
You gotta kiss a lot of ass, I bet.

571
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:20,180
Well, after a while,
you don't notice it anymore.

572
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,517
You think I don't have to kiss ass?

573
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,143
Four dollars an hour?

574
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:29,147
The foreman, the shop steward,

575
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:31,836
the guy on the night shift so he
don't leave my furnace a mess.

576
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:36,196
Bet you got a pile saved up.

577
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:40,992
No, not really a pile, Joe, only about...

578
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:46,039
Eighteen thousand.

579
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:49,292
Eighteen thousand, the
kind of money you make?

580
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:53,171
Hey, I got 10,000.
My wife don't know it.

581
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,215
Yeah, and two lots in Florida.

582
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,059
Hey.

583
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,188
Hey, look at that.

584
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:14,568
Look at that.
Nice?

585
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:18,780
I like to look at 'em once in a while.

586
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:20,589
You like to look at 'em once in a while?

587
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,411
Yes, I like to look at
it once in a while.

588
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:27,873
A little on the side once in a while?

589
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,253
Once in a while.

590
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,861
It helps, you know, so you don't
resent the old lady so much.

591
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,049
Right?

592
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,432
You know, guys like us,

593
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:49,519
we don't often get a chance
to talk to each other.

594
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:52,643
Find it hard talking to me?

595
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:54,399
No.

596
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,318
Yes, you do.

597
00:53:58,195 --> 00:54:00,155
I'm just a working stiff,
and you're way up there.

598
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:02,282
Educated.

599
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,576
Well, look.

600
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,831
Just talk to me the way you would,

601
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,084
somebody at the office,
a friend, like that.

602
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,255
Joe,

603
00:54:17,464 --> 00:54:19,664
would you like to see where
my kind of animal hangs out?

604
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:22,385
Sure.

605
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,234
Good. Then let's get
the hell out of here.

606
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,837
They look like a bunch of fags.

607
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,465
Not really fags,
but close, getting there.

608
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:01,883
What would you like, sir?

609
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:03,452
Johnnie Walker on the rocks and...

610
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:04,636
The same.

611
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:10,100
Yeah, but they're smart. They're smart.
They gotta be smart, right?

612
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,980
Joe, you wanna see how smart
they really are? Watch.

613
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:16,940
Bill, Bill, baby, how are you?

614
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:19,526
Gil! It's good
to see you.

615
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,236
Gil, I'd like you to meet Joe Curran.

616
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,654
This is, Gil Richards, Joe.

617
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:23,655
Happy to meet you.

618
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,240
Same here.

619
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,284
By the way, Gil, Joe here is...

620
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:30,541
Shall I tell him, Joe?

621
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:32,497
Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:34,916
Well, it...

623
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,960
It hasn't been officially announced yet,

624
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,754
but, Joe here is moving
over to your shop.

625
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:41,172
Yeah?

626
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:42,132
What...

627
00:55:42,674 --> 00:55:44,050
What spot?

628
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:45,260
Guess.

629
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,596
Hell, I don't know.
Which...

630
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:51,266
Come on, Gil.

631
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,834
What have they been looking for
over there for three months?

632
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:55,937
Exec VP?

633
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:58,565
That's it.

634
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:05,780
Yeah, I know he looks a little rough,
but that's just part of his act.

635
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:08,616
He'll, be looking things over
pretty closely over there.

636
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:11,619
Getting rid of a lot of dead wood.

637
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:13,264
You'll be shaking things up
over there, won't you, Joe?

638
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,568
Yeah, I'll be shaking things up.

639
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:17,542
That place is gonna shake like
a hurricane and a tree hit it.

640
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:20,462
Well, when you come in,
drop by my office.

641
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,425
Nah, why don't you drop by my office?

642
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,638
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Well, I'll see you.

643
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,288
Joe, look, no hands.

644
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:57,290
Doctor's orders.

645
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:00,752
Can't lift anything
heavier than 10 pounds.

646
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:04,672
Hey, they got ice down there.

647
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:05,632
Yes.

648
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:09,177
Hey, I never pissed on ice before.

649
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:10,428
Well, don't catch cold.

650
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:11,679
I'll try not to.

651
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,057
Feels good!

652
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,356
This is one of nature's
simple enjoyments.

653
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:22,399
God.

654
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,361
I needed that, you know?

655
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:39,374
After you, my...
My dear Alphonse.

656
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:40,583
All right.

657
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,737
Now, you see those buildings, Joe?

658
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,171
Yeah.

659
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,800
Those beautiful monuments.

660
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,719
Concrete, glass.

661
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,348
I work in one of them.

662
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,430
And do you know what they
do in those buildings, Joe?

663
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,522
They move paper.

664
00:58:04,232 --> 00:58:07,193
That's right. They pick
it up in one place,

665
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:11,448
and they move it to another place.

666
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,368
They pass it all around their offices.

667
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:21,875
And the more paper you move,

668
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,461
the more important you are,
the more they pay you.

669
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,925
And if you want to really
show how important you are,

670
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:33,636
what you can get away with,

671
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:36,264
you make little paper airplanes,

672
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:42,061
and you sail them right
up somebody else's ass.

673
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:46,733
Do you ever get the feeling that

674
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:49,861
everything you do,

675
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,988
your whole life,

676
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:55,074
just one big crock of shit?

677
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,871
Yeah.

678
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:09,005
Hey, I got a great idea.

679
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,549
Wanna go hunting?

680
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,009
Hunting?
Yeah.

681
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:15,512
I haven't gone hunting in years.

682
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,722
Hey, I got a great place, you know. Yeah?

683
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:21,226
You should've seen the buck
I got last year, big one.

684
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:23,114
Hey, you know what else
you gotta do? What?

685
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,549
You gotta come out to the house,

686
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:26,147
you gotta meet the little woman.

687
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:27,750
You gotta have a little dinner with us,

688
00:59:27,774 --> 00:59:29,126
see how the other half lives, okay?

689
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,485
Okay, Joe.

690
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,028
Okay, Compton?
It's a deal.

691
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:34,364
Take care, Compton, and...

692
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,534
Just remember, you don't have
anything to worry about, okay?

693
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:43,228
<i>Now you won't believe this, darling,</i>

694
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:47,293
<i>but I have just been
with a guy who knows.</i>

695
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:48,419
<i>What?</i>

696
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:53,758
<i>It's all right.
He likes me.</i>

697
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:56,219
Rest up. The doctor said
only a few more days.

698
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,804
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

699
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:58,930
Okay.

700
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,976
Goodbye, darling.

701
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,185
Bye, Mother.

702
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,231
Say goodbye to Daddy for me.

703
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:27,959
Excuse me.

704
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,335
Yes, surely.

705
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,315
Hi.

706
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,650
Phyllis! Well,
how'd you ever find me?

707
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:54,819
Spies.

708
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:56,404
Hey, you don't look so bad.

709
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:57,989
Well, I could look a lot worse.

710
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,741
My mother was just here.

711
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,826
She's been here every day, twice a day.

712
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:03,745
Twice a day?

713
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,121
Well, she can't be that bad.

714
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,914
You ought to meet my mother.

715
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:07,963
Well, so how's Frank?

716
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,256
Stop it, for Christ's sake! You'd
think the Pope was coming!

717
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:17,759
Joe, what am I gonna talk to her about?
For God's sake!

718
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,136
You never had any trouble
talking with the girls.

719
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:21,625
Shutting you up was the problem.

720
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:24,766
Joe, I didn't dust.

721
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:28,394
Look, look, look, you buy
curtains, she buys curtains.

722
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:31,147
I give you a few bucks
in Gimbels, you go crazy,

723
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:33,483
you give her a few bucks
in Gimbels, she goes crazy.

724
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,068
She doesn't shop at Gimbels, Joe.

725
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,111
Okay, she goes to Macy's.

726
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,533
Women got a lot to talk
about, they think.

727
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:46,287
Relax.

728
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,095
It won't be any worse than the
time your rich aunt came over.

729
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,138
The one who didn't leave us any money.

730
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,349
- Hi.
- Joe.

731
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,643
Hi, come in. Mary Lou's
been dying to meet you.

732
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,021
Mary Lou, this is Bill Compton.

733
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,314
It's a pleasure.

734
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:15,108
Hello.

735
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:17,193
My wife, Joan.
How do you do?

736
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:18,486
Hello.
Nice knowing you.

737
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:21,322
Here, let me take your coats.

738
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,157
Take their coats, honey.

739
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,618
Let me help.
Sure.

740
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:27,870
My best friend in high
school was named Mary Lou.

741
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,164
I loved her name. I
always wished I had it.

742
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:31,791
I hated mine.

743
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,085
Well, you've got a nice name, Joan.

744
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,003
Thank you.

745
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:37,922
Well, I'll just be a minute.

746
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,926
Well, I can see we're gonna
get along real good.

747
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:44,053
What'll you have, a Bud or a 7 and 7?

748
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:45,888
Bud or 7 and 7?

749
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,849
We got ginger ale, too.

750
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:50,643
Yes, how will you have your
Seagram's Seven Crown, dear?

751
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:52,145
Ginger ale or 7UP?

752
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,188
Ginger ale's fine, thank you.

753
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:55,565
Ginger ale, beautiful.

754
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:56,774
And for the gentleman?

755
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:58,067
Bud.

756
01:02:58,276 --> 01:02:59,360
Bud, the king of beers.

757
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:11,247
Where's the ginger ale?

758
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:12,665
Under the sink.

759
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:14,268
I thought you keep it on the shelf.

760
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:16,377
Well, I do keep it on the
shelf, but I just...

761
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:18,963
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

762
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,257
No, no, Joe. Your
instructions were perfect.

763
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:22,508
Terrific.

764
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,137
Joe?
Yeah.

765
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,847
Pretty nice place you got here.

766
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,348
Yeah, it's not much.

767
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:37,106
You never told me you had a girlfriend
named Mary Lou in high school.

768
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:38,399
I made it up.

769
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:42,445
God.

770
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,615
You can be charming when you wanna be.

771
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,375
I hope you don't mind the can.

772
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,544
No. it helps
to keep them fresh.

773
01:03:58,753 --> 01:03:59,921
Nice nuts.

774
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:03,007
No thanks.

775
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:05,218
I mustn't spoil my appetite.

776
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:07,470
Do you mind if I shut the window?

777
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,138
No, go right ahead.

778
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:12,934
I love your curtains.

779
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:14,685
Thank you.

780
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,979
See, what'd I tell you?

781
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,238
They was... They were 49 cents a yard,

782
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:26,614
reduced from 79.

783
01:04:26,823 --> 01:04:28,366
I made 'em myself.

784
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,451
And the saleslady told me that

785
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,245
Debbie Reynolds had been in,

786
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:33,680
and she bought the
same kind of material...

787
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,039
That's enough.

788
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,211
Well, the...

789
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,299
She was wondering what you
was gonna talk about.

790
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:44,173
I told her you was both women.

791
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:46,384
That's right.
We're all alike.

792
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:49,095
What'd you mean by that?

793
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,391
That's the restaurant.

794
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,599
We're gonna have something
real special for dinner.

795
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:57,478
Chinese.

796
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:59,689
Lou Wong's is the best Chinese...

797
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:03,234
The best Chinese restaurant in Astoria.

798
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:05,820
I hope you like Chinese food.

799
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,154
I love it.

800
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:08,656
Yes, yes.
Love it.

801
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:54,035
Joe, give me the box.

802
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:56,483
They look better when they're
all lined up here together.

803
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:10,843
The boys just hate Chinese
food, that's why they're out.

804
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:12,678
Hell, that's not why they're not home.

805
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:13,804
They're never home,

806
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:15,640
not even the good one.

807
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,564
Joe's real funny about the boys.

808
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:25,858
He likes 'em right here when he comes in.

809
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:30,529
What he'd like is to
have 'em all lined up,

810
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:32,633
military fashion, in the
doorway when he comes home,

811
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:34,241
saying, "Hi, Pop."

812
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:37,370
Yeah.

813
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,544
I was really sorry to
hear about your daughter.

814
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:46,963
Is she okay?

815
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,339
She's fine, thank you.

816
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,761
Kids.

817
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:03,938
Everything today is kids.

818
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:11,362
They make you feel so
old-fashioned, you know?

819
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,198
We made... We made our parents
feel old-fashioned, but...

820
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,013
We didn't make 'em feel old-fashioned

821
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,869
like the kids make us feel old-fashioned.

822
01:07:26,002 --> 01:07:28,421
Everything today is kids.

823
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,256
They are taking over the culture.

824
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:32,341
The what?

825
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,678
The culture. The movies,
books, clothes, music.

826
01:07:36,846 --> 01:07:39,181
Yeah, yeah.

827
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:43,102
They're all screwed up, so they got
control of the culture, right?

828
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,938
They're all screwed up, so
they're screwing up the culture.

829
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:47,916
Yeah, it ain't what the kids
say, that we screwed them up.

830
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,060
It's the other way around,
with all that culture crap.

831
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,656
It's the kids who are screwing us up.

832
01:07:55,865 --> 01:07:57,867
Am I right?
Yes, of course.

833
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,076
Fucking A.

834
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:08,184
You mean, she knows you killed a junkie?

835
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,420
Yes, she knows.

836
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:11,828
What'd you do, go and tell her?

837
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:13,632
No.

838
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,301
She figured it out, just as you did.

839
01:08:16,886 --> 01:08:18,971
Christ. Here, here.

840
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,407
Hey, no, no.
What are you doing?

841
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:21,766
Don't worry, don't worry, relax.

842
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:28,481
Hey, Joan, I got something
I wanna show you.

843
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,983
Joe, she don't wanna see your guns.

844
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:33,194
Sure she does, it'll just take a minute.

845
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:36,210
What the hell did you go and do that for?

846
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,615
Don't worry, you'll see.

847
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,662
Look, it's not the gun.

848
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,682
I just wanted... Wanted to
get you away from Mary Lou.

849
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:47,166
See, look, look.

850
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,376
I want to tell you not
to worry about a thing,

851
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:50,771
see, 'cause nothing's
gonna happen to you.

852
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:52,004
Nothing.

853
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:54,090
Your husband's a great guy,

854
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,133
and nothing's gonna happen to him.

855
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:57,662
See, now, the police in this town

856
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,304
ain't gonna bust their ass
over one junkie murder.

857
01:09:00,513 --> 01:09:02,139
See, a guy who kills one junkie

858
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:03,388
might kill another junkie.

859
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,562
So why bust him? He's doing such
good work for the cops, see?

860
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,690
That make you feel better?

861
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:14,485
Yes, thank you.

862
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:17,863
Okay, now I want you to go
upstairs, and I want you to relax,

863
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:20,491
and I want you to enjoy
yourself with Mary Lou, okay?

864
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,286
I got here what you might call

865
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:26,205
a well-balanced gun collection, see?

866
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,082
I wrote a letter to an ammo magazine

867
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,084
and they wrote back, saying,

868
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,419
"You got a well-balanced
collection." See?

869
01:09:32,628 --> 01:09:34,505
Now, this I got off a Jap,

870
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,215
a dead Jap on Okinawa.

871
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:39,836
Then I got...
Here, hold this.

872
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,931
Here is my old M1.

873
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,260
Now, there's a lot of stories
behind that, believe me.

874
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,977
Right on the park?

875
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:51,939
Yes, it is lovely.
We have a beautiful view.

876
01:09:52,148 --> 01:09:55,860
I never been in an apartment
like that before, never.

877
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,379
I always wondered what it'd be like,

878
01:09:57,403 --> 01:09:59,113
what it'd look like on the inside.

879
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,240
I always wanted to see.

880
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,576
We'll have you and Joe up one day.
You will?

881
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:05,244
Yes, of course.

882
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:08,038
That'd be nice.
What about next week?

883
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,332
Tuesday, Saturday...

884
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,626
Saturday'd be good for us.

885
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:15,045
I got a lot of other
stuff over here, too.

886
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,215
Got some handguns, some shotguns.

887
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,193
I got a couple of trophies
there for marksmanship.

888
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,302
I'm a real good shot.

889
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,721
But this...

890
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:27,183
This is my beauty.

891
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,685
It's a submachine gun.

892
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:32,014
You're not supposed to have
'em, but I got one anyway.

893
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:35,024
You can do a lot of damage with this.

894
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:36,552
It's got a lot of stopping power.

895
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:43,032
Thanks for
letting me in, Mr. Hancock.

896
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:52,726
Before we were finished,
we practically worked out

897
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,168
a full year's social calendar.

898
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:57,296
I think we have a free weekend

899
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:58,881
sometime in April or May.

900
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,968
Are you ready to put him
up for the Athletic Club?

901
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:04,428
Well...

902
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,348
I wouldn't mind letting him sit in

903
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:10,643
on one of our creative sessions.

904
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,251
And let him tell everybody what
a bunch of windbags they are.

905
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:16,774
He wouldn't put it quite like that.

906
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,153
Hell, you know, after years
of nothing but ad types,

907
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:25,950
Mary Lou, Joe, they're
a refreshing change.

908
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:28,452
Refreshing?

909
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:30,621
Well...

910
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,581
Different?

911
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:35,125
That's for sure.

912
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:50,933
Lord, I've been in grisly
situations before, but this...

913
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:55,980
Sitting in that room,
him knowing about Frank,

914
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,525
and you and me knowing about Frank,

915
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,821
and big-eyed Mary Lou yammering away.

916
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,494
Does he know all the
gory details, darling?

917
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:12,037
No.

918
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:19,461
When I think...

919
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,130
I just get the shudders.

920
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:38,147
When you think that man holds
our lives in his hand,

921
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,317
it's like sitting on a powder keg.

922
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:43,245
A couple of times tonight,
I said something,

923
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,030
and he was just about to explode.

924
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:48,907
If he gets mad at you, darling,

925
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:50,876
do you know he can go
straight to the police?

926
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:53,871
No, no, you see...

927
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,167
The crazy thing about Joe is that

928
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:01,879
it's as if he shared in it.

929
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,757
As if he killed that boy, too.

930
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:09,219
You have to keep on the good side of him.

931
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,557
Isn't that what we were
really doing there tonight?

932
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,393
Well, there's

933
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,438
something else about Joe.

934
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:22,900
Sometimes, with him,

935
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,445
I almost feel as if

936
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:30,032
what I did was a humanitarian act.

937
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:35,746
I saved the world from
another lousy junkie.

938
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:45,422
Funny, isn't it?

939
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:46,924
What?

940
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:51,720
How you can learn to live with anything.

941
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:54,431
Even murder.

942
01:13:57,393 --> 01:13:58,894
I'll drink to that.

943
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,820
Melissa.

944
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,281
How did you get out of the hospital?

945
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:15,411
Why didn't you tell me about Frank?

946
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:18,372
Why didn't you tell me Frank was dead?

947
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,460
Because we didn't want to upset you.

948
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:25,069
Not while you were in the hospital.

949
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:27,923
Is that the reason?

950
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,510
Certainly, you were

951
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:32,998
just coming down from the drugs.

952
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:36,765
Or was the subject too painful?

953
01:14:40,269 --> 01:14:41,520
I heard you, Daddy.

954
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:44,857
You killed Frank.

955
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:48,610
And I loved him.

956
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:52,114
I loved him.

957
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,824
Melissa!

958
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,112
You stay here.
I'll get her.

959
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:00,330
Melissa!

960
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:06,545
I wanted to tell you.

961
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:09,882
I wanted to tell you how it happened.

962
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,009
It doesn't matter. It
happened, that's all.

963
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:23,896
You might understand.

964
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:24,980
No!

965
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,653
Melissa.
Leave me alone!

966
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:40,078
You've got to listen to me.

967
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,788
Are you gonna kill me, too?

968
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:53,842
"There is some consternation
in these quarters"

969
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:56,470
"about the allocation
of spots to stations."

970
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:02,142
"I'd like you to reexamine them from
the point of view of demographics"

971
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,394
"and market proceedings."

972
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,771
Paragraph.

973
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:11,151
"I know this puts you under pressure,
but we'd like it within a week."

974
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,948
"I'll commiserate with you
over drinks." Signature.

975
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:22,371
And, Janine,

976
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,374
I know my behavior has been a
little erratic the last few days.

977
01:16:27,084 --> 01:16:29,086
Well, it's,

978
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,505
likely to continue so
for a little while longer.

979
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:33,882
You know, running in
and out of the office.

980
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:36,134
So, just keep covering for me, will you?

981
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:38,053
I always do.

982
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:41,807
Thank you.

983
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:45,394
- Yes.
<i>- Mr. Curran for you.</i>

984
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:46,728
Put him on.

985
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:48,730
<i>Hiya, Compton.</i>

986
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,399
Joe, hold it a minute, will you?

987
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:53,402
That'll be all,
Janine. Thank you.

988
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,035
Joe, I've been meaning to call you.

989
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:05,038
About tomorrow night, it's...

990
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,167
Well, it...

991
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:11,536
It looks as if we're just not
gonna be able to make it.

992
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:12,963
Yeah?

993
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,571
<i>Melissa ran away from the hospital.</i>

994
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:18,427
She found out what happened.

995
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:21,638
<i>Found out?
How could she find out?</i>

996
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:23,247
Well, I'll tell you when I see you.

997
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:27,245
<i>I've been down in the Village
every night trying to find her.</i>

998
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,189
Look, I'll go with you.

999
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:31,148
I'm falling off my feet.

1000
01:17:31,315 --> 01:17:33,275
I was thinking about getting
to bed early tonight.

1001
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,029
No, no, no. You can't stop looking.
You gotta keep looking.

1002
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,799
<i>Compton, it'll be easier for you if
you got company. I'll go with you.</i>

1003
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,951
Okay, I'll meet you down in
the Village around 8:00.

1004
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,038
There's a parking lot at
Bowery and East 5th Street.

1005
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:48,999
Okay. Okay,
I'll see you.

1006
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:50,167
<i>Bye, Joe.</i>

1007
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,562
This could be a long night.

1008
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,171
That's all right, that's all right.

1009
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:14,394
I been wanting to see these
animals, where they live.

1010
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:16,735
Okay.
Let's go.

1011
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,945
It's colder than a witch's tit out.

1012
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,870
Say, mister, you got any spare change?

1013
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:29,081
No, but I know where there's a spare job.

1014
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,291
Dumb honky.

1015
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,711
Hey, I like that. That guy,
he never got that before.

1016
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,130
Used to be, you had to
be 40 or 50 years old

1017
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:39,099
before you could become
a bum on the streets.

1018
01:18:42,511 --> 01:18:44,054
Look at that shit.

1019
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:47,808
Cowboys and Indians.

1020
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:52,020
Well, they grew up on television.

1021
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:56,066
Hopalong Cassidy at the age of three.

1022
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:59,569
Hopalong Cassidy.
Real revolutionaries.

1023
01:19:05,117 --> 01:19:06,034
Let's go in here.

1024
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:08,120
The Caldron?

1025
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,415
Yeah, she used to mention this place.
Maybe she'll come in.

1026
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,125
How's that for a half-assed idea?

1027
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,127
All I know is, I need a drink.

1028
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:23,385
There's some room in the back,

1029
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,033
but you have to take your shoes off.

1030
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:41,486
Take off your shoes?
What is that bullshit?

1031
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,989
Well, when in Rome...

1032
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,657
What? What do
you mean?

1033
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,409
You do as the Romans do.

1034
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:49,286
Yeah.

1035
01:19:58,462 --> 01:19:59,671
Hey, look at these creeps.

1036
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:09,806
He looks like a truck driver.

1037
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,640
What's that word they got?

1038
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:14,269
"Grooving"? "Groovy"?

1039
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,190
If they're not screwing,
they're grooving.

1040
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,986
Screwing and grooving.

1041
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:24,196
Good evening, gentlemen.

1042
01:20:24,404 --> 01:20:25,364
Would you like to order?

1043
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,740
You got Imperial?

1044
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,658
Sorry, we don't serve alcohol here.

1045
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:31,119
You don't serve alcohol here?

1046
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:33,246
Well, what do you serve?

1047
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:35,957
We serve shrimp tempura,
kakiage, miso soup.

1048
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,459
That's Jap food.

1049
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,753
Not really.
It's macrobiotic.

1050
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,506
It's food in accordance with
the order of the universe.

1051
01:20:57,938 --> 01:21:00,440
Looks a little bit like Susie.

1052
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:02,526
No, her eyes are different.

1053
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,528
She doesn't look a thing like Susie.

1054
01:21:06,071 --> 01:21:08,657
At least they still got booze.
Come on, kids.

1055
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:12,661
Melissa Compton, she's about
5'8", about 20 years old,

1056
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:13,703
auburn hair.

1057
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,706
Melissa Compton.

1058
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,083
No, mister.

1059
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,793
Hey, why don't you get a haircut?

1060
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:20,836
Joe...

1061
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:23,755
Joe, take it easy.

1062
01:21:29,261 --> 01:21:31,555
No, can't say that I see this one.

1063
01:21:31,763 --> 01:21:34,516
Why don't you put it up on bulletin
board behind you with note?

1064
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:36,893
Here is paper.
You have pencil?

1065
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:38,186
Yes, thank you.

1066
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:39,563
Maybe she come in and see.

1067
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,524
Yes, maybe she will.

1068
01:21:55,996 --> 01:21:58,683
You know that stuff they got at Niagara
Falls, the Empire State Building?

1069
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:01,293
Pennants, pens, gimmicks?

1070
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,421
I tell Mary Lou not to buy that stuff.
It's junk.

1071
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:05,380
She buys it anyway.

1072
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:07,007
This stuff, what's the difference?

1073
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:08,466
Junk is junk, right?

1074
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,223
All I know is these fucking kids

1075
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:16,975
are getting more than we ever did.

1076
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,533
Look at that. The President
of the United States.

1077
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:35,094
If you can't buy a used car from him,

1078
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:36,786
who can you buy a used car from?

1079
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:47,339
Hey, guys, I'm gonna split.
See you up there later?

1080
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:48,816
Yeah, sure, we'll see you there.

1081
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,050
Great, peace.

1082
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,654
Well, let's get something
to eat, for Christ's sake.

1083
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:55,513
At least it's warm here.

1084
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:16,910
It's pretty hopeless, isn't it?

1085
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,328
What?

1086
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:19,663
I said, it's hopeless.

1087
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:21,873
Yeah.

1088
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,625
Yeah, you gotta hang in
there, you know what I mean?

1089
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:28,797
You can't give up.

1090
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:41,726
Hey, the truck driver digs you.

1091
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:44,354
Obviously, he's got good taste.

1092
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:55,073
Hey, you wanna turn a trick?

1093
01:23:56,366 --> 01:23:58,201
That's lovely.
A hippie pimp?

1094
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:00,954
I'm gonna put those guys on.

1095
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,127
Hi.

1096
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:09,587
You guys looking for some, grass, maybe?

1097
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:14,426
I got all I need, sonny.

1098
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:24,102
You kidding?
You really have some?

1099
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:29,441
From the junkie. Still have
it in the trunk of my car.

1100
01:24:32,736 --> 01:24:34,571
You know what that guy said?

1101
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:36,948
I said, "You guys looking
for some grass?"

1102
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:38,877
You yo-yo, they could
be narcs or something.

1103
01:24:39,868 --> 01:24:41,327
Nah, they ain't narcs.

1104
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:45,206
I know narcs.
Narcs have long hair.

1105
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,532
I thought we could lay some
oregano on them or something.

1106
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,921
They wouldn't know the difference.

1107
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:56,259
So the old guy says, "I've
got all I need, sonny."

1108
01:24:57,969 --> 01:24:59,596
Suppose he's serious?

1109
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,765
Guys like that?

1110
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:04,642
They wouldn't have grass.
Nobody's got grass.

1111
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:06,311
Sure.

1112
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:13,985
Hey, man, you putting me on?
You really got some grass?

1113
01:25:14,194 --> 01:25:15,945
Yeah, that's what I said.

1114
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:20,366
Well, we're having a little party.

1115
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:23,369
We could all smoke some, at
one of the chicks' pads.

1116
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:26,498
No, thanks.

1117
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:29,501
It'd be pretty groovy,
if you know what I mean.

1118
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,252
I know what you mean.

1119
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,384
Hey, that's not such a bad idea.

1120
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:40,095
What?

1121
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,222
Well, we're not getting
no place this way.

1122
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,557
This way, we get to know the kids.

1123
01:25:44,766 --> 01:25:46,535
You know, we get friendly,
we infiltrate them.

1124
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:48,520
You know what I mean?

1125
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:50,968
Then maybe they'll tell us
something about your daughter.

1126
01:25:51,815 --> 01:25:53,566
Just see.

1127
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:55,135
You don't have to smoke the stuff.

1128
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,532
Well, maybe you're right.

1129
01:26:02,951 --> 01:26:04,244
What have I got to lose?

1130
01:26:04,452 --> 01:26:05,495
What?

1131
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,581
What have I got to lose?

1132
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:10,667
Well, then, let's go to the party.

1133
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:24,264
Far fucking out! The grass
famine is finally over!

1134
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:27,225
Hang on, you haven't seen anything.
This is fantastic.

1135
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,686
You got that record on
pretty fucking loud.

1136
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:31,247
I'm sorry, do you want
me to turn it down?

1137
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,272
Yeah.

1138
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,398
All right.

1139
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,502
You know I read in <i>Mechanix Illustrated</i>

1140
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:38,486
that sound can hurt your ears.

1141
01:26:38,695 --> 01:26:39,935
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna do that.

1142
01:26:42,157 --> 01:26:45,702
Acid, grass, look at this chunk of hash.

1143
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:49,330
Coke, speed, psilocybin. Shit.

1144
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:53,001
Am I gonna trip!

1145
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:54,502
You're in the business?

1146
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:55,795
No, no.

1147
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,381
His mother is a junkie.

1148
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:01,926
Solid.

1149
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:05,388
Mary Lou ought to see this place.

1150
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:07,223
She'd get some great decorating ideas.

1151
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:16,065
Far out.

1152
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:21,654
See if you can't
fit it into all your openings.

1153
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:25,033
Your mouth, your nose,
your eyes, your ears...

1154
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,970
It's the greatest fucking drug in the
whole world. You can fuck for hours.

1155
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:29,579
Yeah. Definitely.

1156
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,459
It's like a dream, you know?

1157
01:27:36,753 --> 01:27:38,796
It's like a... It's like
a drug-head's dream.

1158
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:45,220
Come on, dance.

1159
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:46,679
I can't.

1160
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:48,240
Yes, you can, you just do anything,

1161
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:50,016
anything at all.
Come on.

1162
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:55,688
Think of this part as the
center of your body.

1163
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:58,733
And just move it from the hips out.

1164
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:01,069
You mean, that's where I
feel the music, down there?

1165
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:04,906
Right, that's it, you're getting it.
From the balls out.

1166
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:07,867
From the balls out, right?
Groovy, that's where it's at.

1167
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,334
Here.

1168
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,419
No, no.
No, thanks.

1169
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:21,005
What's the matter? It won't kill you.
Chicken?

1170
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,012
What you do is suck in deep,

1171
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:31,808
and then hold it until it hurts.

1172
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:34,936
You don't need to tell me. I
seen it on TV all the time.

1173
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:44,946
I better sit down here, you know,

1174
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:46,799
in case I get drunk or it
hits me all of a sudden.

1175
01:28:46,823 --> 01:28:47,824
Yeah, right.

1176
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,659
I gotta sit down.

1177
01:28:56,624 --> 01:28:58,960
Man, it's no good, it's panda piss.

1178
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,962
Come on. Get with
the Pepsi Generation.

1179
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:05,591
You're kidding.

1180
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,718
No. Chicken?

1181
01:29:09,304 --> 01:29:10,430
What do you mean, chicken?

1182
01:29:10,638 --> 01:29:12,056
Chickie, chickie.

1183
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,599
Get...

1184
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,936
You think I'm chicken?

1185
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,189
All right.

1186
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:24,444
You think I'm chicken?

1187
01:29:24,652 --> 01:29:27,030
You think I don't know how?

1188
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:28,823
You watch this.

1189
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:51,137
You think I'm chicken?

1190
01:29:51,346 --> 01:29:52,180
Yeah. Yeah.

1191
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:55,099
All right, my friend.

1192
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:11,366
I don't feel any different.

1193
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:21,501
Free yourself.

1194
01:30:22,335 --> 01:30:23,169
Free yourself.

1195
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:35,848
I lived all my life, I ain't
never been to an orgy.

1196
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:38,601
This is an orgy, isn't it?

1197
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:44,065
Yes, it seems to fit the definition.

1198
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:45,733
Fucking A.

1199
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:00,081
They're touching.

1200
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,626
The new sex.

1201
01:31:05,253 --> 01:31:06,963
Like eating.

1202
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,256
Screwing like that,

1203
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:11,134
you can't be very important.

1204
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:16,347
Well, what you lose in importance,

1205
01:31:16,556 --> 01:31:18,474
you make up in frequency.

1206
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:26,941
How do they fall in love?

1207
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:32,822
It was better for you than for me.

1208
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:35,867
Thanks a lot.

1209
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:37,785
Can I have the dope?

1210
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,876
Why don't you give the old guys a break?

1211
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:46,377
Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

1212
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:00,475
Hey!

1213
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:06,272
I hope I'm not out of line.

1214
01:32:06,481 --> 01:32:08,281
If you want it that bad,
man, you can have it.

1215
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:12,737
Well, take off your clothes.

1216
01:32:14,113 --> 01:32:15,698
I don't have to take my clothes off.

1217
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:19,702
I can make it without
taking off my clothes.

1218
01:32:19,911 --> 01:32:22,031
If you want to make it with
me, take off your clothes.

1219
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:29,545
Well...

1220
01:32:29,754 --> 01:32:31,088
Where we gonna do it?

1221
01:32:32,465 --> 01:32:34,967
Here?

1222
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:38,137
I mean, you got another
bed, in another room?

1223
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:40,389
You do have another bed in another room?

1224
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:42,158
Your friend's pretty uptight, isn't he?

1225
01:32:42,183 --> 01:32:43,684
Mirrors.

1226
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:46,562
Watching ourselves was as far
as my generation ever got.

1227
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:48,571
You mean you never got
into whips or anything?

1228
01:32:48,773 --> 01:32:49,774
Socks, too.

1229
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:51,943
Socks, too?

1230
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:53,361
She's anti-fetish.

1231
01:33:19,971 --> 01:33:21,055
You...

1232
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:23,933
You want me?

1233
01:33:25,393 --> 01:33:26,477
Why not?

1234
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:31,732
You mean...

1235
01:33:35,987 --> 01:33:38,906
"What the world needs now,"
and all that sort of thing?

1236
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,409
Something like that.

1237
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:03,723
You just beat the world speed record.

1238
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:04,932
Whose?

1239
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:07,393
Making love, you know,

1240
01:34:07,602 --> 01:34:09,729
isn't the same thing as a 50-yard dash.

1241
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:13,107
Well, what do you mean by that?

1242
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,162
How you doing?

1243
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,636
Never screwed on grass before?

1244
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:48,225
That was...

1245
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:52,855
That was...

1246
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:54,940
Outrageous?

1247
01:34:55,149 --> 01:34:57,360
Outrageous.

1248
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:04,533
Out. Way out.

1249
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:08,871
Can I join you two?

1250
01:35:09,038 --> 01:35:10,122
He's all yours.

1251
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:12,041
Fair enough.

1252
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,376
Well, I'll buy that.

1253
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,129
No preliminaries?

1254
01:35:17,338 --> 01:35:18,538
I don't need no preliminaries.

1255
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:24,387
Get your clothes on.

1256
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:26,013
I'm not going anywhere.

1257
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:27,699
We're cutting out with
this bag of goodies.

1258
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:28,891
That's a dirty trick.

1259
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,893
Why should those pricks have it?

1260
01:35:31,102 --> 01:35:33,813
I mean Ronnie and Gail, leaving
them here with those guys.

1261
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:36,061
They're big girls, they can
take care of themselves.

1262
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:37,483
I want to...

1263
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:40,903
I want to see you again.

1264
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:42,192
I wanna get together again.

1265
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:43,280
No.

1266
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:45,157
No?
No.

1267
01:35:46,033 --> 01:35:48,411
But you liked it.

1268
01:35:48,619 --> 01:35:50,013
I could tell you liked it.
Didn't you like it?

1269
01:35:50,037 --> 01:35:51,247
It was okay.

1270
01:35:52,957 --> 01:35:54,041
So I'll see you again.

1271
01:35:54,834 --> 01:35:55,876
No.

1272
01:35:59,714 --> 01:36:01,340
Listen, when something happens once,

1273
01:36:01,549 --> 01:36:03,300
it doesn't mean that
it has to happen again.

1274
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:07,805
Well, then that's just a one-night stand.

1275
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:10,099
Come on, you've had
one-night stands before.

1276
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:14,895
Yeah... Yeah,
but I decided.

1277
01:36:20,109 --> 01:36:21,152
Wait a minute.

1278
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:25,906
No, man, no.
That's too much.

1279
01:36:26,115 --> 01:36:28,200
Just the credit cards, man.

1280
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:29,489
You're asking for the pigs.

1281
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,661
Sell 'em.

1282
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:33,956
What about a weekend?

1283
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:38,419
Maybe, but I don't really think so.

1284
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:46,635
Is that your way of saying no?

1285
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,138
I guess so.

1286
01:36:54,852 --> 01:36:56,645
Compton!

1287
01:36:57,772 --> 01:36:59,690
Compton! Christ!

1288
01:37:00,316 --> 01:37:01,567
Hey, Compton!

1289
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:04,904
Compton! Compton!

1290
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:08,365
Compton! Hey, Compton!

1291
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:11,160
Little pricks stole our wallets.

1292
01:37:11,786 --> 01:37:13,162
Our wallets?

1293
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,930
Yeah, the drugs, too.
I'm gonna get 'em.

1294
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:19,919
Get your pants on.

1295
01:37:20,127 --> 01:37:21,938
Where are they? Where'd they go?
Where'd your friends go?

1296
01:37:21,962 --> 01:37:23,522
Come on, bitch! I said, where are they?

1297
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:25,154
Come on, come on, where did they go?

1298
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:27,968
Where'd they go, bitch? Come on,
tell me, where did they go?

1299
01:37:28,177 --> 01:37:29,279
You gonna tell me, or am I gonna
beat the shit out of you?

1300
01:37:29,303 --> 01:37:31,222
Come on! Come on!

1301
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,015
Look, we don't know.

1302
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:36,477
The hell you don't.
Come on!

1303
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,270
Come on, bitch, come on.
Come on, whore.

1304
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:39,730
Come on, talk!
Talk!

1305
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:41,190
Will you stop him?

1306
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:42,958
Well, what are you protecting them for?

1307
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:44,985
They didn't give a damn about you.

1308
01:37:45,194 --> 01:37:48,447
Come on, bitch, you want
me to hurt you now?

1309
01:37:48,656 --> 01:37:50,699
Look, they've got a
commune, in the country.

1310
01:37:50,866 --> 01:37:51,700
Where is it?

1311
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:52,618
I don't know.

1312
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,498
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

1313
01:38:02,253 --> 01:38:05,047
Up Route 9, take it to the 18...

1314
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:09,885
About five miles on Edgewood Road.

1315
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:11,029
You know, if you're lying,
I can come back here.

1316
01:38:11,053 --> 01:38:12,346
I'm not lying.

1317
01:38:12,555 --> 01:38:15,182
Yeah, and I can finish what I started.
Got that?

1318
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:17,351
Man, you just balled me,
and you don't believe me?

1319
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,120
Wait a minute, Compton.

1320
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:04,583
Joe, put them back.

1321
01:40:04,792 --> 01:40:06,669
No, no, just give 'em a little scare.

1322
01:40:06,877 --> 01:40:08,087
No.
Shake 'em up.

1323
01:40:53,382 --> 01:40:55,134
Hi.

1324
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:56,902
Maybe you wanna give us back our stuff?

1325
01:40:56,927 --> 01:40:58,679
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.

1326
01:41:02,933 --> 01:41:04,351
You got it all?

1327
01:41:13,152 --> 01:41:14,570
Where's the money?

1328
01:41:25,372 --> 01:41:26,582
My God.

1329
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:39,011
What the hell you doing, Compton?

1330
01:41:52,024 --> 01:41:54,693
God, no, don't shoot me. I won't tell.

1331
01:41:54,902 --> 01:41:56,422
Don't shoot me.
Please, don't shoot me.

1332
01:41:56,487 --> 01:41:59,531
Please. Just...
I won't tell!

1333
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:04,161
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

1334
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:05,662
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

1335
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:07,998
Well, where's that gonna get you?

1336
01:42:08,207 --> 01:42:10,042
You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.

1337
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,919
Please, don't.

1338
01:42:12,127 --> 01:42:13,207
- Please.
- Look, Compton...

1339
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:17,257
There's only one way out now. Clean.

1340
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:19,885
That means everybody.

1341
01:42:21,762 --> 01:42:23,597
At this point it can get to be fun.

1342
01:42:23,806 --> 01:42:25,557
No more!

1343
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:30,312
I don't get you, Compton.
You hate those kids.

1344
01:42:31,772 --> 01:42:34,066
You hate the way
those girls put you down.

1345
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:36,314
You hate the way those kids,
those little shitheads,

1346
01:42:36,485 --> 01:42:39,530
they made a shithead out of you.
Guys like Frank.

1347
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:41,657
What Frank did to your daughter.

1348
01:42:41,865 --> 01:42:43,242
No!

1349
01:42:44,076 --> 01:42:45,035
No!

1350
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:51,667
Look, Compton, you told me you
got a kick out of killing Frank.

1351
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:54,336
These kids, they shit on you.

1352
01:42:55,754 --> 01:42:57,422
They shit on your life.

1353
01:42:57,631 --> 01:42:59,508
They shit on everything you believe in.

1354
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:01,009
They shit on everything!

1355
01:43:02,136 --> 01:43:04,138
You hate 'em as much as I do.

1356
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:09,476
No! No!

1357
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,022
It's your ass now, Compton!

1358
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:15,816
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1359
01:43:16,024 --> 01:43:17,776
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1360
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,111
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1361
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:20,571
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1362
01:43:20,779 --> 01:43:21,859
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1363
01:43:23,282 --> 01:43:24,658
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1364
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:26,243
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1365
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:27,619
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1366
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:28,908
<i>It's your ass now, Compton!</i>

1367
01:43:28,954 --> 01:43:30,014
<i>These kids, they shit on you.</i>

1368
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:31,373
<i>They shit on your life.</i>

1369
01:43:31,582 --> 01:43:32,809
<i>They shit on everything you believe in.</i>

1370
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:33,959
<i>They shit on everything.</i>

1371
01:43:34,168 --> 01:43:35,648
<i>You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.</i>

1372
01:43:37,171 --> 01:43:38,630
<i>Are you gonna kill me, too?</i>

1373
01:43:38,839 --> 01:43:40,632
Melissa!
