<font color="#ffff80"><i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i></font>

00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:37,153
<font color="#ffff80"><i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i></font>

53
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,739
<font color="#ffff80"><i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i></font>

54
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,867
<font color="#ffff80"><i>with an exceptionally
lively, intelligent face</i></font>

55
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,079
<font color="#ffff80"><i>and an immediately
perceptible air of sadness.</i></font>

56
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,665
<font color="#ffff80"><i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i></font>

57
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:54,420
<font color="#ffff80"><i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i></font>

58
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,298
<font color="#ffff80"><i>A symptom of my own medical
condition as well.</i></font>

59

<font color="#ffff80">Who's this interesting
old fellow?</font>

60
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,177
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i></font>

61
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,013
<font color="#ffff80"><i>To my surprise, he was
distinctly taken aback.</i></font>

62
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,473
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you know? He <i>asked.</i></font>

63
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,433
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you recognize him?</font>

64
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,018
<font color="#ffff80"><i>He did look familiar.</i></font>

65
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,312

<font color="#ffff80">He arrived earlier this morning.</font>

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,358
<font color="#ffff80"><i>This name will no
doubt be familiar</i></font>

68
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,236
<font color="#ffff80"><i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i></font>

69
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,909
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i></font>

70
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:30,248

owner of the Grand Budapest.</i></font>

71
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,417

stays a week or more,</font>

72
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,753
<font color="#ffff80">three times a year at least,
but never in the season.</font>

00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,297
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Monsieur Jean signaled to
me and I leaned closer.</i></font>

74
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,549
<font color="#ffff80">I'll tell you a secret.</font>

75
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,093
<font color="#ffff80">He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath</font>

76
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,053
<font color="#ffff80">in the rear corner
of the top floor</font>

77
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,180
<font color="#ffff80">and it's smaller than
the service elevator!</font>

78
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,723
<font color="#ffff80"><i>It was well known,</i></font>

79
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,476
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i></font>

80
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,604
<font color="#ffff80"><i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i></font>

81
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,108
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i></font>

82
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,819
<font color="#ffff80"><i>he occupied a
servant's quarters?</i></font>

83
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,696
<font color="#ffff80"><i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i></font>

84
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,281
<font color="#ffff80"><i>on a parenthetical,
domestic drama...</i></font>

85
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,657
<font color="#ffff80">Shit.</font>

86
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,743
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...which required the immediate
and complete attention</i></font>

87
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,912
<font color="#ffff80">of Monsieur Jean,</font>

88
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,125
<font color="#ffff80"><i>but, frankly, did not
hold mine for long.</i></font>

89
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,425
<font color="#ffff80">However,</font>

90
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,261
<font color="#ffff80"><i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i></font>

91
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,889
<font color="#ffff80"><i>had left me, as the
expression goes,</i></font>

92
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,224
<font color="#ffff80">"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"</font>

93
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,727
<font color="#ffff80"><i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i></font>

94
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,813
<font color="#ffff80"><i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i></font>

95
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,775
<font color="#ffff80"><i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i></font>

96
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,863
<font color="#ffff80"><i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i></font>

97
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,785
<font color="#ffff80">MR. MOUSTAFA: I
admire your work.</font>

98
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,415
<font color="#ffff80">I beg your pardon?</font>

99
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,296
<font color="#ffff80">I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.</font>

100
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,090
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you most kindly, sir.</font>

101
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,551
<font color="#ffff80">Did Monsieur Jean have a word
or two to share with you</font>

102
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:09,347
<font color="#ffff80">about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?</font>

103
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:14,060
<font color="#ffff80">I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.</font>

104
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,854
<font color="#ffff80">He's perfectly capable,
of course, Monsieur Jean</font>

105
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,814
<font color="#ffff80">but we can't claim he's a first,</font>

106
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,692
<font color="#ffff80">or, in earnest, even
second-rate concierge.</font>

107
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,027
<font color="#ffff80">But there it is.</font>

108
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,738
<font color="#ffff80">Times have changed.</font>

109
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,953
<font color="#ffff80">The thermal baths
are very beautiful.</font>

110
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,704
<font color="#ffff80">They were in their
first condition.</font>

111
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,456
<font color="#ffff80">It couldn't be
maintained, of course.</font>

112
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,375
<font color="#ffff80">Too decadent for current tastes.</font>

113
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:42,255
<font color="#ffff80">But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.</font>

114
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,883
<font color="#ffff80">How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?</font>

115
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,094
<font color="#ffff80">The Grand Budapest.</font>

116
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,854
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't.</font>

117
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,324
<font color="#ffff80">If you're not merely
being polite,</font>

118
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,244
<font color="#ffff80">and you must tell me
if that's the case,</font>

119
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,455
<font color="#ffff80">but if it genuinely
does interest you,</font>

120
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#ffff80">may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,</font>

121
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:23,004
<font color="#ffff80">and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you</font>

122
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,632
<font color="#ffff80">"my story." Such as it is.</font>

123
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,807
<font color="#ffff80">Two ducks roasted with olives.</font>

124
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,393
<font color="#ffff80">Rabbit, salad? Mmm.</font>

125
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,313
<font color="#ffff80">Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus
a split of the brut.</font>

126
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,650
<font color="#ffff80">That should provide
us ample time</font>

127
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,943
<font color="#ffff80">if I commence promptly.</font>

128
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,153
<font color="#ffff80">By all means.</font>

129
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:12,511
<font color="#ffff80">Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.</font>

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,931
<font color="#ffff80">The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.</font>

131
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,393
<font color="#ffff80">It begins, of course, with...</font>

132
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,876
<font color="#ffff80">Bring the table to the window.
Yes, Monsieur Gustave.</font>

133
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,545
<font color="#ffff80">Bring the tray to the table.
Right away, Monsieur Gustave.</font>

134
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,090
<font color="#ffff80">Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?</font>

135
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,092
<font color="#ffff80">Of course, Monsieur Gustave.
Pack them in the hat boxes.</font>

136
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,426
<font color="#ffff80">Is that from
Oberstdorf & Company?</font>

137
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,469
<font color="#ffff80">I believe so, Monsieur Gustave.</font>

138
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,346
<font color="#ffff80">Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
I do, Monsieur Gustave.</font>

139
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,431
<font color="#ffff80">Give them to me.</font>

140
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,601
<font color="#ffff80">These are in order.

144

145
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,868

153
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,469

always anxious before you travel.</font>

00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,971
<font color="#ffff80">I admit, you appear
to be suffering</font>

Oh, dear God.</font>

diabolical varnish.</font>

Don't you like it?</font>

160
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,524
<font color="#ffff80">It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.</font>

161
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,068
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps this will soothe you.</font>

162

00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,290
<font color="#ffff80">Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man</font>

<font color="#ffff80">in the position of a Lobby Boy?</font>

202

00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,341
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr.

207
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,680

officially interviewed.</font>

208
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,057
<font color="#ffff80">Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?</font>

209
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,517
<font color="#ffff80">What? No.</font>

210
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,313
<font color="#ffff80">Experience?</font>

216
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,198
<font color="#ffff80">Straighten that cap, Anatole.</font>

217
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,158
<font color="#ffff80">The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider.
The strap's busted.</font>

218
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,119

I fully agree.</font>

219

<font color="#ffff80">Education?</font>

220
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,913
<font color="#ffff80">I studied reading and spelling.</font>

221
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,374
<font color="#ffff80">I started my primary school.
I almost...</font>

222
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,584
<font color="#ffff80">Education, zero.</font>

223
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,751
<font color="#ffff80">Now it's exploded.</font>

224
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,004
<font color="#ffff80">Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!</font>

225
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,213
<font color="#ffff80">This afternoon,
Monsieur Gustave?</font>

226
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,506
<font color="#ffff80">Without fail, Frau Liebling.</font>

227
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,174
<font color="#ffff80">What in hell is this? Not now.</font>

228
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,343
<font color="#ffff80">Family?</font>

229
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,598
<font color="#ffff80">Zero.</font>

230
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,808
<font color="#ffff80">Six, Igor.</font>

231
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,067
<font color="#ffff80">Why do you want to
be a Lobby Boy?</font>

232
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,532
<font color="#ffff80">Well, who wouldn't, at
the Grand Budapest, sir?</font>

233
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,743
<font color="#ffff80">It's an institution.</font>

237
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,727

239
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,064
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...</font>

240
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,940
<font color="#ffff80">Go and light the goddamn candle.
Yes, sir.</font>

00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,520
<font color="#ffff80">The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,</font>

285
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,148
<font color="#ffff80">and they will open
up like a flower.</font>

286
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,941
<font color="#ffff80">I am reminded of a verse,</font>

287
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,569
<font color="#ffff80">"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face</font>

288
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,738
<font color="#ffff80">"by ends of nimble bristles</font>

289
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,823
<font color="#ffff80">"and with their blush
of first color,</font>

290
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,825
<font color="#ffff80">"rendered her lifeless
cheek living."</font>

291
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,078
<font color="#ffff80"><i>MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner,
he took alone in his room.</i></font>

292
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,463
<font color="#ffff80"><i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i></font>

293
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,467
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i></font>

294
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,511
<font color="#ffff80"><i>to review the books
and convey messages</i></font>

295
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,222
<font color="#ffff80"><i>on behalf of the
mysterious proprietor.</i></font>

296
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,391
<font color="#ffff80"><i>On these occasions, Monsieur
Gustave and our business manager,</i></font>

297
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,103
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Herr Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i></font>

298
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:15,369
<font color="#ffff80"><i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i></font>

299
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,556
<font color="#ffff80"><i>but we won't discuss that.</i></font>

300
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,482
<font color="#ffff80">What do you want? Look.</font>

301
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,739
<font color="#ffff80">GUSTAVE H: Dear God.</font>

302
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,198
<font color="#ffff80">I'm terribly sorry, sir.</font>

303
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,408
<font color="#ffff80">We must go to her.</font>

304
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,492
<font color="#ffff80">We must?</font>

305
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,328
<font color="#ffff80">Tout de suite. She
needs me, and I need</font>

306
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,163
<font color="#ffff80">you to help me with
my bags and so on.</font>

307
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,833
<font color="#ffff80">How fast can you pack?
Five minutes.</font>

308
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,002
<font color="#ffff80">Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26</font>

309
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,295
<font color="#ffff80">in an ice bucket
with two glasses</font>

310
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,340
<font color="#ffff80">so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.</font>

311
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,517
<font color="#ffff80">I blame myself.</font>

312
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,563
<font color="#ffff80">She tried to tell me she had a premonition.
I didn't listen.</font>

313
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,357
<font color="#ffff80">All of Lutz will be
dressed in black,</font>

314
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,484
<font color="#ffff80">except her own ghastly,
deceitful children</font>

315
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,736
<font color="#ffff80">whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.</font>

316
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,238
<font color="#ffff80">They'll be dancing like gypsies.</font>

317
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,327
<font color="#ffff80">There's really no point in
doing anything in life,</font>

318
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,287
<font color="#ffff80">because it's all over in
the blink of an eye...</font>

319
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,374
<font color="#ffff80">And, the next thing you
know, rigor mortis sets in.</font>

320
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,418
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, how the good die young.</font>

321
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,588
<font color="#ffff80">With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,</font>

322
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,340
<font color="#ffff80">but one never knows
until the ink</font>

323
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,050
<font color="#ffff80">is dry on the death certificate.</font>

324
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,387
<font color="#ffff80">She was dynamite in
the sack, by the way.</font>

325
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,766
<font color="#ffff80"><i>She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.</i></font>

326
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,434
<font color="#ffff80">I've had older.</font>

327
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,228
<font color="#ffff80">When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,</font>

328
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,439
<font color="#ffff80">but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,</font>

329
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,900
<font color="#ffff80">which is fine with me,
because I like those.</font>

330
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,361
<font color="#ffff80">More flavorful, or so they say.</font>

331
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,741
<font color="#ffff80">Why are we stopping
at a barley field?</font>

332
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,675
<font color="#ffff80">Well, hello there, chaps.</font>

333
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,301
<font color="#ffff80">Documents, please.</font>

334
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,512
<font color="#ffff80">With pleasure.</font>

335
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,476
<font color="#ffff80">It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.</font>

336
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,311
<font color="#ffff80">I was once considered
a great beauty.</font>

337
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,982
<font color="#ffff80">What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?</font>

338
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,442
<font color="#ffff80">Franz.</font>

339
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,776
<font color="#ffff80">I knew it!</font>

340
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,029
<font color="#ffff80">He's making a funny face.</font>

341
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,825
<font color="#ffff80">That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.</font>

342
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,119
<font color="#ffff80">He's with me.</font>

343
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,996
<font color="#ffff80">Come outside, please.</font>

344
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,459
<font color="#ffff80">Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.</font>

345
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,127
<font color="#ffff80">I cross-referenced
them myself with</font>

346
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,670
<font color="#ffff80">the Bureau of Labor
and Servitude.</font>

347
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,714
<font color="#ffff80">You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.</font>

348
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,008
<font color="#ffff80">He hasn't done anything wrong.</font>

349
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,557
<font color="#ffff80">Stop it, damn you!</font>

350
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,851
<font color="#ffff80">Never mind, Monsieur Gustave!
Let them proceed!</font>

351
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,686
<font color="#ffff80">GUSTAVE H: Ow! That hurts!</font>

352
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,317
<font color="#ffff80">You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!</font>

353
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,819
<font color="#ffff80">Take your hands
off my Lobby Boy!</font>

354
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,041
<font color="#ffff80">What's the problem?</font>

355
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,292
<font color="#ffff80">This is outrageous.</font>

356
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,045
<font color="#ffff80">The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.</font>

357
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,381
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Monsieur Gustave?</i></font>

358
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,220
<font color="#ffff80">My name is Henckels.</font>

359
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,599
<font color="#ffff80">I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer.</font>

360
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,559
<font color="#ffff80">Do you remember me?</font>

361
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,231
<font color="#ffff80">I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.</font>

362
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,233
<font color="#ffff80">I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.</font>

363
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,236
<font color="#ffff80">Release them.</font>

364
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,242
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm.</font>

365
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,285
<font color="#ffff80">Your colleague is stateless.</font>

366
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,746
<font color="#ffff80">He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,</font>

367
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,250
<font color="#ffff80">which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.</font>

368
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,417
<font color="#ffff80">Take this.</font>

369
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,462
<font color="#ffff80">It's temporary</font>

370
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,964
<font color="#ffff80">but it's the best I can
offer, I'm afraid.</font>

371
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,216
<font color="#ffff80">And how's your wonderful mother?</font>

372
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,343
<font color="#ffff80">She's very well, thank you.
I adore her.</font>

373
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,720
<font color="#ffff80">Send my love. I will.</font>

374
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,473
<font color="#ffff80">Your companion was
very kind to me</font>

375
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,475
<font color="#ffff80">when I was a lonely little boy.</font>

376
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,979
<font color="#ffff80">My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.</font>

377
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,231
<font color="#ffff80">I beg your pardon, sir.</font>

378
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,792
<font color="#ffff80">You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization</font>

379
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,794
<font color="#ffff80">left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse</font>

380
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,671
<font color="#ffff80">that was once known as humanity.</font>

381
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,298
<font color="#ffff80">Indeed, that's what we provide</font>

382
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,175
<font color="#ffff80">in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...</font>

383

<font color="#ffff80">Oh, fuck it.</font>

384
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,796
<font color="#ffff80">Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.</font>

385
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,376
<font color="#ffff80">You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.</font>

386
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,919
<font color="#ffff80">They've done a marvelous job.</font>

387
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,295
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know what sort of cream</font>

388
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,546
<font color="#ffff80">they've put on you
down at the morgue,</font>

389

390
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,509

than you have in years.</font>

391
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,719
<font color="#ffff80">You look like you're alive.</font>

392
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,229
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.</font>

393
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,231
<font color="#ffff80">Clotilde? Oui, Monsieur Gustave?</font>

394
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,441
<font color="#ffff80">A glass of chilled water

398
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,409
<font color="#ffff80">All right, then.</font>

399
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,619

<font color="#ffff80">Ah, Inspector Henckels.</font>

565
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,919
<font color="#ffff80">"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,</font>

566
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,880
<font color="#ffff80">"I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder</font>

567
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,549
<font color="#ffff80">"of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."</font>

568
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,217
<font color="#ffff80">I knew there was
something fishy.</font>

569
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,844
<font color="#ffff80">We never got the cause of death.</font>

570
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,222
<font color="#ffff80">She's been murdered and
you think I did it.</font>

571
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,893
<font color="#ffff80">HENCKELS: Hey!</font>

572
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,730
<font color="#ffff80">Stop!</font>

573
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,948
<font color="#ffff80">What happened?</font>

574
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,617
<font color="#ffff80">What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit</font>

575
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,453
<font color="#ffff80">out of a sniveling little
runt called Pinky Bandinski</font>

576
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,455
<font color="#ffff80">who had the gall to
question my virility,</font>

577
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,916
<font color="#ffff80">because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,</font>

578
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,126
<font color="#ffff80">it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,</font>

579
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,795
<font color="#ffff80">you must never be a candy-ass.</font>

580
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,964
<font color="#ffff80">You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.</font>

581
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,632
<font color="#ffff80">You've got to win their respect.</font>

582
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:00,094
<font color="#ffff80">You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.</font>

583
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,266
<font color="#ffff80">He's, actually,
become a dear friend.</font>

584
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,976
<font color="#ffff80">You'll meet him, I hope.</font>

585
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,020
<font color="#ffff80">So. You've talked to Kovacs?</font>

586
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,647
<font color="#ffff80">I saw him last night in secret.</font>

587
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,024
<font color="#ffff80">He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.</font>

588
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,359
<font color="#ffff80">You're supposed to also.</font>

589
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,652
<font color="#ffff80">I'll do that later.</font>

590
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:17,987
<font color="#ffff80">He suspects you're innocent.</font>

591
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,321
<font color="#ffff80">Of course he does.</font>

592
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,282
<font color="#ffff80">What's the charge?</font>

593
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,661
<font color="#ffff80">In the small hours of the
evening of 19 October,</font>

594
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,914
<font color="#ffff80">an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H,</font>

595
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,251
<font color="#ffff80">did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz</font>

596
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,962
<font color="#ffff80">and entered by the
rear service alley,</font>

597
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,505
<font color="#ffff80">alerting no one to his presence,</font>

598
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:40,467
<font color="#ffff80">and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,</font>

599
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,012
<font color="#ffff80">to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.</font>

600
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,764
<font color="#ffff80">There is no evidence to
indicate whether this visit</font>

601
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,434
<font color="#ffff80">had been pre-arranged
with her or not.</font>

602
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:53,522
<font color="#ffff80">The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.</font>

603
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,858
<font color="#ffff80">Monsieur Gustave was not
observed on the premises again</font>

604
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,236
<font color="#ffff80">until, of course,
24 hours later.</font>

605
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,697
<font color="#ffff80">The identity of his
accusers is made</font>

606
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,116
<font color="#ffff80">clear in this
notarized deposition.</font>

607
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:07,745
<font color="#ffff80">They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,</font>

608
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:12,666
<font color="#ffff80">but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events</font>

609
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,502
<font color="#ffff80">appears to have fled
the jurisdiction.</font>

610
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,379
<font color="#ffff80">His whereabouts are
currently unknown,</font>

611
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:20,215
<font color="#ffff80">but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.</font>

612
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,509
<font color="#ffff80">Who is he?</font>

613
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,640
<font color="#ffff80">Serge?</font>

614
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,766
<font color="#ffff80">I'm afraid so.</font>

615
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,226
<font color="#ffff80">That little prick.</font>

616
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,562
<font color="#ffff80">No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.</font>

617
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,898
<font color="#ffff80">I've been dropped into
a nest of vipers.</font>

618
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,107
<font color="#ffff80">You have an alibi?</font>

619
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,485
<font color="#ffff80">Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.</font>

620
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,321
<font color="#ffff80">I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.</font>

621
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,365
<font color="#ffff80">Your life may be at stake.</font>

622
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,325
<font color="#ffff80">I know, but the bitch legged it.</font>

623
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,287
<font color="#ffff80">She's already on board the Queen
<i>Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.</font>

624
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,041
<font color="#ffff80">Don't give up.</font>

625
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,423
<font color="#ffff80"><i>MR. MOUSTAFA: The details
of the conspiracy,</i></font>

for us to apprehend.</i></font>

628
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,116
<font color="#ffff80">I'm looking for Serge X,</font>

629
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,160
<font color="#ffff80">a young man in the
service of my employer,</font>

630
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,872
<font color="#ffff80">the family Desgoffe und
Taxis of Schloss Lutz.</font>

631
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,084
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, sir? You're his sister?</font>

632
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,670
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, sir. Seen him lately?</font>

633
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,965
<font color="#ffff80">No, sir. No, sir?</font>

634
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,050
<font color="#ffff80">No, sir.</font>

635
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,265
<font color="#ffff80">I need to find him right
away, for his own safety</font>

636
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,016
<font color="#ffff80">and everybody else's.</font>

637
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,894
<font color="#ffff80">If he shows up...</font>

638
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,856
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, sir? Tell him Jopling says,</font>

639
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,316
<font color="#ffff80">"Come home."</font>

640
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,071
<font color="#ffff80"><i>MR. MOUSTAFA: But one
thing was certain,</i></font>

641
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:11,702
<font color="#ffff80"><i>the Desgoffe und Taxis were
a very powerful family,</i></font>

642

643
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,844
<font color="#ffff80">A letter from Monsieur Gustave.
Zero.</font>

644
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,764
<font color="#ffff80">You want me to? Read it.</font>

645
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,563
<font color="#ffff80">"My dear and trusted
colleagues..."</font>

646
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:41,815
<font color="#ffff80">I miss you deeply as I
write from the confines</font>

647
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:45,027
<font color="#ffff80">of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.</font>

648
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,321
<font color="#ffff80">Until I walk amongst you
again as a free man,</font>

649
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,907
<font color="#ffff80">the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,</font>

650
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,284
<font color="#ffff80">as does its impeccable
reputation.</font>

651
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,495
<font color="#ffff80">Keep it spotless and glorify it.</font>

652
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,039
<font color="#ffff80">Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it</font>

653
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,333
<font color="#ffff80">as if I were watching
over you like a hawk</font>

654
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,003
<font color="#ffff80">with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.</font>

655
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:06,256
<font color="#ffff80">Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,</font>

656
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:10,093
<font color="#ffff80">I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.</font>

657
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:14,264
<font color="#ffff80">A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.</font>

658
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,100
<font color="#ffff80">Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.</font>

659
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,436
<font color="#ffff80">"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."</font>

660
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,897
<font color="#ffff80">Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup</font>

661
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,482
<font color="#ffff80">since it's 46 stanzas.</font>

662

<font color="#ffff80">"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest</font>

<font color="#ffff80">May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?</font>

671
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,400
<font color="#ffff80">No? Anyone?</font>

672
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,861
<font color="#ffff80">You with the very large
scar on your face?</font>

673
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,123
<font color="#ffff80">Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.</font>

674
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,374
<font color="#ffff80">It needs a dash of salt.</font>

675
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,801
<font color="#ffff80">Good day.</font>

676
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,641
<font color="#ffff80">Mush, gents? Any takers?</font>

677
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,314
<font color="#ffff80">Suit yourselves.</font>

678
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,529
<font color="#ffff80">Rise and shine. Chop, chop.</font>

679
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,324
<font color="#ffff80">Good morning, Pinky.</font>

680
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,414
<font color="#ffff80">Mendl's again?</font>

681
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,707
<font color="#ffff80">Precisely.</font>

682
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,918
<font color="#ffff80">Who's got the throat slitter?</font>

683
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,925
<font color="#ffff80">Out of this world.</font>

684
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,426
<font color="#ffff80">GUSTAVE H: Mendl's is the best.</font>

685
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,762
<font color="#ffff80">Well, back to work.
Monsieur Gustave?</font>

686
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,767
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

687
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,856
<font color="#ffff80">PINKY: Me and the
boys talked it over.</font>

688
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,525
<font color="#ffff80">We think you're a
really straight fellow.</font>

689
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,903
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I've never been
accused of that before,</font>

690
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,072
<font color="#ffff80">but I appreciate the sentiment.</font>

691
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,657
<font color="#ffff80">You're one of us now.</font>

692
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,910
<font color="#ffff80">What a lovely thing to say.</font>

693
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,995
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Gunther.</font>

694
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,622
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you, Wolf.</font>

695
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,832
<font color="#ffff80">Anything else?</font>

696
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:48,710
<font color="#ffff80">Tell him, Ludwig.</font>

697
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,966
<font color="#ffff80">Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.</font>

698
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,427
<font color="#ffff80">You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.</font>

699
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:01,223
<font color="#ffff80">You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.</font>

700
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:05,727
<font color="#ffff80">You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.</font>

701
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,896
<font color="#ffff80">But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,</font>

702
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,856
<font color="#ffff80">which in this case
happens to take the form</font>

703
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,192
<font color="#ffff80">of a storm-drain sewer system</font>

704

00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,242
<font color="#ffff80">Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade</font>

707
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,202
<font color="#ffff80">with a fine lady and
a white poodle,</font>

708
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:26,039
<font color="#ffff80">but it's got what you'd
call "vulnerability,"</font>

709
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,917
<font color="#ffff80">and that's our bread and butter.</font>

710
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,920
<font color="#ffff80">Take a look.</font>

711
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,464
<font color="#ffff80">Who drew this?</font>

712
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,758
<font color="#ffff80">What do you mean, "Who
drew this?" I did.</font>

713
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,052
<font color="#ffff80">Very good. You've got a
wonderful line, Ludwig.</font>

artistic promise.</font>

penetrate this lowest rudiment?</font>

716
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,269
<font color="#ffff80">It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?</font>

717
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,187
<font color="#ffff80">Digging with the throat-slitter,</font>

718
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,024
<font color="#ffff80">I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,</font>

several of our members</font>

sticks and bunk-linens,</font>

724

00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,393
<font color="#ffff80">It's you. Thank you.</font>

847
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,604
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you, you sweet, kind man.</font>

848
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,469
<font color="#ffff80">LUDWIG: Okay.</font>

849
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:44,855
<font color="#ffff80">ALL: Whoa!</font>

850
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,129
<font color="#ffff80">I suppose you'd
call that a draw.</font>

851
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:19,265
<font color="#ffff80">Good evening.</font>

852
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:31,152
<font color="#ffff80">Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.</font>

853
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,195
<font color="#ffff80">Gunther was slain
in the catacombs.</font>

854
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:36,198
<font color="#ffff80">Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one clay...</font>

855
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:37,491
<font color="#ffff80">Hold it.</font>

856
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,872
<font color="#ffff80">No time to gab.</font>

857
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:45,499
<font color="#ffff80">Take care of yourself, Mr.
Gustave.</font>

858
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,668
<font color="#ffff80">Good luck, kid.</font>

859
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,798
<font color="#ffff80">Which way to the safe house?</font>

860
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,383
<font color="#ffff80">I couldn't find one.</font>

861
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,553
<font color="#ffff80">No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?</font>

862
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,890
<font color="#ffff80">I'm afraid so. I
asked around, but...</font>

863
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,893
<font color="#ffff80">GUSTAVE H: I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.</font>

864
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,520
<font color="#ffff80">Let's put on our disguises.</font>

865
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,730
<font color="#ffff80">We're wearing them.</font>

866
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:08,856
<font color="#ffff80">No, we're not.</font>

867
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:11,525
<font color="#ffff80">We said false whiskers and
fake noses and so on.</font>

868
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:12,860
<font color="#ffff80">You didn't bring any?</font>

869
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,195
<font color="#ffff80">I thought you were growing one.</font>

870
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,323
<font color="#ffff80">And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?</font>

871
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,700
<font color="#ffff80">No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.</font>

872
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,869
<font color="#ffff80">But I take your point. So be it.</font>

873
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,497
<font color="#ffff80">Give me a few squirts of L'air
de Panache, please, will you?</font>

874
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:27,833
<font color="#ffff80">Can I not get a squirt, even?</font>

875
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,543
<font color="#ffff80">I forgot the L'air de Panache.</font>

876
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:32,338
<font color="#ffff80">Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?</font>

877
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,508
<font color="#ffff80">I don't believe it.
How could you?</font>

878
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,678
<font color="#ffff80">I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?</font>

879
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,888
<font color="#ffff80">I smell.</font>

880
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,767
<font color="#ffff80">That's just marvelous, isn't it?</font>

881
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,228
<font color="#ffff80">I suppose this is to
be expected back in...</font>

882
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,729
<font color="#ffff80">Where do you come from again?</font>

883
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,439
<font color="#ffff80">Aq Salim al-Jabat. Precisely.</font>

884
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,234
<font color="#ffff80">I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat</font>

885
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:54,694
<font color="#ffff80">where one's prized possessions</font>

886
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,737
<font color="#ffff80">are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,</font>

887
01:00:56,946 --> 01:01:00,741
<font color="#ffff80">and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.</font>

888
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,452
<font color="#ffff80">But it's not how I trained you.</font>

889
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,329
<font color="#ffff80">What on God's earth
possessed you to leave</font>

890
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,747
<font color="#ffff80">the homeland where
you obviously belong</font>

891
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,290
<font color="#ffff80">and travel unspeakable distances</font>

892
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,961
<font color="#ffff80">to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined, highly-cultivated society</font>

893
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:15,214
<font color="#ffff80">that, quite frankly, could've
gotten along very well without you?</font>

894
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,133
<font color="#ffff80">The war.</font>

895
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:19,593
<font color="#ffff80">Say again?</font>

896
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,804
<font color="#ffff80">Well, you see, my
father was murdered</font>

897
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:24,640
<font color="#ffff80">and the rest of my family were
executed by firing squad.</font>

898
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,308
<font color="#ffff80">Our village was
burned to the ground</font>

899
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,770
<font color="#ffff80">and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.</font>

900
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,772
<font color="#ffff80">I left because of the war.</font>

901
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,444
<font color="#ffff80">I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?</font>

902
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,612
<font color="#ffff80">Truly.</font>

903
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:42,491
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.</font>

904
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,829
<font color="#ffff80">What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.</font>

905
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,165
<font color="#ffff80">Goddamn, selfish bastard.</font>

906
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:52,460
<font color="#ffff80">This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.</font>

907
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,172
<font color="#ffff80">I apologize on
behalf of the hotel.</font>

908
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:58,758
<font color="#ffff80">It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.</font>

909
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:02,970
<font color="#ffff80">Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.</font>

910
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:07,016
<font color="#ffff80">You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.</font>

911
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,518
<font color="#ffff80">You must know that.</font>

912
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,771
<font color="#ffff80">I'm so sorry, Zero.</font>

913
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,316
<font color="#ffff80">We're brothers.</font>

914
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,493
<font color="#ffff80">How's our darling Agatha?</font>

915
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,207
<font color="#ffff80">"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,</font>

916
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:34,043
<font color="#ffff80">"and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,</font>

917
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:37,171
<font color="#ffff80">"tho' vinegar did brine
my heart, never..."</font>

918
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:40,007
<font color="#ffff80">Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,</font>

919
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:43,677
<font color="#ffff80">but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.</font>

920
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,448
<font color="#ffff80">I want roadblocks at
every junction for 50km.</font>

921
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:07,368
<font color="#ffff80">I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.</font>

922
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,203
<font color="#ffff80">I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds</font>

923
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,454
<font color="#ffff80">ready in five minutes.</font>

924
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:12,206
<font color="#ffff80">We're going to strip-search</font>

925
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:13,874
<font color="#ffff80">every pretzel-Ha us,
Waffel-hut, Biergarten</font>

926
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,126
<font color="#ffff80">and especially every grand hotel</font>

927
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,837
<font color="#ffff80">from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.</font>

928
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,047
<font color="#ffff80">These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.</font>

929
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,341
<font color="#ffff80">At least three of
them are anyway.</font>

930
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,551
<font color="#ffff80">Who are you?</font>

931
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:26,971
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing here?</font>

932
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,722
<font color="#ffff80">Civilian personnel aren't
permitted in the cellblock.</font>

933
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,307
<font color="#ffff80">This is a military
investigation.</font>

934
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,934
<font color="#ffff80">This is Mr. Jopling, sir.</font>

935
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,228
<font color="#ffff80">His employer's mother was
one of the victims...</font>

936
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,730
<font color="#ffff80">Shut up.</font>

937
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,067
<font color="#ffff80">You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?</font>

938
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:44,196
<font color="#ffff80">Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?</font>

939
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:46,740
<font color="#ffff80">I'm aware of his disappearance.</font>

940
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:49,493
<font color="#ffff80">His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room</font>

941
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:51,245
<font color="#ffff80">at the Kunstmuseum
late last night.</font>

942
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,081
<font color="#ffff80"><i>He was short four fingers.</i></font>

943
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,541
<font color="#ffff80">What do you know about that?</font>

944
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,917
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing.</font>

945
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:00,588
<font color="#ffff80">Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.</font>

946
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,100
<font color="#ffff80">Mendl's.</font>

947
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,107
<font color="#ffff80">Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jurgen</font>

948
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:21,775
<font color="#ffff80">and reverse the charges, please.</font>

949
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,861
<font color="#ffff80">We've no choice. There's
nowhere else to turn.</font>

950
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,362
<font color="#ffff80">I'll hold. Thank you.</font>

951
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:28,282
<font color="#ffff80">It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.</font>

952
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,243
<font color="#ffff80">It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.</font>

953
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,203
<font color="#ffff80">Do you swear? Of course.
What is it, in fact?</font>

954
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:34,538
<font color="#ffff80">I can't say.</font>

955
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,959
<font color="#ffff80">How does one come by
front-row aisle seats</font>

956
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,463
<font color="#ffff80">for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?</font>

957
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,131
<font color="#ffff80">How does one arrange
a private viewing</font>

958
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,134
<font color="#ffff80">of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?</font>

959
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:51,472
<font color="#ffff80">How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?</font>

960
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,933
<font color="#ffff80">Ivan, darling, it's Gustave.
Hello.</font>

961
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,143
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I was until about
five minutes ago.</font>

962
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,480
<font color="#ffff80">We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.</font>

963
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,149
<font color="#ffff80">Well, through a sewer, as it happens.
Exactly.</font>

964
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,985
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.</font>

965
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:06,820
<font color="#ffff80">This is an official request.</font>

966
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,157
<font color="#ffff80">I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...</font>

967
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,830
<font color="#ffff80">IVAN: <i>I'll call you
back, Gustave.</i></font>

968
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,999
<font color="#ffff80">Right. Stand by.</font>

969
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,419
<font color="#ffff80">I beg your pardon. Do
you prefer to walk?</font>

970
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,505
<font color="#ffff80">We're right here.
It's very simple.</font>

971
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:26,757
<font color="#ffff80">Straight down the
corniche, then left.</font>

972
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,968
<font color="#ffff80">Jojo, see the gentleman out.</font>

973
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,139
<font color="#ffff80">Get me Monsieur Georges at
the Château Luxe, please.</font>

974
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,310
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Happy birthday to you</i></font>

975
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:40,604
<font color="#ffff80">Take over.</font>

976
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:42,106
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Happy birthday, dear...</i></font>

977
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,524
<font color="#ffff80">GEORGES: Hello, Ivan?</font>

978
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,528
<font color="#ffff80">Got it.</font>

979
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,531
<font color="#ffff80">Get me Monsieur Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.</font>

980
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,618
<font color="#ffff80">Higher, goddammit, higher!</font>

981
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,205
<font color="#ffff80">Take over.</font>

982
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,957
<font color="#ffff80">DINO: Monsieur Georges. Higher.</font>

983
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,334
<font color="#ffff80">I see. Straightaway.</font>

984
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,380
<font color="#ffff80">Get me Monsieur Robin at
I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.</font>

985
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,009
<font color="#ffff80">...and two and three.</font>

986
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,138
<font color="#ffff80">Monsieur Robin. There's a call
from Monsieur Dino for you.</font>

987
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,348
<font color="#ffff80">Take over.</font>

988
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,059
<font color="#ffff80">One, two, three.</font>

989
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,477
<font color="#ffff80"><i>ROBIN: Yes, Dino.</i></font>

990
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:23,981
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.</font>

991
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,318
<font color="#ffff80">Get me Monsieur Martin at
the Ritz Imperial, please.</font>

992
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,905
<font color="#ffff80">Too much salt.</font>

993
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,615
<font color="#ffff80">Not enough pepper-</font>

994
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,202
<font color="#ffff80">Take over.</font>

995
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,331
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Robin? Martin. Too much salt.</i></font>

996
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,542
<font color="#ffff80">So I've heard.</font>

997
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,838
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe. Let me make a few calls.</font>

998
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,429
<font color="#ffff80">Serge X, missing. Deputy
Kovacs, also missing.</font>

999
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:58,432
<font color="#ffff80">Madame D, dead. Boy <i>with
</i> Apple, stolen, by us.</font>

1000
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,060
<font color="#ffff80">Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.</font>

1001
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:04,521
<font color="#ffff80">Gustave H, at large. What else?</font>

1002
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,023
<font color="#ffff80">Zero, confused.</font>

1003
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,441
<font color="#ffff80">Zero, confused, indeed.</font>

1004
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,777
<font color="#ffff80">The plot "thickens,"
as they say.</font>

1005
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,613
<font color="#ffff80">Why, by the way? Is
it a soup metaphor?</font>

1006
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:14,865
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know.</font>

1007
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,288
<font color="#ffff80">Get in.</font>

1008
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,042
<font color="#ffff80">IVAN: We found the butler.</font>

1009
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,045
<font color="#ffff80">He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.</font>

1010
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,380
<font color="#ffff80">Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow</font>

1011
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,965
<font color="#ffff80">at the observatory
on the summit.</font>

1012
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,468
<font color="#ffff80">Tell no one. He'll
explain everything.</font>

1013
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,762
<font color="#ffff80">Your train departs in
four and a half minutes.</font>

1014
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,388
<font color="#ffff80">Here's your tickets.</font>

1015
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:39,640
<font color="#ffff80">Third class?</font>

1016
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:40,808
<font color="#ffff80">It was overbooked</font>

1017
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:44,645
<font color="#ffff80">but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.</font>

1018
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,979
<font color="#ffff80">He pulled some strings.</font>

1019
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,273
<font color="#ffff80">You'll need these
for the dining car.</font>

1020
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,153
<font color="#ffff80">One last thing.</font>

1021
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:56,824
<font color="#ffff80">L'air de Panache.</font>

1022
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:01,495
<font color="#ffff80">They only had the half-ounce.</font>

1023
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,793
<font color="#ffff80">We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.</font>

1024
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,254
<font color="#ffff80">How much money you got? 42
Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.</font>

1025
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,464
<font color="#ffff80">Give me 25. Yes.</font>

1026
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,553
<font color="#ffff80">Bless you.</font>

1027
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:19,096
<font color="#ffff80">Please.</font>

1028
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,572
<font color="#ffff80">JOPLING: I've got
to hand it to him.</font>

1029
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:37,656
<font color="#ffff80">DMITRI ON PHONE: <i>Jesus</i> Christ.</font>

1030
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:41,577
<font color="#ffff80">JOPLING: I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?</font>

1031
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:47,040
<font color="#ffff80">DMITRI: <i>Talk to the club-footed sister
again, and, this time, be persuasive.</i></font>

1032
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,967
<font color="#ffff80">DMITRI: Goddamn son of a bitch.</font>

1033
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,534
<font color="#ffff80">Holy fuck!</font>

1034
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,750
<font color="#ffff80">What's the meaning of this shit?</font>

1035
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,543
<font color="#ffff80">Boy <i>with Apple?</i> I thought
you'd hidden it.</font>

1036
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:34,087
<font color="#ffff80">Why are you only noticing now? I
assumed it went to the tax appraiser.</font>

1037
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:36,006
<font color="#ffff80">Are you fucking kidding me?</font>

1038
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,091
<font color="#ffff80"><i>CLOTILDE: Excusez-moi.</i></font>

1039
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:41,386
<font color="#ffff80">I believe it was removed
by Monsieur Gustave.</font>

1040
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:50,395
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not angry with Serge.</font>

1041
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:53,065
<font color="#ffff80">You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.</font>

1042
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,234
<font color="#ffff80">He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.</font>

1043
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,444
<font color="#ffff80">It's not his fault, is it? I don't know.
It depends.</font>

1044
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,238
<font color="#ffff80">Well, you can say that
about most anything.</font>

1045
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,739
<font color="#ffff80">"It depends." Of
course it depends.</font>

1046
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:02,449
<font color="#ffff80">Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.</font>

1047
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,785
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.</font>

1048
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:08,455
<font color="#ffff80">That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.</font>

1049
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:15,254
<font color="#ffff80">May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?</font>

1050
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,463
<font color="#ffff80">With pleasure.</font>

1051
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,258
<font color="#ffff80">I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.</font>

1052
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,968
<font color="#ffff80">Flat as a board,
enormous birthmark</font>

1053
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:22,970
<font color="#ffff80">the shape of Mexico
over half her face,</font>

1054
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,305
<font color="#ffff80">sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen</font>

1055
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,890
<font color="#ffff80">while Mendl, genius
though he is,</font>

1056
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:28,642
<font color="#ffff80">looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.</font>

1057
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,061
<font color="#ffff80">Yet without question,
without fail,</font>

1058
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,481
<font color="#ffff80">always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.</font>

1059
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:35,983
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

1060
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,819
<font color="#ffff80">Because of her purity.</font>

1061
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:43,156
<font color="#ffff80">She admires you as well,
Monsieur Gustave.</font>

1062
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:44,658
<font color="#ffff80">Does she?</font>

1063
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,076
<font color="#ffff80">Very much.</font>

1064
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:50,080
<font color="#ffff80">That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."</font>

1065
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,291
<font color="#ffff80">That's important.</font>

1066
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,753
<font color="#ffff80">Don't flirt with her.</font>

1067
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,053
<font color="#ffff80">LIEUTENANT: A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.</font>

1068
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,889
<font color="#ffff80">The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.</font>

1069
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,974
<font color="#ffff80">However, the telegraph
office always keeps</font>

1070
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,809
<font color="#ffff80">a carbon of the ticker
tape for 24 hours.</font>

1071
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,228
<font color="#ffff80">I copied it down. It
reads as follows,</font>

1075
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,988

all my love full stop."</font>

1076
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:07,866
<font color="#ffff80">Where's the basket?</font>

1077
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,185
<font color="#ffff80">PUMP ATTENDANT: Where
you headed, mister?</font>

1078
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,233
<font color="#ffff80">Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?</font>

1079
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,911
<font color="#ffff80">Three Klubecks.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Yes. Those fuckers!</font>

1115
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:35,675
<font color="#ffff80">I tried to warn you

There's more.</font>

1121
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,645
