1
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>Was that in 1913 or 17?
I can't remember now.</i>

2
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:50,152
<i>I'm beginning to forget
all the people that I used to know, see?</i>

3
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,701
<i>Do I remember Louise Bryant?</i>

4
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,706
<i>Why, of course.
I couldn't forget her if I tried.</i>

5
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,463
I can't...

6
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,883
I might sort of scratch my memory,

7
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,968
but not at the moment.

8
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,389
You know, things go
and come back again.

9
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,060
It was Christopher Street,

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,021
and I was thinking about

11
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,316
another street down there instead,

12
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,861
until it came back
that it was Christopher Street.

13
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,906
Sometimes I have lapses like that.

14
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,160
I'd forgotten all about them.

15
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,162
Were they socialists?

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,582
I guess they must've been,

17
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,834
but I don't think they were
of any importance.

18
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,711
I don't remember them at all.

19
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,923
I know that Jack went around
with Mabel Dodge,

20
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,510
and then he went around
with another gal,

21
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,221
and then he went around
with Louise Bryant.

22
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,766
I know there were shifts back and forth,

23
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,394
but it never occurred to me...

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,106
It never impinged on
my own personal life.

25
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,524
I like baseball.

26
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,443
I don't know what
the outside world thought of them.

27
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,570
But they were a couple.

28
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,616
I mean, you always spoke of
Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

29
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,787
I recall his telling me
that he had two ambitions

30
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,372
when he came to college.

31
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,458
One was to be elected
president of his class.

32
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,336
He didn't know anyone in the class.
No one knew him.

33
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,756
The other was to make a million dollars

34
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,925
by the time he was 25.

35
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,805
Now, my idea about Jack Reed
is probably different from most.

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,601
But I knew him well.
I knew he was a man of strong views.

37
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,687
I knew he was independent.

38
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,857
And I have an idea,
I may be wrong of this,

39
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,151
that his wife was a Communist

40
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,655
and that his wife had influenced him,
as any wife does,

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,323
as you know and I know.

42
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,286
Louise Bryant?

43
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,206
Well, I thought she was something
of an exhibitionist.

44
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,668
No, I'm not gonna talk about people.
Don't fool yourself.

45
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,006
No, sir. I'm not... I'm not

46
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,800
a purveyor of neighbourhood gossip,
or anything of the kind.

47
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,051
That's not my job.

48
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
He was quiet.

49
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,515
He was a nice fellow.

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,353
I would say, if I met him,
I would say he was a nice fellow.

51
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,775
He was, however, a fighting fellow

52
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,777
in regards to principles.

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,239
I said, I think,
that a guy who's always interested

54
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,159
in the condition of the world
and changing it

55
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,495
either has no problems of his own

56
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,538
or refuses to face them.

57
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,958
Jack“.
Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy,

58
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,376
but some people did.

59
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,547
Jack Reed's life, short as it was,

60
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,008
<i>happened at a time,</i>

61
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,678
<i>and all of us, after all,
are the victims of our time and place,</i>

62
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>when he had the opportunity,
as a reporter,</i>

63
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,186
<i>to be in some very exciting
and dramatic places.</i>

64
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,023
<i>It isn't everybody can
be buried in the Kremlin,</i>

65
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,151
and he's the only American.

66
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,779
Born in Portland, Oregon.

67
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,907
Now, isn't that something?

68
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,284
- What's he hugging?
- A statue.

69
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,329
Well, I can see that.
But what's it a statue of?

70
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,997
It's just a statue, Mr Woodward.

71
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,375
- How much is it?
- It's $75.

72
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,377
- For a photograph?
- That's right, Mrs Rudisile.

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,087
This is interesting, Mrs Trullinger.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,798
Not that it isn't very nice,
but it isn't a painting.

75
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,092
Mr Woodward,
I'd like you to look at this.

76
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,261
- I think I see the intention here.
- Yes.

77
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,179
Eve dominates, you see?

78
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,265
The dream dominates the dreamer.

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,766
It's...

80
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,604
It looks blurry to me.

81
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,940
The other one looked blurry, too.

82
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,360
I think that's the intention
of the photographer, Mr Woodward.

83
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,820
What? To be blurry?

84
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,030
But perhaps if you looked at it
from a different point of view...

85
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,282
Louise!

86
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,784
This is you?

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,625
Lovely figure.

88
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,636
Louise, have you taken
leave of your senses?

89
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,471
Don't be a fool, Paul.

90
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,432
You think I'm a fool
because I object to my wife

91
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,642
being displayed naked in front
of half the people I know...

92
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,603
Yes. My God,
it's a work of art in a gallery.

93
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,770
What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,981
You used to call Portland
a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.

95
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,149
It may be stuffy and provincial,

96
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,276
but it also happens
to be a coffin where I earn a living.

97
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,944
You can take your living
and fill up teeth with it,

98
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,362
because I can earn my own living.

99
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,572
I have my work.

100
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,117
You consider a few articles in
The Oregonian and The <i>Gazette</i> work?

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,744
No, I'll tell you
what your work is, Louise.

102
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
It's making yourself
the centre of attention.

103
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,124
It's shocking Louise Trullinger,
emancipated woman of Portland.

104
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,668
Now, we're gonna say good night
to these people and go home.

105
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,087
- I'm going to the Liberal Club.
- You're not going to the Liberal Club.

106
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,881
- I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul.
- No, you're not...

107
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,344
It's very nice, Mrs Trullinger. All of it.

108
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,221
It's very gratifying to hear,
isn't it, Louise?

109
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,765
Isn't it, Louise?

110
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,271
Of course, you know
who is going to be at the Liberal Club.

111
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,066
Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,986
And unless we are willing to take arms
to defend our heritage,

113
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,406
we cannot call ourselves
patriotic Americans!

114
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,868
I'm proud to be free.

115
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,912
I'm proud to be an American.

116
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,831
And if the man
we elected President decides

117
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,708
that our freedoms are being threatened

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,795
and that the world must
be made safe for democracy,

119
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,383
then I know I won't be alone
in heeding the call of patriotism!

120
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,718
What is this war about?

121
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,471
Each man will have his own answer.

122
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,225
I have mine. I'm ready to be called!

123
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,735
Now, tonight we have with us

124
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,823
the son of Margaret
and the late C.J. Reed of Portland,

125
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,742
who has witnessed this war first-hand.

126
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,204
And I, for one, see no reason
why we here at the Liberal Club

127
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,082
shouldn't listen to what
Jack Reed has to say.

128
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,383
What would you say
this war is about, Jack Reed?

129
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,894
Profits.

130
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,939
What did he say?

131
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,280
Excuse me, Mr Reed.
Hello, my name is Louise Bryant

132
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
and I am a journalist.

133
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,908
And I was wondering if you might
have time to give me an interview.

134
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,201
I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.

135
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,746
I had a piece in the <i>Blast</i> not long ago.

136
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,623
- Berkman's <i>Blast?</i> Really?
- That's right.

137
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,671
Well, when did you want
to do this interview?

138
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,839
Now.

139
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,049
I don't live here.

140
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,176
- I live in a house by the river.
- Oh, really.

141
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,053
My, my, my. Two places.

142
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,932
Yeah, I use this place as a studio.

143
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,977
Do you like white lilies?

144
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,438
They're my favourite flowers.

145
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,443
- You're not married, are you?
- No, I don't think I believe in marriage.

146
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,652
- Are you married?
- Marriage?

147
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,237
How could anyone believe in marriage?

148
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,616
I bet your mother's glad
to see you back in Portland.

149
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,202
Mother's glad when I'm not in jail.
Is this you?

150
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,079
Yes. Do you like it?

151
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,248
Yeah. I think they're...

152
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,920
- A little blurry, but this one's very nice.
- Yes.

153
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,171
It is. Now...

154
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,383
Granted, the profit motive
in the world economy

155
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,469
is a basic root cause for the war.

156
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,888
Do you feel that those
Americans who are pro-war

157
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,600
and who ascribe their motives
to patriotism are cynical or naive?

158
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,103
And, if they're cynical,
is it the cynicism of patriots

159
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,896
who feel that without a profit motive,

160
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,732
the power structure elite of this country
will not enter the war,

161
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,234
even though they feel
that the containment

162
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,486
of German militarism
may be necessary for...

163
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,738
All right, Miss Bryant, do you want
an interview? Write this down.

164
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,906
Are you naive enough to think

165
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,367
containing German militarism
has anything to do with this war?

166
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,911
Don't you understand that England
and France own the world economy

167
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,412
and Germany just wants a piece of it?

168
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,539
Keep writing, Miss Bryant.

169
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,874
Miss Bryant, can't you grasp
that J.P. Morgan

170
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,043
has loaned England and France
a billion dollars?

171
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,129
And if Germany wins,
he won't get it back.

172
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,880
More coffee?
America would be entering the war

173
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,173
to protect J.P. Morgan's money.

174
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,466
If he loses it, we'll have a depression.

175
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,717
So, the real question is,

176
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,886
why do we have an economy
where the poor have to pay

177
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,304
so the rich won't lose money?

178
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,806
All right, now, what haven't we covered?

179
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,475
Economic freedom for women
means sexual freedom,

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,394
and sexual freedom
means birth control...

181
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,187
<i>Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.</i>

182
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,564
...we have a predominantly

183
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,815
upper-middle class readership.

184
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,526
So, we have to run around the country
raising money for the magazine

185
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,986
any way we...

186
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,241
What?

187
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,911
Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...

188
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,330
That I ought to offer you more coffee.

189
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,167
I hadn't realised the hour, but

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,003
I seem to have taken up
a lot of your time.

191
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,921
Well, that's okay by me.

192
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,342
Does this happen to you often?

193
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,845
Not often enough.

194
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,347
Well?

195
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,185
We certainly have come a long way fast.

196
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,394
Yeah.

197
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,856
Do you want to take it a step further?

198
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah.

199
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,695
What would you think if I asked you
to do something

200
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,864
that might seem a little selfish?

201
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, I... I think you should.

202
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,869
Good. Good, because I'd like you
to take a look at my work

203
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,370
and tell me what you think.

204
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,831
You see, I really respect
your opinion so much.

205
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,542
Well, it's odd,
because I was just gonna ask you

206
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,710
if you had anything
I could take a look at.

207
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,129
I know it's an imposition
but I'd be very grateful and you see,

208
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,256
I've read everything
that you've ever written.

209
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,133
Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...

210
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,635
Well, thank you.

211
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,846
Well, then I... I'll get your coat.

212
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,766
Oh, and I hope you won't
be gentle with me.

213
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,351
- Gentle?
- I'm a serious writer.

214
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,518
You can really be tough.

215
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,312
NO, I will be. NO, I will be.

216
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,108
- Do you want me to leave?
- Not really, but I'm late.

218
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,320
- Late at 6:00 in the morning?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

219
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,405
Well, could I see you tomorrow night?

220
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,657
I'm busy tomorrow night.

221
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,159
- Because I'm leaving town the next day.
- Gee, I'm sorry.

222
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,827
So, if you have time,
let me know what you think,

223
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,163
and I'll send you a copy of the interview.

224
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,082
Some interview, huh?

225
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,126
Take a look sometime.

226
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,673
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.

227
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,007
- Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,852
Jack,dean
do you remember Mr Hardison?

229
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,855
Used to be at the First Presbyterian
Church, up the hill.

230
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,150
He's in Seattle now
at the big Plymouth church.

231
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,199
What brings you out here, Jack?

232
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,785
Just come out to see your mother?

233
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,958
Mr Partlow, I just... I'm raising money
for this magazine that I write for.

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,210
- What?
- I say, I'm raising money

235
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,296
for this magazine that I write for!

236
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,964
- Magazine? What magazine?
- Yes, sir.

237
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,299
Well, it's called The <i>Masses.</i>

238
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,134
<i>- The what?
- The Masses!</i>

239
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,719
<i>- The Masses.
- Masses.</i>

240
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,055
Jack, do you remember
Mr Patterson's sister?

241
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,473
The one with the bad arm?

242
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,059
- Is that religious?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.

243
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,145
Oh, you remember her, Jack.
Her name was Miriam.

244
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,313
She didn't eat meat.

245
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,981
Sounds religious.

246
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,150
You remember the fellow
that was courting her?

247
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,653
Sold spool thread.
Came from down around Eugene.

248
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,989
- Not religious, huh?
- No, sir.

249
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,409
- What was his name, Jack?
- I don't think I remember the name.

250
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,412
Well, I don't know about you people,
but I'm starved.

251
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,997
I don't know, Mrs Partlow. I...

252
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,416
Jack, I heard you made a few people
a little unhappy

253
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,834
down at the Liberal Club last night.

254
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,003
Oh, Carl,
we're here to have a good time,

255
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,838
let's not go into that.

256
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,673
What was his name, Jack?

257
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,925
- Here you are!
- I can't...

258
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,510
Welcome. So happy...

259
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,179
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello.

260
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,056
Oh, you look wonderful.

261
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,104
Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.

262
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,025
Alma Boyle.
This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.

263
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,694
Jack, Louise is quite a progressive
in her own right.

264
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,862
Mr Partlow.

265
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,740
- How do you do, Mr Reed?
- How do you do?

266
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,452
Oh, Mr Partlow, Mrs Partlow,
this is Louise Trullinger.

267
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,287
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

268
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,623
Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?

269
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,459
Yes. Yes, I am.

270
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,461
Well, isn't that something?

271
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,463
He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.

272
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,217
Oh, Mrs Trullinger, your husband's
the finest dentist in all of Portland.

273
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,386
- Thank you very much.
- Really?

274
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,638
And I think he did a plate
for Uncle Grover.

275
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,057
Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha.
I could eat a horse.

276
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,225
All right, let's go in.

277
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
What a shame Paul
couldn't come tonight.

278
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,061
- An emergency?
- Yes...

279
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,229
Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.

280
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,981
- No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new.
- Oh, well...

281
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,485
Did free love start
in Greenwich Village?

282
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,238
Very good wine, Carl.

283
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,242
- More, Jack?
- No, no. No, thank you.

284
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,994
It's just delicious, really.

285
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,288
Don't you think so, Mrs Trullinger?

286
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,416
Yes, it's just delicious.

287
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,667
Thank you, Louise.

288
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,836
- Dupont, I think.
- Dupont.

289
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,338
It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?

290
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,758
Mother doesn't want you to get Jack
started on the subject of marriage.

291
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,177
You got any children, Mrs Trullinger?

292
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,929
Not yet, Mr Reed.

293
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,848
- Call me Jack.
- I've been married 14 years now.

294
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,600
Don't get me in any arguments
about free love.

295
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,935
It's getting cold outside.

296
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,603
I'll just call you Louise.

297
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,356
George Waldorf.
That's it! George Waldorf!

298
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,858
Used to sell spool thread.

299
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,361
- What about George Waldorf?
- Well, he died.

300
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,698
I couldn't think of letting
you walk unescorted, Louise.

301
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,949
Tell me something.

302
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,536
Does Dr Trullinger mind your
spending so much time at your studio?

303
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,372
People have to give each other
a little freedom.

304
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,499
Freedom, Mrs Trullinger?

305
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,294
I'd like to know
what your idea of freedom is.

306
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,838
Having your own studio? Walk...

307
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,389
I'd like to see you
with your pants off, Mr Reed.

308
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,416
<i>Marching and shuffling along</i>

309
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,600
I didn't realise the time.

310
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,770
So, if you like, there's some
very nice damson preserves.

311
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,272
And you can make toast out of that,
if you want.

312
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,525
So, bye.

313
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,776
Where you going?

314
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,110
Where you going?

315
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,947
If you're catching the 2:45, I mean,
you don't really have that much time.

316
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,366
- I'm sure you're gonna want to pack...
- Louise, it's 8:45, only.

317
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,534
It's 8245.

318
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,452
Listen, I realise
that you're very busy in New York,

319
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,037
but I'd be grateful
if you could take the time

320
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,789
to write a few words to me
about my work.

321
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

322
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,626
If you'll just send my portfolio back.
You can mail it to this address...

323
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,379
Louise, wait a minute. What are you
just walking out like that for?

324
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,965
Will you come upstairs, please,
and just talk to me for a minute?

325
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,969
Thank you.

326
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,471
- Listen...
- What is it?

327
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,225
Why don't you come?

328
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,643
- What?
- Come to New York.

329
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,478
You wanna write?
Come where the writers are.

330
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,981
If you wanna have freedom you gotta go
where the freedom is, don't you?

331
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,899
You're gonna go to waste in Portland.
Come to New York.

332
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,651
- You ought to be in New York.
- Thank you very much.

333
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,902
I'll remember that.

334
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,071
- What?
- I'll remember your advice.

335
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,324
Please come with me.

336
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,326
All right, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

337
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,495
You want me
to come with you to New York.

338
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,913
Yeah.

339
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,832
What as? What as?

340
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,584
- What do you mean, what...
- What as?

341
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,169
- Your girlfriend?
- What does that mean?

342
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,504
What as? Your girlfriend,

343
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,674
your mistress, your paramour,
your concubine?

344
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,509
Why does it have to be as anything?

345
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,344
Because I don't wanna
get into some kind

346
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,806
of emotional possessive involvement
where I'm not able to...

347
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,101
I want to know what as.

348
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,521
Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving.
Why don't you come as a turkey?

349
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,611
I always thought she was
a very earnest girl who went away.

350
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:36,157
Probably the dentist knew nothing
except about teeth,

351
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,368
and was mainly interested...

352
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,705
And then she had
this wonderful journalist

353
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,124
who could talk about all sorts of things.

354
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,294
I had a coat I brought from Germany.

355
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,630
And she wanted that coat

356
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,717
and made me all kinds of propositions.

357
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,677
But I wanted it, too.

358
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,514
But finally I gave in and gave it to her.

359
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,892
I had other coats.

360
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:09,231
So that's how she operated.

361
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,571
<i>She went after him.
As I say, she got him.</i>

362
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>So she wasn't any dummy.</i>

363
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,537
<i>But it was something to happen
in little old Portland.</i>

364
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,581
<i>You didn't hear the word "sex."</i>

365
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,583
You didn't hear the word "lesbian."

366
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,919
You didn't hear the word "homosexual."

367
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,005
You didn't hear the word "abortion."

368
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,423
You didn't hear those things.

369
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,258
<i>Men respected women.</i>

370
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>They helped them on with their coats,
they opened the doors for them.</i>

371
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>And the man and woman
who courted each other,</i>

372
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,432
<i>they married each other.</i>

373
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,768
<i>You know something that I think,</i>

374
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,773
that there was just as much
fucking going on then as now.

375
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,027
Only now,
it has a more perverted quality.

376
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,447
Now there's no love whatever included.

377
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,701
<i>Then, there was your heart,
a bit of heart in it.</i>

378
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>Greenwich Village was there,</i>

379
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,955
<i>and New York was around it.</i>

380
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,959
<i>And the rest of New York did not act
the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.</i>

381
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,461
<i>It was sort of a centre of dissent</i>

382
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,757
<i>and had been for a long time
in American life.</i>

383
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,427
<i>People from all over
the country came there.</i>

384
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,140
<i>It was regarded as bohemian.
Their ways of life were irregular.</i>

385
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,475
<i>The way they dressed</i>

386
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>and certainly the way they thought</i>

387
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,063
<i>was outside the mainstream
of American life.</i>

388
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,732
<i>And as I recollect it,</i>

389
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,735
<i>marriage was not important
in Greenwich Village.</i>

390
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,321
<i>I remember hearing a line
Jack said to somebody</i>

391
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,407
<i>he was trying to lure into bed.</i>

392
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,828
<i>She was being very coy, and he said,
"Aren't you pagan enough?"</i>

393
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,997
Hello?

394
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,175
Hello, Jack?

395
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,220
If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets
on birth control,

396
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,638
I'm proud to be a criminal.

397
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,891
No one is arguing with your
inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.

398
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,143
All I'm saying
is that this is not the right time

399
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,394
to go to jail for birth control.

400
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,647
Oh, there's a right time
to go to jail for birth control?

401
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,899
<i>The Masses is governing
conscience now?</i>

402
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,235
<i>Soon you'll be indistinguishable
from The New York Times.</i>

403
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,904
Emma, all I'm saying
is that you are too valuable

404
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,656
-to the anti-war movement.
- You're wrong.

405
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,326
- No, he's right. If we get into this war...
- And you're wrong.

406
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,496
- Will you let me finish my sentence?
- Your sentence is not worth finishing.

407
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,249
Thousands of American women,
overworked, underfed,

408
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:17,419
are dying, giving birth to anaemic
children who can't last out a year.

409
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,339
Are their lives any less valuable
than thousands of American boys'?

410
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,092
- I want those back Tuesday.
- I'm not saying... Do you think...

411
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,261
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.

412
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,512
Good night.

413
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,597
- You want some coffee?
- Chase and Sanborn?

414
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,351
- I'm out of coffee.
- Again? I'm leaving.

415
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,021
No, the conversation is over.
You're a journalist, Jack.

416
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,274
When you're a revolutionary,
we'll discuss priorities.

417
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,608
Hopefully over coffee.

418
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,945
- It's late, I'll walk you home.
- Why? I won't hurt anybody.

419
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,954
Well...

420
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,540
Yeah.

421
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,709
It's Friday night.

422
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm so glad to see you.

423
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,796
Really, I'm so glad to see you.

424
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,135
I finished your articles.
They're very good.

425
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,555
The railroad piece, I think, is...
Needs polishing.

426
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,891
- It's repetitious, but...
- But that's deliberate.

427
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm using repetition to make a point.

428
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,810
I don't want it to seem too polished.

429
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,979
Oh.

430
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,648
Well, I think
you're gonna love New York.

431
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,984
Emma, Emma, Emma.

432
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,986
I think it was Emma Goldberg.

433
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,237
<i>I think so.</i>

434
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,989
<i>I never forgot Emma Goldman.</i>

435
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,992
<i>She inspired me to the very depths.</i>

436
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,995
<i>And Max Eastman was a beloved man.</i>

437
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,998
<i>The real radical, a free spirit.</i>

438
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,835
He was in that same group
with that Emma Goldman.

439
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,339
That was her name.
Goldman, not Goldberg.

440
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,090
<i>Floyd Dell was one of them.</i>

441
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,343
<i>He wrote novels, beautiful novels.</i>

442
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,180
<i>The radicals included people
like the IWWs</i>

443
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,848
<i>and Bill Haywood.</i>

444
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,100
<i>And there were Walter Lippmann,</i>

445
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,103
<i>and Lincoln Steffens
and Isadora Duncan</i>

446
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,105
<i>and Edna St Vincent Millay.</i>

447
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,857
<i>Alfred Stieglitz...</i>

448
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,609
<i>Oh, and Margaret Sanger.</i>

449
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,028
<i>My Lord, I picketed for her.</i>

450
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,697
<i>And, of course,
the great writer Eugene O'Neill</i>

451
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,032
<i>came from down there.</i>

452
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,535
<i>I don't think there's anybody
who can touch O'Neill today.</i>

453
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,207
<i>You have to be a bit of a rebel
to be an artist of any kind, I believe.</i>

454
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,543
<i>And everybody in Greenwich Village
was a bit of a rebel.</i>

455
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,221
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

456
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,556
Good for you.
Could you pass the bread, please?

457
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,891
- Thanks.
- Because to the middle-class American,

458
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,060
everyone on the left is the same.
An anarchist, a socialist...

459
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,404
Would you pass the bread, please?

460
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,906
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

461
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,700
<i>Good. Madame Schumann-Hank...</i>

462
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,495
Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant.
What do you write about?

463
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,998
Everything.

464
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,417
You write about everything?

465
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,504
Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...

466
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,840
Just...

467
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:10,884
I see.

468
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,431
Now, about Davis and Sloan,
have they quit?

469
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,598
Not yet, but they...

470
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,860
I don't think they should sit here
like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.

471
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,029
- It's just...
- Organisation, right?

472
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,114
Look, what does a capitalist do?

473
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,199
Let me ask you that, Mike.
Huh? Tell me.

474
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,868
I mean, what does he make,
besides money?

475
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,537
I don't know what he makes.
The workers do all the work, don't they?

476
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,039
Well, what if they got organised?

477
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,041
I mean, all the workers.
Not just the plumbers,

478
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,209
and the carpenters
and the goddamn cigar makers.

479
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,627
But all of them, all over the world?

480
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,297
Not in just one country.
Give him a beer, will you?

481
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,798
What if they all got organised?

482
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,384
Don't you think they could...
They could change society overnight.

483
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,635
They can make it into
anything they wanted.

484
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,221
Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.

485
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,641
Well, don't ask this pretentious
son of a bitch for money.

486
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,478
If you need $5, I'll give it to you.

487
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,398
Let me have $4.50, will you?

488
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,317
- What isn't fair...?
- You see what I'm saying?

489
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,153
If all the workers in the world
belonged to one big union,

490
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,238
-there wouldn't be a war, would there?
- Are you listening to me?

491
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,740
Miss Bryant.

492
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,743
You've been nursing
that beer for an hour.

493
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,411
Can I get you a glass of wine
or something?

494
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,497
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Thank you, anyway.

495
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,249
- Beer's fine.
- You are an amiable person.

496
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,168
And a very good painter, I hear.

497
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,504
I write.

498
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,099
Read Jung!

499
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,768
"Read Freud, read Jung."
Read Engels, read Marx!

500
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,938
My God, you can't interpret Freud
in an economic context.

501
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,856
You know you got a taxi waiting?

502
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,025
Zosima represents
the corruption of religion.

503
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,276
I tell you you're wrong.

504
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,488
- And Jung is a mystic...
- But do you seriously believe...

505
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,285
- How long are they going to stay?
- I don't know. They'll get out in a while.

506
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,372
- I'll only be gone for a day.
- You just got back from Boston.

507
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,873
Hey, why don't you come
with me to Baltimore?

508
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,209
Really? What am I supposed
to come to Baltimore as?

509
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,627
What as?

510
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,046
Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.

511
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,715
Taxi's waiting, Jack.

512
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,051
See you tomorrow.

513
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,228
We've been trying for two years.

514
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,648
Capitalists can take this country into
war any time they damn well please.

515
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,900
The only impact you can make
is in the streets.

516
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:32,985
Of course, but...

517
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,070
But don't you think, Emma,

518
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,907
that if Debs gets a lot of votes,
it'll strengthen that image?

519
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,827
No, I don't. I think voting is the opium
of the masses in this country.

520
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,829
Every four years, you deaden the pain.

521
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,080
Yeah, but...

522
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't you think...

523
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,086
I just made it very clear
what I think, Miss Bryant.

524
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,422
Come on, E.G.
Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.

525
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,508
- Louise has a point. She says...
- Suddenly I'm dogmatic.

526
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,511
Why does my status change
every time you get a new woman, Jack?

527
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,764
Bernie, could I have the red wine?
Louise, would you like a glass?

528
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,850
She's just... She's upset with me.

529
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,769
It's got nothing to do with you.
Nothing to do with you.

530
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,564
Thank you. It's a great comfort.

531
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,442
The house is completely filled
with people when you're gone.

532
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,360
They use it as if it was
a meeting hall or something.

533
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,696
- I can't get any work done.
- Just throw them out.

534
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,448
- How am I supposed to throw them out?
- Just kick them out.

535
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,616
Tell them to leave.

536
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,201
I'm not going to
say to Max Eastman, "Leave."

537
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,702
- Just throw them out.
- Jack?

538
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,538
Jack, is that you?
Jack, it's very good to see you.

539
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,124
- Hello, Horace. How are you?
- Very good to see you.

540
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,212
- You know Louise Bryant?
- Yes, hello. How are you?

541
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,380
- Very nice to see you.
- How do you do?

542
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,548
Great pleasure.

543
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,550
- Hi, Max. How are you?
- Divine, Horace.

544
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,552
- And Floyd, good to see you.
- Hello, Horace.

545
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,638
Still getting arrested, Jack?

546
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,889
I try.

547
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,059
How about you, Miss Bryant?

548
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,228
Are you trying to get arrested, too?

549
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,812
No, not really.

550
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,817
- What do you do, Miss Bryant?
- I write.

551
00:28:56,318 --> 00:29:00,447
You write? Now, may I ask,
what are you working on?

552
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,576
It's impossible to describe.

553
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,078
It's impossible to describe?

554
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,162
She just did a hell of a piece

555
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,498
on the influence of the Armory Show
and you ought to read it.

556
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,833
Well, you know,
I very much would like to read that.

557
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,795
<i>Why don't you give me</i> a call
<i>at The Metropolitan?</i>

558
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,839
In fact, even better,
why don't we have a drink on Thursday?

559
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,592
- Fine.
- We can talk about the Armory Show.

560
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,927
- It's a date, then.
- Well, all right.

561
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,512
That's wonderful. Fine.

562
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,846
Jack!

563
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,269
Now, you stay out
of the slammer, now, okay?

564
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,274
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
It's nice to see you.

565
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,111
- Jack, please don't do that.
- What?

566
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,363
He's the editor of Metropolitan.
I've known him for years.

567
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,449
- Jack, I can speak for myself.
- So can your work.

568
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,034
- I don't want you to do that...
- Taxi's waiting, Jack.

569
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,036
Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.

570
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,875
Jack“.

571
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,629
I'll see you at the end
of the week, okay?

572
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,215
- Okay?
- Wait. Wait.

573
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,718
Maybe I will call him about Thursday.

574
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,470
Yeah, call him about Thursday.
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,222
- See you, boys.
- Bye-bye, Jack.

576
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,182
- Bye-bye, Jack.
- See you.

577
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,560
See you, Jack.

578
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,860
"The railroads opening new frontiers,

579
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,988
"and crisscrossing it all
are the railroads.

580
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,365
"The railroads opening new frontiers,

581
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,743
"and in turn, these frontiers...

582
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,287
"And in turn, these frontiers..."

583
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,580
Oh, God.

584
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,209
It is repetitious.

585
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,007
We're not human beings,
we're a commodity.

586
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,717
- And how many days a week?
- Seven days.

587
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,968
- Every day?
- They said,

588
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,305
"if you don't come to work on Sunday,
don't come on Monday."

589
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,390
- What do you make an hour?
-20 cents.

590
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,185
How many times have they
slammed the door on your face

591
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,771
because the labour you do
is called unskilled?

592
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:56,980
That's right, Bill.

593
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,399
Well, the lWW's not gonna
turn you down

594
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,234
-because you're unskilled.
- Listen to him, George.

595
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,113
Or skilled. Or black or white or yellow.

596
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,490
Seven days a week.

597
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,533
- What do you make an hour?
-10 cents an hour.

598
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,910
One big union.

599
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,997
- All workers belong...
- Listen, read that. That's important.

600
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,292
I'm looking for a lathe worker
named Pasquale Alberti.

601
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,379
He had an industrial accident. He got
his leg crushed. Do you know him?

602
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,047
Yeah, sure, Harvard.

603
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
Is that what they wanna read about
in Greenwich Village now,

604
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,842
industrial accidents?

605
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,514
And for that, we need power.

606
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,475
And there's only one way to get power.

607
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,060
Organise!

608
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,521
All the workers together!

609
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,314
One big union!

610
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:44,111
And the war the IWW
wants you to get into is class war!

611
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,946
Not a war in Europe!

612
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,198
War against the capitalists!

613
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,700
You'll never get anything or anywhere,

614
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,621
until the whole working class
belongs to one big...

615
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,915
All right, gentlemen,

616
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,668
you've got 20 seconds
to vacate the premises.

617
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,261
May I ask on what authority?

618
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,971
On my authority.

619
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,014
This is an illegal assembly.

620
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,642
Excuse me, Officer. These men
have the legal right to assemble.

621
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,935
That's all they're doing.

622
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,687
We know what the hell they doing.

623
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,689
- What the hell you doing?
- Me?

624
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,857
You.

625
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,483
- I write.
- You write?

626
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,569
You wrong.

627
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,907
Get him out of here!

628
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,330
Here they are.

629
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,665
The folio. The oeuvre.

630
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,170
Well...

631
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,589
How is Jack?

632
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,134
I do hope he's being more careful
about what he's writing these days.

633
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,219
I'd hate to see him not able
to get into print.

634
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,054
Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.

635
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,934
Did you tell him
where we were having drinks?

636
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,936
No, I will. He's out of town.

637
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,440
Mr Whigham, excuse me, but
the Armory Show piece is on the top.

638
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,484
Oh, this is the Armory...

639
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,570
- Yes.
- Yes. Of course. Here it is.

640
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,745
Well...

641
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,789
I really ought to spend
more time on this.

642
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,374
Oh, yes, of course.

643
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,084
What about dinner?

644
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,421
- Dinner?
- Jack wouldn't mind.

645
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,425
- Why would he mind?
- Well, we're all grownups, of course,

646
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
but Jack's rather...

647
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,888
He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?

648
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,223
And I've never really known how...

649
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,599
Mr Whigham, are you saying you need

650
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,935
Jack's permission
to make a pass at me?

651
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,105
What are you getting so upset about?

652
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,941
For Christ's sake,
I made two little tiny changes...

653
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,526
Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.

654
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,694
What the hell's the matter
with you, Jack?

655
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,905
The lWW's a bunch of Reds.

656
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,114
Come on.

657
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,659
We got Reds in the IWW,
got Reds in the Village.

658
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,494
We've got nothing
but Reds around here.

659
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,497
For Christ's sake,
you're the best goddamn writer around.

660
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,249
Now, what the hell
you wanna waste your time

661
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,459
with a lot of Red propaganda
nobody's ever gonna print?

662
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,503
It's the truth.
Does that mean anything around here?

663
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,129
Well, who the hell's to say
what the truth is?

664
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,131
A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?

665
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,133
You're not being fair to the AF of I.

666
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,053
- Now, give me the goddamn article...
- You're gonna rewrite what I write.

667
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,264
I'm just gonna take it
to a magazine that won't.

668
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,974
Well, fine. Take it to The <i>Masses.</i>

669
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,392
- They're a bunch of Reds.
- Thank you.

670
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,602
- Who's gonna pay your rent?
- Rent's easy, Pete.

671
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,564
You just don't rewrite what I write.
You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.

672
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,525
You stubborn son of a bitch.
Who's gonna pay your rent?

673
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,001
Louise?

674
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,895
I got every one in the shop.

675
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,565
We're broke, but we've got them all.

676
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,862
Thanks.

677
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,826
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

678
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,704
- What is it?
- It's nothing. How'd it go?

679
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,581
A lot better than we thought it would.

680
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,500
- You see Whig ham?
- Yesterday.

681
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,545
- How was that?
- We mostly talked about you, of course.

682
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,088
Did he offer you work?

683
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,923
No, but he made a big point
of telling me

684
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,635
what wonderful friends
you and he have become over the years.

685
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,678
It was a fascinating meeting.

686
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,098
Are you angry at Whigham or me?

687
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,769
What is it?

688
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,979
It's nothing.
You said you'd be back Tuesday

689
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,356
and it's Saturday.

690
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,358
Didn't I say I'd back
at the end of the week?

691
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,777
- The end of the week is Friday.
- The end of the week is Friday?

692
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,278
Saturday's not the
end of the week any more, huh?

693
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,780
Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!

694
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,947
What difference does it make?

695
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,157
What do you think I've been doing?

696
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,117
Running around listening
to the sound of my own voice?

697
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,203
How do I know whose voice
you've been listening to?

698
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,872
Obviously you like it
a lot better than mine!

699
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,426
Look at me. Oh, God!

700
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,804
I'm like a wife.

701
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm like a boring, clinging,
miserable little wife.

702
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,272
- Who'd wanna come home to me?
- Me!

703
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,650
Well, I can't do this!
I can't do this any more!

704
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,235
You can't do what?

705
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,029
I'm just living in your margins.

706
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,699
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what my purpose is.

707
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,910
- Well, tell me what you want.
- I want to stop needing you!

708
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,078
I want you to know something.

709
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,622
I asked Whigham
if he'd send me to France.

710
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,585
- Is that what you want?
- That's what I want.

711
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,008
- What are you doing, Louise?
- I can't work around you.

712
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,218
Will you tell me why you're doing this?

713
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,053
I'm not taken seriously
when you're around.

714
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,471
When I'm around
you're not taken seriously?

715
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,723
Oh, God, this is not good.

716
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,141
You mean
you think I'm taken more seriously?

717
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,308
Is that what you're talking about?

718
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,060
Do you mean you're not?
Come on, Jack.

719
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,229
You know what I'm saying.
You're not being honest with me.

720
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,397
I don't know what you're saying.

721
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,983
You're not being honest with me.
Please, be honest with me.

722
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,151
I am so being honest with you.

723
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,028
Maybe if you took yourself a little more
seriously, other people would, too.

724
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,530
I told you what I thought
about the Armory piece.

725
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,781
I was honest about that.

726
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,409
I think it's very nice,
but no, I don't take it very seriously.

727
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,577
- Thank you.
- Why do you even expect

728
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,747
to be taken seriously if you're
not writing about serious things?

729
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,081
I don't understand that.

730
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,292
I found myself an apartment.
I'm looking for one.

731
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,461
I'm not even sure I know
what things you're serious about.

732
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,837
One day you're writing
about the railroads,

733
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,130
and you don't even finish the piece.

734
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,174
The next day you're doing a piece
on an art exhibition

735
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,717
that happened three years ago.

736
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,594
Look, why do you give me
anything to read, anyway?

737
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,138
If I criticise it at all,
you tell me you like it the way it is.

738
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,639
And when we're out with other people,

739
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,475
if somebody doesn't ask you
a direct question,

740
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,934
you tell me you feel ignored.

741
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,061
But with everything
that's happening in the world today,

742
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,813
you decide to sit down and write a piece

743
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:57,650
on the influence of the goddamned
Armory Show of 1913!

744
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,402
Are people supposed
to take that seriously?

745
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,737
Well, I don't really care!

746
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,197
- You care!
- I'm not really... I don't care!

747
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,865
- You care!
- I don't care!

748
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,035
And I'm not interested
in whether your stupid friends

749
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,329
-take me seriously or not!
- Well, they don't take it seriously.

750
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,622
That's why they don't take it seriously.

751
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,832
I found an apartment on Houston Street,
and I'm moving in.

752
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,460
And I'll tell you something else,
Jack Reed.

753
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,879
I don't think we like the same people
or the same kind of life.

754
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,006
- And I wanna be on my own.
- Go ahead, be on your own!

755
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,674
I don't give a damn!
You're on your own anyway.

756
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,343
Oh! I know you don't give a damn!

757
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,094
Well, will you tell me
why the hell I should give a damn?

758
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,471
You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!

759
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,098
- I don't give a damn, either!
- That's right! I don't give a damn!

760
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,560
- I'm getting out of here!
- Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!

761
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,278
Honey, can we just
get out of New York?

762
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,656
Let's go somewhere
and just write what we wanna write.

763
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:05,653
Provincetown was
just a tiny little fishing village.

764
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,657
<i>And it was very, very conservative.</i>

765
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,620
<i>We'd take the Fall River steamer
up there, I remember, every summer.</i>

766
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,289
<i>We used to save fares
by sleeping in tiers.</i>

767
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,291
<i>And we always got bedbugs.</i>

768
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,335
<i>You did whatever you pleased up there.</i>

769
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,922
<i>And we put on some very
interesting plays, experimental plays</i>

770
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,466
<i>that a commercial theatre
couldn't possibly do.</i>

771
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,385
<i>Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.</i>

772
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,054
<i>There's a whole play</i>

773
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,557
<i>without the protagonist
even appearing on the stage.</i>

774
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,143
<i>And they gave three one-act plays.</i>

775
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,312
<i>One of them was a play by...</i>

776
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,982
<i>I always thought it was by John Reed
and Louise Bryant.</i>

777
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,901
<i>But I see it's by her.</i>

778
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,069
<i>They were in it.</i>

779
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,988
<i>The play was terrible,
and they were worse.</i>

780
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,533
<i>And of course, Gene O'Neill
was known as the poet,</i>

781
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,870
<i>but I liked his plays
better than his poetry.</i>

782
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,580
Will you never understand?

783
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,249
Are you so stupid
that you do not know what I mean?

784
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,043
I am offering myself to you.

785
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,087
I am kneeling before you.

786
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,422
I have promised you my body,

787
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,758
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

788
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,595
I have promised to love you,
a negro sailor!

789
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,766
Tell them not to stand behind the moon.

790
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,018
Don't stand behind the moon.

791
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,937
- Back?
- Can you step back a little bit?

792
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,689
'Cause of the moon.

793
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,399
This is the moon here.

794
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,900
- This way?
- Yes.

795
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,111
Take it from "I hate the sea."

796
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,362
Will you never understand?

797
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,489
Are you so stupid
that you don't know what I mean?

798
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,324
I'm offering myself to you.

799
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,743
I'm kneeling before you.

800
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,663
I... I, who have had so many men
kneel before me,

801
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,623
I'm offering you my body,

802
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,626
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

803
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,337
I have promised to love you.

804
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,339
You, a negro sailor.

805
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,968
Is that not humiliation enough
that you must keep me waiting so?

806
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,220
Answer me, please! Answer me.

807
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,264
Will you give me that water?

808
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,600
I have no water.

809
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,186
Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?

810
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,856
I wonder how long it'll take the public
to find out he's a maniac.

811
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,608
Teddy Roosevelt has rabies.
Universal military training.

812
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,318
Jack, your second speech is out.

813
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,155
And the ironic part of it is
that poor people, they love him.

814
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,158
Sure, they do.
They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.

815
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,076
You can't touch the bunny suit.
It's rented.

816
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,494
Did you read the piece
on the convention?

817
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,955
If the left doesn't defend Wilson,
we're gonna get President Hughes.

818
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,165
Think we ought to go to St Louis?

819
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,042
I am not going to St Louis
to defend Wilson.

820
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,127
- I think we should.
- Why? What good would it do?

821
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,087
I don't know,
if you don't think Hughes would have us

822
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,256
in a war in a few months,
it wouldn't do any good at all.

823
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,008
Wilson's kept us out so far.

824
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,385
Reed thought that he was a good poet.

825
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,345
He was a terrible poet.

826
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,765
He thought that he could write
good novels.

827
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,099
Short stories.

828
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,893
Of course, he was a poet.

829
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,521
And not a great poet,

830
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,357
but some of it was very fine.

831
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,612
<i>But, as a journalist,
Jack Reed topped them all.</i>

832
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,156
- Look. Pull this up.
- Hey, Jack.

833
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,033
See? That's good.

834
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,951
Jack, your ride's here.

835
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,497
- Excuse me. I'll wait outside.
- Okay. Okay.

836
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,001
- Do you see what I mean? If one...
- Jack, the taxi's waiting.

837
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,548
Yeah, I got to run.

838
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,011
Bye, honey.

839
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,105
<i>Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble,</i>

840
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,524
<i>he wanted to stir up trouble
for the capitalists.</i>

841
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,027
And he also wanted
to arouse the working masses

842
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,781
to the necessity of some
kind of effective united action.

843
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:41,828
In other words, I am accusing him
of either being a busybody

844
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,790
or of being a fraidy-cat,

845
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,167
not wanting to face things
of his own nature.

846
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,967
<i>Dear Louise, St Louis is very hot
and very crowded with Democrats,</i>

847
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,970
<i>all having a wonderful time
and wearing little paper hats</i>

848
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,888
<i>in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.</i>

849
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,140
<i>I'd like to think it's because</i>

850
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,183
<i>he doesn't want the United States
to go into the war,</i>

851
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,144
<i>but who knows
the mind of a Democrat?</i>

852
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,147
<i>By the way, I've decided to throw out
the poem on white lilies.</i>

853
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,690
<i>The rhyming scheme was wrong.</i>

854
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>Maybe when I get back
I can start it again.</i>

855
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,528
<i>Politics sure plays hell
with your poetry.</i>

856
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,406
<i>I keep thinking I see you.
It's the damnedest thing.</i>

857
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,033
<i>I miss you, honey.
I miss walking on the beach.</i>

858
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,622
- Hello.
- Where's the whisky?

859
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,633
Would you like a glass?

860
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,310
Don't try and decide.

861
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,437
I'll get you one.

862
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,361
I like your play.

863
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,197
I only hope I can do the part justice.

864
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,408
I think your dialogue is beautiful.
I really do, I love it...

865
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,661
Then why the hell
don't you just stand still and say it

866
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,871
instead of wandering all over the stage?

867
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,249
You're supposed to be looking
for your soul, not an ashtray.

868
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,667
Would you rather I didn't smoke
during rehearsals?

869
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,378
I'd rather you went up in flames
than put out your cigarette

870
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,255
in the middle
of a monologue about birth.

871
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,464
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.

872
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,383
It makes me wanna cancel
the whole production.

873
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,177
I won't do it again.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

874
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,481
You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.

875
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,525
Are you leaving?

876
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,652
Give me your glass.

877
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,373
Are you nervous?

878
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,669
- Or is that a tremor?
- Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?

879
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,547
Why should I be?
He has his things, I have mine.

880
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,853
- What are they?
- What?

881
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,068
The things that you have that are yours.

882
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,737
What are they?

883
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,449
My work, for one.

884
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,119
He's a real mean
son of a bitch, isn't he?

885
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,121
What do you mean?

886
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,498
Leaving you alone with your work.

887
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,002
- You think I mind?
- You should.

888
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,339
It's the one thing
we mustn't be left alone with.

889
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,924
- You may feel that way, I don't.
- Good.

890
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,970
Don't let those village radicals keep you
from being what you should be.

891
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,431
What do you think I should be?

892
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,100
The centre of attention.

893
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,687
Well, you must have been
with some very competitive women.

894
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,273
Let's just say possessive.

895
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,109
Possessive? That's something else.

896
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,819
It's a waste of time.

897
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,780
I'm not.

898
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,949
Neither is Jack, for that matter.

899
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,536
Oh, yes. I know.
You and Jack have your own things.

900
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,581
He has the freedom to do the things
that he wants to and so do I.

901
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,666
And I think anyone who's afraid
of that kind of freedom

902
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,835
is really only afraid
of his own emptiness.

903
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,297
Are you making this up
as you go along?

904
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,842
I'd like you to go.

905
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,471
Why?

906
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,972
Because I don't want to be patronised.

907
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,100
I'm sorry if you don't believe
in mutual independence

908
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,518
and free love and respect.

909
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,480
Don't give me a lot of parlour socialism
that you learned in the Village.

910
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,652
If you were mine, I wouldn't share you
with anybody or anything.

911
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,989
It'd be just you and me.
You'd be at the centre of it all.

912
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,661
You know,
it would feel a lot more like love

913
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,038
than being left alone with your work.

914
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:52,012
- I hope I haven't upset you.
- Not at all. I'm grateful.

915
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,974
But you seem to be looking
for something much more serious

916
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,059
than what I had in mind.

917
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,728
- Than what you had in mind?
- Yes.

918
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:04,191
You see, Jack and I
are both perfectly capable

919
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,360
of living with our beliefs.

920
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,698
But I think someone as romantic as you
would be destroyed by them.

921
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,453
And I don't want that to happen.
It would upset Jack too much.

922
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,394
<i>You can't come and play in my yard</i>

923
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,064
<i>I don't love you any more</i>

924
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,568
<i>You'll be sorry when you see me</i>

925
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,905
<i>Sliding down my cellar door</i>

926
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,242
<i>You can't holler down my rain barrel</i>

927
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,662
<i>You can't climb my apple tree</i>

928
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,292
<i>I don't want to play in your yard</i>

929
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>If you can't be good to me</i>

930
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,207
<i>I don't want to play in your yard</i>

931
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,960
<i>I don't like you any more</i>

932
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,837
<i>You'll be sorry when you see me</i>

933
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,840
<i>Sliding down our cellar door</i>

934
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,678
<i>You can't holler down our rain barrel</i>

935
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,640
<i>You can't climb our apple tree</i>

936
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,851
<i>I don't want to play in your yard</i>

937
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,063
<i>If you won't be good to me</i>

938
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,859
Wonderful!

939
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,378
Floyd, I've been
waiting for this for weeks.

940
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,069
Tap your sensuality.

941
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,087
- Wonderful close.
- Extraordinary.

942
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,048
Very good. Excellent.

943
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:19,178
- Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Max, what about you?

944
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,387
- Okay. Who's next?
- I just recited

945
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,764
two-thirds of my new play.

946
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,099
You said it was a work
of uncanny perception.

947
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,852
Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.

948
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,288
- Well!
- Jack. Come in.

949
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,415
News from the front.

950
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,667
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

951
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,251
- Hi, Jack.
- How was the trip?

952
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,963
Welcome back.

953
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,757
- Who's next?
- Nobody's next.

954
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,385
Let's have a dance out of Gene.

955
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,262
Jack, you're just in time
to see O'Neill dance.

956
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,432
Okay. Do something Irish.
Come on, Gene.

957
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,101
Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.

958
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,520
- Yeah. Go ahead Gene.
- Recite something from your new play.

959
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,938
Hutch says it's wonderful.

960
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,607
Tell us about the convention, Jack.
How was Wilson's speech?

961
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,485
Never mind the speech.
What was he wearing?

962
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,448
- What about Wilson?
- Yeah. What about Wilson?

963
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,620
Oh, I don't think there's any reason to
believe that Wilson's gonna do anything

964
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,582
other than support the interest of the
ruling class and take us into the war.

965
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,961
But as long as he says he's against it,
then I think we have to support him.

966
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,214
Because he'll have to make good on
that campaign promise

967
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,341
for at least a few months
and that might give us time

968
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,968
to strengthen the anti-war coalition.

969
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,054
But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in
the streets now than there was before...

970
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,322
You want another drink, Gene?

971
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,370
I guess not.

972
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,137
- Good night.
- Night.

973
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,223
Good night.

974
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,986
Would you like
some cold tea with lemon?

975
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,404
No, thanks.

976
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,324
Well, I'll have some, anyway.

977
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,798
- What's this?
- A poem.

978
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,175
May I read it?

979
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,889
I didn't finish it.

980
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,282
Finish it.

981
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,873
Finish it?

982
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,256
Would that make you happy?
If I were a poet?

983
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,301
I'm happy-

984
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,147
- Jack.
- Why don't you get some sleep?

985
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,567
Jack.

986
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,321
There's something
that I have to tell you.

987
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,408
- You don't have to tell me anything.
- No?

988
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,535
No.

989
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,963
You want to get married?

990
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,871
Okay. There we go. I'll see...

991
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,712
- Oh, careful there. Careful.
- There's two more to come.

992
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,340
Two? No, there should be three.

993
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,389
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry to hover like this.

994
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,224
It's not that
you're not doing a wonderful job.

995
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:19,436
It's just that I'm very concerned
about this one particular box.

996
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,899
- Here. No. No.
<i>- I'll</i> take it.

997
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,006
Where's the whisky?

998
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,802
- Lady, where do you want this?
- Oh, just put it over there.

999
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,679
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1000
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,265
Yeah.

1001
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,561
- Anything to drink in there?
- Drink?

1002
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,606
Oh, here. Thanks.
Thank you very much. I...

1003
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,858
- Thank you. Good.
- Thank you.

1004
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:19,454
Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.

1005
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,127
- Gene?
- No glass?

1006
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,129
Oh. Let's see.

1007
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,675
Well, I guess I should have
labelled these, shouldn't I have?

1008
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,512
No. No, that isn't the right one.

1009
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,681
Try this one.

1010
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,226
Well, what are you working on, Gene?

1011
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,603
At the moment, Scotch.

1012
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,440
I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?

1013
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,026
- I'd prefer a glass.
- A glass.

1014
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:55,157
You know,
you left without saying goodbye.

1015
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:59,494
That's not like you, not that I have
the slightest idea what you're like.

1016
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,456
Success at last. See, a... Here we go.

1017
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,762
Your skill as a bartender
seems to have deteriorated.

1018
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,848
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. No. I'm...

1019
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:24,019
Why should I be nervous? My God,
it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.

1020
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:41,244
- What is it?
- It's a poem telling you that I love you.

1021
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,499
And that I won't be possessive
and I won't be jealous.

1022
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,586
And you can sleep with whoever
you want, live with whoever you want.

1023
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,924
I'll do anything that you say.
I'd like to kill you, but I can't.

1024
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,261
So you can do whatever you want to,

1025
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,223
except not see me.

1026
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,269
Or smoke during the monologue.

1027
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,735
Gene, Jack and I,
we haven't told anyone yet

1028
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,113
because we were too embarrassed.

1029
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,281
But

1030
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,493
we're married.

1031
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,870
Jack and I got married.

1032
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:31,086
- That is embarrassing.
- Yes. Isn't it?

1033
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,713
We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.

1034
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,007
And it's gonna be good.
We're gonna work together.

1035
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,843
We're gonna spend
all our time together.

1036
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,636
That's why we took a lease
on this place,

1037
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,304
so we wouldn't have to go back
to the city.

1038
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,764
Does this mean that we have to cheat?

1039
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,808
Or is this a free
and independent marriage?

1040
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,269
- Gene.
- You're a lying Irish whore from Portland

1041
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,105
and you used me
to get Jack Reed to marry you.

1042
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,982
No, I didn't.

1043
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,818
I just want us to be friends, Gene.

1044
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,654
Oh, how genteel. That would be a
good role for you, wouldn't it?

1045
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,282
"There's Louise with Jack and Gene.

1046
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,326
"He's crazy about her,
but Jack doesn't know.

1047
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:08,081
"Poor Jack. Poor Gene.
What a heartbreaker she is."

1048
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,839
What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.

1049
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,842
I'm sorry. I'm...

1050
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,721
Where is he?

1051
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,641
Washington.

1052
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,393
Well, Mrs Reed,

1053
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,273
I'll do whatever you say.
What do you want me to do?

1054
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,943
Wish us well?

1055
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,457
I wish you well.

1056
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,002
You and Jack.

1057
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,083
Jack!

1058
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,127
Oh, God.

1059
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,925
<i>I'm not sure whether she had an affair</i>

1060
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,220
with Eugene O'Neill or not
during this time.

1061
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,098
And nobody seemed to know. Or...

1062
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:51,142
It was nobody's business, anyway, so...

1063
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,521
I don't know what that situation was.

1064
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:58,191
The report was that
she and Reed and O'Neill

1065
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,443
had a ménage à trois.

1066
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,825
Jack, what... What is...

1067
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,550
Oh, God! I swear...

1068
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,970
...that we love America!

1069
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,557
We love her mountains, her forests...

1070
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,976
<i>There were mutinies
in the French army,</i>

1071
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,979
<i>there were mutinies
in various parts of the front.</i>

1072
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:40,150
<i>And then, in 1917, the troops,
poorly armed,</i>

1073
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,820
poorly equipped, poorly clothed,
went back to Russia

1074
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,322
to talk it out with the czar.

1075
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,073
And when they got through,
there wasn't any czar.

1076
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,075
Revolution in Russia.

1077
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,245
This was the spring of 1917.

1078
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,040
And I became so excited

1079
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,002
that I zigzag-jumped the benches

1080
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,838
as we walked out of the park.

1081
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,674
Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.

1082
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,177
Revolution, the people take over,

1083
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,387
down with the czar!

1084
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,515
Naturally, I was happy.

1085
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,812
Well, haven't you made the politics
a little nebulous here?

1086
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,897
- What do you mean "nebulous"?
- Unclear...

1087
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,817
- How can you say they're unclear?
- Well, they're unclear to me. I...

1088
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,235
Why am I necessarily attempting

1089
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,487
to define the politics
of a specific group of people?

1090
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,990
It isn't what I said.
I think it's a vast oversimplification.

1091
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,120
Oh, it's just an opinion.

1092
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,167
You know,
if you made carbons of these,

1093
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,420
I could take them on the train with me.

1094
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,256
<i>Wilson, of course,
was elected on the platform of</i>

1095
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,008
<i>"Keep us out of war" in 1916.</i>

1096
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,346
<i>But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself</i>

1097
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,975
<i>and declared war against Germany.</i>

1098
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:40,478
The mission at that time was to make
the world safe for democracy.

1099
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,480
Reed said,

1100
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:48,778
"This is a war for democracy?
Where is the goddamn democracy?"

1101
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:54,159
If men really disapproved of war, dear,
we'd have stopped wars years ago.

1102
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,787
Men like wars. Always have.

1103
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,375
So they all went and got little uniforms,
went to war.

1104
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,336
- My country is at war!
- Yes.

1105
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,466
And so today, I, too, am at war!

1106
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,345
My name is Jack Reed,
I'm from New York.

1107
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,640
This is not my war, and I'm not gonna
have anything to do with it!

1108
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,225
All right. All right.

1109
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,810
All right, folks.

1110
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,396
There was a lot of anti-war feeling,
of course.

1111
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,983
We had no one against the war.
There wasn't a soul against the war.

1112
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,571
Well, I'm not talking about saying it
to the workers any other way.

1113
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,741
How do we move them?

1114
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,743
Right. How do we organise them?

1115
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,078
The Socialist Party...

1116
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,834
The Socialist Party of America
is nothing to sneeze at.

1117
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,670
You think the Socialist Party
is going to take a position?

1118
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,339
You boys are Reds, aren't you?

1119
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:53,092
The Socialist Party is useless.
Jack, is that right?

1120
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,428
Now, that's the truth. Jack?

1121
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:56,846
The United States is at war.

1122
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,765
Your friends are talking to you.

1123
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,268
If the workers of the world act together,
they can stop the war. And I'm not...

1124
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,103
This one even pisses red.

1125
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,691
You ran around saving the world
until your kidney acted up again.

1126
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:09,943
Very intelligent.

1127
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,028
And you're gonna keep running around
making speeches

1128
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,863
until you wind up
in the hospital. Brilliant.

1129
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,698
And then,
you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.

1130
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,117
Harry, how much is the government
paying you to keep me quiet?

1131
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,702
Very funny. Keep laughing.

1132
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,788
- Yeah...
- That hurt, didn't it?

1133
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,958
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.

1134
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,794
You're not gonna be able to keep doing
what you've been doing.

1135
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,796
This is a serious condition.
It could kill you.

1136
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,258
Harry, look, I want to know if...

1137
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,886
Could this thing interfere
with having children?

1138
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,890
- Yes. You cannot have sex if you die.
- No, come on, Harry. Seriously.

1139
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,727
Are you thinking about having children?

1140
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,439
Not at the moment,
but I want to be able to...

1141
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,652
ls Louise talking about it?

1142
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,904
No.

1143
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,073
Well, just because
she isn't talking about it

1144
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,741
doesn't mean
she isn't thinking about it.

1145
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,077
Don't worry. You don't make babies
with your kidneys.

1146
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,996
Look, I'm gonna send you home
to Louise.

1147
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,747
Tell her to keep you there,
put you in bed,

1148
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,292
give you lots of liquids.
I'm gonna write it all down.

1149
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,753
Look, Louise doesn't know about
this. And I don't want her to, okay?

1150
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,589
- Fine.
- So, can you give me my bill here?

1151
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,508
- I don't want it sent to the house.
- Do you have any money?

1152
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,430
Not at the moment.

1153
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,974
Then why the hell
should I give you a bill? Go home.

1154
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,853
It is my belief that socialism and peace
are inseparable.

1155
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,857
And I reiterate that the Socialist Party
will stand firmly behind

1156
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:34,277
its resolution to oppose
American involvement in this war!

1157
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,696
Mr Chairman, Louis Fraina,
Local Boston.

1158
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,365
The chair recognises
the delegate from Boston.

1159
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,533
And I still want to know

1160
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,453
what specific action
we are going to take against the war.

1161
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,038
Your resolution is all very nice,

1162
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,957
but will it stop even one boy from
being killed? I don't think so.

1163
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,376
...stigmatised as unpatriotic.

1164
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,712
The task that confronts us is difficult.

1165
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,631
Let us hope
that we can handle it properly.

1166
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,798
What's that supposed to mean?

1167
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,133
Stupid!

1168
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,471
I'd like to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna fight conscription or not.

1169
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,390
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Will the delegate identify himself?

1170
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,976
I am not a delegate, Mr Chairman.
My name is John Reed,

1171
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,561
I write for the magazine The <i>Masses,</i>

1172
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,648
and I want to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna organise demonstrations...

1173
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,816
I'm sorry, Mr Reed.
You have no credentials here.

1174
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,986
Now, this floor is reserved
for delegates, not journalists.

1175
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,821
Mr Chairman,
is the Socialist Party prepared

1176
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,657
-to take a position on the draft or not?
- Hey, shut up!

1177
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,992
I'm sorry, Mr Reed.
You have no credentials.

1178
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,243
Let him speak, will you?

1179
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,788
Mr Reed,
you're getting into party politics, eh?

1180
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,165
I'm just trying to be a journalist.
Mr Chairman...

1181
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,460
So is Trotsky.
Let us see what happens in Russia.

1182
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,255
Why don't you join the Socialist Party?
We need good people like you.

1183
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,383
Big things are happening in Russia.

1184
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,928
As appalling as it may seem
to see socialists supporting bloodshed,

1185
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,555
I can understand the necessity
of supporting one's government

1186
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:45,973
during times of war.

1187
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,893
The task that confronts us is a giant!

1188
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,271
In that,
we must continue our opposition!

1189
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:09,664
- We have to give this dog a name.
- Well, she has a name.

1190
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,417
What's the matter with her name?

1191
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:16,045
- I can't find anything in this house.
- I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."

1192
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,423
I suppose if she were a baby,
you'd wanna call her "Person."

1193
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:20,383
Not really.
I think I might wanna call her "Jack."

1194
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,884
No. No. Bad.

1195
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,594
See, now this is why
I can't find anything.

1196
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:24,762
You put things anywhere.

1197
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,305
Dog! Dog!

1198
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,307
She's still not housebroken.

1199
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,810
You got to grab her
when she squats like that,

1200
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,563
and then take her outside. That's right.

1201
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,441
And then when she goes,
you've got to give her a reward.

1202
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,401
All right. Now, stay, Dog.

1203
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,528
Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?

1204
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:41,696
No,no,no.

1205
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,665
Why? Why, do you think
I'm using too much garlic?

1206
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,752
I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.

1207
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,837
Garlic doesn't bother me.

1208
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:13,394
- That's from Gene.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.

1209
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,063
I didn't realise what it was.

1210
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,574
He gave it to me in October.
I haven't seen him since.

1211
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,409
- You don't have to explain.
- I'm not explaining.

1212
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,912
- I'm just telling you it's over.
- Louise, look.

1213
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,705
I don't expect you to tell me
everything you do.

1214
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,791
What about if you tell me something,
just tell me the truth?

1215
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,709
- Jack, I haven't seen him.
- Don't do that, Louise.

1216
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,754
Don't tell me that Gene gave you
a love poem six or seven months ago,

1217
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,839
but you put it in a book
and you haven't seen him since.

1218
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,466
I don't care
whether you've seen him or not.

1219
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,051
- I just care about dishonesty.
- Oh, I see.

1220
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,094
You don't care
that I had an affair with another man,

1221
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,597
you just care about dishonesty?
Look who's being dishonest.

1222
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,349
You care. You care so much,
you won't even talk about it.

1223
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,184
- You won't even mention...
- Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.

1224
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,352
You want to be honest about it?

1225
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,645
If I didn't wanna be honest about it,

1226
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,480
do you think I'd be silly enough
to leave a poem he gave me

1227
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,607
lying around in the house
in a book of Walt Whitman?

1228
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,775
Why not Whitman?

1229
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,611
I'm sure Gene would feel right at home
in that company.

1230
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:04,821
Oh, no. You don't care.

1231
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,240
Why the hell should I care that
you slept with somebody else?

1232
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,366
Do you think I haven't?

1233
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,076
I don't think we have to report
to each other

1234
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,995
every time we go to bed with somebody.
It doesn't mean anything.

1235
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,372
It doesn't mean that I love you any less.

1236
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,874
Do you love me any less
'cause you went to bed with Gene?

1237
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,839
What difference does it make?

1238
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,550
I just don't think we should lie about it.
That's all.

1239
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,594
- Who?
- What do you mean, "Who?"

1240
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,471
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

1241
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,224
Who was it?

1242
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,810
What do you want, a list?
It doesn't mean anything.

1243
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,072
Louise.

1244
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,325
Louise.

1245
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,750
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

1246
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,295
- I wanna know where you're going.
- I don't want to talk about it.

1247
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,755
- Well, I wanna talk about it.
- You said it all, Jack.

1248
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,758
What? What did I say now
that we both haven't said 100 times?

1249
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,302
Please forward my mail
to John K. Wheeler,

1250
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:10,469
Wheeler Bell Syndicate.

1251
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,972
I'll have someone pick up
the rest of my things in the morning.

1252
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,057
Didn't we say that people had to give
each other freedom

1253
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,268
-if they were gonna live together?
- We said a lot of things.

1254
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,895
I thought
we weren't going to be possessive.

1255
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,771
- I thought you loved me!
- Who says I don't?

1256
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,857
You love yourself! Me, you fuck!

1257
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,818
When you're not fucking other people,
that is!

1258
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,780
Freedom? You mean I should just be
like you and not give a damn, is that...

1259
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:33,910
Is that what fucking Gene means?
You don't give a damn about us?

1260
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:37,204
I'm not packing my bag.
I wanna know where you're going.

1261
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,206
- Get out of my...
- Where you going?

1262
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,208
- Get out of my...
- You're not going...

1263
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,380
Get away! Get out of my way.

1264
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,032
- How many were there?
- Come on, Louise.

1265
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,704
You don't know the first thing about
what living together means.

1266
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:27,672
Go ahead. I know where you're going.

1267
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,675
I thought you needed someone
to share your life with. But I was wrong.

1268
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,468
As long as you get your two shots of
limelight every day.

1269
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,095
You don't need a thing.

1270
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,729
You go to hell! Both of you!

1271
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:15,219
It could possibly have been
a matter of prestige, you know,

1272
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,639
to say that you had an affair
with Louise Bryant.

1273
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,183
I haven't been spared

1274
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:25,604
the legends about men that are
supposed to have had affairs with me,

1275
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,107
because I was known by name.

1276
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:32,069
Affairs which never occurred at all.

1277
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,072
It's very difficult to tell, you know.

1278
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:38,075
Do you know there is nothing
more bewildering

1279
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,037
than when you get a letter
from a loony who says,

1280
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,456
"That marvellous week
we spent in Venice."

1281
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:47,126
- Yeah.
- And it happens about every two years.

1282
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,128
- Yes.
- It's most extraordinary.

1283
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:57,303
<i>One day, I was out walking
with my aunt in Portland.</i>

1284
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:01,307
And she was quite something.
She was six feet tall.

1285
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,477
And I said to her,

1286
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:08,147
"What is all this ado about Louise?

1287
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,441
"What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"

1288
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,068
<i>She said,</i>

1289
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,529
<i>"Well, she had something
that just appeals."</i>

1290
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,701
<i>That's my story.</i>

1291
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:23,204
- How you feeling?
- Oh, better.

1292
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,039
- Here you are.
- Oh. Thanks, Harry.

1293
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,832
Thanks.

1294
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,126
Well, we got it out just in time.

1295
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:32,379
But since God only knows what
condition the one you've got left is in,

1296
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:33,547
you better treat it well.

1297
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,884
That means, tell that goddamn Eastman
you got to be in bed by midnight.

1298
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,304
If you get an infection now, that's it!
Absolutely no salt!

1299
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,431
<i>"Dear Jack,
I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.</i>

1300
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,100
<i>"I talked to a specialist here in Paris.</i>

1301
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,519
<i>"And he said you can lead
a perfectly normal life.</i>

1302
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,104
<i>"I hope you're not neglecting
your writing.</i>

1303
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,313
<i>"Please don't spend your energy</i>

1304
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,981
<i>"getting caught up in things
you can't afford."</i>

1305
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,608
<i>"Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece

1306
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,818

1309
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,615

1310
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,784

1317

my being here alone."</i>

1319
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,221
Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!

1320
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,431
Jesus Christ,
if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy,

1321
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,351
you can just bend right over
and kiss your ass goodbye.

1322
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,478
Because they'll pull Russia
right out of the war.

1323
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,856
Right off the Eastern Front.
They quit, that's all.

1324
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:33,732
Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.

1325
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,693
Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.

1326
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,195
You want to walk down
the Champs-Elysées someday

1327
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,407
and see 500,000 Krauts
come barrelling out of Fouquet's?

1328
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:44,451
You better hope that the Bolsheviks
are small potatoes.

1329
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,288
Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!

1330
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,707
Waiter, another round here.

1331
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,917
Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr.!

1332
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,669
Hey, come over here!

1333
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,255
Speak up, Pete, speak up.
They can't hear you in the next room.

1334
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,965
- How are you, Jack?
- Good to see you.

1335
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,843
God. You look 20 pounds lighter
since you lost that kidney.

1336
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,012
- Oh, yeah?
- I bet you only piss about half as much.

1337
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,264
Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.

1338
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,892
Jack, can the Bolsheviks
overthrow Kerensky?

1339
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,728
Okay. Why don't you ask
an impartial observer?

1340
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:14,732
Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell
you got against this war anyway?

1341
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,068
Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet
with Wilson?

1342
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,906
Get back into print so we can all read
some decent writing, you know.

1343
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:25,075
<i>- I'll</i> drink to that.
- You'll drink to anything.

1344
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,621
Well, that's right, too.
It's good to see you.

1345
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:32,166
Jesus Christ. It's good to see you.
Goddamn, how's Louise?

1346
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,126
Not so good.

1347
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,086
- She's good.
- Tell her from me that I said

1348
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,715
that John Wheeler wouldn't know
a story if it fell right on top of him.

1349
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,134
I'll tell you.
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?

1350
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,386
What the hell are you doing?
You're driving them crazy.

1351
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,804
You realise that?

1352
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,015
They think you're some kind
of goddamn German!

1353
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:50,601
I love it! Goddamn, I love it!

1354
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,269
Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.

1355
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,605
- Is that a sarsaparilla with ice?
- Yeah, thanks.

1356
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,524
You bet your sweet patoosie,
that's sarsaparilla with ice.

1357
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,694
Why wouldn't John Wheeler
know a story if it fell on him?

1358
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,322
John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.

1359
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:04,698
No, he's all right.

1360
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,284
I just hate to see Louise get hurt.
That's all.

1361
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,787
What are you talking about?

1362
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,166
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,169
Don't tell her that I told you. All right?

1364
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,964
Told me what?

1365
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,509
Well, Ben Parsons told me
that Wheeler had to let her go

1366
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,429
because she hadn't turned anything in
that he could use,

1367
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,139
other than some story about a cop

1368
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:33,018
that went over there to drive
a police department ambulance.

1369
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,397
- He let her go?
- Fired her.

1370
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,028
- When did you hear that?
- A couple of weeks ago.

1371
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,198
No, it was a month.
More than a month and a half ago.

1372
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:49,743
Oh, look, Jack,
Wheeler's a goddamn moron.

1373
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,996
Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed
about being fired.

1374
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,164
- I'm gonna see you later, huh?
- Jack, what's the matter?

1375
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:56,875
Hell, we've all been fired.
I've been fired.

1376
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,043
Hell, I'll drink 110 it.

1377
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:01,005
Imagine, 65 million

1378
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,674
go to war. Right?

1379
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,051
<i>10 million die.</i>

1380
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,429
<i>10 million become orphans.</i>

1381
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:13,017
<i>20 million become maimed, crippled,
or wounded.</i>

1382
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,062
<i>You had catastrophe in Europe.</i>

1383
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:20,065
<i>You had a holocaust in Europe.</i>

1384
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,860
<i>You had a desire for change.</i>

1385
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:24,695
<i>Who can stop them</i>

1386
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:28,198
<i>when there was
such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?</i>

1387
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,575
<i>Who could stop them?</i>

1388
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:43,047
You know, I think I'm gonna have to get
a new typewriter...

1389
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,926
- What are you...
- What?

1390
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,973
You look fine. Are you all right now?

1391
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:56,143
Oh, God, yes.
Nobody needs two kidneys.

1392
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,812
The second one's just for show.

1393
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,483
Sorry, this isn't a very good time.

1394
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,948
They're moving me
to another communications centre.

1395
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,410
So, I'm just not going to be able to
talk to you right now, Jack.

1396
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:15,954
Could we just go out here a second?
Just for a second?

1397
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:19,583
- Look, I'm on my way to Russia.
- Oh, really? Have you enlisted?

1398
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,751
Very funny.

1399
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,294
I know you're doing work here
that's good,

1400
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,713
'cause I read the ambulance piece
and I thought that was good.

1401
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,173
- Thank you.
- And I know you're working on your book

1402
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,633
and I know how important that is to you.

1403
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:28,926
But you got to have enough sense

1404
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,928
if you're trying to build up
your reputation as a journalist,

1405
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,554
to be in the right place at the right time.

1406
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:35,099
- I appreciate your advice.
- Well, the place to be now is Russia.

1407
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:38,268
- Thank you. I'll remember that.
- Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.

1408
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,646
They're in their third
provisional government in six months.

1409
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,607
You know what that means? It means
there might be another revolution.

1410
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,111
The workers are deserting the factories,
the army's deserting the battlefronts.

1411
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,948
The exiles are all coming back.
The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.

1412
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,825
All of them are going back,
only this time

1413
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,034
it might be the real thing.

1414
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,286
And if they have
a real workers' revolution in Russia,

1415
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,705
they'd have one in Germany,
and if they had one in Germany,

1416
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,291
-it could happen all over the world.
- Got a match?

1417
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,293
Louise, that'd be the end of the war.

1418
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,087
You don't have to tell me
what's happening in Russia.

1419
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,880
- I read the papers.
- Well, come with me.

1420
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,007
As a colleague,
I'm not talking about anything else.

1421
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,343
Come with me as a colleague.
You ought to be in Petrograd.

1422
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,429
Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said
about New York!

1423
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,431
- I was right about New York.
- No, I have work I'm doing here.

1424
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:16,557
And I happen to think my work is...

1425
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,309
It is important. But it's not important as
what you could be doing in Russia.

1426
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,478
I wanna work together. As partners.

1427
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:24,273
I don't want a partner. And if
I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.

1428
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,150
- I wouldn't need you to take me.
- Louise.

1429
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,194
Russia is not the safest place
in the world for a woman to be alone.

1430
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,197
You may be a hell of a journalist.
But that doesn't mean...

1431
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,579
Louise, we'd better hurry along.

1432
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,833
So, moving you out of here, huh?

1433
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,377
Yes. I've been promised an interview
with General Plumer.

1434
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,713
Well, I've got to run along myself.

1435
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,675
- Sorry I don't have any time.
- No. I don't want to keep you.

1436
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:54,011
I just...
Look, the seat's already reserved.

1437
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,346
You've wasted your money, Jack.
I don't want it.

1438
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,892
Change the date. Go by yourself.
You can use it whenever you want to.

1439
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,935
Keep up the good work.

1440
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:04,897
Jack.

1441
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,025
Good luck.

1442
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,234
Yeah, you, too.

1443
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,242
Got a taxi waiting.

1444
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,145
Jack! Jack Reed!

1445
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,773
- Joe, Joe Volski.
- How are you?

1446
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,984
Oh, fine, fine.
Are you going to Petrograd, too?

1447
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,737
- Yes. Yeah.
- Fine. Wonderful!

1448
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:57,449
Great things are happening.
Are you travelling by yourself?

1449
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:02,120
- I think I am.
- Well, then I'll switch.

1450
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,309
We met in Chicago.

1451
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:28,438
Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!

1452
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,817
You don't remember me, eh?

1453
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,279
Well, it's not that.

1454
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,324
- Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat.
- My hat?

1455
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:42,160
Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognise you
in this particular hat.

1456
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:45,831
Oh, then I'm a revolutionary
returning in disguise.

1457
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,209
Well, comes the revolution,
I'll buy you a new hat.

1458
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,337
- I see you're studying Russian.
- Yeah. I'm trying to.

1459
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,672
Know what?

1460
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,342
- What?
- I mean,

1461
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,803
ask me anything you want in Russian.

1462
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,055
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

1463
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,308
Let's see...

1464
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:07,019
Excuse me.
Excuse me, now here's the thing.

1465
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:10,480
I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you
up on this offer. So, here's what I want.

1466
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,274
I want to sign my own name
to my own stories

1467
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:13,942
and I don't want to use a double byline.

1468
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,903
I want to be responsible
for my own time and my own actions.

1469
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,448
I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant,
and not as Mrs Reed,

1470
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,533
and I want to keep an account
of every cent we spend

1471
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,743
so that I can pay you back.

1472
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,078
Now, I assume you know that
I'm not going to sleep with you,

1473
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:27,873
so just don't confuse the issue
by bringing it up.

1474
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,082
That's it.

1475
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,668
- Fine.
- Good.

1476
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,211
You like salami?

1477
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,384
He says,
"Wait a minute, I have to go back.

1478
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,553
"I forgot my teeth on the table."

1479
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,639
He says, "Hell with your teeth!

1480
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:46,725
"What do you think,
they're bombarding with sandwiches?"

1481
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,699
After the revolution,
you'll buy me a new hat.

1482
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,410
Thank you very much.
I'll keep you by your word.

1483
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,081
By the way, did you hear this one?
A man...

1484
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,143
...then asks,
"Why do you let your beard grow?"

1485
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:33,438
He says, "I want to remember
what I ate yesterday."

1486
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:44,616
This is a hard word,
but it means "I don't smoke."

1487
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:45,784
Okay.

1488
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:51,623
"Are you one of the family?"
He said, "No. That's why I'm crying."

1489
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:01,133
There's a foreman of a logging camp,
he's trying to hire a crew.

1490
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:03,427
You know, and he goes down
a long line of very big men

1491
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,636
and he gets to a little man in the back

1492
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,680
and he says, "Who the hell are you?
What're you doing here?

1493
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,641
"Don't you know that I need men who
can chop down dozens of trees a day?

1494
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,309
"Where the hell
have you ever worked before?"

1495
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:13,729
And the little man says,
"Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."

1496
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:15,522
And the foreman says,
"You mean the Sahara Desert."

1497
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,983
And the little man says,
"Yes, sure, now!"

1498
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,780
A woman knocks at the door
of her neighbour.

1499
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:25,031
I didn't tell you that?

1500
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:29,453
She says, "My husband just died.
I want to sell his jacket."

1501
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,498
He says,
"What's the matter with the pants?"

1502
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,834
She says, "The pants, I wear."

1503
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,469
The Russian border.

1504
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,893
The Russian border.

1505
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,337
He's already fighting for three months.

1506
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,424
Now he joined the Bolsheviks
and he's not going to fight any more.

1507
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:31,932
I don't think he's afraid.
There are many Bolsheviks in the army.

1508
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,226
And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.

1509
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,231
He's 14 years old.

1510
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:14,474
<i>The Communists obviously wanted
peace. Rightly so.</i>

1511
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,270
<i>Because the country was completely
unable to sustain a war.</i>

1512
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:21,022
There was treason
and there was corruption.

1513
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,024
There was everything under the sun.

1514
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,361
But certainly...
There was certainly no possibility

1515
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,613
of conducting a war.

1516
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,199
Kerensky was anxious to conduct it,

1517
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:35,745
produce some battalions of women
who were going to go and fight.

1518
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,459
Jack Reed!

1519
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,630
Alex, what the hell are you doing here?

1520
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,549
- You have someone to meet you?
- No.

1521
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,426
Then what luck I am here!

1522
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:51,386
- Lois?
- Yes.

1523
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:52,554
Alex Gomberg.

1524
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,307
- Looking for accommodation?
- No. Just a hotel.

1525
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,976
More good luck.
I know of an empty apartment.

1526
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:01,271
You have transportation?
No problem. Follow me.

1527
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,483
A lot of people had an idea
that Utopia was growing up.

1528
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:08,653
I could not blame them
for being pro-Bolshevik,

1529
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,238
but I wasn't.

1530
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,908
The one person
who was awfully ignorant about Russia

1531
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,993
-was Beatrice Webb.
- Yes, she was.

1532
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,494
She didn't know a thing.

1533
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,497
Do not be misled by the quiet
in the streets.

1534
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,249
Underneath is great tension.

1535
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,586
Alex, how much time
has the Kerensky government got left?

1536
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,130
Any day now, the Bolsheviks will strike.

1537
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,261
Fantastic, isn't it?

1538
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:36,765
A quiet street,
and yet we are in the heart of Petrograd.

1539
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,643
Give him four roubles.

1540
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:46,191
Jack, Lois. Lucky for you, I am here.

1541
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:50,445
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again.

1542
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,284
Only one bed? That's a double.

1543
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,704
Single. That's a single!
This is where I'll...

1544
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,666
This is good for me. I can just...

1545
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,377
Good.

1546
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,676
I don't mind this at all.

1547
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,815
He's calling for an insurrection,
isn't he?

1548
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,692
Day and night. Day and night.

1549
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,069
"Another insurrection will ruin Russia."

1550
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,737
"Another insurrection will save Russia."

1551
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,572
"The war is ruining Russia."

1552
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:37,993
"Without England or France,
Russia will be isolated."

1553
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,911
"The Bolsheviks are ruining Russia."

1554
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,330
Lois, lucky for you, I am here.

1555
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,040
Louise.

1556
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,584
- This is the line for bread.
- Yes.

1557
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,753
There's another line for boots.

1558
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,256
And there is still another line for cards

1559
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:54,259
on which they'll get the boots
in two, three months.

1560
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:58,054
Did we have to get rid of the czar
to stand in line for bread?

1561
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,725
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1562
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,938
Vosstanie means "Insurrection,"
and "Kerensky" means "Kerensky,"

1563
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,773
<i>and Bolsheviki means Bolshevik.</i>

1564
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,860
So I think it calls for an insurrection
by the Bolsheviks

1565
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,446
<i>against the Kerensky government
and the kornilovtsy.</i>

1566
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,573
- What's a kornilovtsy?
- Louise, I'm not that fluent in Russian.

1567
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:21,619
Look, if they buy this,

1568
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,289
they're gonna cut you down
to 400 or 500 words, aren't they?

1569
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,792
- That starts out like you got 5,000.
- Where would you out?

1570
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,464
I'd lose this. I'd lose this.

1571
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,091
But what's your lead?

1572
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,471
Oh, I know what you think.
You think the strongman line.

1573
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,973
Well, I just don't know if you're gonna
take anybody's breath away

1574
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,976
with that for a lead. You know?

1575
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,814
You're right.
It's too long, it's too general.

1576
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,609
And the strongman line
is the best lead.

1577
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,990
You've been right
about something else, too.

1578
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,454
The Bolsheviks will take Russia
out of the war.

1579
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:09,334
- Good night.
- Night.

1580
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,420
<i>"In the streets the talk
is of peace and bread.</i>

1581
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:14,005
<i>"Neither of which
Kerensky has provided."</i>

1582
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,007
<i>"Everybody knows that
something is going to happen,</i>

1583
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,342
<i>"but nobody knows just what."</i>

1584
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:20,678
Yes?

1585
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,680
I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian.
I'm English.

1586
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,099
<i>"Petrograd does not sleep.</i>

1587
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,518
<i>"At night, the arguments grow louder
and the crowds thicken."</i>

1588
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:28,103
<i>"Nobody is satisfied with Kerensky.</i>

1589
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,772
<i>"The far right wants a strongman,
the far left wants peace.</i>

1590
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,941
<i>"Everyone waits to see
what the Bolsheviks will do."</i>

1591
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,777
<i>"It is not easy to write fairly about
the Bolshevik leader Lenin.</i>

1592
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,446
<i>"He is absorbed, cold,
impatient of interruptions."</i>

1593
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,116
- You're editorialising here.
- I never editorialise.

1594
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,701
- At the end.
- You're right. Cut it.

1595
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:48,373
What I don't understand is...

1596
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,709
Why did you take out the piece
about the gunshot? It was very good.

1597
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:52,961
- It is good, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1598
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,712
Put it back in for me.

1599
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,972
Mr Zinoviev, do you still feel
that the timing is wrong

1600
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,807
for a Bolshevik insurrection?

1601
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,892
<i>"I interviewed Zinoviev at Smolny.</i>

1602
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,310
<i>"He'd been in hiding with Lenin."</i>

1603
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:11,980

less than a day.

1604

1605

<i>"We hear Trotsky speak at Smolny.</i>

1606
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,820
<i>"If Lenin represents thought,
Trotsky represents action.</i>

1607
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:19,988
<i>"He is essentially an agitator."</i>

1608
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,573
<i>"The meeting hall at Smolny
was packed. At one point,</i>

1609
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,992
<i>"someone in the platform

1610
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,077
<i>"and everybody, including the smokers
took up the cry,</i>

1611
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,329
<i>"'Don't smoke, comrades!'
And then they went on smoking."</i>

1612
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:30,498
<i>"At the point Trotsky said,
'We are trying to avoid insurrection,</i>

<i>"or his gift for phrasemaking,
and yet it is Lenin who is the architect."</i>

1620
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,352
Kerensky is some socialist, huh?

1621
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,191
<i>"The Winter Palace of the czar, where
Kerensky's government holds office,</i>

-"It is quiet in the Winter Palace.</i>

<i>"that the army is starving

1627
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:10,205
<i>"Kerensky is full of old-world manners
and charm, totally unlike Lenin."</i>

1628
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,874
<i>"Provisional government will last,'
Kerensky said during the interview,</i>

01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:16,711
<i>"He seemed bitter, defensive."</i>

1631
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,964
900,000 men deserted
since January the 1st.

1632
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,927
That's 14% of the Russian army. l...

1633
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:28,473
I'm sort of braising the cabbage.
'Cause I thought it'd be a nice change.

1634
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:32,227
You know that house
where Rhys Williams is staying?

1635
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:36,064
Evidently, the banker's daughter
came home in hysterics the other night,

1636
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,316
'cause some woman streetcar
conductor called her "comrade."

1637
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,069
So after dinner, they all voted

1638
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,988
they preferred the Germans
to the Bolsheviks by 10-to-one.

1639
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:47,575
Anyway, the Social Revolutionaries
asked the British ambassador

1640
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:48,826
to please not mention their visit,

1641
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:51,162
because they were already considered
too far to the right.

1642
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:52,747
And you know,
it's the same group of people

1643
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:55,500
you couldn't even see a year ago,
'cause they were too far to the left.

1644
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,835
Karsavina is dancing tonight.

1645
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,255
And, oh, Manny Komroff says
that Charlie Chaplin will be...

1646
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:01,506
Jack“.

1647
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,509
Thanks for bringing me here.

1648
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,772
Will they strike?

1649
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:21,192
Do you speak English?

1650
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,612
Do you speak English?

1651
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,863
Do you speak English?

1652
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,201
Do you speak English?

1653
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,036
Do you speak English?

1654
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,038
Do you speak English?

1655
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:35,707
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1656
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,500
Will they strike?

1657
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,047
- New York?
- Yes.

1658
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:44,716
- You know Broome Street?
- Yes!

1659
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,467
I know,
but can you tell me what he's saying?

1660
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,721
- I lived there four years.
- Really? What's he...

1661
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,889
What is he saying?

1662
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,225
Can you tell me what he's saying?

1663
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,728
He says don't strike.
He says it's not right

1664
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:59,397
to leave our Russian soldiers
at Front without guns.

1665
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,360
You are a long way from New York.

1666
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:26,090
He says that our Russian
soldiers at the Front

1667
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:27,675
are also strike.

1668
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,844
That is why they're leaving the Front.

1669
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,191
What's that?

1670
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:45,276
He said that the workers of England,
France and America

1671
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,195
will be left alone to fight Germany.

1672
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:48,529
Tell him he doesn't know
how many workers

1673
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,615
in England, France and America
are against the war.

1674
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,200
You lived in New York. Tell him that.

1675
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,868
You are right, American.

1676
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,794
Go ahead, you speak.

1677
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,131
Go ahead.

1678
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,050
Tell them about your American workers.

1679
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,719
No, I can't speak here, I don't have
any credentials to speak here.

1680
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,222
- I'm an American...
- Credentials? What credentials?

1681
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,140
Everyone has credentials here.

1682
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,600
He ask you to speak.

1683
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,437
Speak. I translate.

1684
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,171
I only want to say that if you strike,

1685
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,841
the American workers
will not feel betrayed.

1686
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,349
They're waiting for your example.

1687
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,686
They're waiting for your leadership.

1688
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:04,605
If you refuse to support
the capitalist war machine,

1689
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,274
they will follow your example.

1690
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,276
And if workers of the world
stand together,

1691
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,153
the war can be stopped.

1692
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:19,829
They support you
and will join you in revolution!
