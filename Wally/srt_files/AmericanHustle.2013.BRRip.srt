507
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,090

and I forgot to mention

508
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,260
that I have a little piece
of real estate in Long Island.

509

No, you didn't mention that

510
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,631
Two lunches and you
never mentioned that.

511
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,837

guy with the hat walked in.

512
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,137
The hat'?
You remember that?

513

I do remember.

Yes. (CHUCKLES)

516

You couldn't see his eyes.

517
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,217
It was like he had no eyes.

518
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,945
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

519
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,455
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

520
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,524
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

521
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,785
I saw a hat store
down the street.

522
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,018
I thought maybe
he bought it there,

523
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,027
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

524

SYDNEY: Yes.

525
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,464
Really?
It's two lunches.

526
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,330
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

527
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,370
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

528

to run, and we need to do it now.

him with Rosalyn.

688

That is a manipulation.

Rosalyn will never let you go.

690
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,381
She'll use Danny
against you because

691
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,921
she's too messed
up to let you leave.

would say that.

00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,627
I got other guys lined up.
I got a meeting.

843
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,901
Here, look, these are my associates.
I got to run.

844
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,265
Carl, his associates are here.
CARL: Don't go.

845
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,998
He's got a meeting he's got to go to.
Listen, don't go...

846
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,629
I got to run. No, don't go...
No, don't go.

Crazy thing about people,</i>

in on something.</i>

849
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,634
<i>Yeah, they're so stupid.</i>

850
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,805
I got to run. Come on.

851
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,746
I'll tell them. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll tell...

852
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,478
Hey, you know what
Carl just told me?

853
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:32,487
He said he could do this whole thing
with four guys within a week.

854
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,988
Or we could do something much bigger.
All right.

855
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,489
Something bigger?
Yeah, my guy deals

856
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,752
with hundreds of
millions of dollars.

857
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,123
How much bigger?
Hundreds of...

858
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,992
I knew you were
holding out on me, Irving!

859
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,428
Hundreds of millions of dollars?
Like, much bigger.

860
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,331
Like, I'm talking about, we could
say never the fuck mind the CDs,

861
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,460
and we could have some complete
access to something huge.

862
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,765
RICHIE; Huge? Like what'?

CARL: Carl Elway.

865
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,837
I want you to think of
the most undervalued asset

866
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,843
in the state of
New Jersey today.

867
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,807
The rebuilding
of Atlantic City.

868
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,440
Look, maybe they... Maybe
they legalized gambling

869
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,611
a year ago...
Wow.

870
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,018
...and nothings happening.

871

Hey.
No licenses, no permits.

872
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,189
Quit while
you're ahead, Carl.

873
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,849
I know the guy...
I know the right people

874
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,359
who are going to help you out.
Who's the guy?

875
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,292
The guy is Carmine Polito.

<i>And where he had been
mayor for ten years.</i>

885
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,811
<i>A very beloved guy.</i>

886
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,681
<i>A guy who never
gave up on his people.</i>

887
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,878
<i>His father had emigrated from
Italy and had stoked coal.</i>

<i>I mean, his household

893
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,428
<i>And his wife, Dolly, well,
she was the apple of his eye.</i>

894
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,039
<i>And the center
of the household.</i>

895

<i>I mean,
everyone loved this guy.</i>

896
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,010
<i>And he had a huge heart.</i>

CARMINE: The WPA employed craftsmen
to paint this during the Depression.

898
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,547
Why can't we
employ people today

899
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,420
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

900

<i>RICHIE:
He worked with all the unions,</i>

901
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,888
<i>he was the leader of

<i>But he couldn't get the funds
to rebuild Atlantic City.</i>

905
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,032
<i>And that was his problem.</i>

906
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,538
<i>So, with our help,

908

STODDARD: You said grifters,
con artists.

910
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,246
We're not going
after some politician.

911
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,148
This is a bad idea, Richard.

912
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,878
Look, it's really simple.

913
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,583
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

914
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,386
What?
...under the sheik's name.

915
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,790
Whose $2 million?

916
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,759
Just listen.

917
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,388
$2 million under
the sheik's name

918
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,662
in a Chase account
that we control.

919
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,169
Carmine calls up
on the telephone,

920
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,139
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

921
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,674
and he has a real account.

922
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,471
Five days.

923
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,513
I'm not taking $2 million
of the taxpayers' money,

924
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,604
putting it anywhere
for five days.

925
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,150
I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

926
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,152
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

927
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,347
and to get rid
of the payoff guys

928
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,482
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

929
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,287
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

930
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,657
I understand your eagerness.

931
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,320
I really do.

932
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,125
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

933
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,632
Let me tell you a story

934
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,759
about me and my
dad and my brother.

935
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,963
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

936
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,164
Ice fishing,
that's all anybody...

937
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,466
That's what we lived for.

938
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,007
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

939
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,667
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

940
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,676
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

941
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,145
You drop a line
and you just wait.

942
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,183
One year,
my brother <i>says,</i>

943
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,511
"Let's go in October."

944
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,176
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

945
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,117
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

946
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,951
My brother <i>says,</i>
I love my brother, he says...

947
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,455
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

948
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,015
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

949
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,822
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

950
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,556
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

951
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,857
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

952
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,296
What are you saying?

953
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,697
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

954
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,860
another time, young man.

955
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,029
For now, no Carmine Polito.

956
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:10,868
Go do your job.

957
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,339
<i>RICHIE: Stoddard shot
the whole thing down.</i>

958
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,808
Boring.

<i>Bu! Edith was a genius.</i>

960
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,139
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

961
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,842
RICHIE: <i>She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.</i>

962
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,317
<i>A woman I'd
never even heard of.</i>

963
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,877
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

<i>RICHIE: Way back in</i> a <i>warren

<i>This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.</i>

967
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,363
<i>And Edith met her in the ladies'

968
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,163
Brenda? Hi.

969
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,827
Hello.
How are you?

00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,498
<i>She was excited to be

<i>instead of just being

974
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,511
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

975
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,739
It was beautiful.
That's from England.

976
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,371
This is from England?
Yeah.

977
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,178
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

978
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,546
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

979
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,244
ever talks to me.
I know.

980
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,582
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

981
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,213
"and don't ask questions."

982
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,724

Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

988
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,269
But Barnaby,
that's another story.

989
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,200
Barnaby plays the piano.

990
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,296
That's impressive.

991
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,968
<i>We got her to wire $2 million into
an FBI-controlled account at Chase.</i>

<i>And by the time
Stoddard caught up to us,</i>

<i>Edith made sure his boss
was impressed by my idea.</i>

996

Don't be modest.

<i>RICHIE:

1003

<i>it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in from of his boss.</i>

1004
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,230
You made me accept praise
from my boss for thanking me

for something that
never should have happened,

1006

something that I
didn't approve.

00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,139
You should be happy.

to want to see cash,

1064

he's going to want to
see it in an account,

1065
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,924
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

you were working with me?

1174
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,915
That I'm
the sheik's associate?

1175
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,886
I just fucking told you,
he doesn't like you.

1176
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:54,826
I mean,
let him have a night out

for fuck's sake, all right?

1178

He's going to jail soon.
You're done with him.

1179

no, we're gonna get Carmine's...

There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

1197
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,765
All right, Edith and I were
so successful for so long

1198
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,426

just small enough.

in this room with me right
now, taking orders from me?

1203
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,480
You're taking your

just hear you correctly?

Richard, the filter is
broken in the fish tank.

00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,826
It's a problem.

1220
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,296
See, your job is to
do the filter, Mom.

1221
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,594
Mine is to do the gravel.

1222
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:42,661
When you don't do the filter
right, all the fish die. See?

1223
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,104
I can't get that top on the
filter, that thing on there.

I need a jet at Teterboro.

I told you that.

1513

You don't need a jet.

1514
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,681
You just let him
walk to the curb at JFK.

What does that mean?

It means you got
to be committed.

1519
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,782
It means you got to be
committed to something

All right, thank you.

1529
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,213
All right, so tell me the rest
of the ice fishing story.

1530
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,384
Where was I?
Your father woke you up,

1531
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,146
it was a blizzard,
it was Lake Canoga.

1532
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,210
Come on, come on.

1533
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,184
Okay, well, my brother
and I were on the ice,

1534
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:46,159
and my father came out of the
house and I could see him coming.

1535
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,889
He was holding a lantern
and he was in the blizzard,

1536
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,759
and I knew
he was gonna be angry.

1537
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:51,696
So I went
to intercept my father,

1538
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,428
because I knew if he
saw what my brother

1539
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,002
was doing,
he was gonna kill him.

1540
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,004
Oh, so you tried to
protect your brother,

1541
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,403
but you couldn't,
and that's why you feel bad,

1542
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,769
because you're
trying to protect me

1543
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,206
and you're worried about me. Is
that what the story's about?

1544
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,333
It's about protection. No,
it's not about protection.

1545
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,606
It's not?
No.

1546
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,612

He's in the back room.

1854
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,530
It's a sign
of disrespect

1855
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,429
to talk, uh, business
on the first meeting.

1856
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,057
That's not true.
It's disrespectful...

to leave him back there in

Come on, let's go, we got

1860

friend from New York

1861
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,733

Hey, no disrespect, pal.

1862
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,243
Hey, Irving,
I'm gonna be having fun.

1863
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,075
Maybe it'll be
contagious, huh?

1872
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:16,668
<i>he was known to never bury a
body, because he felt it sent</i>

1873
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,575
<i>a stronger message to
leave it in the street.</i>

1874
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,272

He looked at me like...

want to go into the Ocean Bar?

it's beautiful in there.

1879

No, I don't have to go there. I like it here.
There's an exit.

1881
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,090
TELLEGIO:
Nobody knows I'm here.

1882
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:43,161
Look, tell him I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1883
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,001
We're very excited.
It's been our lifelong dream

1884
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,336
to build casino resorts
on the East Coast.

1885

(RICHIE WHISPERING)

1886

You told him that?

1887
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,514
They didn't want
the Jews to make money.

1888
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,015
They didn't want the
Italians to make money.

the blacks to make money.

And, I don't know, you can
tell him this in your own way.

1895
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,360
I've been in the casino
business 40 years'

1896
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,563
it's scrutinized more carefully
than any other business.

1897
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,200
Carmine made
this legal, but

1898
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,573
we must be careful,
or they'll take it away.

1899
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,538
So, Mr. Tellegio, how do you
think we should approach this?

1900

What do you think?
What do you want to do?

1901
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,414
Well, if you want to get the
gaming license and keep it,

1902
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,986
we have to make our principal
investor here, the sheik,

Well,
to expedite citizenship,

1905
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:54,872
that requires very
special treatment.

1906
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,103
Well, you would know the right
people to do that, Carmine.

we can get his
whole organization,

2328
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,938
as well as getting
any number of congressmen.

2329
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,414
I mean, that's just...

2330

first layer of the onion.

01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:07,745
Wow.

2332
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,312
How you gonna do that?

2333
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,957
We would get $10 million, that we...
$10 million?

2334
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:14,321
And that's how we just let
them know we're for real.

2335
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:15,450
$10 million?

2336
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:16,824
All right, so what does he
say he's gonna do for us?

2337
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:18,625
How are we trapping him?
They're gonna promise

2338
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,257

skims, do the licensing...

2339
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,963
And you have what? You have
him on tape saying this?

2340
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,902
You have that, right?
No.

2341
01:39:27,662 --> 01:39:30,973
I want you to find a safer way to
get Victor Tellegio on a wire.

2342
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,669
No $10 million.
That's crazy.

2343
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,678
Thank you.
Right?

2344
01:39:34,769 --> 01:39:37,147
Even to entrap Tellegio,
it's crazy.

not being killed by the Mob,

01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:03,267
but otherwise,
you're doing a great job.

What's the end of

2357
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,870
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

2358
01:40:07,969 --> 01:40:09,107
I'm gonna call

2359

My brother's dead!

That's how it ends!

2361
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,282
He fell through
the fucking ice!

2362
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,879
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

it's awkward, and, uh,

2364
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,496
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

2365
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:31,531
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

2366
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:32,730
I mean,
we got the Sherman Suite.

We do.

You know what,
give me those flowers.

2383
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:05,927
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

2384
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:07,563
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

02:07:47,827 --> 02:07:49,932
That's the story
you want to go with?

2990
02:07:49,996 --> 02:07:50,997
All right?

2991
02:07:51,097 --> 02:07:54,203
That's what you want
the New York Times to hear?

2992
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:59,540
That you got conned
by the very con men

2993
02:08:00,606 --> 02:08:05,555
who you forced to entrap the members
of Congress in the first place?

2994

That's what you
want to go with?

2995
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:10,452
That doesn't sound so good
for your whole thing, does it?

2996
02:08:11,117 --> 02:08:16,066
And how ironic that the ones
who were working hardest

2997
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:19,034
to get the economy
of New Jersey going,

2998

that you round up.

And why'? Why?

3000
02:08:23,563 --> 02:08:25,975
Because, what, they're the
easiest to go after'?

3001
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,873
And what about
the real bullshit artists?

3002
02:08:30,803 --> 02:08:33,374
You didn't even come close
to the big leagues.

3003

Those big guys,
the money men.

3004
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:39,515
That's what I was
trying to go after.

you got none of them.

some very big guys.</i>

3011

just doing business as usual,</i>

3012

<i>helping their
communities or their states,</i>

3013
02:09:21,053 --> 02:09:24,398
<i>but some of them knew they
had larceny in their blood.</i>

3014
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:26,431
<i>And they even admitted it.</i>

3015
02:09:26,525 --> 02:09:29,369
<i>But in all,
it was six congressmen,</i>

3016

3017
02:09:32,865 --> 02:09:34,936

3018

<i>We gave the two million back,</i>

3019
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:43,719
<i>so Carmine got the reduced
sentence, 18 months.</i>

<i>The loss of his friendship</i>

3021
02:09:48,614 --> 02:09:50,719
<i>would haunt me
for the rest of my life.</i>

3022
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:55,956
<i>And when
the story was written,</i>

3023
02:09:56,555 --> 02:09:59,729
<i>Richard DiMaso's name
was never mentioned,.</i>

3024

You know, my boss knows
you did him a solid.

3030
02:10:30,089 --> 02:10:31,090
Yes, I did.

3031
02:10:31,157 --> 02:10:34,036
He never took a nickel, so they
can't get him for nothing.

3032
02:10:34,593 --> 02:10:36,129
I was never going
to let that happen.

3033
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:38,306
All right.
