[door opens, shuts]

5
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,919
- It's getting cold.
- Thanks.

6
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,758
That is one fine frame.

7
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,886
One fine frame, that is.

8
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,680
[shivers]

9
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,598
How much...

10
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,813
...does a fine frame
like that cost, do you think?

11
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,732
I never told you,

12
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,944
but you sound a little like
Dr Seuss when you're drunk.

13
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,029
Anna, I'm serious.

14
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,199
Serious, I am, Anna.

15
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,329
I'd say it cost
at least a couple hundred.

16
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,748
I'm gonna read it for you.

17
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,583
Do I really sound like Dr Seuss?

18
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,712
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement

19
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,131
in the field of child psychology,

20
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,216
his dedication to his work

21
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,845
and his continuing efforts
to improve the quality of life..."

22
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,889
Will you concentrate?

23
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,393
"...his continuing efforts
to improve the quality of life

24
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,688

00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,153
Dr Malcolm Crowe..." That's you.

27
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,656
"...the Mayor's Citation
for Professional Excellence."

28
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,244
They called you their son.

29
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,747
Wow.

30
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,458
We should hang it in the bathroom.

31
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,213
This is an important night for us.

32
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:44,094
Finally, someone is recognising
the sacrifices you've made.

33
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:48,223
That you have put everything
second, including me...

34
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,769
...for those families
that they're talking about.

35
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,942
They're also saying
that my husband has a gift.

36
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,822
You have a gift that teaches
children how to be strong

37
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:08,619
in situations where most adults
would piss on themselves.

38
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,538
I believe what they wrote is real.

39
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,503
Thank you.

40
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,009
[Malcolm] I would like
some wine in a glass.

41
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,180
I would not like it in a mug.
I would not like it in a jug.

00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,100

43
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,194

Look.

Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

48
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,384
This is 47 Locust Street.

49
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,181
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

50
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,391
You don't know so many things.

51
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,561
There are no needles

52
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,314
or prescription drugs
of any kind in this house.

53
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,734

[sobbing]

55
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,868
Do you know why you're
afraid when you're alone?

56
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,998
I do. I do.

57
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,251
What do you want?

58
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,045
What he promised me!

59
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,548
- I want what he promised me.
- Oh, my God.

60
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,591
Do I know you?

61
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,010
Don't you know me, hero?

62
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,514
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

63
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,767
[sobbing continues]

64
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,686

S... single-parent family.

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,568
Possible mood disorder.

67
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,822
I was afraid!

68
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,701
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

69
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,664
You... you were wrong.
You were wrong.

70
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,208
[sobbing]

71
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,835
Now look at me!

72
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,129
I don't want to be afraid no more.

73
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,382
Please, just give me a minute to think.

74
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,968
I waited ten years for you!

75
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,637
I'm not giving you nothing!

76
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,472
Ben Friedkin?

77
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,892
Some people, they call me "freak".

78
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,104
Ronald Sumner?

79
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,315
I am. I am a freak. Look at...

80
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,360
Vincent.

81
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,530
Vincent Grey.

82
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,451
Don't. Don't.

83
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,954
I do remember you.

84
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,999
- No.
- Quiet, very smart.

85
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,919
Compassionate.

86
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,839
Unusually compassionate.

87
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,676
You forgot "cursed".

88
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,599
You failed me.

89
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,018
You failed me!

90
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,442
Vincent, I'm sorry if I
wasn't... if I didn't help you.

91
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,361
But if you just... let me try.

92
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,614
You just give me a chance...

00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,949

00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,127

- Now, don't talk. Shh.

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,113
It's OK, Cole.

101
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,658
My name is Dr Malcolm Crowe.

102
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,704
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

103
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,623
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,759
You know,
in the olden days in Europe,

105
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,886
people used to hide out in churches.

106
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,806
They would claim sanctuary.

107
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,854
What were they hiding from?

108
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,485
Bad people, mostly.

109
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:43,323
People that wanted to put
them in jail... hurt them.

110
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,579
Noticed your eyeglasses. They
don't have any lenses in them.

111
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,832
They're my dad's.

112
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,376
The lenses hurt my eyes.

113
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,420
What were you talking
about with your soldiers

114
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,381
when I came in?

115
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:04,302
<i>- De...
- De profundis clamo ad te, Domine.</i>

116
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,388
It's called "Latin".

117
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,602
All your soldiers speak Latin?

118
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,354
No.

119
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,273
Just one.

120
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,278
Are you a good doctor?

121
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,196
Well...

122
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,284
I used to be.

123
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,621
I won an award once
from the mayor.

124
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,999
Had an expensive frame.

125
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,348
I'm gonna see you again, right?

126
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,184
If that's OK with you.

127
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,034
[door opens, shuts]

128
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,345
It's me.

129
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,276

- Hey, good morning.

134
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,307
Cole?

135
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,645
Cole?

136
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,483
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are getting soggy.

137
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,489
Let me see you.
Aw, honey, you got a spot.

138
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,500
OK, here it comes.

139
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,378
[screams]

140
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,140
Something you were looking for, baby?

00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,686
Pop-Tarts?

142
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,816
They're right here.

143
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,819
Oh.

144
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,494
What are you thinking, Mama?

145
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,373
Lots of things.

146
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,876
Anything bad about me?

147
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,920
Hey, look at my face.

148
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,882
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

149
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,885
Got it?

150
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,973
Got it.

151
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,393
- Get up.
- [bell rings]

152
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,895
- Th... that's Tommy, Mom.
- OK, you tuck it in.

153
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,481
Hey, Cole? You want this?

154
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,182
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
arm-around-the-shoulder bit?

155
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,227
I just made that up. I went
with it as great actors do.

156
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,271
It's called "improv".

157
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,361
[bell ringing]

158
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,144
Hey, baby.

159
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,980
How was your day?

160
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,317
Hmm?

161
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,907
You know, you can
tell me things if you need to.

162
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,957
Oh, you know what I did today?

163
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,670
I, uh... I won the Pennsylvania
Lottery in the morning.

164
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,506
I quit my jobs.

165
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,509
And I ate a big picnic in the park

166
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,344
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

167
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:05,014
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

168
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,058
What'd you do?

169
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,525
I was picked first for
kickball teams at recess.

170
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,944
I hit a grand slam to win the game.

171
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,864
Everybody lifted me up
and carried me around, cheering.

172
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,998
In that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

173
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,208
You got an hour.

174
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,133
Hi.

175
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,473
Want to sit?

176
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,855
Don't feel like talking today?

177
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,028
Wanna play a game?

178
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,948
It's a mind-reading game.

179
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,867
Here's how it works:

180
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,244
I read your mind.

181
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,914
If what I say is right, you
take one step towards the chair.

182
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,083
If what I say is wrong,

183
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,086
you take one step back
towards the doorway.

184
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,382
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

185
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,677
If you reach the door, you can go.

186
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,681
Wanna play?

187
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,316
OK.

188
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,783
[humming]

189
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,168
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

190
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,798
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her,

191
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,218
so you think I'm not
going to be able to help you.

192
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:25,196
You're worried that
she said she told him things,

193
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,782
things she couldn't tell anyone else.

194
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,411
Secrets.

195
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,878
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

196
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,269
Your dad gave you
that watch as a present

197
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,354
just before he went away.

198
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,576
He forgot it in a drawer.

199
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,661
Doesn't work.

200
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,593
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

201
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,678
...you're a good student.

202
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,056
You've never really been
in any serious trouble.

203
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,274
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

204
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,359
Anything we wanted.

205
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,740
I drew a man...

206
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,494
...got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

207
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,999
You saw that on TV, Cole?

208
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,631
Everyone got upset.

209
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,468
They had a meeting.

210
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,678
Mom started crying.

211
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,598
I don't draw like that anymore.

212
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,519
How do you draw now?

213
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,857
Draw... people smiling...

214
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,943
...dogs running...

215
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,154
...rainbows.

216
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,950
They don't have
meetings about rainbows.

217
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,620
No.

218
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,747
I guess they don't.

219
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,758
What am I thinking now?

220
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,469
I don't know what you're thinking now.

221
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,562
I was thinking,

222
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,647
you're nice...

223
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,235
...but you can't help me.

224
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,417
[sighs]

225
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,503
I thought you meant
the other Italian restaurant

226
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,505
I asked you to marry me in.

227
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,970
[sighs]

228
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,014
I'm so sorry, Anna.

229
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,059
I just can't seem to keep track of time.

230
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,815
And I didn't have
a very good session today. I...

231
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,153
[sighs]

232
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,072
They're both so similar.

233
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,034
Same mannerisms,
same expressions, same...

234
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,411
...things hanging over their head.

235
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,249
I think it might be some kind of abuse.

236
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,212
Cole has... scratches on his arm.

237
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,673
I think they might be fingernail cuts.

238
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,843
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know, Anna.

239
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,511
[sighs]

240
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,889
Maybe a teacher or a neighbour.

241
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,476
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him, and...

242
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,561
...doesn't seem to fit.

243
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,316
Or I could just be wrong.

244
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,569
Maybe he's just a kid who
likes to climb trees a lot.

245
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,121
[sighs] Anna...

246
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,085
I know that I've been
a little distant. I...

247
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,545
I know that it makes
you mad. I just...

248
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,006
...feel like I'm being
given a second chance

249
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,258
and I don't want it to slip away.

250
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,929
Anna.

251
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,099
Happy anniversary.

252
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,608
[sighs]

253
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,069
[Cole] Stop looking at me.

254
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,905
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

255
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,615
OK.

256
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,286
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

257
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,372
He your best buddy?

258
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,457
He hates me.

259
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,960
Do you hate him?

260
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,670
No.

261
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,841
Did your mom set that up?

262
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,592
Yes.

263
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,556
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

264
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,891
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

265
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,019
She doesn't look at me like
everybody else. I don't want her to.

266
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,981
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

267
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,442
That I'm a freak.

268
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,652
Hey.

269
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,613
You are not a freak. OK?

270
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,992
Don't you believe anybody that
tries to convince you of that.

271
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,327
That's bullshit!

272
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,706
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

273
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,375
OK?

274
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,963
Come on.

275
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
You said the "S" word.

276
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,304
Yeah, I know.

277
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,014
Sorry.

278
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,102

279
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,836
[Malcolm] Your Dad lives in Pittsburgh
with a lady that works in a tollbooth?

280
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,675
[Cole] What if she has
to pee when she's working?

281
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,927
Think she just holds it?

282
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:48,639
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

283
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:54,436
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today. How come?

284
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:58,524
Well... sometimes we do
things to draw attention,

285
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:03,195
to express our feelings
about certain issues, uh,

286
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,990
divorce, whatever.

287
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,201
For example, a person might
leave something on a desk

288
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,036
for someone else to find.

289
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:19,044

free-association writing is, Cole?</i>

of paper and you start writing.</i>

<i>Have you ever done any
free-association writing, Cole?</i>

301
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,549
<i>Yes.</i>

302
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,135
<i>What did you write?</i>

303
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,430
Upset words.

304
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,560
Did you ever write any upset
words before your father left?

305
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,189
I don't remember.

306
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,859
Can you do something for me?

307
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,446
I want you to

308
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,407
think about what you want
to get out of our time together,

309
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,493
what our goals should be.

310
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,663
Something I want?

311
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,708
If you could change something
in your life, anything,

312
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,126
what would it be?

313
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,045
Instead of something I want,

314
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,547
can it be something I don't want?

315
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,176
OK.

316
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,137
I don't want to be scared anymore.

[Anna] Don't you see
enough of me at the store?

324
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:28,257
[man] I'm on my way out to the flea
market in the Amish country. I thought

325
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:32,094
you'd wanna come along and show me
how to buy at one of these things.

326
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,014
[Anna] I don't know if I can
deal with the Amish today.

327
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,100
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

328
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,270
[man] I just figured maybe
you just wanted to get some air

00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,731
because you'd seemed
kind of down lately.

330

[Anna] Um... I'm OK.

331
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,947

I should stop by on my way back

332
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,451

'Cause that wouldn't be a problem.

00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,792
OK, so I guess
I'm gonna get going then,

342
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,546
was capital
of the United States of America

343
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,801
from 1790 to 1800?

It's the city you live in.

- [kids] Philadelphia.
- Right, right.

346
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:06,021
Philadelphia's one of the
oldest cities in this country.

347

A lot of generations have
lived here and died here.

Almost any place you go in this city

Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

351

Can anyone guess what
this building was used for

00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,454
a hundred years ago,
before you went to school here,

353
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:25,582
before I went to this school, even?

358
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,811
No. Uh, that...
Mm-mmm. That's not correct.

359
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,479
Uh, where'd you hear that?

360
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,565
They'd pull the people in,

361
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,484
crying and kissing their families bye.

362
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:56,613
People watching... spit at them.

363
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,869
U-Uh, Cole, this-this building
was a legal courthouse.

364
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,704
Laws were passed here,

365
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,998
some of the very first laws
of this country.

366
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,251
This whole building was
full of lawyers, lawmakers.

367
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,837
They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

368
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,797
[kids giggling]

369
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,299
Um...

370
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,594
I don't... I don't know which
one of these guys told you that,

371
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,014
but, um... they were
just trying to scare you.

372
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,860
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

373
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,155
Like what?

374
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,324
Stop it!

375
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,869
I, uh... I-I-I don't
know how else to look.

376
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,247
You're Stuttering Stanley!

377
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,501
Excuse me?

378
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,797
You talked funny when you went to school
here. You talked funny into high school.

379
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,300
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people.

380
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,968
It makes them feel bad.

381
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,012
- How did you...
- Stop looking at me!

382
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,390
<i>Who have you...
b-b-been speaking-mg to'?</i>

383
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,727
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

384
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,063
- Stop it.
- Stuttering Stanley!

385
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,398
- S-S-Stop... Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!

386
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,485
- Stuttering Stanley!
- S-S-Stop it.

387
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,987
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

388
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,324
Shut up, you f-f-f-freak!

389
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,258
Hey, big guy.

390
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,347
How's it going?

391
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,350
I don't wanna talk
about anything right now.

392
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,227
OK.

393
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,690
[children playing outside]

394
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,035
You like magic?

395
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,913
Hmm?

396
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:17,045
Observe: the magic penny.

397
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:20,048
Looks like an ordinary penny.

398
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,467
But I do my little magic shake, and...

399
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,513
...now it's in my right hand.

400
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,725
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

401
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,394
I do another little shake, and...

402
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,065
...right there in the vest pocket.

403
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,819
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

404
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,363
I do another little shake...

405
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,073
...and...

406
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,162
...right back in
the left hand where it started.

407
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,749
That isn't magic.

408
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,419
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

409
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:00,464
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

410
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,095
Think so?

411
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,724
I didn't know you were funny.

412
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,533
<i>[woman] Malcolm, sit your
cute butt down and listen up.</i>

413
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:33,538
<i>No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.</i>

414
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:37,334
<i>And you better make her happy.
And I'm not talking about no...</i>

415
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,212
<i>..."Mmm! This taste like
real butter" kind of happy.</i>

416
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,923
<i>I'm talking about...
What's up, girl?</i>

417
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,467
<i>"Julie Andrews,
mm-hmm, twirling around</i>

418
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,428
<i>like a mental patient on
a mountaintop" kind of happy.</i>

419
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,807
<i>Now, that's the kind
of happy I'm talking about.</i>

420
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,725
<i>Shh. Come here.</i>

421
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,061
<i>Shh. Don't tell her I told you,</i>

422
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,523
<i>but she said she knew she love you</i>

423
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,734
<i>from the first time
she met you on the street.</i>

424
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,530
<i>She'd do anything for you.</i>

425
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:10,325
<i>[sobbing] I love you guys.</i>

426
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,536
<i>[sniffling]</i>

427
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,288
<i>My nose is running. Turn it...</i>

428
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,850
[water running]

[rock music]

431
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,370
And then you do the magic shake.

432
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,081
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

433
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,709
...all the way back
to the hand it started in.

434
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,172
That's stupid.

435
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,551
It's supposed to be funny.

436
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,553
It's stupid.

437
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,597
I want my penny back.

438
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,768
[Mrs Sear] He doesn't
get invited places, so...

439
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,436
[woman] It's our pleasure.

440
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,773
Last time was a Chuck E Cheese
party a year ago.

441
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,650
He hid in one of those purple,

442
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,777
plastic tunnels and didn't come out.

443
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,364
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

444
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,283
- [woman] Excuse me.
- [Mrs Sear] Sorry.

445
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,648
[man] Sir.

446
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,693
Madam?

447
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,903
Is someone out there?

448
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,323
Open this door, please. Come on.

449
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,492
I can't breathe.

450
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,495
If you can hear me, open this door.

451
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,748
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

452
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:08,503
Open this door, or I'll break
through it and grab you!

453
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:11,464
The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.

454
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,966
For what?

455
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,094
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

456
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,346
You only had one line.

457
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,393
[Tommy] Darren, check it out.

458
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,437
Oh, yeah.

459
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,023
My dad made me invite him.

460
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,959
Happy birthday, Darren.

461
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,296
Is there something
you wanna see in there?

462
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,048
No.

463
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,886
We're gonna put on a pretend play.

464
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,388
Wanna be in it?

465
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,140
OK.

466
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,435
<i>It's called Locked in the Dungeon.</i>

467
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,189
Yeah, Cole, and... you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

468
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,487
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

469
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,740
No! Don't!

470
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:23,078
I t - [pounding]

00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,831

[Cole] Help! Help! Help!

477
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,687
- Com?
- Oh, no!

478
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,272
- Help! Help!
- [pounding continues]

00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,067
- [screaming continues]

480
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,945
- Oh, God. ls there a key for this door?
- Help me!

481
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,114
Cole? Honey, honey, can you hear me?

482
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,950
- Open the door!
- God!

483
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,953
- No!
- [Mrs Sear screams]

484
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,956
- Oh, my God, Cole!
- Oh, my God! Help me!

485
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,125
- [pounding]
- Help! Help!

486
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,502
[latches clicking]

487
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,587
[silence]

00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,967
[heavy breathing]

489
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,598
[man] The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

490
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,892
He's doing fine.

491
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,478
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

492
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,151
[chuckles]

493
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,363
There's some cuts
and bruises on your son

494
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,491
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

495
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,537
Yeah, those are from sports.

496
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,462
You think I hurt my child?

497
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,217
You think I'm a bad mother?

498
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,720
Mrs Sloan over there,

499
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,473
she's a social worker with the hospital,

500
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,934
and she's gonna ask you
a couple procedural questions.

501
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,605
What happened to my child today?

502
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,691
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.

503
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,943
Something was very wrong!

504
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,074
Hey.

505
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,088
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

506
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,769
Once upon a time,
there was this young prince,

507
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:57,232
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

508
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,652
And he got his driver,

509
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,695
and they started driving.

510
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,739
Driving, driving.

511
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:10,662
Driving a lot, and, uh... um...

512
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,665
...they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

513
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,501
And...

514
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,550
Then he woke up, and he realised
they were still driving.

515
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,344
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr Crowe?

516
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,807
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

517
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,101
Uh, not too many, no.

518
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,687
Well, you have to add
some twists and stuff.

519
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,440
OK. Some twists.

520
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:44,404
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

521
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,782
Maybe they run out of gas.

522
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,868
They run out of gas?

523
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,037
That's good
'cause they're driving, right? OK...

524
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,498
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

525
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,336
You think I'm sad?

526
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,258
What makes you think that?

527
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,304
Your eyes told me.

528
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,892
I'm not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

529
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,900
[exhales]

530
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,406
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

531
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,160
He worked with children.

532
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,829
He loved it.

533
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,582
He loved it more than anything else.

534
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,671
And then one night,
he found out that he made a...

535
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,882
...mistake with one of them.

536
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,301
He couldn't help that one.

537
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:54,515
And he can't stop thinking
about it. He... can't forget.

538
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,647
Ever since then,
things have been different.

539
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:05,109
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

540
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:11,866
And his wife... doesn't like
the person that he's become.

541
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:15,912
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

542
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,669
And then one day, Malcolm
meets this wonderful little boy.

543
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,546
A really cool little boy.

544
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,384
Reminds him a lot of the other one.

545
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,973
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

546
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:41,771
...'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

547
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:46,192
be like... helping that other one too.

548
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,906
How does the story end?

549
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,451
I don't know.

550
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:16,014
I want to tell you my secret now.

551
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,769
OK.

552
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,321
I see dead people.

553
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,909
In your dreams?

554
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,122
While you're awake?

555
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:50,506
Dead people, like,
in graves and coffins?

556
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,801
Walking around like regular people.

557
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:56,888
They don't see each other.

558
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:00,308
They only see what they want to see.

559
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,603
They don't know they're dead.

560
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,399
How often do you see them?

561
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:14,322
All the time.

562
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,868
They're everywhere.

563
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,457
You won't tell anyone my secret, right?

564
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,251
No. I promise.

565
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,215
Will you stay here until I fall asleep?

566
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,843
Of course.

567
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,521
[Click]

568
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:51,400
[Malcolm] Cole... has pathologies
more severe than initially assessed.

569
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,155
He's suffering
from visual hallucinations,

570
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,908
- paranoia...
- [tyres screeching]

571
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:03,329
...some kind of...
school-age schizophrenia.

572
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,835
Medication, hospitalisation
may be required.

573
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,968
[sighs] And I'm not helping him.

574
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,663
[sighs]

575
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,135
[clears throat]

576
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,141
Hi. This is Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.

577
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:52,980
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I-I'd like
to talk to you about your boy

578
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:56,359
and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

579
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,235
[shuffling]

580
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,833
Mama?

581
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,169
No.

582
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,338
Dinner is not ready!

583
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,089
What are you gonna do?

584
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:44,508
Y-You can't hurt me anymore!

585
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,722
Lenny, you're
a terrible husband, Lenny!

586
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:53,059
Look what you made me do! Lenny!

587
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,436
[Cole sobbing]

588
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:06,947
[panting] I'm OK. OK. OK.

589
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,580
[Tommy] Once there was a boy,

590
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,416
very different from all the other boys.

591
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,127
He lived in the jungle...

592
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,090
...and he could speak
to the animals.

593
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,468
- [piano music]
- [camcorders whirring]

594
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,639
[kids making animal noises]

595
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,849
[applause]

596
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,690
[Cole] Did you think
the play sucked big time?

597
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:44,652
Heh. What?

598
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,738
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

599
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:51,075
He said everyone was
self-conscious and unrealistic.

600
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,411
He said the play sucked big time.

601
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:56,247
This Tommy kid sounds like a real punk.

602
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,919
I thought the play was
excellent. Better than Cats.

603
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,505
- Cats?
- Never mind.

604
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,259
Cole, I was really interested

605
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,469
in what you told me at the hospital.

606
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:13,013
I'd like to hear more about it.

607
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,942
Cole?

608
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,530
What?

609
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,712
Something up there?

610
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,343
Cole?

611
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,891
I don't see anything.

612
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,272
Be real still.

613
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,237
Sometimes you feel it inside,

614
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,032
like you're falling down real fast,

615
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,743
but you're really just standing still.

616
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:25,085
Do you ever feel the prickly
things on the back of your neck?

617
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,796
Yes.

618
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,967
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

619
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,886
Yes.

620
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,224
That's them.

621
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,687
When they get mad...

622
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,777
...it gets cold.

623
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:10,923
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

624
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,426
Cole?

625
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,431
Please make them leave.

626
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,475
I'm workin' on it.

627
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,688
Come on.

628
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,218
Aah! [laughing]

629
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,360
<i>Mommy, Daddy?</i>

630
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,363
[coughing]

631
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,741
<i>My throat hurts.</i>

632
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,126
<i>Run! Run!</i>

633
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,005
[announcer]
<i>Pedia Ease cough suppressant.</i>

634
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:35,424
<i>Gentle, fast, eff...</i>

635
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,760
Cole.

636
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,555
Oh, I don't care what they say.
This thing is broken.

637
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,398
Take 'em off.

638
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,488
I don't want them on my table.

639
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:05,371
I saw what was in your bureau
drawer when I was cleaning.

640
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,623
Got something you want to confess?

641
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,169
Hmm?

642
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,923
The bumblebee pendant?
Why do you keep taking it?

643
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,721
It was Grandma's.

644
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,100
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

645
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,271
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

646
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,274
That's right.

647
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:42,199
Sometimes people think
they lose things...

648
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:47,830
...and they really didn't
lose them, it just gets moved.

649
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,416
So did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

650
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,217
Don't get mad.

651
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,344
So who moved it this time?

652
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:05,764
Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant

653
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:08,892
out of my closet and placed
it nicely in your drawer.

654
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,564
- Maybe.
- God, I am so tired, Cole.

655
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,150
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,

656
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,986
I'm... tired in my heart.

657
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:22,322
I need some help. You know,
I don't know if you noticed,

658
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,701
but our little family
isn't doing so good.

659
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:30,164
I mean, I've been praying,
but I must not be praying right.

660
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:34,668
Looks like we're just gonna have
to answer each other's prayers.

661
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,716
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

662
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,723
Now, tell me, baby.
I-l... I won't get mad, honey.

663
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,642
Did you take the bumblebee pendant?

664
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,361
- No.
- [silverware clatters]

665
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,408
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

666
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,120
Go!

667
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,175
[barking, whimpering]

668
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,223
[gasps]

669
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,229
Hey, come on.

670
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,148
I'll show you where
my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

671
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,653
[dog whimpering]

672
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:47,366
[sobbing] Sebastian, come on.

673
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,243
Mama?

674
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,585
If you're not very mad,

675
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:01,338
can I sleep in your bed tonight?

676
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,676
Look at my face.

677
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,928
I'm not very mad.

678
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,561
Baby, why are you shaking?

679
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:18,814
Cole, what's wrong?

680
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,693
Oh, God, please tell me!

681
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,778
Oh, please.

682
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,158
Oh.

683
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,961
[Anna] It's Edwardian,

684
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,797
beautifully worked
with mine-cut diamonds

685
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:47,134
and an actual colour Burmese sapphire.

686
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,845
It's timeless.

687
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,763
Oh.

688
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,975
You, uh... [clears throat]

689
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,227
...got anything a little plainer?

690
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:59,146
Plainer?

691
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:02,816
You want a plain ring to go with
your plain fiancé? Is that how it is?

692
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,069
No! Baby, don't... don't get in a tizzy.

693
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,657
Uh...

694
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,452
You're so beautiful.

695
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,164
Y-You're like a Burmese
sapphire all by yourself.

696
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,208
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

697
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:24,963
Why don't you try it on and see
how you both feel about it?

698
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,679
There. How does that feel?

699
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:37,643
I think this piece, um,
communicates a longing.

700
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:41,313
I imagine that the woman who owned it

701
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:44,191
loved a man that she couldn't be with.

702
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:49,154
Did he have wavy hair and chestnut eyes?

703
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:53,325
- What?
- Um, I-l don't know, but...

704
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:56,328
...a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

705
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,706
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

706
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:05,420
I think maybe when people own
things and then they pass away,

707
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:09,633
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

708
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,220
like... like fingerprints.

709
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,932
I'll just wrap it up.

710
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,608
You don't need a guy with a master's.

711
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,778
You need a wrestler with
a neck larger than his head.

712
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,781
[chuckles] No, I need
a wrestler with a master's.

713
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,576
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

714
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,620
- From you?
- Mm-hmm.

715
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,422
It's a...

716
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,590
...first edition.

717
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,592
- Wow.
- [giggles]

718
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,845
Oh, this is too much.

719
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,432
No. Took it out
of your Christmas bonus.

720
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,602
It's perfect, Anna.

721
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,771
Thanks.

722
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,857
[chuckles]

723
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,572
<i>[Cole] What do you want
more than anything?</i>

724
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,615
<i>[Malcolm] I don't know.</i>

725
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,826
<i>[Cole] I told you what I want.</i>

727
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,623
<i>[Malcolm] I know what I want.</i>

728
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,336
<i>I want to be able
to talk to my wife again...</i>

729
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,632
<i>...the way we used
to talk to each other...</i>

730
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:36,928
<i>...like there was no one
else in the world except us.</i>

731
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,974
<i>[Cole] How are you gonna do that?</i>

732
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,104
[sighs]

733
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,482
I can't be
your doctor anymore.

734
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:52,569
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

735
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,322
Bad things happen
when you do that.

736
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,451
Do you understand?

737
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:02,079
I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychol...

738
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,498
Don't fail me.

739
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,920
Don't give up. You're the only
one who can help me. I know it.

740
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,172
I can't help you.

741
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,177
You...

742
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,596
Someone else can help you.

743
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,851
You believe me, right?

744
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:32,192
Dr Crowe, you believe my secret, right?

745
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:37,114
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

746
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:50,043
How can you help me...

747
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,754
...if you don't believe me?

748
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,719
Some magic's real.

749
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:19,197
[Vincent] Do you know why
you're afraid when you're alone?

750
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,161
I do. I do.

752
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,252
<i>[Malcolm] I'm sorry about that, Vincent.</i>

753
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,046
<i>I hope I didn't leave
you alone too long.</i>

756
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,606

You won't believe.

<i>I never liked 'em either.</i>

765
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,473
<i>When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,</i>

766
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:30,185
<i>and I threw up chilli cheese
fries all over this male nurse.</i>

Dr Reed is on line two.</i>

I have to take this.</i>

- OK.</i>

01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,409
<i>Yo no quiero morir.</i>

784
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:12,746
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Yo no quiero morir!</i>

785
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,087
You been running around?

786
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,010
Make you feel better?

787
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,014
I like to run around.
It's good exercise.

788
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,895
Do you wanna ask me questions now?

789
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,650
Wanna be a lance corporal in Company M,
Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

790
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:45,612
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

791
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,489
Maybe later.

792
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,577
Something happened, didn't it?

793
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,040
You wiggin' out?

794
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,044
Yes.

795
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,962
I think I am.

796
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,968
[Malcolm] Do you know what
"yo no <i>quiero</i> morir" means?

797
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,430
It's Spanish. It means
"I don't want to die".

798
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,936
What do you think these ghosts
want when they talk to you?

799
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,695
I want you to think about it, Cole.

800
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,617
I want you to think
about it really carefully.

801
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,828
What do you think they want?

802
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:40,667
Just help.

803
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,545
That's right. That's what I think too.

804
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,381
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

805
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,509
And I think I might know
a way to make them go away.

806
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,344
How?

807
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,305
Listen to them.

808
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,435
What if they don't want help?

809
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:02,021
What if they're just angry and
they just want to hurt somebody?

810
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,399
I don't think that's the way it works.

811
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,484
How do you know for sure?

812
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,447
I don't.

813
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:32,927
Hey.

01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,222

What's... what's happening?

818
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,001
Cole!

819
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,423
What's...

821
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,850
What's happening to you?

822
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,145
Is someone hurting you?
I'll... I will kick their ass.

823
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:26,397
Cole, if they're hurting you...

824

I'm feeling much better now.

She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

840
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,135
I guess she did.

That's her sister.

through this with my father's cancer...

I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

848
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,926
[woman 2] How many...
how many doctors?

849
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,887
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

850
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,640
- I think so, yes.
- Oh.

851
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:20,608
I just heard the, uh...
the little one is falling ill now.

852
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,693
God help them.

853
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,174
Don't go home, OK?

854
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:47,260
I definitely won't.

855
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,108

Excuse me, mister.

Are you Kyra's daddy?

860
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,200
It's for you.

861
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,705

<i>We can dance for a little bit,</i>

- That's so great, honey.</i>

<i>It's time for your food.</i>

<i>Can I go outside if I eat this?</i>

875
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:52,857
<i>I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.</i>

876
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,733
We'll see.

877
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:58,529
<i>Don't say that it tastes funny.</i>

878
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:01,240

<i>Sammie's mom called.</i>

880
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,431
You were keeping her sick.

881
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:45,326
You liked it, she said.

882
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:50,331
She looked out for you.

883
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,084
Is Kyra coming back?

884
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:58,923
Not anymore.

885
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,390
- [Cole] All right.
- [woman] I think that's enough.

886
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:10,476
- That's enough makeup.
- OK.

887
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,979
They're calling for the stable boy.

888
01:27:14,063 --> 01:27:16,065
Oh, we have to hurry!

889
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,695
Who, uh... who were you talking to?

890
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:30,412
Just practising my lines.

891
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:37,044
[Cole] Thanks for giving me
this part, Mr Cunningham.

892
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:41,048
When I went to school here, there
was a terrible fire in the theatre.

893
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:43,133
They rebuilt the whole thing.

894
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,010
Yeah, I know.

895
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:49,014
[audience] Aw.

896
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,482
Only he who is pure of heart

897
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:01,318
can take the sword from the stone.

898
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,362
Let the boy try.

899
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,033
[scattered applause]

900
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:14,039
But he is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

901
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:16,125
Silence, village idiot.

902
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:20,045
Let the boy step forward.

903
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:46,155
[all gasp]

904
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:50,075
[all] Hail King Arthur!

905
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,161
[applause]

906
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,791
[kids] Yea!

907
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:00,127
- Hoorah!
- [applause]

908
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,379
[kids shouting]

909
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:08,344
[audience laughing]

910
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,972
[applause resumes]

911
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,855
[kids chattering]

912
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,194
I thought you were really
great in the play, Cole.

913
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,696
- Really?
- Yeah.

914
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,324
- You know what else?
- What?

915
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:33,327
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big-time.

916
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:36,455
Ha-ha-ha.

917
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:38,499
[chuckles]

918
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:45,297
I got an idea how you
can talk to your wife.

919
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:48,425
Wait till she's asleep.

920
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:52,179
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

921
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,647
I'm not gonna see you anymore, am I?

922
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,736
I think we said
everything we needed to say.

923
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:11,824
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

924
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,496
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

925
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:21,375
Just for pretend.

926
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:29,633
OK.

927
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,348
I'm gonna go now.

928
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:45,816
I'll see you tomorrow, Cole.

929
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,213
[siren wailing]

930
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,634
[chatter on police radio]

931
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:16,013
L-I'm OK, officer. I-I'm OK.

932
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,223
I don't know what happened.

933
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,898
[Lynn] Hmm.

934
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,735
Jeez, I hope nobody got hurt.

935
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:36,116
You're very quiet.

936
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,536
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

937
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:42,247
I have two jobs, baby.

938
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:45,459
You know how important
they are for us.

939
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,294
[sighs]

940
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:50,047
I'd give anything to have been there.

941
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:04,603
I'm ready to communicate with you now.

942
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:11,193
Communicate?

943
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,322
Tell you my secrets.

944
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:19,076
What is it?

945
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,958
You know the accident up there?

946
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,876
Yeah?

947
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,296
Someone got hurt.

948
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:33,465
They did?

949
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:35,384
A lady.

950
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,471
She died.

951
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:42,057
Oh, my God. What, you can see her?

952
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:45,102
Yes.

953
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,145
Where is she?

954
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:52,526
Standing next to my window.

955
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:01,827
Cole, you're scaring me.

956
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:05,664
They scare me too sometimes.

957
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,543
They?

958
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,340
Ghosts.

959
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:21,221
You see ghosts, Cole?

960
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,227
They want me to do things for them.

961
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,190
They... they talk to you?

962
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:35,360
They tell you to do things?

963
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:38,572
They're the ones that used to hurt me.

964
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:43,660
What are you thinking, Mama?

965
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,871
You think I'm a freak?

966
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:48,165
Look at my face.

967
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,418
I would never think
that about you. Ever.

968
01:33:52,586 --> 01:33:55,088
- Got it?
- Got it.

969
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,556
Just let me think for a minute.

970
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,562
Grandma says hi.

971
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:17,069
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

972
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,279
She just likes it a lot.

973
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:23,492
What?

974
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,244
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

975
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:30,957
Cole, that's very wrong.

976
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:34,044
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

977
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,588
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

978
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,299
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

979
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:45,305
She said... when you were little,

980
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:47,557
you and her had a fight

981
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,435
right before your dance recital.

982
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:57,609
You thought she didn't
come to see you dance.

983
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,365
She did.

984
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,581
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

985
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,627
She said you were like an angel.

986
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,384
She said...

987
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:25,637
...you came to the place
where they buried her...

988
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:30,308
...asked her a question.

989
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:35,605
She said the answer is...

990
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,526
..."Every day"-

991
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:44,281
What did you ask?

992
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:54,166
Do...

993
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:58,545
Do I make her proud?

994
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:04,551
Mama.

995
01:36:22,736 --> 01:36:25,238
[people laughing on TV]

996
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,248
<i>[man] Hi, everybody.</i>

997
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:38,919
<i>As most of you know,
I'm not used to doing this,</i>

998
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:42,881
<i>and, uh, I promised Anna that
I'd try not to embarrass her.</i>

999
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,966
<i>I'll leave that to her mother.</i>

all of you for coming</i>

<i>and for sharing this
wonderful day with us.</i>

1003
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:54,601
<i>It's, uh... bittersweet,
almost, for me,</i>

1004
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:57,312
<i>because I hate giving her up...</i>

1005
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,397
Anna?

1006
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:11,535
<i>I miss you.</i>

1007
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:20,001
I miss you too.

1008
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:22,921
Why, Malcolm?

1009
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,674
What?

1010
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:31,096
- What is it? What?
- Why did you leave me?

1011
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,015
I didn't leave you.

[Cole] <i>I</i> see people.

They don't know they're dead.

1016
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:10,427

<i>They're everywhere.</i>

1018

<i>They only see what they want to see.</i>

1019
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,994
[Malcolm] OK, Mikey.

1020

I think I can go now.

Just needed to do a couple things.

1038
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:57,552
I needed to help someone.

1039
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:02,474
I think I did.

1040
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:11,524
And I needed to tell you something.

1041
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,448
You were never second.
