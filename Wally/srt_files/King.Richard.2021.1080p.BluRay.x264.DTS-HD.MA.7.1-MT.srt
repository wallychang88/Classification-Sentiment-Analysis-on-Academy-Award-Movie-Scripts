1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,473
I'll take that. Thank you.

2
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,060
Where I grew up,
<i>Louisiana, Cedar Grove...</i>

3
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:06,065
<i>tennis was not a game peoples played.
We was too busy running from the Klan.</i>

4
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,695
<i>But here it is, when I'm interested
in a thing, I learn it.</i>

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,156
<i>How it works,
how the best peoples in the world do it.</i>

6
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,201
<i>And that's what I did with tennis,
with the girls.</i>

7
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,138
<i>If you look at the biggest servers;</i>

8
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>Sampras, Lendl, Connors,
you'll see the break of their wrists</i>

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,626
<i>is like a smack, like a high-five.</i>

10
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,045
<i>That's what you're looking for
when you hit it.</i>

11
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,213
<i>That "pop."</i>

12
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:34,594
All we need is a club...
for training, and clinics, the whole deal.

13
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,681
Everything the girls need
to go from prodigy to pro.

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,809
I wrote me a 78-page plan
for their whole career

15
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,185
before they was even born.

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,274
It was 1977,
I had watched this tennis match...

17
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,526
and, uh, I seen them get this girl,
Virginia Ruzici,

18
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,195
$40,000 for four days' work.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,282
And since I knew
I had only made $52,000 all year,

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,534
I knew I was in the wrong business.

21
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,663
Went home that night, told the wife,
"We need to make two more kids."

22
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,793
So that night I wrote up the plan.
One for Venus, one for Serena.

23
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,598
- All right. Step in a little bit more.
- Cover their whole tennis...

24
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,091
Cover their education,
foreign languages, everything.

25
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,945
- And now that plan say...
- All right, shorten it up.

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,222
It's time for us to come see you
to help turn them into champions.

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,892
Now, I know what you thinking,

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,771
"This family is from the ghetto.
How they gonna pay old me?"

29
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,815
Well, don't you worry about that.
We're not here to rob ya.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,317
We here to make you rich.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,277
You ever think about basketball?

32
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,531
Best of luck to you, I...

33
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,636
Okay, you making a mistake,
but I'm gonna let you make it.

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,410
- Okay.
- All right.

35
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,788
- Them pants look expensive.
- Oh, they are.

36
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,998
If I had a dollar
for every crazy parent

37
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,542
that told me their kid
would make it to number one,

38
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,169
well, I'd be a rich man.

39
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,757
- You look pretty rich to me.
- Well, there you go.

40
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,387
You need to open
your stance up a little more.

41
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,888
Your stance too closed.

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,390
Serena, those books
are bigger than you are.

43
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,665
No, they're not. I can do it.
I can carry more than you.

44
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,000
- And break your back while you're at it?
- Wanna bet?

45
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,961
Serena!

46
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,631
Phone book!

47
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,009
Phone book.

48
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,596
Phone book!

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,307
Phone book.

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,436
- Phone book!
- Girls.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,229
Hey.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,541
- Told you I'd win.
- You cheat.

53
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,024
- Hi, Mrs. Strickland.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,986
Now, you need to go tell your father
to stop working you so hard.

55
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,532
I seen y'all practicing in the rain.
The man is crazy.

56
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,202
Girls. Y'all go ahead back in the house.

57
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,622
Tell your sisters we leaving
in a few minutes.

58
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,750
We'll deliver
the rest of them books later.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,629
I ain't gonna tell you again,
do not talk to them kids.

60
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,049
Excuse me.
They came onto my lawn.

61
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,677
And somebody has gotta,
as hard as you're working 'em.

62
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,806
They work as hard as they need to
to stay off these streets.

63
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,809
I'm in the champion-raising business.

64
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,853
I got a book about it
about to come out soon.

65
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,272
Maybe I give a copy to your daughter.

66
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,108
- Remind me which corner she working on?
- Get off my property.

67
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,171
- Richard, leave that nosy woman alone.
- Yeah, just stop talking to my kids.

68
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,548
Got your little booty-hugging shorts.
You need some bigger shorts!

69
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,332
You know,
she just wanna rile you up.

70
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,283
- I gotta get to work.
- All right.

71
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,535
I think you riling me up

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,454
with them little nurse shoes on.

73
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,517
- I love them little nurse shoes.
- Get these girls to practice.

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,376
- All right. Have a good day.
- You, too.

75
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,980
Yes, I have my homework.

76
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,172
Keep turning those hips
if you wanna get that power.

77
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,507
Bye, Mom.

78
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,342
- Tunde, dang, you're a nerd.
- Stop.

79
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,052
Why you doing homework on a Saturday?

80
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,764
Because I am trying to get an A.
You should try it with your B-plus.

81
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,226
Where are we practicing today, Daddy?

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,020
- Yeah, where are we practicing?
- At the club.

83
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,523
And Serena,
stop saying everything Venus say.

84
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,483
Hope they don't steal our balls again.

85
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,402
Lyn, you probably told 'em to do it
so we wouldn't have to practice.

86
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,280
We got us a van full of balls.

87
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,325
And you don't need to be worrying about
what other folks is doing anyway.

88
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,845
You need to worry about what you doing.

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,080
We out here getting great,
that's what we need to be worrying about.

90
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,373
You understand that?

91
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,209
- Yes, Daddy, we do.
- All right.

92
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,127
Oh.

93
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:41,674
- Say hi to the peoples that's gone.
- Hi to the people that's gone.

94
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,600
I feel like I'm in church.

95
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,107
- Okay, who ready to work?
- We're ready to work!

96
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,907
- Say again?
- We're ready, Daddy.

97
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,076
All right, all right.
That's what I like to hear.

98
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,885
Stay up on your toes.
You're making too much noise.

99
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,182
King Richard,
don't get much rest ever, do you?

100
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,019
Don't nothing come
to a sleeper but a dream.

101
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,791
Are you ready to be dropped?

102
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,982
'Cause I will drop you.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,029
Oh, no, watch out. Watch out.

104
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,323
There you go.

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,927
Keep that wrist like the smack.
It's like with the "pop" on top.

106
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,232
Throw it to the sky.
Get this one over the fence.

107
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,873
I like that. Yeah, that's it.

108
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
There you go!

109
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,838
First drill. Whoever hit that, one dollar.

110
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,926
Yes, yes, good power.

111
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,597
Yes, there you go. There you go.

112
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,809
Yes! Ooh, watch out, Martina.

113
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,353
Speed that racket head up.

114
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,439
Oh! Almost, Venus Williams!

115
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,400
Forehand.

116
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,946
Yes, you keep that stance open or else
I'mma come down there and tickle you.

117
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,740
Very good. Get to it. Get to it.

118
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,659
There you go! There you go!

119
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,079
Don't wait for that ball, go get it. Yes.

120
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,963
Good depth, good depth there.

121
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,549
Switch it backhand.

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,345
Don't get too excited. This is your game.

123
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,616
Get it all the way up
to that cotton picker.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,391
All the way up to the sky.

125
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,019
Yes, Venus Williams. Come on in here.

126
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:03,315
That's a very, very good day today.
You did good work.

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,692
- Venus Williams...
- Hm?

128
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,403
- Who is your best friend?
- You, Daddy.

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,779
Serena Williams...

130
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,364
- Who is your best friend?
- Venus.

131
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,302
- Then you, after Venus. It's okay.
- That's unbelievable. That's unbelievable.

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,327
Give your daddy a kiss.

133
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,705
Thank you. All right.

Pick your things up,

00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,557

Young man?

Now, that girl there is only 16 years old.
And she out here to work.

Hey yo, come on, homie, man.

- Come on, man.
- Hey, keep your old ass at home, homie.

169
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,161
Turn that music up!
Turn that music up!

170
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,288
Come over here
trippin' and shit, man.

171
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,257
Came over here
with that stupid shit.

172
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,425
Punk-ass nigga, say what?

173
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,895
Daddy, are you okay?

174
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,067
When I was your age
I used to have to fight every day.

175
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,445
If it wasn't the Ku Klux Klan
or the police or...

176
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,699
the white boys from the next town...

177
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,161
somebody was always
beating on me for something.

178
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,123
And I ain't had no daddy
to stand in their way.

179
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,962
This world ain't never had no respect
for Richard Williams.

180
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,174
But they gonna respect y'all.

181
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,428
They gonna respect y'all.

182
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,410
Somebody ought to call the cops on you.

183
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,247
Daddy, what's happening?

184
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,959
- Nothing, Junior. Go in the house.
- Okay.

185
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,214
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, girls, dinner's ready.

186
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,049
- How was practice?
- It was good.

187
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,675
Daddy got beat up again.

188
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,428
- Did you work on your serve?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,598
Tunde, get the plates.

190
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,726
If we eat fast enough we'll probably
have time for the talent show.

191
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,371
Oh, wait, hold on.
I'm going first.

192
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,855
- I already know what I'm singing.
- Let me guess...

193
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,654
<i>Because the greatest love of all...</i>

194
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,740
Stop! What's so funny?
The song is a great song.

195
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,909
- Move, move, move.
- Yes, ma'am.

196
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,993
Leave Serena alone.

197
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,037
- Here, give this out.
- Thank you, Mama.

198
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,205
Y'all go wash up.

199
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,381
What happened?

200
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,134
That same boy, sniffing around Tunde.

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,973
- Give me this.
- Thank you.

202
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,892
All right. I got to get to work.

203
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,981
Okay, girls, half hour.
Finish your homework, then get to bed.

204
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,984
- Y'all clean up.
- You got it? Yes, ma'am.

205
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,279
Something has to change.

206
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,032
- What you mean?
- We can't keep up this pace.

207
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,371
Me nursing all day, you working all night.

208
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,416
Coaching in-between.
Now look at your face.

209
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,043
Oh, I done already put this behind me.

210
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,981
Okay, we just got to stick to the plan.

211
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,089
We got champions in the other room.

212
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,967
Richard, we have done
a great job with them.

213
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,468
They are great.

214
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,313
But they're not going
to Wimbledon like this.

215
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,807
Not with hitting with you and me
on those raggedy courts.

216
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,812
They need better surfaces than...
They need better everything.

217
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,190
And not playing with you
with your busted-up feet.

218
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,027
My feets are fine. Okay?

219
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,323
Okay, actually they was hurting
out there a little bit today.

220
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,866
Oh, my gosh.

221
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,371
Richard, you playing. I'm serious.

222
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,498
I'm serious.

223
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,677
- You are right.
- I know I'm right.

224
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,928
Yeah.

225
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,932
You should have seen Venus
out there today.

226
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,229
Just something done clicked in her mind.
She is so ready.

227
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,482
- Yeah, she ready.
- She ready for that next level.

228
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,943
That shows me how
<i>And when the night falls</i>

229
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,070
She ready.

230
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,490
You got to trust me. Okay?

231
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,075
All right.

232
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,035
I'm gonna get us some help.

233
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,498
Venus and Serena
gonna shake up this world.

234
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,544
And they gonna need to
'cause they not gonna make it as singers.

235
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,881
They not 'cause...

236
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,259
Oh, Serena.

237
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:50,138
I got to get to work. All right?

238
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,390
That's what I want to hear.

239
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,476
<i>With somebody who loves me</i>

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,686
<i>Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance</i>

241
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,290
We're gonna shake up this world.

242
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,405
- Oh, I wanna dance...
- with somebody

243
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,133
- A basketball hoop?
- Dancing together? A hole?

244
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,157
Ballet?

245
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh, a ring? A basketball... hoop?

246
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,621
- Ten o'clock, girls. Time for bed.
- What was it?

247
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,373
- So, what was it?
- Saturn.

248
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,959
Oh!

249
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,672
All right. Y'all wrote in your journals?
Made your plans for tomorrow?

250
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,965
Yes, Daddy.

251
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,884
That's right. Got to have a plan
for every day, else what?

252
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,053
If you fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

253
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,472
- That's right. We not failing, are we?
- No, Daddy.

254
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,433
Okay, all the way to the top.

255
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,144
Come on, Meka. Just get in.

256
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,354
You know,
one day not too long from now,

257
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,816
somebody gonna hand you girls
a check for one million dollars.

258
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,445
And you gonna buy
as many beds as you want.

259
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,364
- In one check? Really?
- Maybe even a couple of 'em.

260
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,118
But we not gonna
be like this forever, okay?

261
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,788
- Okay.
- All right.

262
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,499
You girls go to bed.

263
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,418
Good night, Daddy.

264
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,367
As you notice, Vic,
<i>they have very good form.</i>

265
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:02,163
<i>And, uh, you can see
their serve looks very good... hopefully.</i>

266
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,083
<i>Raise your hand, Serena.</i>

267
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,668
<i>Venus Williams.</i>

268
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,301
<i>And, we have your tape, "Tennis Our Way,"
and we've been viewing it.</i>

269
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,596
<i>However, the tape say
you'll be good by Friday.</i>

270
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,888
<i>Well guess what, Vic...</i>

271
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,826
<i>we got good by Tuesday.</i>

272
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,143
<i>That's how good your tape is.</i>

273
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,771
<i>These girls is looking for some coaching,
and we think you'd be great.</i>

274
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,566
<i>So, you want to relax, take it easy...</i>

275
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,570
<i>and get a chance
to see some real good tennis players.</i>

276
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,779
That's it.

277
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,740
So I guess you made that yourself?

278
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,367
Yes, I did. Yes. Uh...

279
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,287
When the girls was younger,
I had bought me this camcorder.

280
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,957
So I filmed myself in the mirror
asking questions, things, and the such.

281
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,793
Then when they got older,
I start doing it with them.

282
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,795
I called it their "media training."

283
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,131
I see. Well, that's... very industrious.

284
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,134
Oh, yeah, I'm a businessman, Vic.

285
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,681
Uh, this deal you're asking for, you know,
all of this for... for free, Richard...

286
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,809
Nobody's taking that bet.

287
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,481
Tennis is a technical game,
you know, probably one of the most.

288
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,443
And if you didn't grow up
with the game, then...

289
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,862
It's like playing the violin.

290
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,323
You know, it takes hours and hours a day.

291
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,786
You know, year after year
of expensive expert instruction,

292
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,121
just to hold the thing right.

293
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:30,377
Yeah, and even then... even for families
with unlimited financial resources,

294
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,588
the chances of achieving the kind of...

295
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,676
mastery and success
that you're talking about...

296
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,762
I mean, for one kid,
let alone two, it's...

297
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,725
It's like asking somebody to believe
that you got the next two Mozarts

298
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,687
living in your house, you know?

299
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,732
It's just...
It's just very, very unlikely.

300
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,779
I'm sorry, that's... just my two cents.

301
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,948
- Yeah.
- I, uh...

302
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,159
- Yeah. Okay.
- Maybe you can prove me wrong.

303
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,628
Daddy?

304
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,
Jehovah, God...</i>

305
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,349
<i>we thank you for this food.</i>

306
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:31,312
We ask you to bless the hands
of the peoples that prepared this food.

307
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,775
We thank you for this opportunity
as a family to come together.

308
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,611
And we ask you to please...

309
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,864
please don't let nobody get fat

310
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,658
from eating all this food.

311
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,660
In Jesus's name we pray. Amen.

312
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,413
Amen.

313
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,852
Meka, I think
he was talking to you.

314
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,251
Oh!

315
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,190
- Look at all this cheese.
- What'd you get, Isha?

316
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,758
I got a little bit of work
I got to do. Uh...

317
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,302
Y'all ride home with your mother.
All right?

318
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,012
Everything okay? You all right?

319
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,097
Oh, everything's great.
Y'all just go and eat.

320
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,057
Bring... bring my food home when you come.

321
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,020
- Bye, Daddy.
- All right.

322
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,911
- You eating his food?
- Uh-huh.

323
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,763
Hey, where Tunde at, homie?

324
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,640
Roc, what you doin', man?

325
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,434
Did I stutter, nigga?

326
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,413
Hey, let's roll, homie.
Fool just went right now.

327
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,523
We bounce, we can smoke 'em.
Leave this old-ass dude alone.

328
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,984
You know what my daddy taught me?

329
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,197
How to smoke a blunt.

330
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,992
And how to smoke a bitch nigga, too.

331
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm real good at both.

332
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,796
What you scared for, homie?

333
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,094
Tell Tunde me and the homies might
come by later and run a train on her.

334
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
Oh! Oh, oh!

335
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,599
Get his ass! Get his ass!

336
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,104

Smoke him, homie.
On the turf, homie. Smoke him.

339
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,704
He came and disrespect you in our hood?

00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,499
Don't nobody give a damn
about you, homeboy.

341
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,211

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,873
Come on, Roc, wake up! Talk to me!

348
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,125

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

352
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,475
How many fingers am I holding up?

353
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,188
How you get all nine fingers
on one hand?

354
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,693
You fine.

00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,863
I'mma go take a shower.

356
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,762
Where are we

357
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,630
Yeah, where

358
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,674
We going some place special today.

359
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,759
These houses are huge.

360
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,428
Yes, that one looks like a castle.

361
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,514
- Y'all like these houses?
- Yes.

362
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,992
That one
looks like the White House.

363
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,351
Which one? Which one you like?
What's your favorite?

364
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,978
I like that one.

365
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,980
Yeah, that one's nice.

366
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,692
If that was my house, I'd put a pool
in the front and a slide on the roof.

367
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,546
- You'd put your pool in the front?
- Have a big pool party.

368
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,445
Everybody's gonna want to come

369
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,466
Oh, you just gonna be
the crazy lady on the block.

370
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,825
No. I'm gonna be
the coolest person on the block.

371
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,995
- That one has a tennis court.
- Oh, that's the one then.

372
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,246

00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,255
'Cause you got a plan
and you gonna stick to it.

376
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,634
When I was a little boy,
my moms used to say, "Son...

377
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,470
the most strongest, the most powerful,

378
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,515
the most dangerous creature
on this whole Earth

379
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,685
is a woman who know how to think.

380
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,438
Ain't nothing she can't do."

381
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,857
- Y'all know how to think?
- Yes, Daddy.

382
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,402
Now, these peoples we about to go see,
you gonna show them how dangerous you are?

383
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,653
Yes, Daddy.

384
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,322

00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,721
That's your dangerous face.

388
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,097
Okay, don't do that for the peoples.

389
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,401
- Don't do that.
- Don't do that.

390
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,197
That's a nice shirt.

391
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,301
Top of the morning to you.

392
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,235
Look at that. Look at that.
Come on.

393
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,907
- You see who that is?
- Yes.

394
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,533
- Who's that?
- John McEnroe.

395
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,245
- That's right. Who's that?
- That's Pete Sampras.

396
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,371
Mm-hm.

397
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,833
One day, they gonna be bragging
about the time they met the two of you.

398
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,755
- What are you doing, Johnny?
- What?

399
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,466
You know he's a smoker.
Get off your heels.

400
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,885
- Ah, screw you.
- Screw me?

401
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,512
All right, Pete, let's take a break.

402
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,348
Why are you guessing early?
Just read the toss.

403
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,785
It looked like
it was going outside.

404
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,726
- It did not.
- You see what he did?

405
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,020
Yeah, but that's what you've been
working so hard for...

406
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,064
- Excuse me, Mr. Cohen?
- Getting that shot...

407
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,232
Yeah?

408
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,235
Uh, Richard Williams.
We spoke on the phone.

409
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,321
- Oh, yeah. I remember. The brochure.
- Yep, that's right.

410
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,634
I actually brought you another one
in case you misplaced the first...

411
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,325
No, no, no. I got it.

412
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,618
What can I do for you?

413
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,223
Uh, well, we figured you was busy.
That's why we came to see you.

414
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,122
Yeah.

415
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,249
Everybody says
I got these two great tennis players

416
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,477
and we're still looking for a coach.

417
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,918
Oh, yeah, Mr. Wilson, listen.

418
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,355
- No, it's Williams.
- We're in the middle of practice here.

419
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,979
This my daughter, that's Venus.
This is my other daughter, Serena.

420
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,007
Nice to meet you, girls.

421
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,860
It won't take but a minute
to watch them hit a few balls.

422
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,697
I'm sorry. I'm not taking any juniors
now and we're in the middle of practice.

423
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,596
I don't mean to interrupt nothing,
Mac, Pete.

424
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,056
Oh, tough break at Wimbledon.

425
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,952
I seen what happened to you, Mac.

426
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,602
Uh, you gonna win again.
Just keep your head up.

427
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,957
- Mr. Williams, this is not a good time.
- Wait. Listen. Look...

428
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,983
- I just want you to watch them hit a few...
- We're in the middle of...

429
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,985
Look, Mac is gone. Mac is gone.

430
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,988
The way Pete whipping up on him,
he may never come back.

431
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,116
Pete, you don't mind if he just watch 'em
hit a few balls, do you?

432
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,659
It's okay with me.

433
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,121
See? Come on. Mac is gone.
Pete's okay. We ready.

434
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,683
You the only person

435
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,291
Come on. Watch 'em hit a few balls.

436
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,186
You girls are pretty good, huh?

00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,962
Oh, they better than good.

00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,238
- Show him this magic.
- This'll take a minute.

442
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,681
Hey, that's their brochure, Pete.

443
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,328
Now you take a look at that.
I'mma have them sign it for you later.

444
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,560
- Come on, come on.
- Got it.

445
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,479
- So tell me your names again.
- I'm Venus.

446
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,231
- I'm Serena.
- Venus and Serena. I'm Paul.

447
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,485
Uh, no, no, you not Paul.
You Mr. Cohen.

448
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,652
Mr. Cohen, right.

449
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,780
All right, Serena,
why don't you start at forehand?

450
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,092
Venus, backhand.
We'll hit some down the line, all right?

451
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,094
That's good, Paul.
That's how I usually start with 'em too.

452
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,535
- That's real smart.
- Good.

453
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,162
All right, ready?

454
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,426
That's right.
Show him the magic.

455
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,471
There you go.
Good power, Venus Williams.

456
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,598
That's it.

457
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,936
- What you think, Pete?
- They look good.

458
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,772
They good. I know they good.
I know they good.

459
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,404
Pete Sampras is looking at you.
Pete Sampras gonna steal your stuff.

460
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,408
All right, great job, girls.

461
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,772
Serena, why don't you go get some water?
I wanna hit with your sister for a minute.

462
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,789
Venus, you want to try something
a little different?

463
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,707
Okay, so start in the middle.

464
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,085
I want you to go after
every single ball, all right?

465
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,271
I'm not gonna tell you
where they're coming.

466
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,712
But don't stop until we're done.

467
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,923
Oh, she do that. She'll do that.

468
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,594
There you go.

469
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,513
Okay, I want you
to recover each time.

470
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,354
Get it. Show it to him.

471
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
You have to show him that magic.

472
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,696
Yes.

473
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,740
There you go. There you go.

474
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:35,119
- Get it. All right.
- Okay.

475
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,122
Girls, come here and talk to me
for a second.

476
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,832
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

477
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,502
Let me ask you both something.

478
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,796
What do you want out of this?

479
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,507
I know what your dad wants,
but what about you?

480
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,928
Well, I want to win Wimbledon
as many times as anyone's ever won it.

481
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,014
You think you can do that?

482
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,390
I know I can.

483
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,395
What about you?
Who on the tour do you wanna play like?

484
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,901
Well, I'd like other people
to want to play like me.

485
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,695
I bet they will.

486
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,823
All right, you girls go pick 'em up.

487
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,830
Come on, Paul, let's go.

488
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,043
You taught 'em all this?

489
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,588
Oh, yeah, me and my wife Brandy.
We both athletes.

490
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,466
So, what you think?

491
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,406
- Is this a bee you're drawing?
- Yes, it is.

492
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,933
- You're not working on...
- I thought y'all were doing homework.

493
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,733
We got a coach.

494
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,450
You little fakers. You little fakers!

495
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,331
- Pete Sampras's coach?
- Sure as hell.

496
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,291
So he's gonna do it for free?

497
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:08,045
Uh... he said he can't do two for free.

498
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,630
What?

499
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,257
He only gonna teach Venus.

500
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,592
Okay, okay,
you should have seen Venus.

501
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,863
Pete Sampras was there and
I don't think he could beat her at all.

502
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,388
Sampras? Okay, Venus!

503
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,139
We were so good.

504
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,808
Did you tell Serena?

505
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,955
We only hit the net, like, twice.

506
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,354
Do you want to?

507
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,023
- Oh, Richard.
- Yeah.

508
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,984
We got a coach.
We got a coach.

509
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,610
We got a coach. We got a coach.

510
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,078
It's not fair. I want to go with you.

511
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,747
I know. I want you to, too.

512
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,460
Meka, Daddy said he's
gonna record everything

513
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,129
and then we can watch it together.

514
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,964
He has a plan, okay?

515
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,841
Yeah, for you.

516
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,468
Okay, Meka, your mom ready.
Y'all gonna practice today.

517
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,973
But Daddy, I can't practice on her court.
She always hits slices.

518
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,517
That ain't nothing but
a few minor adjustments.

519
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,563
You got to stay prepared
for whatever's unpredictable. Okay?

520
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,608
Come on now, give your daddy a kiss.

521
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,320
Don't put no mean on my face.
Come on. Daddy love you.

522
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,697
Mm? Come on, Junior, let's go.

523
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,833
I know you feel left out.
But you're not left out.

524
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,795
You got something great, too.

525
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,131
- What?
- Me.

526
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,259
Come on, we got work to do.

527
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,762
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

528
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,513
I ain't raised no poop butts.

529
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,767
- Mom.
- Come on. We got work to do.

530
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,562
Go. That's it. Back.
Center. And back.

531
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,125
What you're going through
is the Paul Cohen

532
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,983
first-strike strategic tennis system.

533
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,943
It's gonna turn you into a killer.

534
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,340
You'll learn to think
about this tennis court as a chess board

535
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,115
made up of 228 shots.

536
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,867
You will learn to perfect them all.

537
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,744
Did I say stop? Go, go, go.
Again.

538
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,829
Center.

539
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,374
Come on!
Up, up, up! Explode!

540
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,668
Side!

541
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,545
Up, up, up! Back!

542
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,675
Side, side, side, side.
I need you to be faster, Serena.

543
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,678
Twenty-four...

544
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,889
Twenty-five...
Oh, halfway there. Come on.

545
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,266
Twenty-six...

546
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,814
Oh! Come on, back to the middle each time.
Let's get 50.

547
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,816
Make sure you keep that stance open.

548
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,192
Please, Richard.

549
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,072
Oh! Blame your dad.

550
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,158
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
What are you doing?

551
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,661
This is it. What! That's it.

552
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,998
Trust it, trust it.

553
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,252
Better! Yes!

554
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,715
Yeah.

555
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,928
Let me see a little bit more pronation
on that wrist right at the end.

556
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,096
You just focus right here.

557
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,700
You know exactly what you're doing.

558
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,350
Do you want to be the best?
You can do it. You know why?

559
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,563
Because you're a killing machine.
You're a goddamn attack dog.

560
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,897
So bite.

561
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,627
Talk a little louder, Paul.
Can't hear you.

562
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,611
- That wasn't for you, Richard.
- Trying to record though, Paul.

563
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,530
You can interview me later.

564
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,702
- Yes! Yes!
- There you go.

565
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,246
That's what the pronation
gets you right there.

566
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,291
Really?

567
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,170
Yeah! Keep it up. Keep it up.

568
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,757
That's the move. Now get back
to the middle. Get back to the middle.

569
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,153
You never know where that ball's gonna go.
You gotta be ready.

570
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,803
Stay low, stay low, stay low...

571
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,346
Yeah, baby! Yes!

572
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,432
Go!

573
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,769
Get around it. That's it.

574
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,606
End the point. Recover, quick!
You gotta move faster.

575
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,460
Hold on, Junior, Junior. Junior.

576
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,234
Uh, Paul, one second.

577
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,046
Look, you just got a little
closed up that time.

578
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,382
You're doing real good.
You just gotta keep that stance open.

579
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,718
- You plant that right foot...
- What are you doing, Richard?

580
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,582
- That's how you get a little closed off.
- Richard, what are you doing?

581
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,098
I'm talking to my daughter.
Is something wrong with that?

582
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,581
No, nothing wrong with that.

583
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,393
Except you want me
to fix her stance and I can't do that

584
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,811
if you keep telling her to hit open.

585
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,587
Well, Paul, ain't no reason
to fix something that's not broke.

586
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,090
Okay? You've been hollering at the girl
all day long to get back to the middle.

587
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,635
That's all I hear you saying.
Yet you instructing her

588
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,113
- to close her stance.
- That's right.

589
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,889
How can she get back to the middle
with her stance all closed up?

590
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,267
Okay, if she stays open,
she can plant that foot.

591
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,229
- More power, more speed.
- No! That is not how you get power.

592
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,106
You want power in your stroke,
you square your shoulders,

593
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,734
you close your stance,
hold your head right at contact,

594
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,237
and blast through it.
You do not hit open stance.

595
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,613
- Okay?
- Yep.

596
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,801
- Can we please get back to it?
- Well, just keep your mind open, Paul.

597
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,345
You know, just in case you not
the smartest person in the whole world.

598
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,055
It would be really helpful
if we could actually hit a few.

599
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,959
Because I got about 18 minutes left
and I'd like to finish this practice.

600
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,041
It just don't make no sense
what you sayin', Paul.

601
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,460
If she keep her stance closed,
feet are all jumbled up,

602
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,045
she not gonna be able to get back.

603
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,899
I'll get my lesson from you
when we're done, okay?

604
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,151
- Right now, I'd like to focus on Venus.
- I keep forgetting you know everything.

605
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,510
- 17 minutes now.
- I keep forgetting that.

606
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,886
That's it!

607
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,581
Okay, just as long as she hits some open.

608
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,870
- Keep that stance open, Junior.
- Now, recover, recover, recover.

609
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,232
Get around it. Get around it.
I want a forehand.

610
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,360
I want a forehand. Get back to center.
There you go!

611
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,969
Great serve.
<i>You know, Capriati is really...</i>

612
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,618
Dang, that's Capriati?

613
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,620
Now, she's a freaking killer.

614
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,624
Won the Junior Orange Bowl in Miami
in the US 18-and-Under when she was 12.

615
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,042
Just went pro last year.

616
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,628
That's her coach, Rick Macci.
He's in Florida.

617
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,714
Not as dumb as the rest, but...

618
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,675
She is the youngest pro ever
to be ranked in the top ten.

619
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,637
And guess what she just did?
She just beat Steffi Graf.

620
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,390
How do you think she learned
how to do that? Juniors.

621
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,434
That's where the fight is.

622
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,519
That's where you face adversity,
competition.

623
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,813
It's also where you get noticed by agents

624
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,251
who can help you pay for the training
and introduce you to sponsors.

625
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,985
Capriati signed a two million dollar
contract with Diadora

626
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,613
before she played a single pro match.

627
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,948
How do you think that happened? Juniors.

628
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,413
So what do you guys say?
Want to play Juniors?

629
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,293
I think I can add that to the plan.

630
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,212
We'll play some Juniors.

631
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,595
Come on. Come on.
Do you feel good?

632
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,805
- Yes. I'm excited.
- Okay.

633
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,894
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Did you see that, Mom?

634
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,357
It's okay. They're just not used to
seeing good-looking peoples like us.

635
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,109
You don't worry about them.
Let them worry about you, Venus.

636
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,570
Oh, this it. This it right here.

637
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,659
Come on, come on, come on.
Just leave your stuff there.

638
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,262
- Kick her butt.
- All right, y'all.

639
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,245
- Have fun. Bye.
- Okay. Love you.

640
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,330
All right.

641
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,543
Okay. You just focus on that ball.
Okay?

642
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,630
You... are Venus Williams.

643
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,007
You gonna win Wimbledon.

644
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,929
These girls ain't never gonna want
to see your name in their draw. Okay?

645
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,932
- Okay, Daddy.
- You just go out there and have fun.

646
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,518
I know. I got this.

647
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,103
- All right.
- Okay. I love you.

648
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,521
I love you.

649
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,340
All right, girls, meet at the net.

650
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,397
Best of three sets.
Tiebreaks at six-all.

651
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,065
I'm covering three courts.

652
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,402
So keep your own score
and call your own lines.

653
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,617
Good luck.

654
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,206
Okay, up or down?

655
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,376
Up, I guess. Thanks.

656
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,174
Down. You can serve.

657
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,233
She knows who she is.
We've done our job.

658
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,443
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,028
- She'll be fine.
- Mm-hm.

660
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,281
- Come on, V, you got this.
- Good luck, V!

661
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,658
Come on, Venus!

662
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,749
She's nervous. Take a step up.

663
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,729
You just have some fun
out there, Venus Williams.

664
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,420
That's all this about. Have some fun.

665
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,683
Good job, V!

666
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,353
Maybe she ought to take
a few more steps up.

667
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,230
Just get some place safe.

668
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,399
Don't move.

669
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,831
You are so freaking stupid.

670
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,166
- All right, Venus!
- Go, Venus!

671
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,711
All right, V.

672
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,006
- You watching?
- Mm-hm.

673
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,680
- You're so bad!
- Yes!

674
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,892
- Damn!
- Great job!

675
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,081
I am talking to you.
I am talking to you.

676
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,523
Do you even want to be
out there right now? Do you?

677
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,442
Because the way that you just played,
it's hard to believe that you do.

678
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,865
Thank you.

679
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,535
Venus!

680
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,676
- Get in here, get in here.
- I'm so proud of you!

681
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,350
- Get in my picture.
- Take a picture.

682
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,083
Come on, come on. Come on, Paul!

683
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,045
- Say, "Venus!"
- Venus!

684
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,672
That's it. That's it.

685
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,636
Bad sportsmanship.

686
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,306
Yes!

687
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,266
Can I take a picture with the winner!

688
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,216
Right there. Hold it.

689
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,749
- You look so good.
- So proud of you.

690
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,858
Let's go, Venus.

691
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,570
Hey, Kelly. Kelly, Kelly.
It was out. Call it.

692
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,322
It was out.

693
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,842
- What?
- I know, she's lying.

694
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,658
No, no... no, it wasn't.

695
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,597
- It wasn't out, though.
- Can they do that?

696
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,974
- It's all right. That's okay, Junior.
- They can't do that.

697
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,957
Just do what you do.

698
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,585
- Just cheating.
- That's all right.

699
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,128
Just watch this one.

700
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,924
- Come on, Venus.
- You got this, V.

701
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,300
30-40.

702
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,564
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, V, good job! Yeah!

703
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,568
All right. All right. All right.
That's it.

704
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,301
- Come on, y'all.
- What's wrong?

705
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,969
- That's okay.
- What's wrong? You won.

706
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,953
Okay, you can smile. You can smile.

707
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,623
That was good.
A little adversity, that's okay.

708
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,262
- You're missing it.
- No, I can hear everything with that ball.

709
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,882
- Good play.
- Come on!

710
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,300
You got this.

711
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,101
- Did you see any of it?
- Yeah, I saw some of that.

712
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,647
- Okay, come on, y'all. Come on.
- Wait, where's Meka? She okay?

713
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,608
Yeah, she's fine. She's just bored.
Said she knew you would win.

714
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,572
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

715
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,657
Did you see it?

716
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,470
I told you
that girl was a pusher.

717
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,121
Yeah, Paul calls that
"playing patty-cake."

718
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,123
That's why she got moded.

719
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,794
Moded. Corroded.
Your booty exploded.

720
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,422
40-15.

721
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,260
Thank you.

722
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,853
Cheese!

723
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,582
There you go. There you go.

724
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,440
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

725
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,044
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

726
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,748
- You did real good.
- Bye.

727
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,297
You should be very proud of yourself.

728
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,280
You did good. Well done.

729
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,449
Mommy, look!

730
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,120
The first place Junior Tennis Tournament
is presented to...

731
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,747
Venus Williams!

732
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,086
- Go, V!
- She won!

733
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,171
She won. She won.

734
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,466
Moded. Corroded.
Your booty exploded.

735
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,011
That looked kinda heavy up there.
Let me see.

736
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,223
Let me see that big ol' thing.
Ooh, I'm about to drop it.

737
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,809
- Were you nervous at all, V?
- Why is she nervous?

738
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,145
That girl looked like she was 18
and Venus still whupped her anyway.

739
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,356
- Yeah!
- Yes, she did.

740
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,192
Okay, that's enough of that back there.
No more tennis talk.

741
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,153
- And stop all that bragging.
- Daddy, we're not bragging.

742
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,197
Oh, you're not? What you doing?

743
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,700
I mean, it's just the truth and...
here's the proof.

744
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:33,887
That's right.

745
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,579
All right now, let's hear what I'm saying.
Stop all that bragging.

746
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,415
Richard, they're not bragging.

747
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,477
- They bragging. I'm listening to 'em.
- They're having fun.

748
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,562
- I know what bragging sounds like.
- The girl won. She's just happy.

749
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,422
Look, Junior won, the other girl lost.
Everybody did their best.

750
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,841
And I'm not gonna hear
no more about it now.

751
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,514
If that was that girl's best,
then she needs to practice some more.

752
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,308
I'm just sayin'. Jeez.

753
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,945
Okay, you big shots. Here's five bucks.
Go on and get me something to drink.

754
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,655
- I wanna get something...
- Stop!

755
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,241
- Give the money to Tunde.
- Stop arguing.

756
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,494
Why they always taking the money from me?
Daddy gave it to me, not you, Tunde.

757
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,179
Richard... where are you going?

758
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:37,348
They wanna brag, let them brag
about how they walked three miles home.

759
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,517
Richard, you can't leave
those girls like that!

760
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,038
I done told them I didn't wanna hear
nothing about no tennis and no bragging.

761
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,397
Stop! Stop!

762
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,462
You can't leave them back there like that.
Leaving 'em out on the streets like that.

763
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,237
- You can't do that.
- Okay, look at me. Listen here.

764
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,531
I'm listening.
You go back and get my girls.

765
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,991
When these matches is over,

766
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,620
I don't wanna hear nothing
about no tennis. Okay?

767
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,955
They can talk about Kingdom Hall,

768
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,541
they can talk about dinosaurs,
they can talk about space.

769
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,667
Space?

770
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,587
Why is it that you gotta ruin
everybody else's day?

771
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,311
You don't wanna be happy so you
don't want nobody else to be happy.

772
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,611
This ain't about being happy.
It's about bragging.

773
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,029
You don't want
nobody else to be happy

774
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,845
so you gotta make everybody else upset.

775
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,515
I have never in my life...
Never, ever, met somebody

776
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,934
who just don't want to be happy.

777
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,330
- I don't want no bragging.
- You go back and get my girls.

778
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,914
- They coming now.
- That's what you do.

779
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,648
They right down on the street.

780
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,486
I can't believe he done left us.

781
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,283
Daddy, where were you going?
I thought you were leaving us.

782
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,245
Yeah, I was. Thank your mother.
She made me come back.

783
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,663
Who got my change?

784
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,791
Family meeting.

785
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,292
We gonna watch something.

786
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,506
We gonna watch. We gonna learn.

787
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,513
<i>Cinderella?</i>

788
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:22,996
Okay.

789
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,712
Okay, what you learn?

790
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,090
- Isha?
- To be polite?

791
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,592
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

792
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,969
- That's good. Lyn?
- To be brave.

793
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,389
Brave? Explain how you mean.

794
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,833
Well, you gotta be pretty brave
to take a ride in a pumpkin.

795
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,022
- Okay, go to your room.
- But...

796
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,792
'Cause you fooling with me,
and I'm not fooling with you.

797
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,317
Go ahead, go to your room.

798
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,236
- Okay!
- Junior?

799
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,325
Never stop dreaming, I guess.

800
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,786
Mm-hm. That's good. Come on, Meek.

801
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,414
Remember your shoes?

802
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,584
Okay, that's good,
but everybody's wrong.

803
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,962
- So we gonna watch the film again.
- No, Richard. No.

804
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,007
Lyn, come on out here.
We watching this film again.

805
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,469
No, ain't nobody listening.
If you're not gonna listen to the film...

806
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,197
They answered your questions.

807
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,349
- They answered your questions.
- Okay. All right. Hold on. Hold on.

808
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,143
The point is she was humble.

809
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,899
No matter how them peoples treated her,
no matter how disrespected...

810
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,403
she stayed calm,
she kept her heart clean.

811
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,030
She was humble.

812
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,177
Now, we gonna go out here
and we gonna play these matches

813
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,202
and we gonna compete.

814
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,455
But we gonna stay humble
else we not gonna do it.

815
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,293
All right,
y'all can go ahead with yourself.

816
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,305
You feel good about yourself?

817
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,602
- I mean, I think they got the point.
- Never drive off on my kids again.

818
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,731
- Oh, that's where you still at?
- Ever. Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

821
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,417
If they hit the ground, they gonna skid.

822
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,377
I need you to take it right out the air.

823
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,421
Take it right out the air.

824
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,588
Right out the air.

825
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,048

00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,300
I like that. I like that.

827
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:45,471
Don't let it bounce. Don't let it bounce.
Don't let it bounce.

828
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,266
Boom! Boom!

That's the shot I got to call the police.

00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,378

00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,099
Come on.

837
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,968
- Daddy, why are the police here?
- I don't know.

838
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,410
So you sometimes don't get
to have dinner before you go to sleep?

839
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,559
No, ma'am.

840
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,978
What's going on? Everybody okay?

841
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,605
They got a call.

842
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,150
Said there was trouble in the house,
that we were being rough with the girls,

843
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,069
and they needed to look.

844
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,113
- A call from who?
- Not at liberty to say.

845
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,160
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

846
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,329
You all need to look around?

847
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,456
Go ahead, you can check on
in the cupboards.

848
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,936
Maybe you can go check under their beds,
make sure there's no monsters.

849
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,919
It's a little wet for practice,
don't you think?

850
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,883
- Don't the girls have schoolwork to do?
- They do their homework.

851
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,093
Tunde's first in her class.
Lyn and Isha are too.

852
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,388
That's right. Girls, spell "civilization."

853
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,600
C-I-V-I-L-I-Z-A-T-I-O-N.

854
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,395
- Mr. Williams, this is not necessary.
- Hold on. Hold on.

855
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,648
You wanna check on the kids?
Let's check on the kids.

856
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:07,947
We got future doctors and lawyers,
plus a couple tennis stars in this house.

857
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,075
Now, I understand you got to do your job,

858
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,746
even if some crazy-ass neighbor do call,
talking foolishness.

859
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,551
And I don't even mind you saying
we hard on these kids, you know why?

860
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,167
'Cause we are!

861
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,254
That's our job,
to keep 'em off these streets.

862
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,757
You want to arrest us for that? Fine.

863
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,176
But what you not gonna never do
is come knock on this door

864
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,346
talking about you had to blow their
damn brains out in them streets

865
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,266
'cause they running with hoodlums
and doing drugs and things.

866
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,019
That's what you not never gonna say
in this house.

867
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,607
You wanna arrest us for that?
That's fine.

868
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,003
You need to be arresting them parents
at them tennis matches.

869
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,361
That's who needs to be getting arrested.

870
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,123
Just over there
bustin' his chops.

871
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,768
- You know how these police be.
- Mm-hm.

872
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,378
As usual. No business.

873
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,663
- Hey, where you going?
- I'll be back.

874
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,737
- Hey, Betty.
- Oracene.

875
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,323
- I've never been over here before.
- You haven't.

876
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,367
- That's a shame.
- It is.

877
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,162
I know you know how hard it is
raising a daughter.

878
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,582
I have five of them.

879
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,709
Five.

880
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,965
Don't make me come back over here again.

881
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,101
All right, Venus,
you're running a little late.

882
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,925
It's about to start.
So you're on court three.

883
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,229
- Good luck out there.
- Thank you.

884
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,878
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

885
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,590
Can't be the only Black peoples here
and be late.

886
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,385
- Hey.
- Hi.

887
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,263
- Name?
- Tiffany. Last name is Tanner.

888
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,849
Serena Williams. Ten and under.
I'm signing in, too.

889
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,309
Oh. Okay. Let me find you here.

890
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,521
You are on court nine.
I'll send your opponent right over.

891
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,772
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

892
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,736
There you go.

893
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,488
Great shot, Venus Williams. Good decision.

894
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,574
Your daughter looks good out there.

895
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,451
Yeah, thank you.
She a little tight today.

896
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,329
No, I mean the little one.
She looks like a champ, too.

897
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,207
Could have warned us, man.
I didn't know you had two.

898
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,284
May as well let her finish.

899
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,578
Come on!

900
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,038
Whoo!

901
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,422
What you doing?

902
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,968
You done started,
now you might as well finish.

903
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,014
Go on. Just make sure you have fun.

904
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,016
That's all we here to do.
Go ahead. Have fun.

905
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,687
Serena Williams!

906
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,399
- You knew about this?
- No.

907
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,401
Mm-mm.

908
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,821
That's real.

909
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,491
Hey, you want it? We can swap.

910
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,410
- I like silver better anyway.
- Good. I like gold.

911
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,916
"At a time when tennis prodigies
seem to be surfacing every week,

912
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,294

Venus Williams."

913
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,173
There she go.

914
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:40,177

"Her concentration was excellent.
Boy, did she wax me."

924
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,619
- That's from Dorothy Cheney, y'all.
- Dang, Venus, you're famous.

925
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,140
One step at a time.

926
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:10,541

938
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,486
The guy's an agent and wants
to talk to you about representation.

939
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,784
<i>I was at a clinic in Oakland,</i>

942

943
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,307
Pretty incredible.

944
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,811
Your girls are standing with the former
First Lady of the United States.

945
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,563
You did that.

946
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,191
<i>Enjoy the tennis, everyone.</i>

947
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,158
There's the man.

948
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:29,328
Richard, I want you to meet
George MacArthur and Laird Stabler.

949
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,830
- George. Laird. Hi.
- Richard, nice to meet you.

950
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,643
- We spoke on the phone.
- Oh, that's right. Good to meet you.

951
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,394
George is the head of their agency,
right here.

952
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,021
- That the big boss.
- That's the big boss right there.

953
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,629
- Yeah, I can tell by the cigar.
- Oh.

954
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,732
Sit down, guys.

955
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,674
- Come on, sit down.
- Oh, thank you, yes.

956
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,760
Heck of a girl you got there.
Just incredible.

957
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,554
Love to help you take her
to the next level. Yeah.

958
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,974
- Can I get you anything?
- Usual.

959
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,203
- Fine, thank you.
- I'll have an Arnold Palmer, please.

960
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,519
I'm good.

961
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,481
Well, thanks for coming, Richard.
What do you think of the club?

962
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,692
Oh, it's really great.

963
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,404
We appreciate everybody taking off
their hoods before we came in.

964
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,508
- Richard...
- We like that.

965
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,741
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

966
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,744
It's, uh... We've been here
a couple of times.

967
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:13,747
Well, uh, Richard, first off,
we would just like to congratulate you

968
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:17,501
on a great job you've done so far.
Quite honestly, it's incredible.

969
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,211
- It's incredible?
- Yes.

970
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,847
I'm sure you know,
but Laird here is the best.

971
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,284
- Mm-hm.
- Well...

972
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,518
He discovered Capriati when she was ten.
Mary Pierce, too.

973
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,854
And we believe that Venus
can be bigger than both.

974
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,939
I'm sorry, you, uh...

975
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,443
You said two times already.
You said it's incredible.

976
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:46,947
- Yeah.
- And why is what we did so incredible?

977
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,950
Oh, I just meant with your resources
and your experiences.

978
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,202
Richard, I think all that
Laird is saying is that

979
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,889
you've done an incredible job
with the girls.

980
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,831
Hold on. Hold on, Paul.

981
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,918
That is a full-grown adult man
sitting right there.

982
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,546
He don't need you to say what he said.

983
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,151
If you was gonna say what he said,
you could have said it back at the house.

984
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,855
We could have saved everybody
the trouble of coming to this meeting.

985
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,430
Now, I asked this man
a simplified question.

986
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,224
He over-emphasizing
how incredible it is...

987
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,809
"it's so incredible" what we did.

988
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,539
I see all these white kids around here.
He ain't saying how incredible that is.

989
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,957
Let him answer the question.

990
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,460
- Okay. That's why we're here.
- Why it's so incredible what we did?

991
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,692
We're here to ask questions.

992
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,528
I'm sorry. I mean,
I certainly did not mean to...

993
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,864
make any offense there, Mr. Williams.
I'm very sorry.

994
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,217
I just meant with your background...

995
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,535
Our background. Now, of course,
what you mean is our race.

996
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,497
No, it's okay. I get it.

997
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,916
You know, little Black girl,
all-white sport.

998
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,501
That's why we picked tennis.

999
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:45,881
Your little, uh... ghetto Cinderella.
Your Ghetto-rella.

1000
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,967
Well, that's exactly
what we're talking about, Richard.

1001
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:50,719
We think Venus
could be very inspirational

1002
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,305
to a whole group of people
who quite honestly, as an industry,

1003
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,516
we have not done enough to reach.

1004
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,727
Venus can open a lot of doors.
And we'd like to help her do it.

1005
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,855
Okay. So, uh, what you offering?

1006
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,359
Whatever you need.
Shoes, coaches, rackets.

1007
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,735
Rackets?

1008
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,154
They offering rackets?

1009
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,657
We wouldn't even be
sitting here if you hadn't seen

1010
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,552
what they had done with their rackets.

1011
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,954
- That's true. Fair enough. Yes.
- Come on. You sure you the best?

1012
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,415
- Well, I don't know. He said it.
- Richard, can I be frank?

1013
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,540
I think you should be
whoever the hell you wanna be.

1014
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,546
What Venus needs now
is more court time and training,

1015
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,982
the right tournaments and exposure.

1016
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,341
That's a hundred grand a year, easy.

1017
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,721
You sign with us
and we'll help you carry that burden.

1018
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,725
Let us take it from here.

1019
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,688
Let us make this a sure thing.

1020
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,733
You don't want to risk all that,
do you, Richard?

1021
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:59,913
I think I'mma go get in the pool.
Uh, we'll talk later.

1022
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,834
Lovely to meet you.

1023
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,172
What the hell was that?

1024
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,469
Okay, here you go.

1025
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,888
- Thank you.
- What you all doing?

1026
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,142
- Hey, Daddy. You hungry?
- You want something to eat?

1027
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,187
- Where the food I packed for you?
- Don't worry. It's all on our tab.

1028
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,522
- Mm-hm.
- It's on your tab?

1029
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:28,609
It's no big deal, Mr. Williams.
All the food here is for free.

1030
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,819
Nothing's for free.
Somebody's paying for it.

1031
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:31,904
Put it down.

1032
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,966
Put it... Don't you bite
that cookie one more time.

1033
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,240
Put it down.

1034
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,744
Let's go.
Get your little tabs out in the bus.

1035
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,788
- Bye.
- Bye, you guys.

1036
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,540
Daddy, what's wrong?

1037
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,792
What's wrong?
You sitting at some country club

1038
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,629
with your legs all crossed like you
Queens of Sheba from somewhere.

1039
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,090
Never take anything
from anybody for free.

1040
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,384
Everything in this place got hooks in it.

1041
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:59,389
No, don't touch us, Panty-Man!

1042
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:01,975
Y'all be careful.

1043
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,420
- Hey, girls.
- Hi, Mr Cohen.

1044
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,478
Heya...

1045
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,915
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Oracene, how you doing?

1046
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,333
All right.
I'll get you something to drink.

1047
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,982
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

1048
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,487
So what are we doing here, Richard?

1049
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,656
What the hell was that back there?

1050
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,867
- Yeah, we... we not doing this.
- Not doing what?

1051
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:22,871
We not signing with none of them agents.
We not playing no more Juniors.

1052
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,915
Have you lost your mind?

1053
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,417
Venus is 63-and-oh, okay?

1054
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,563
You pull her out of Juniors now,
you're gonna ruin her.

1055
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,941
Those girls need to play matches
or they're gonna die on the vine.

1056
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,633
Yeah, I... I done heard the risk...

1057
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,594
but this Junior circuit
is worse than the ghetto.

1058
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,056
Kids out there cracking up, burning out.

1059
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,934
- Their parents ought to be shot.
- What are you talking about?

1060
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,371
Your daughters are fine.

1061
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,854
Oh, yeah, they fine now.
But you heard them agents,

1062
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,708
they talking about pushing them
up the ladders,

1063
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,025
and Nationals and Internationals.

1064
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,696
They just... They don't need
all that pressure. Okay?

1065
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,740
They will play matches when they turn pro.

1066
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,803
And right now they need
to just do what they're doing.

1067
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,579
- They need to just be kids.
- No, there will be no pros, Richard.

1068
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,808
And even if there were,
you don't sign with an agent,

1069
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,643
how're you guys going to afford
all their training till then?

1070
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,085
- Let me worry about that.
- Did you know about this?

1071
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:17,217
Richard, don't do this.

1072
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:21,805
Every American player who's ever done
anything got good following this path.

1073
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,641
- Mac, Tracy, Agassi, Pete.
- Yep.

1074
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:28,478
This window you guys have
is so freaking small.

1075
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,605
- Yep.
- And it will close.

1076
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,292
I know you don't want to believe me,
but it will.

1077
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:35,611
Everybody talking about this window,
this window they got to get through.

1078
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,864
But peoples like us, we get shot
when we go through those.

1079
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,034
So I'm thinking we just gonna
pause right here,

1080
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,619
and then when the time is right,

1081
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,495
we just gonna walk
through the front door.

1082
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,124
Man, I don't understand.

1083
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,544
You do not have a clue.

1084
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,773
You are pissed off because
some guy insulted you today,

1085
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,049
- so now you wanna walk away.
- Mm-mm.

1086
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,510
You are the most stubborn person
I have ever met in my life.

1087
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,220
And I coach McEnroe.

1088
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,766
We appreciate
everything you've done, Paul.

1089
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,104
But this part
of our relationship is done.

1090
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:16,193
And we will no longer be requiring
your services anymore.

1091
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,738
Richard, no good coach
is gonna take them for free

1092
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,657
if they're not playing Juniors.

1093
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,118
Well, you did. Remember?

1094
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,204
And I think you're a pretty good coach.

1095
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,631
All right.

1096
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,595
I just pray you don't screw this up.

1097
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,347
Yeah, we appreciate your prayers, Paul.

1098
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,973
Mm-hm.

1099
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,352
Okay, Panty-Man, we gonna get her!

1100
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,603
Oracene.

1101
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,483
Come on,
before Panty-Man gets you.

1102
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

1103
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,202
I'll see you at Wimbledon, kid.

1104
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,710
Are we a team?

1105
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,463
Are we a team? We... we a family.

1106
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,756
So we're a team?

1107
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,486
- A family the best kind of team there is.
- And you don't think that was a decision

1108
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,886
that you should have discussed with me?

1109
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,055
Discussed with Venus?

1110
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:31,601
Richard, my faith dictates
that I stand by your side.

1111
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:35,230
- All right, just do that, then.
- Don't mistake my silence for agreement.

1112
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:39,025
You do that again, and I won't be quiet.

1113
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,903
- Now, don't do that to me.
- You don't make a fool out of me.

1114
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,739
- Who made a fool out of you?
- You.

1115
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,342
- You made a fool out of me.
- What are you talking about?

1116
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,035
- Don't make a fool out of me.
- Ain't nobody make no fool out of you.

1117
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,963
Good feet. Excellent.
Get there. Work! Excellent.

1118
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,132
I like it. I like it.
Hey, who's aggressive?

1119
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,551
- Who wants this point?
- Rick. Rick.

1120
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,679
This guy Richard Williams keeps calling.
It's like the tenth time in a row.

1121
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,264
Told me to tell you it's urgent.

1122
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,349
Urgent? What's so urgent?
His backhand?

1123
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,601
You gotta get that ball.

1124
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,603
No, some, uh, father in California.

1125
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,207
Says he's got two daughters,
that they're the best in the state.

1126
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,484
Yeah, let me guess,
next Jennifer Capriati?

1127
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,111
These girls so great,
how come I've never heard of 'em?

1128
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,280
They're from Compton.

1129
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,073
Compton?

1130
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,992
All right, keep working.
Cuz, it's on you.

1131
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,661
- Let's keep those lines going!
- Let's go, guys.

1132
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:34,892
- You guys are late.
- Sorry.

1133
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,458
Let's go. Move, move, move.

1134
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,879
I like that. I like the visor.
Are you eating that?

1135
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,815
You put crap like that in your mouth,
your game's gonna go south.

1136
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,717
- Hey, Barry, which line?
- Line two.

1137
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,594
Line two. Okay.

1138
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,223
This is Rick Macci.

1139
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,106
He's here! He's here!
He's here! He's here!

1140
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,193
Okay, okay. Relax, relax.
Everybody, come on, get in your positions.

1141
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,402
Let's go.

1142
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,573
Mr. Macci. Welcome, welcome.

1143
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,950
Hello, everybody.

1144
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,762
- Hello.
- Hi.

1145
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,703
- I'm Richard Williams.
- Mr. Williams.

1146
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,330
This my wife. This Brandy.

1147
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,165
- Hi, it's an honor.
- We glad to see you.

1148
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,186
- It's great to be here.
- This is all our kids. This our family.

1149
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,670
That's Venus, Serena,
Tunde, Lyn, Isha.

1150
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,921
- Hello.
- Hi.

1151
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,858
Thank you for coming.
We know you came a long way,

1152
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,110
so we won't waste your time.
You want to get over to the club?

1153
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,553
- Let's get it started.
- Come on, girls, let's go.

1154
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,180
- Mr. Macci a busy man.
- Be great, be great.

1155
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,305
Come on, y'all, let's go.
Get on in there.

1156
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,227
Grab the door here.

1157
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,773
Wow. So, uh...

1158
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,442
tell me one more time,
which one of you is, uh...

1159
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,152
Big one, Venus. Little one, Serena.

1160
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,655
Okay. I think I can handle that.

1161
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,582
Oh, don't worry about that.
You don't need that.

1162
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,208
Bye, guys!

1163
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,589
We got Rick Macci in Compton!

1164
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:12,262
There you go, Meka. Take that.
And that.

1165
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,140
- Close her down, Richard?
- Yeah, you can just close it up.

1166
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:27,235
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down, haircut.
Hell you think you going?

1167
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,907
Uh, well...
just gonna play some tennis.

1168
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,158
Hey, yo, Richard!

1169
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,619
This Jimmy Connors-looking cracker
with you?

1170
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,371
- Uh, yeah, yeah, white boy with us.
- All right, it's spoke.

1171
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,625
- Yeah, he just white.
- I am that.

1172
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,895
- Get up out of here.
- I ain't gonna let you get shot, Rick.

1173
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,254
Appreciate it.

1174
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,716
- This is it, huh?
- This it.

1175
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,427
Compton Country Club.

1176
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,305
Really good, really good, really good.

1177
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,475
They ain't gonna hit you.
They ain't gonna hit you.

1178
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,144
Go get it. Forehand.

1179
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,772
Pop! Excellent. Backhand.

1180
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,566
Attagirl, go! Move. Fast feet.
Good recovery.

1181
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,109
Excellent. Recover.

1182
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,487
Wheels, wheels, recover. Go!

1183
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,865
Good! Again!

1184
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,034
Hey, I like it.
Find the slot, rip the shot.

1185
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,804
- That's Rick Macci.
- Again!

1186
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,412
Where you get that power from?

1187
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,914
Macci rhyme with "crazy."

1188
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,434
I'm sorry, was it something I said?

1189
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,062
I think it's the 'stache. I think she
doesn't like the guy with the 'stache.

1190
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,754
Get there. I love it.
Come on in for the approach.

1191
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,882
Yes! Come on. Get there.

1192
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:32,986
What do you say?
Fight it like you're angry.

1193
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,761
Oh, I like it! Excellent work.

1194
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,472
Hey, girls. Hey.
I love what you're doing.

1195
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,992
- Excellent job.
- There you go!

1196
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,059
Put it right there.
Did you guys have fun?

1197
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,269
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good. I like it.

1198
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,605
That father of yours,
he's done a heck of a job,

1199
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,607
so, uh, this was a lot of fun for me too.

1200
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,818
So, thank you, girls. Thank you.

1201
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,612
Richard, I'm, uh... I'm impressed.

1202
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,073
Y'all go get some water.
Get some water.

1203
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,242
They're, uh... they're terrific.
I think...

1204
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,204
I think you might just have
the next Michael Jordan on your hands.

1205
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:04,416
Oh, no, brother-man...
I gots me the next two.

1206
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,878
I like the way you think.

1207
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,049
This here...
this is my standard agreement.

1208
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,219
Same one I used with Jennifer.
All right?

1209
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:20,265
Instruction, housing, food, education.
You don't pay for a thing.

1210
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,767
Even trips to Disney World,
which is right down the road.

1211
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,438
But... uh, mostly, it's...
it's my personal time.

1212
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,231
Now, that I promise you will get.

1213
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,651
You train at Rick Macci, you're gonna...
you're gonna train with Rick.

1214
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,195
Sounds expensive. What's in it for you?

1215
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,740
My fee is 15 percent
of their future earnings.

1216
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,159
If you make nothing, I make nothing.

1217
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,912
But, uh, I can tell you one thing,
we are not gonna make nothing.

1218
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,957
What you know
about Nick Bollettieri?

1219
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,421
- He a real famous tennis coach.
- Sure, uh...

1220
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,174
The boy keep calling here.
Can't get him off the phone.

1221
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,384
Yeah, Nick is, uh... he's a good coach.

1222
01:15:56,469 --> 01:16:00,430
You know, he's had a lot of success,
but, uh... I can tell you now,

1223
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:03,314
you go down to Bradenton to train
with Nick, you're not gonna get Nick.

1224
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,620
You're gonna get whatever hitting coach
he's got available.

1225
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,729
You're gonna... gonna get a factory.

1226
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,624
Now, you train with me,
I'm your coach. It's me.

1227
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,191
A lot of people say Nick the best.

1228
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,901
Mm-hm.

1229
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,819
- Remember that man who said that?
- Mm-hm.

1230
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,073
Mr. and Mrs. Williams,
whether it's Nick or Rick,

1231
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,676
Tom, Dick, or Harry, it doesn't matter.

1232
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,660
If it's their dream to be a champion,
well, then you got a chance.

1233
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,579
But, you know, if it's yours, mine, no.

1234
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:27,207
Crash and burn.
It's not gonna happen. So...

1235
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,292
you want to go with Nick, then...

1236
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,087
you know, you gotta go with Nick.
That's your prerogative.

1237
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,630
No, we wanna go with you.

1238
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,424
Oh! Thank heavens. I was...

1239
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,429
We just wanted to hear you say
what you had said.

1240
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,928
Well... well done.

1241
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,805
Whoo!

1242
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,933
- Tunde. Uh...
- Ah!

1243
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,310
Now, this here is our standard agreement.

1244
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:48,978
I'm sorry, your...

1245
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:54,150
You know, you take these girls,
you take us all, the whole family.

1246
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,155
I'm sorry, you...
You all wanna come to Florida?

1247
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,118
Not Tunde.
She just graduated valedictorian.

1248
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,078
So, her life is here.

1249
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,955
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1250
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,083
Yeah, but all that other stuff that's
in that contract, we need that.

1251
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:14,587
We need a house, we need the best school,
and a job for me on your staff.

1252
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,258
It says here, a... mobile home?

1253
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,552
Yeah, I mean, we got to get there,
don't we?

1254
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,596
You believe in these kids or what?

1255
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:28,852
You bet I do. I swear to you two.
You bet I do.

1256
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,248
Okay, then why are we still sitting here?
We supposed to be in Florida.

1257
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,898
What are we doing?
Let's go to Florida.

1258
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,998
- Oh, thank you.
- Can you get me one?

1259
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,708
Here you go. No, we can share that.

1260
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,085
No, 'cause y'all wouldn't
let me sit with you.

1261
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,087
You keep your hand on that wheel.

1262
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,089
She got it. Do you need me, Junior?

1263
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,384
- No, I got it.
- Put at least one hand on that wheel.

1264
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,636
- What's up? Hey, police.
- Hi, police!

1265
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,448
We were just
breaking the law. Sorry.

1266
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,349
Okay, spell "Albuquerque."

1267
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:12,687
A-L-B-U-Q...

1268
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,524
No. A... Can't be L-R.

1269
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,861
- A-L-B... Q...
- The word got, like, three Q's.

1270
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,030
No, don't tell 'em. Let 'em do it.

1271
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,591
<i>Know when to hold 'em</i>

1272
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,802
<i>Know when to fold 'em</i>

1273
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:49,307
<i>Know when to walk away
And know when to run</i>

1274
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,143
<i>You never count your money</i>

1275
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,646
<i>When you're sittin' at the table</i>

1276
01:18:54,730 --> 01:19:00,985
<i>There'll be time enough for counting
When the dealing's done</i>

1277
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,283
- Look at that. We in Florida.
- Oh, this is so pretty!

1278
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:08,929
There you go.
Welcome to Florida.

1279
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,582
- Rick Macci, here we come.
- Rick Macci, there we go.

1280
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,344
- There they are. Wow, look at that.
- Hi!

1281
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,847
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the Sunshine State.

1282
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,809
Gosh, it's great to see you guys, huh?
How was the trip? Was it good?

1283
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,102
Yeah. It was long.

1284
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,896
- Long? Yeah, I bet it was.
- It wasn't long. It was not long.

1285
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,000
Richard, do you see that
blue bad boy right there?

1286
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,233
- Mm-hm.
- I call it the Comet.

1287
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,598
I like to ride around,
makes me feel like I own the place.

1288
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,946
Which is crazy 'cause, you know,
I kinda do.

1289
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,175
- That gonna be mine.
- Girls, these are the drilling courts.

1290
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,660
That's Tommy Ho.
He won the US Junior Nationals at 15.

1291
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:54,706
He's top 50 in the country.
That's Eric Taino. That's John Roddick.

1292
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,625
They're both top five in the country
right now for their age group.

1293
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,437
- Now, John, he's got a little brother.
- Yeah, he good.

1294
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,838
His name's Andy. That kid is a savage.
He breathes fire.

1295
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,048
He's good.
Wait till I get my hands on him.

1296
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,133
This is it right here.

1297
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,861
Let's go. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!

1298
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,388
Feet. You hear that sound?
That sound is effort. I love effort.

1299
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:14,017
That's my happy place.
Come with me. This is where we eat.

1300
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,394
Hey, guys, don't eat too many
of these things, all right?

1301
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,729
This will give you horns.

1302
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,064
Best French fries in Florida.

1303
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,752
Now, look, this place will always be
open and available to you guys.

1304
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,505
- You help yourselves whenever you want.
- All right, good, 'cause I'm hungry.

1305
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,113
For real? We just ate.

1306
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:28,531
You got some place here, Rick.

1307
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:30,825
And it just got a lot better today.

1308
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,263
- Come on, Richard, let's go.
- Over here. Look at 'em walking off.

1309
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,788
Try the cinnamon rolls.
They're first class.

1310
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,227
What you got over there?
That's the... the chum?

1311
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,045
Yeah, you know,
you got a good eye, Richard.

1312
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,297
- Mm-hm.
- You know how that works.

1313
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,008
You need a few cheeseburgers
to pay for the sirloin.

1314
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,886
You sell enough sirloin,
you can get to the fillet mignon.

1315
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,721
Oh, there you go.

1316
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,682
Here we are, girls. This is Mecca.

1317
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:59,187
These two courts here, they're yours.
Just you and me and the best pros we got.

1318
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:02,815
This is where we hit the horn,
we pop the corn, and when we pop it,

1319
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,984
- we pop with extra butter, right?
- Right.

1320
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,652
- Huh? You feel me? Yeah?
- Yep.

1321
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:07,737
- Bang.
- Bang.

1322
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,155
- Right? Bang.
- Bang.

1323
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,282
Now, look,
I got a little surprise for you.

1324
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,660
This... this won't happen every day,
but since she's here,

1325
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,288
I thought maybe you'd
wanna hit a little bit.

1326
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,165
Jennifer!

1327
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,834
Oh, look.
That's Jennifer Capriati.

1328
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:26,089
Hey. I hear you guys can play.
You wanna hit?

1329
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,173
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1330
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,884
- Can we?
- Yeah. Just take it easy on her though.

1331
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,887
- Let's go, Meka.
- Have fun girls.

1332
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,973
This is really special.
Have fun!

1333
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,328
This is special for her, too.
I told her all about the girls,

1334
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,061
and she wanted to meet Venus, so, yeah.

1335
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,585
Yeah, you know how to throw a party.

1336
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,315
Well, it's good
you guys are here.

1337
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,192
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, girls.

1338
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,361
All right, girls, let's go.
Warm up slow.

1339
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,904
Just have fun.

1340
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,573
Look at that.
That's gotta be special for her, huh?

1341
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,784
Yeah. She looks strong.

1342
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,829
She is. She is.
A lot of work she's put in.

1343
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,289
She's gonna get there.
V's gonna get there.

1344
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,335
That's it. Attagirl. Good. I like it.

1345
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,255
I mean, look at that.
That's... that's the model right there.

1346
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,966
Now, I figure we mold her
in Jennifer's path.

1347
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,176
We start with the Easter Bowl,
then the Orange Bowl.

1348
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,137
- Just like how Jennifer did it, right?
- Yep.

1349
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,949
They're good tournaments,
they're challenging.

1350
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:18,850
I'm thinking we not gonna play
the Easter Bowl though, Rick.

1351
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:22,562
Okay, well, you...
got another tournament in mind?

1352
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:25,982
No, uh...

1353
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,193
I meant to tell you, uh...
we not playing no more Juniors.

1354
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,905
Yeah, they'll play matches again
when they turn pro.

1355
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,658
Okay.

1356
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,119
And when exactly
is that gonna be, Richard?

1357
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:42,498
When I say they ready.
We're not gonna rush this, Rick.

1358
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,917
Everything going good.
We not gonna start rushing now.

1359
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,170
Uh... what are they gonna do, Richard?

1360
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,130
What... They gonna play ping-pong?

1361
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,798
No, no. They gonna practice with you.

1362
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,468
They gonna go to school,
they gonna go to the Hall.

1363
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,304
And pretty much, they gonna be kids.
That's what I want.

1364
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,514
They're gonna be... be kids? But...

1365
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,641
Richard, that's...
That is not how it works.

1366
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,643
I... I can't do that.

1367
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:05,396
I can't mold her like that.
You need to play Juniors.

1368
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,399
Look, there's not a single player,
not one, on the pro tour

1369
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:12,028
that didn't play Juniors.
Without Juniors, it's impossible.

1370
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:15,239
Well, not for you. Not for you.
You Rick Macci.

1371
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,991
That's why we drove all this way.

1372
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,660
Nothing is impossible for Rick Macci.

1373
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,331
But if you think you can't do it,
we can go talk to Nick.

1374
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:29,462
You know, you might have
mentioned this in Compton.

1375
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,882
I probably could have,
but then you wouldn't have made

1376
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,511
the best decision
you ever made in your life.

1377
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,514
This is great, Rick.

1378
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,438
Oh, and I need 'em hitting
open-stance strokes.

1379
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,434
- Ah, God.
- That's the most important.

1380
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,311
They got to hit them open-stance strokes.

1381
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:48,272
We gonna make it go "boom" like you said.
Remember? Make it go boom.

1382
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,358
Yeah, I...
I said "bang," but, yeah.

1383
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,378
You said, "bang," "boom,"
we gonna make some noise.

1384
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:53,963
I got to get the family.
They need to see this.

1385
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,905
I'mma grab a burger.
You want something?

1386
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,907
I don't want a burger.

1387
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,844
Don't be scared, Rick.
I wrote the plan.

1388
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,619
Oh, God, the plan.

1389
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,083
All right, Venus, serve it up.

1390
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,182
Good! Hey, look at that.

1391
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,269
Boom! I like it. How about that?

1392
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,896
Bang! Come on, get in there and dig!

1393
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,108
Kill it. I like it. Good. Good, good.
Hey, listen.

1394
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,232
That wasn't a good shot at the end.
Do you know why?

1395
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:35,361
It was excellent.

1396
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,196
'Cause it was excellent. Good.

1397
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,157
I'm proud of ya. Excellent work.
Let's go. I'll race you to the water.

1398
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,345
You've faced a lot of criticism
in the last three years

1399
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,597
since you pulled your daughters
out of Junior tournament tennis.

1400
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,622
- Mm-hm.
- You've been called controversial,

1401
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,959
overbearing, a self-promoting distraction.

1402
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,795
- Mm-hm.
- How do you respond to all that?

1403
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:55,464
Well, look, peoples gonna say
what peoples gonna say.

1404
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,593
You know, when somebody come to me,
telling me my daughter so good,

1405
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,554
and she, you know,
she need to be playing matches,

1406
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:05,308
I know the only reason they see good
is 'cause they see money.

1407
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,811
And most of the time they see money
that can be going into they pocket.

1408
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:11,015
But you've certainly said
a lot of provocative things.

1409
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:13,733
You've said
"tennis parents should be shot."

1410
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,457
You've said you're brokering a deal
to purchase Rockefeller Center.

1411
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,653
Yep.

1412
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,656
Well, truth is,
I got so many businesses now,

1413
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,700
I hardly even think about tennis.

1414
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,846
And you're not concerned
all that's holding them back?

1415
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,289
Most top prospects their age,
like Martina Hingis for example,

1416
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,832
- are about to turn pro.
- Yeah.

1417
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,294
But your daughters haven't
played a match since 1991.

1418
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,421
Well, we still pushing 'em forward.

1419
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:40,551
Venus speaking four languages.
Most of 'em fluently, almost.

1420
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:41,969
How many languages you speak?

1421
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:45,556
Exactly. Not even really good at this one.

1422
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,059
Look, look,
I've been broke all my life,

1423
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,062
and Venus don't wanna be poor, you know.

1424
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,857
But we not gonna let nobody push our
daughter into nothing she ain't ready for.

1425
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,403
- Okay. All right, I'mma get Venus.
- Thank you.

1426
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:01,322
Y'all can go ahead
and move and set up up top.

1427
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,367
Now, fast feet. Fast feet. Fast feet.
Good. Here they come.

1428
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,262
Here's it come.
You don't know when it's coming.

1429
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,789
Let's go. You don't know. Go! React.
Good! I like it. Let's go. Move.

1430
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,916
Yes, like a bullet. Yes, I like it!

1431
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,293
Boom, that's major league. Let's go.
Fast feet. Fast feet.

1432
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,252
Junior!

1433
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,922
When you're moving, I'm grooving.
Good. Get there.

1434
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,257
You got an interview. Come on, let's go.

1435
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,804
Come on.
Hey, V, we got two more hours.

1436
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:28,432
I'm telling you now, you leave this court,
your sister's taking over.

1437
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,017
Sorry, Rick, it's showtime.

1438
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,561
Yeah, it's always showtime,
isn't it, Richard?

1439
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,274
Hey, Meek, let's go.
I know someone wants to be here.

1440
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,319
- Do you want to turn pro?
- Yes.

1441
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:44,115
A lot of people are excited to see
how you'd do against players like Seles.

1442
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,700
Do you think you can beat her?

1443
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,035
I know I could beat her.

1444
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,497
You know you can beat her?
Very confident.

1445
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,999
I'm very confident.

1446
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,628
You say it so easily. Why?

1447
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,214
Because I believe it.

1448
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,383
But you haven't played a match
in almost three years.

1449
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,720
All right, hold it right there.
If you don't mind, lemme tell you why.

1450
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,638
Richard, we're doing an interview.

1451
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:11,517
Well, what she had said, she said it
with so much confidence the first time.

1452
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:14,478
- But you keep going on and on.
- You can't just keep interrupting...

1453
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,523
What you gots to understand
is you're dealing with

1454
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,191
the image of a 14-year-old child.

1455
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:23,028
And this child gonna be playing when
your old ass and me gonna be in the grave.

1456
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,365
When she had said something,
we done told you what's happening.

1457
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,161
You are dealing with a little Black kid.
Let her be a kid.

1458
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,223
Now, she done answered it
with a lot of confidence.

1459
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,081
Leave that alone!

1460
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,254
Focus. That's it.
It's all about your eyes.

1461
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,964
Focus. Right there. Good.
Turn it over. Good.

1462
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:45,801
Sharp. Again. Again.
Sharp. Let's go.

1463
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:49,388
One, two, right there.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1464
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,640
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1465
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,893
Let's go. Keep moving. Keep moving.
Fast feet.

1466
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,145
What's going on, Shakespeare? Good.

1467
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,606
- Did you get the part?
- Yeah, it was good.

1468
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,859
Rick, what's going on over there?

1469
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,738
Ah... big Junior tournament's coming up.
The Continental Cup.

1470
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,574
Hoopla's for Kournikova.
She's getting some practice in.

1471
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,785
I heard she's going pro next month
in Russia.

1472
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:14,872
- Hingis announced too.
- Yeah, they, uh... They are.

1473
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,709
But look, Russia's overrated.
The weather's lousy, the food's terrible.

1474
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,920
But, Rick, I wanna play.

1475
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,922
Sweetheart, you're preaching
to the choir, okay?

1476
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,984
- Do you think I'm ready?
- No, I know you're ready.

1477
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,843
- Okay, will you talk to my dad?
- Sweetheart, look...

1478
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:31,138
- Rick, please. You know I'm ready.
- Trying to feed me to the wolves here.

1479
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,058
- Look, I've been down this road...
- Rick, just talk to him. Please.

1480
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,811
Please?

1481
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,498
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

1482
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,022
- You know...
- Is that a yes?

1483
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,691
It's that face. It's your face.
It's like I can't...

1484
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,545
- So, yes?
- You give me the face... Yes, yes.

1485
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,987
- Yes! Yes!
- All right, all right, all right.

1486
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,490
- Oh, boy. Here we go. Let's just...
- That's a yes.

1487
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,414
Hope he doesn't actually
kill the messenger.

1488
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,118
- He said yeah?
- He said yes.

1489
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,411
Jesus.

1490
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:57,248
Think fast.
Put those on, train your sister.

1491
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,811
I need a break to figure out
how I'm gonna talk to this maniac.

1492
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:02,086
- Let's go. Put your gloves on.
- Let's go.

1493
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,966
The main reason we not rushing,
'cause without an education,

1494
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,593
no matter how good you are,
by the time they 18,

1495
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,304
they gonna be broke and have
50 more years to live like a fool.

1496
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,182
We not doing that. Oh, look at that!

1497
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:17,245
- What's going on, everybody?
- There's Rick Macci.

1498
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:20,646
Rick own everything you see
as far as you can see.

1499
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:25,067
True. Hey, uh... Richard, do you think
I could, um, bend your ear for a minute?

1500
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:28,988
Oh, yeah, sure thing.
Girls, take the kids down to the court.

1501
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,550
I'll meet you down there.
You can go with them.

1502
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:32,294
- I'll talk to you in a second.
- Thank you.

1503
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,244
Rick got that look on his face
like he need to say something to me

1504
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,787
that I'm not gonna wanna hear.

1505
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,330
Have fun, kids.

1506
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:40,309
- You have great teachers.
- Lemme give you a ride in your cart.

1507
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,878
She got the fire in her eye, that one.
Thank you. I miss this sucker.

1508
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,754
Richard, there's a...

1509
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:48,674
There's a tournament
in Oakland coming up.

1510
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,217
It's called the Bank of the West.

1511
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,845
- Mm-hm.
- Now, I called the director.

1512
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:56,181
He said they'd, uh, give Venus
a wild card if we committed now.

1513
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:58,017
Also, my friend Patrick, he's from Nike,

1514
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,246
he's gonna be there,
and he's available for a sit-down.

1515
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,790
- I don't like that, Rick.
- You don't like what? Wait a second.

1516
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,440
Don't talk to peoples behind my back.

1517
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,711
- I'm not talking to anybody. Wait...
- You know I don't like that.

1518
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,486
Hang on a second.
Will you just hear me out, please?

1519
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,656
Look, she's... she's 14 years old.

1520
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:15,117
Hingis just turned pro.
Kournikova, she's going soon.

1521
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,912
I don't understand why
we would give them a head start.

1522
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:20,956
Jennifer, she... she'd been on the cover
of a freaking Wheaties box by now.

1523
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:22,476
And I know I'm not supposed to say this,

1524
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,127
but Venus is twice as good
as Jennifer ever was.

1525
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:28,464
- Jennifer just dropped off the tour.
- Nah, she didn't.

1526
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,091
She didn't drop off the tour.
She's taking a break, okay?

1527
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,237
- Rick, tell me the truth.
- It's a vacation. I am telling the truth.

1528
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,448
- Peoples are saying that she burnt out.
- She's not burned out.

1529
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:39,099
Jennifer is fine, but you know what?
So is Venus.

1530
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,726
Come on, man.

1531
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:44,104
Look, she's ready.
Let's get this show on the road.

1532
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:47,733
I can see it in her eyes.
She's hungry. She's got the fire.

1533
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:51,779
- Come on, Richard. What do you say?
- Did she send you here to talk to me?

1534
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,591
- You're gonna beat me?
- I'm gonna hit it now.

1535
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:56,033
Okay, it's not just my idea.

1536
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,246
- Rick, I don't say this to you too often.
- Right.

1537
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:04,333
- But you are not wrong.
- So, does that...?

1538
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:07,002
But that's all you're getting
from me today. Okay?

1539
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,088
- Okay.
- Just let me think about it.

1540
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,608
- I'll take it.
- All right.

1541
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,716
Thank you for your time, Richard.

1542
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,391
You can borrow your cart
if you want.

1543
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,388
Uh, that's okay, Richard,
you hang onto it.

1544
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:18,597
It looks great on you.

1545
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:21,600
- No, just have it back in 40 minutes.
- Okay.

1546
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:24,478
Oh, my gosh.

1547
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,107
Again! Again!

1548
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,026
You gotta get it in.
You can't fault on that.

1549
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,351
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

1550
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,113
My wife think
I got a girlfriend down here,

1551
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:36,365
I be coming to get your burgers so much.

1552
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,492
She don't know I'm cheating
on her cooking.

1553
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:45,165
<i>Jennifer Capriati now faces
her most serious court battle.</i>

1554
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,918
<i>The 18-year-old was arrested
after police showed up</i>

1555
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,755
<i>at her Coral Gables hotel room
to check a tip about a runaway.</i>

1556
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,425
<i>They say that they found
a small amount of marijuana.</i>

1557
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,720
<i>Police say a runaway girl
and a 19-year-old man</i>

1558
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:59,722
<i>did show up at Capriati's room.</i>

1559
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:04,935
<i>They were arrested on charges of heroin
and suspected crack cocaine possession.</i>

1560
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,646
Let's go!

1561
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,899
What do you say? What do you say?
Time to get sharp for the bay.

1562
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:13,110
Little steps, big results.

1563
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,238
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1564
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,427
Come on, guys, somebody say something.
What's going on?

1565
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,243
- They're at Disney World.
- They're what?

1566
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,536
They're at Disney World.

1567
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,955
Richard said practice is cancelled
for today.

1568
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:27,833
Ah, you gotta be...

1569
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:38,635
- There go Rick. Hey, Rick!
- Hey, Richard.

1570
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,144
Okay, let's go.

1571
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,104
Come on. Homework.
You got homework.

1572
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,773
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey.

1573
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,191
You guys have a good time?

1574
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,395
- I rode on Space Mountain.
- Did ya? Were you scared?

1575
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:56,737
I was not scared.
They were crying like babies.

1576
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,340
- I like those ears.
- Don't drop that.

1577
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:01,950
Richard, maybe if I could
just get a minute? Thank you.

1578
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,329
There was, uh...

1579
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,266
- We had a practice scheduled.
- Uh-huh.

1580
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:10,834
Tournament's just a few weeks away,
so, you know, we gotta practice.

1581
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:14,338
Yeah, well... I decided
we not playing that tournament.

1582
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,757
Daddy, what?

1583
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,481
- Why? What happened?
- It's okay, Junior.

1584
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,303
I'm not gonna let him
burn you out like he did Capriati.

1585
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:24,431
- What?
- I'm sorry, like I did with what?

1586
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,850
- Well, you was her coach, right?
- Mommy...

1587
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,913
That's all you been saying is,
"Look at Jennifer. Look at Jennifer."

1588
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,648
Well, we looking.
She on TV, her mugshot. Arrested.

1589
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:37,820
Venus is not gonna be cracked out
in some alley 'cause you pushed her there.

1590
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:38,946
It's not fair.

1591
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:42,407
Venus, don't you get upset.
Don't you let him see you upset. Come on.

1592
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:45,619
You proud of yourself?
Just broke her heart.

1593
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:53,710
I tell you what, man...
I'm getting pretty tired of your games.

1594
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,048
- My games? What games?
- These games.

1595
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:01,301
You showed up here, first thing you did,
you pulled 'em out of Juniors.

1596
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,679
Now you pull 'em out of practice.
You do it constantly.

1597
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,473
For music lessons,
or homework, or church.

1598
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:10,102
Look, they got to get straight A's,
else they can't play tennis.

1599
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,831
You knew that. I told you that.
That's my rules.

1600
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:14,565
Well, you pull 'em out to train
with other coaches behind my back?

1601
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:18,402
I'm trying to round out they games.

1602
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,863
They not gonna get great
doing the same drills

1603
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:23,699
- every other Junior in America is doing.
- Thank you.

1604
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:26,554
- I'm trying to look out for my kids.
- No, you're looking out for yourself.

1605
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:30,122
You know, all I hear from you is pressure.
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

1606
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,916
But you know what I see?
On TV, I see it every day.

1607
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,585
I see the Richard Williams Show.

1608
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,754
"A million dollars. Number one.
The greatest of all time."

1609
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,382
- You don't think that adds pressure?
- It add confidence.

1610
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:42,885
That's bullshit. It's about you.

1611
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:45,345
Now, look, you wanna jerk my chain,
go on and jerk it.

1612
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,139
But do not do it to those girls.

1613
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,642
Rick, all respects due...

1614
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:54,104
We love you.
You like a member of our family.

1615
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,232
But you work for us.

1616
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,067
- I wrote this plan.
- Plan.

1617
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:02,905
And when I say she's not playing,
she is not playing.

1618
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:06,700
I call the shots.
And I'm sorry if you don't like that.

1619
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:09,661
Richard, screw your freakin' plan.

1620
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:13,832
You don't know what you're doing.
You don't.

1621
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:25,886
That is a nice house, by the way.
Remind me, who pays for that?

1622
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,306
Don't do that. Don't do that.
You're a better man than that.

1623
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,581
Are you going after her?

1624
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,168
- Uh, she'll be fine.
- No, she won't.

1625
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:00,545
Go fix this.

1626
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,467
I puts this whole thing together...

1627
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:08,512
and now everybody seem
to know better than me.

1628
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:24,361
Richard, do you think
you did this by yourself?

1629
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:28,991
From the first day we met.
Remember that? Out on that bus stop?

1630
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:33,161
You didn't even tell me your real name.

1631
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,291
'Cause you thought
I was just another dumb nigga.

1632
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:42,254
You just like them white boys.
You never believed in none of this.

1633
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,172
When did I not believe?

1634
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:46,758
Huh? I want you to tell me,
when did I not believe?

1635
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:48,927
You not the only dreamer in this family.

1636
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,652
Wouldn't be no dream if it wasn't for me.

1637
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,473
I carried them inside me and on my back.

1638
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,559
And I carried you, too.

1639
01:36:55,643 --> 01:37:00,147
Working two shifts
so I could put food on your table.

1640
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,483
That open stance, you got that from me.

1641
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:06,403
Oh, you did that? Oh, okay.

1642
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:09,823
And I fixed Serena's serve
because you messed that up.

1643
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:11,158
- You did what?
- Yes.

1644
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,035
I fixed that toss
because you messed it up.

1645
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,786
- Mm-hm.
- I'm here. I've been here,

1646
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,331
dreaming and believing, just like you.

1647
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:19,333
- Mm-hm.
- You just don't wanna see me.

1648
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:23,503
So... uh, what you want?

1649
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:26,882
What you want?
You want a thank-you?

1650
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:29,760
That's all right, Richard.

1651
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,644
That's all right.
I don't need your thank-you.

1652
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:35,515
Unlike you, I don't need the world
to tell me I'm great.

1653
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:44,399
See how you do?
You see what you just did?

1654
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:46,818
How you walk away
when something's not finished.

1655
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:48,623
- Come on. Come on.
- Did you just see that?

1656
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,782
You see that? That's what you do
with all your businesses.

1657
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:54,534
Remember the cement
company business...

1658
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:57,412
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- The cleaning company business.

1659
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,498
All your other kids.

1660
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1661
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,712
You sound like you got something
you need to get off your chest.

1662
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,691
Don't let God stop you.
Say what you need to say.

1663
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,299
Oh, I said it.

1664
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:14,262
Your son showing up in that
red Nissan truck, knocking on my door.

1665
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:19,393
And all you had to say was,
"Oh, look, it's my son. He found me."

1666
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,020
And then all your other kids
showing up after that.

1667
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:23,146
Okay.

1668
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:25,482
See, another woman
would have left.

1669
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,194
- But I stay because I don't quit.
- You...

1670
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,029
You're the one who leaves.

1671
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,198
Well, go ahead then. Go ahead. Don't...

1672
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,450
I'm gonna stay right here
until the job is done.

1673
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:36,804
Don't stay here doing me no favors.

1674
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,912
Richard, you think I'm staying here
because of you?

1675
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,248
I stay here because of my girls.

1676
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:44,918
I stay here because I answer to something
higher than Richard Williams.

1677
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:49,047
And you better be glad,
because if I was staying here for you...

1678
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:52,092
I would have been gone a long time ago.

1679
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,219
- Look at this house.
- I'm looking.

1680
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,198
- Look where you live.
- I'm looking! I'm looking!

1681
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:59,182
Where would you live if it wasn't for me?
Where would you be?

1682
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:02,102
Stuck in some apartment
with three kids and no daddy.

1683
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,604
That's where you would be.

1684
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:08,191
Listen to you.
That's your ego and your bragging.

1685
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,027
You're just scared.

1686
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:13,989
You're just scared.

1687
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:16,741
Scared you will fail.

1688
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:21,329
Scared that the world
will look at you and see...

1689
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:24,666
another dumb nigga.

1690
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:30,464
And you know what?
You think they might be right.

1691
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:39,097
I have never,
never thought that about you.

1692
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,776
You've done your job.

1693
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:55,363
And whether you wanna see it or not,
I've done mine.

1694
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:59,784
But this is Venus's life.
You gotta let her decide.

1695
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:05,123
Because if you don't trust her to do that,
she's gonna be the one leaving you.

1696
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,183
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1697
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,407
So you wanna play?

1698
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:24,244
I don't know why you won't let me.

1699
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:27,205
Unless you think I'm not ready.

1700
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:49,978
When I was a little boy,
I grew up in Shreveport.

1701
01:41:51,314 --> 01:41:53,023
One day my father took me to town.

1702
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,318
He give me this money
to pay this white man for something.

1703
01:41:57,278 --> 01:42:01,781
Back in them days, Black folks weren't
allowed to touch white peoples.

1704
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:07,412
So I went to give the man this money,
and I accidentally touched his hand.

1705
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:10,749
And he start beating on me.

1706
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,085
He knocked me down,
his friends come over,

1707
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,255
they all start stomping on me
and beating on me.

1708
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:22,260
And I look up and
I see my father in the crowd...

1709
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:24,137
and he took off running.

1710
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,059
Left me there with these
grown men beating on me.

1711
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:34,189
Now, I haven't been no great daddy...

1712
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:39,152
but I've never done nothing
but try to protect you.

1713
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,201
This next step you about to take...

1714
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:50,789
it would be hard for anybody.

1715
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:56,002
But for you...
You not gonna just be representing you,

1716
01:42:56,087 --> 01:43:01,508
you gonna be representing
every little Black girl on earth.

1717
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:06,513
And you gonna be the one
gotta go through that gate.

1718
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:11,309
And I just never
wanted you to look up...

1719
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:16,064
and see your daddy running away.

1720
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:24,823
Daddy, you always said I'd be
number one in the world, right?

1721
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:29,661
Let's go out there and show
all of those people

1722
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,038
that I can handle what's coming.

1723
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,543
And I'm not gonna let you down.

1724
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,421
How could you, Junior?

1725
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,260
Come here.

1726
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:02,569
<i>Welcome to Oakland, California
for The Bank of the West Classic,</i>

1727
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:06,865
<i>where tomorrow, world number one
and reigning US Open champion,</i>

1728
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:11,453
<i>Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,
will face a tough draw of challengers,</i>

1729
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:15,457
<i>all hoping to take home
the 400,000 dollar purse.</i>

1730
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:18,501
<i>Among them,
14-year-old Venus Williams,</i>

1731
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:22,005
<i>who takes the court
in her first-ever professional match.</i>

1732
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:26,050
<i>In fact, it will be the first match
Williams has played at any level</i>

1733
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:28,178
<i>in more than three years,</i>

1734
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,722
<i>since her father made
the controversial decision</i>

1735
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:33,641
<i>to pull her out
of Junior tournament tennis,</i>

1736
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:37,645
<i>which is the normal
conduit to tennis superstardom.</i>

1737
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:40,982
<i>Many questions remain
about how this talented youngster</i>

1738
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:45,570
<i>will now fare under the pressure
and spotlight of the professional tour,</i>

1739
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:50,700
<i>against veteran players, after so long
away from competition.</i>

1740
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:54,788
<i>A worry even her outspoken father
cannot hide.</i>

1741
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:59,334
<i>We been working for this day
for nine long, hard years.</i>

1742
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:02,712
<i>Uh, you be saying,
"We gonna get there, we gonna get there."</i>

1743
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:08,468
<i>And, uh, finally you get there like today,
and you find out, "Wow..."</i>

1744
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,678
<i>"We don't belongs here.</i>

1745
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:15,141
<i>We belong some place else.
We belong back in the ghetto."</i>

1746
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:20,188
<i>A genius? A huckster?
Tomorrow we will finally see.</i>

1747
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:24,192
<i>Is his dream only hype,
or is his daughter, in fact,</i>

1748
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:27,237
<i>what the tennis world
has been waiting for?</i>

1749
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,490
You did it, Richard.

1750
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:33,284
Last year there was 24 media credentials
for this tournament.

1751
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,412
This year you got 200, so...

1752
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:38,016
- You know what? That's him.
- Okay. That's him.

1753
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,457
We should get Venus, right?

1754
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:43,211
- Guys, it's go time. Look alive.
- Come on. The man is here.

1755
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:47,423
- The Nike man here, y'all. Close that.
- This is it. Guys, you're gonna go there.

1756
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:50,760
- Yep. Get in your positions.
- Okay, you ready?

1757
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,865
- Hey, Patrick, how you doing?
- Very well.

1758
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:55,784
- How's Terri and the kids?
- They're good.

1759
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:58,728
- Billy still playing baseball?
- Yeah, he's swingin' away.

1760
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:02,105
- Hello. Patrick. Nice to meet you.
- Richard Williams. This is Oracene.

1761
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,648
That's my wife, that's Brandy.

1762
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,502
- You know who that is.
- It's an honor to meet you.

1763
01:46:05,526 --> 01:46:07,128
That's who you brought that briefcase for.

1764
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:09,279
That's right. Yeah.

1765
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:12,532
Well, you had a long trip...

1766
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,492
- Mm-hm.
- And a big day tomorrow,

1767
01:46:14,577 --> 01:46:17,996
so I am not gonna take up
too much of your time.

1768
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:22,584
Now, I hope it is clear
how highly we regard your daughter.

1769
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:25,461
We'd like to take her
off the table right now.

1770
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:29,132
- That is three million dollars.
- Whoo!

1771
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:31,593
Signature shoe. Signature line.

1772
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,928
We want to build our women's brand
around Venus.

1773
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:36,639
Make her a marquee player.
How's that sound?

1774
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:38,516
Well, I think, uh...

1775
01:46:40,352 --> 01:46:44,105
Well, actually...
you need to be pitching her.

1776
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:51,529
Well, Venus, what do you think?
I mean, that is a generous deal.

1777
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:54,949
It's a million more than Capriati
got before she went pro.

1778
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,702
Plus, a real commitment to invest

1779
01:46:57,786 --> 01:47:00,997
in the charity and outreach programs
you and your family support.

1780
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,123
That's great.

1781
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:04,876
We think you're gonna
have a tremendous career

1782
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,546
and we want to help you build it,
starting today.

1783
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:19,724
Uh...

1784
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:22,143
- It's, uh...
- Yeah.

1785
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:27,482
- Um...
- Uh...

1786
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:32,487
Yeah, maybe...
maybe just have a minute.

1787
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:34,489
- You know, just let the family...
- Absolutely.

1788
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:36,282
- No problem, just for...
- Of course.

1789
01:47:36,367 --> 01:47:39,202
Just to be clear,
this deal is for tonight only.

1790
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:42,830
It's off the table as soon as you step
on that court tomorrow, okay?

1791
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:44,976
- Take your time. Talk about it.
- Patrick, listen, thank you.

1792
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,211
We'll just take a second.
There is a heck of a seafood buffet.

1793
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,631
Now, it's on the mezzanine level.
You don't want to hit one or two...

1794
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:54,717
Just fix your face
till the man get out the door.

1795
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:56,094
What does he mean by that?

1796
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:57,948
Just let the man get out the door first.

1797
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,491
No, I want to know
what he means though.

1798
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:02,600
We gonna talk about it when he leaves.
Just let him get out the door.

1799
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:04,143
What is going on?

1800
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,730
I... What did he mean by,
it's one night only?

1801
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:09,876
- Tonight only?
- Don't you worry about that.

1802
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,962
- I want to understand.
- He's just trying to scare us.

1803
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:14,089
That's right. He's trying
to scare us, and guess what?

1804
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:15,238
I'm scared.

1805
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:17,634
I'm frickin'... I'm frickin' terrified.

1806
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:20,827
Guys, what... what is going on?

1807
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:24,038
Three million dollars.
What's the problem here?

1808
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,541
- Rick, look...
- Let me see.

1809
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,501
They haven't even seen the girl play yet.

1810
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:30,336
Yeah, no, that...

1811
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:32,181
I mean, that's the point.
They don't have to.

1812
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,048
Richard, I... you did it.

1813
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:37,301
Hey! You did it, Richard.
Look, I thought you were nuts.

1814
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:39,595
All the talking and the interviews
and the nonsense.

1815
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:43,558
But look, you were right, she's a star.
Look at what it...

1816
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:47,770
We won! This... Why is everybody so glum?
Please, guys?

1817
01:48:47,855 --> 01:48:49,814
Oracene, please,
can you help me out here?

1818
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:51,816
You need to be talking to Venus.

1819
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:55,611
V? What's going on?

1820
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,782
I just want to show them what I can do.

1821
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,744
- Okay.
- I understand it's a good offer, but...

1822
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:05,913
This is not a good offer.
This is an unbelievable offer.

1823
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,624
Guys, this is money
that changes your lives.

1824
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:11,252
That changes your family's lives.
What do we...?

1825
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:14,881
Rick, you asking this girl to take all
the hard work she done did...

1826
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:17,800
- Richard, stop it. Stop it!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

1827
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,595
All the hard work she done did
for the last ten years

1828
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,972
and accept the first offer
that come through the door.

1829
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:25,952
- You know that's not right, Rick.
- Richard, the draw's not even out yet.

1830
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:29,645
Rick. The girl is asking
for a opportunity to compete.

1831
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:31,939
We don't even know who she's playing.

1832
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,358
She don't care nothing about that.

1833
01:49:34,443 --> 01:49:37,403
Venus Williams,
do you care who you play?

1834
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:39,280
No, Daddy.

1835
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:42,244
Venus Williams, are you gonna beat
whoever on the other side of that net?

1836
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,576
Yes, Daddy.

1837
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:46,996
Venus Williams,
do you wanna take this deal?

1838
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,710
No.

1839
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:54,587
Well, there it is.

1840
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,048
We're not taking the deal.
Let's go get something to eat.

1841
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,343
- Rick, you hungry?
- No.

1842
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:03,221
Come on, everybody, let's go.

1843
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,991
Come on, Rick,
you got to pay for this food.

1844
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:07,255
Hey, y'all. Hey, everybody.

1845
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,477
- Tunde!
- There you go.

1846
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,581
Look at that, look at that.

1847
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:18,069
Yeah. Mister Rick is paying for us
to go to a seafood buffet.

1848
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:21,531
- Yeah. Yes, come on.
- Hi.

1849
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,407
You knew about this?

1850
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:30,081
Yes. Come on!

1851
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,960
Game, Stafford.
<i>Stafford leads two games to love.</i>

1852
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:40,258
Fault!

1853
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:49,725
- Fault!
- Love-15.

1854
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:53,062
Come on, V.

1855
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:54,689
Fault!

1856
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,209
Love-30.

1857
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,007
Fight back now.

1858
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:25,720
Come on, Junior.

1859
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,851
Love-40.

1860
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:45,948
Oh!

1861
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:49,202
Game, Stafford.
<i>Stafford leads three games to love.</i>

1862
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,225
She's looking a little tight out there.
But, you know, she's gonna loosen up.

1863
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:55,727
It's gonna be good.
I'm gonna check out another match.

1864
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:57,460
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1865
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:04,258
30-40.

1866
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,063
That's all right.
That's all right.

1867
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,687
Oh!

1868
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:19,042
Game, Stafford.
<i>Stafford leads four games to love.</i>

1869
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:22,401
Hey, let it go now.
Next game. Let that go.

1870
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,406
- Yeah!
- Love-15.

1871
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:10,574
Attagirl, V.

1872
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:15,162
There you go.

1873
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,583
That's a great ball!

1874
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,794
That's a great ball!

1875
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:27,550
Game, Williams.
<i>Stafford leads four games to two.</i>

1876
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:32,596
- Let's go!
- Game, Williams.

1877
01:53:32,681 --> 01:53:34,659
- There it is. There you go.
- Four games all.

1878
01:53:57,664 --> 01:53:59,100
You were great tonight, Venus.

1879
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:01,667
Were you surprised
how you handled your nerves?

1880
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,253
I was somewhat surprised,
but somewhat not surprised.

1881
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:06,274
I guess since I haven't played
a tournament in a while,

1882
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:08,341
I was surprised that I wasn't
nervous or jumpy.

1883
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:10,217
Tomorrow you play the top seed, Vicario.

1884
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:13,304
She's number one in the world,
a three-time Grand Slam champ.

1885
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:15,014
How do you think you'll hold up?

1886
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:20,394
I think I have the game to beat anyone.
I just have to play it.

1887
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:22,957
- Also, I was wondering...
- That's enough. Real good questions.

1888
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:25,149
Let's go! Huh?

1889
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:28,194
What did you do out there?
I... I couldn't believe it. It's like...

1890
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:31,489
- Okay, Rick, I gotta go.
- It's like she's a... hired assassin.

1891
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:33,866
I mean, it's like, unbelievable.

1892
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,203
Richard, I talked to Dougherty.
He's upping the offer.

1893
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:39,663
Four million dollars, Richard.
Four million dollars.

1894
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,582
We did it. We did it, Richard.

1895
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,020
I think we just gonna keep our chips
on the table though, Rick.

1896
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,420
Wait, wait. Hey, Richard, no.
She's playing Vicario.

1897
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:47,940
She's the best player on the planet.

1898
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,925
She's the best player in the whole
wide world. She can't beat her.

1899
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:54,220
- But what if she do?
- Richard, it doesn't work like that.

1900
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:58,349
Oh, hey, Bud. Bud. Good to see you.
Still got them pretty pants on.

1901
01:54:58,433 --> 01:55:00,370
You missed out on this money though.
I tried to tell ya.

1902
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:02,269
You know him?

1903
01:55:02,354 --> 01:55:07,483
Rick, if she beats Vicario,
a 14-year-old who's never played a match,

1904
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:11,237
walks off the street and beats
the best player on the planet...

1905
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:15,574
forget Ali-Frazier, it'll be the greatest
upset in the history of sports!

1906
01:55:34,136 --> 01:55:35,970
Yes!

1907
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:39,974
- Oh.
- Oh!

1908
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:53,571
Meek. Come on.

1909
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:12,965
I know you love Venus
and all this is exciting, but...

1910
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,469
it's a little hard for you too, huh?

1911
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,141
Can I tell you a secret?

1912
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:29,064
Your sister is gonna be number one
in the whole world, no doubt about it.

1913
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:30,483
I know that.

1914
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:32,568
But you...

1915
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:36,155
You gonna be the best there ever was.

1916
01:56:37,282 --> 01:56:40,326
You gonna be the greatest of all time.

1917
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:44,955
You know how I know?
'Cause I planned for it.

1918
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:50,127
I knew you was having
a hard time in Venus's shadow,

1919
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:52,546
but I kept you there
'cause I knew you was rough.

1920
01:56:52,631 --> 01:56:55,549
I knew you was tough,
I knew you was a fighter.

1921
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,887
That's why I did
this whole thing like this.

1922
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:08,187
Go on, take that in. You're up next.

1923
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:20,407
Come on now. Move your feets.

1924
01:57:21,243 --> 01:57:23,452
One, two, three, four, five.

1925
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:25,246
One, two, three, four, five.

1926
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:27,623
One, two, three, four, five.

1927
01:57:27,707 --> 01:57:29,708
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1928
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:31,460
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1929
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:34,105
- Now, whatever happens tonight...
- Close. Close.

1930
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,675
- Next time, ten.
- I want you guys to remember...

1931
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:41,095
that you come from
a rich history of people.

1932
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:44,014
Right? Like Sojourner Truth.

1933
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,101
- Remember her?
- Yes.

1934
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:49,562
What did she say at Seneca Falls?

1935
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:52,565
- What did she say?
- "Ain't I a woman"?

1936
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:53,857
That's right. That's right.

1937
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,485
And what does that mean to you?
What does that mean to you?

1938
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,697
That she's strong,
and that she can do anything.

1939
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:00,906
Exactly.

1940
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:06,036
That she was a young Black woman,
just like you guys.

1941
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:10,791
And that she deserves to be seen,
and that she deserves to be heard.

1942
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:14,378
So, tonight I want you
to remember who you are,

1943
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:16,422
remember where you came from.

1944
01:58:17,382 --> 01:58:19,800
Stand tall and be proud in that.

1945
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,303
All right?

1946
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:26,807
Yeah. You gonna look beautiful.

1947
01:58:29,144 --> 01:58:30,978
You are beautiful, Venus.

1948
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,735
You too, Serena.

1949
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,867
Hello, everybody, and welcome
<i>back to Oakland on a beautiful night</i>

1950
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:48,996
<i>for our second-round match between
the reigning French and US Open champion,</i>

1951
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,958
<i>Arantxa Sánchez Vicario
and Venus Williams,</i>

1952
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:56,754
the heralded 14-year-old

1979
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,779
- 40-15.
- That's it. That's it. You like that?

1980
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:52,656
My wife taught her that.

1981
02:02:53,992 --> 02:02:57,035
That's Venus Williams.
Remember that name.

1982
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,916
Okay, that's a can of corn.
That's a can of corn!

1983
02:03:05,837 --> 02:03:09,590
Game, Williams.
<i>Williams leads, five games to two.</i>

See how she do that open stance?
That's what we worked on.

1986
02:03:14,095 --> 02:03:15,095
Yeah.

1987
02:03:18,725 --> 02:03:20,267
That's right.

1988
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:22,185
Looking good, Venus Williams.

1989
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:28,794
- There you go.
- Game. First set.

1990
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:30,110
<i>Venus Williams.</i>

1991
02:03:30,194 --> 02:03:32,487
That's it, kid! That's it!

1992
02:03:37,035 --> 02:03:40,245
There you go.
That's all that hard work, right there.

1993
02:03:59,474 --> 02:04:00,807
Game, Williams.

1994
02:04:00,892 --> 02:04:02,453
<i>She leads the set 3-1.</i>

1995
02:04:02,477 --> 02:04:06,104
She's scared of you.
She's scared of you, Venus.

1996
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:52,943
Just stay loose, Junior.

1997
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:08,542
She's gone to the toilet.

1998
02:05:09,836 --> 02:05:11,086
Okay.

1999
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:33,316
We're right here with you, Venus.

2000
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:39,322
- Stay in your game.
- Let it go. Stay right there.

2001
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:41,700
- You got it, V.
- We love you.

2002
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:51,585
Don't let it get in your head, Junior.

2003
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,508
- She's trying to freeze her.
- Mm-hm.

2004
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:03,555
- Oh, come on.
- What's... what's happening?

2005
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:06,475
She's icing her.

2006
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:09,394
- They don't have a rule for how long...
- There's nothing we can do.

2007
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:11,063
They can't... There's...

2008
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:15,317
She can just say she's using the toilet.
It's a dirty, old trick.

2009
02:06:18,029 --> 02:06:20,322
That's eight minutes already.

2010
02:06:21,365 --> 02:06:23,283
That's eight minutes.

2011
02:06:25,953 --> 02:06:27,370
That's nine minutes.

2012
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:35,879
You got her on the ropes!

2013
02:06:38,299 --> 02:06:41,301
- Let's go!
- This is ridiculous!

2014
02:06:56,109 --> 02:06:57,776
Why won't she stand up?

2015
02:06:58,319 --> 02:06:59,945
Stand up, Junior.

2016
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:27,097
That's all right, just stay in it, V.

2017
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:31,059
Hey, V, your game.
Your game, Venus. Let's go.

2018
02:07:31,686 --> 02:07:33,728
- Time.
- That's right. Let's go.

2019
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:38,984
Yes! Feel your game!

2020
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:03,008
- Out!
- Love-15.

2021
02:08:04,302 --> 02:08:06,928
- You got the next one, Venus.
- Hey, find it.

2022
02:08:07,013 --> 02:08:08,972
You got the next one, Venus.

2023
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:17,189
- Let.
- Fault.

2024
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:21,026
Let it go. Let's go. Next one.

2025
02:08:38,169 --> 02:08:39,753
Come on, Venus Williams.

2026
02:08:56,729 --> 02:08:59,731
<i>Game, Vicario. Three games all.</i>

2027
02:09:05,613 --> 02:09:07,030
15-40.

2028
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:08,907
Come on, V.
You got the next one.

2029
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:14,746
Okay, Junior.

2030
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:22,170
Game, Vicario.

2031
02:09:26,133 --> 02:09:27,717
<i>Game, Vicario.</i>

2032
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:37,352
Game. Second set,
<i>Vicario, six-three. One set all.</i>

2033
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,282
Oh, my God.

2034
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:45,545
<i>Five-love. Final set.</i>

2035
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:01,603
Love-40.

2036
02:11:05,316 --> 02:11:06,941
It's all right, Venus.

2037
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:30,507
Game, set, and match.
<i>Vicario, two sets to one.</i>

2038
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:33,635
<i>Two-six, six-three, six-love.</i>

2039
02:11:43,938 --> 02:11:45,522
Good job, Venus.

2040
02:11:48,567 --> 02:11:52,737
She did good out there.
She did great. She did great.

2041
02:12:14,427 --> 02:12:17,470
Hey, V. Mmm...

2042
02:12:18,597 --> 02:12:19,806
Mm-hm.

2043
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,611
I should have won tonight.

2044
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:40,410
Now all our deals, no respect...

2045
02:12:40,494 --> 02:12:42,412
Uh-uh. No. No, no, no.

2046
02:12:42,496 --> 02:12:43,830
- Don't do that.
- Mm-mm.

2047
02:12:43,914 --> 02:12:45,582
You were counting on me.

2048
02:12:45,666 --> 02:12:48,126
Okay, okay, you listen to me.

2049
02:12:48,711 --> 02:12:50,086
Look here.

2050
02:12:51,005 --> 02:12:55,049
You just went toe-to-toe,
for two hours...

2051
02:12:55,634 --> 02:12:58,636
with the number one player
in the whole world.

2052
02:12:58,721 --> 02:13:00,180
Had her shook.

2053
02:13:00,264 --> 02:13:04,184
- Had her knees shaking.
- Yes. Yes.

2054
02:13:04,268 --> 02:13:06,019
And you did it with grace.

2055
02:13:08,355 --> 02:13:11,274
If you don't have no respect
for yourself right now,

2056
02:13:11,358 --> 02:13:13,151
you will never have none.

2057
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:15,236
At all.

2058
02:13:16,447 --> 02:13:19,449
You are a champion, Venus Williams.

2059
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:21,951
And the whole world know it.

2060
02:13:23,662 --> 02:13:26,039
You gonna walk out there
with your head up.

2061
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:33,254
I have never been more proud
of a person in my whole life.

2062
02:13:38,886 --> 02:13:41,262
Come on, your sisters outside
waiting for you. It's cold.

2063
02:13:52,274 --> 02:13:54,317
Daddy, I'll take my bag.

2064
02:13:54,401 --> 02:13:56,486
- No, I'll carry it, Junior.
- I got it.

2065
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:10,458
Hey, champion.

2066
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:12,377
There she go.

2067
02:14:20,844 --> 02:14:22,428
We're proud of you.

2068
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:24,681
You did it, V.

2069
02:14:49,582 --> 02:14:52,584
We're proud of you. You did good.

2070
02:14:56,547 --> 02:14:58,108
This is the exit.
I can let you all out here.

2071
02:14:58,132 --> 02:15:00,091
Thank you, sir. Y'all go ahead.

2072
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,103
Richard.

2073
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:14,689
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2074
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:26,534
They look like they know.

2075
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:29,454
Go on. Don't keep 'em waiting.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

2076
02:15:29,538 --> 02:15:31,414
That's your fans. Go ahead.

2077
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:33,875
- Come on, Serena.
- Okay!

2078
02:15:33,959 --> 02:15:37,211
- You next!
- Venus! Venus! Venus!

2079
02:15:37,296 --> 02:15:40,882
Richard. Richard.
How about that, huh?

2080
02:15:40,966 --> 02:15:43,092
Hey, Nike's back on the line.

2081
02:15:43,177 --> 02:15:45,178
I mean, they're coming
out of the woodwork.

2082
02:15:45,262 --> 02:15:48,556
Puma. Fila. Reebok. They all wanna meet.
They all wanna meet first.

2083
02:15:48,641 --> 02:15:50,600
I'm gonna tell 'em
they can kiss my backside.

2084
02:15:50,684 --> 02:15:53,811
No, I think we'll talk to the peoples.
I think we gonna talk to them.

2085
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:56,314
Hey, Richard, she did it.

2086
02:15:56,857 --> 02:15:58,483
Oh, yeah, she did it.

2087
02:16:01,654 --> 02:16:04,238
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2088
02:16:17,086 --> 02:16:19,879
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!

2089
02:17:30,701 --> 02:17:33,035
<i>We had the kids' future planned
before they were born,</i>

2090
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:37,165
<i>and the first day that I took Venus
and Serena to the tennis court,</i>

2091
02:17:37,249 --> 02:17:38,374
<i>I knew I had champions.</i>

2092
02:17:39,042 --> 02:17:41,627
<i>Sometimes I feel like it was just...
destiny.</i>

2093
02:17:41,712 --> 02:17:43,129
<i>For the both of them.</i>

2094
02:17:43,881 --> 02:17:46,317
<i>If you were a tennis player,
who would you want to be like?</i>

2095
02:17:46,341 --> 02:17:48,301
<i>I'd like other people to be like me.</i>

2096
02:17:49,344 --> 02:17:52,805
<i>If she plays the way that she's
capable of, this kid's gonna be great.</i>

2097
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:58,227
<i>Venus and Serena Williams
have made tennis history.</i>

2098
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:07,195
<i>They're the first sisters
and the first African-Americans</i>

2099
02:18:07,279 --> 02:18:10,782
<i>ever to claim the top two spots
in the world rankings.</i>

2100
02:18:19,792 --> 02:18:24,796
<i>People are so captivated by the story
of sisters having to play each other.</i>

2101
02:18:25,756 --> 02:18:27,715
<i>This is how we've always
dreamed it would be.</i>

2102
02:18:34,681 --> 02:18:38,768
<i>Young African-American kids...
they're seeing a reflection of themselves.</i>

2103
02:18:38,852 --> 02:18:40,686
<i>No matter which one win,
we still win.</i>

2104
02:18:40,771 --> 02:18:43,064
<i>Raise your hand, Serena. Venus.</i>

2105
02:18:50,155 --> 02:18:52,300
My dad, he always
<i>thought it was important for me</i>

2106
02:18:52,324 --> 02:18:53,699
<i>to give back to the community.</i>

2107
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,264
<i>Being number one is great,</i>

2108
02:18:58,288 --> 02:19:01,249
<i>but fighting for the generation
to come is even better.</i>

2109
02:19:12,302 --> 02:19:14,072
<i>I'll never forget my dad said,</i>

2110
02:19:14,096 --> 02:19:16,241
<i>"This is the moment
we've been working for all our lives.</i>

2111
02:19:16,265 --> 02:19:18,349
<i>Stay focused and don't be afraid."</i>

2112
02:19:20,769 --> 02:19:23,312
<i>Open the stance.
That's... There you go.</i>

2113
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:29,879
They will remember
<i>Venus and Serena. They will say,</i>

2114
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:31,654
<i>"Boy, they did it. I can do it."</i>

2115
02:19:36,702 --> 02:19:40,204
<i>We'll win. And we'll share our victory
with every person in the world.</i>
