1
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're screwed.</font>

2
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more free wi-fi.</font>

3
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Ki-jung!
- Yeah?</font>

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lady upstairs put
a password on 'iptime'.</font>

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A password?</font>

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you try 123456789?</font>

7
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No luck.</font>

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it the other way.</font>

9
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried that too!</font>

10
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?</font>

11
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

12
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kim Ki-taek.</font>

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?</font>

14
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our phones are shut off.
Now our wifi is shut off.</font>

15
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your plan?</font>

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?</font>

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For wifi, hold it high.</font>

18
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick it in every corner and so on.</font>

19
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn stink bugs.</font>

20
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here! I got it!</font>

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You got a signal?</font>

22
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, see?</font>

23
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one, 'coffeeland 2G'.</font>

24
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a new cafe open?</font>

25
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I get it?</font>

26
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climb up here.</font>

27
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey kids.</font>

28
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does it work?
- Yeah.</font>

29
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then check WhatsApp.</font>

30
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.</font>

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

32
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it is. Pizza Generation.</font>

33
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Check this out, guys.</font>

34
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.</font>

35
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we can get paid.</font>

36
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.</font>

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Fumigation?</font>

38
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They still do that kind of thing?</font>

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess so.</font>

40
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the window.</font>

41
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.</font>

42
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill the stink bugs.</font>

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, too many stink bugs
these days...</font>

44
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, that smells!</font>

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to shut it!</font>

46
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I shut it, Dad?</font>

47
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is the problem?</font>

48
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this one as an example.</font>

49
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call this a straight line?</font>

50
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why's it folded here?</font>

51
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this sticking up?</font>

52
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even fold it.</font>

53
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quarter of them look like this.</font>

54
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So 1 out of 4 are rejects.</font>

55
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're really docking
10% off our pay?</font>

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?</font>

57
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?</font>

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here.</font>

59
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not some minor issue.</font>

60
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:41,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?</font>

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brand? You can't even afford
a box folder!</font>

62
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

63
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss.</font>

64
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all because
of that guy, right?</font>

65
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What guy?</font>

66
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?</font>

67
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?</font>

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know all that?</font>

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you?</font>

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sister knows the guy.</font>

71
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.</font>

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which, Boss.</font>

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll accept a 10% penalty.</font>

74
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return...</font>

75
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return?</font>

76
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?</font>

77
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, we need someone!</font>

78
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.</font>

79
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?</font>

80
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on a sec.</font>

81
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me think about it.</font>

82
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.</font>

83
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're all gathered here today,</font>

84
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones,</font>

85
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this bounteous wi-fi!</font>

86
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.</font>

87
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you put up
a 'No Urinating' sign?</font>

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you!</font>

89
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, signs like that
just make them piss even more.</font>

90
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least shout at him!</font>

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shout.</font>

92
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Please don't piss!"</font>

93
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is that Min?</font>

94
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey mister, that's not a toilet.</font>

95
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way to go, Min.</font>

96
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, punk!</font>

97
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you staring at, asshole?</font>

98
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here! You little shit.</font>

99
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a fucking grip!</font>

100
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an impressive friend.</font>

101
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">College students have
a real vigor to them.</font>

102
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not like my brother.</font>

103
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?</font>

104
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

105
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>

106
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh hi, Min!</font>

107
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min!</font>

108
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you well, sir?</font>

109
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sure.
- What are you doing here?</font>

110
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I texted you. Didn't you see it?</font>

111
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, were you eating?</font>

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we weren't eating.</font>

113
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?</font>

114
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could've met outside,
why come here?</font>

115
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of this.</font>

116
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for you,
but it's so heavy.</font>

117
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Put it down here.</font>

118
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, what is that?</font>

119
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,</font>

120
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.</font>

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a landscape type?</font>

122
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can see it
as an abstract type.</font>

123
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you know these!</font>

124
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks
since his cadet days.</font>

125
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house</font>

126
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is filled with these things.</font>

127
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families...</font>

128
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min!</font>

129
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so metaphorical.</font>

130
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.</font>

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

132
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa.</font>

133
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food would be better.</font>

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that called?
A landscape stone?</font>

135
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You collect those rocks too?</font>

136
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thanks to that rock
I saw your parents, they look healthy.</font>

137
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.</font>

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?</font>

139
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't afford lessons.</font>

140
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cute, huh?</font>

141
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the one you're tutoring?</font>

142
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.</font>

143
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take over
as her English tutor.</font>

144
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

145
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.</font>

146
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a nice girl.</font>

147
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.</font>

148
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your university friends?</font>

149
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why ask a loser like me?</font>

150
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think?</font>

151
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the thought makes me sick.</font>

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?</font>

153
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's revolting.</font>

154
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like her?</font>

155
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm serious.</font>

156
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.</font>

157
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you take care of
her until then.</font>

158
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's you,
I can leave in peace.</font>

159
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your trust,</font>

160
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do I have to pretend to be
a college student?</font>

161
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, think about it.</font>

162
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For years including
your military service,</font>

163
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you took the university entrance
exam 4 times.</font>

164
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...</font>

165
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it comes to English,</font>

166
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.</font>

167
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I guess so.
- Sure!</font>

168
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.</font>

169
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just fake it.</font>

170
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...</font>

171
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How should I describe the mother...?</font>

172
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a bit simple.</font>

173
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young and simple.</font>

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple?</font>

175
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

176
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.</font>

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you agree?</font>

178
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess so.</font>

179
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you said
your sister is artistic?</font>

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good at Photoshop?</font>

181
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?</font>

182
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

183
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, no smoking in here.</font>

184
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.</font>

185
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

186
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the cherry on top...</font>

187
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, does Oxford have
a major in document forgery?</font>

188
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung would be top of her class.</font>

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's amazing, huh?</font>

190
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:39,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.</font>

191
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son.</font>

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of you.</font>

193
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

194
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.</font>

195
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go to this university
next year.</font>

196
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've got a plan!</font>

197
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just printed out the document
a bit early.</font>

198
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who is it?</i></font>

199
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame? Good afternoon.</font>

200
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here on Min's recommendation...</font>

201
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh right, come in.</i></font>

202
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

203
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>

204
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Madame.</font>

205
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just work here.
Come this way.</font>

206
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The yard is so nice.</font>

207
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The inside's nice too.</font>

208
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.</font>

209
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used to live in this house.</font>

210
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He designed it himself.</font>

211
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see,
now it's a playpen.</font>

212
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

213
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.</font>

214
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

215
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame.</i></font>

216
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame?</i></font>

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>

218
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>

219
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here.
The tutoring candidate.</font>

220
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care about documents.</font>

221
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min recommended you, after all.</font>

222
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.</font>

223
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye and I were quite happy
with him.</font>

224
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?</font>

225
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

226
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was marvelous.</font>

227
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:56,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.</font>

228
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.</font>

229
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:07,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,</font>

230
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you're not up
to Min's level, then,</font>

231
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure
what the point is.</font>

232
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So anyway,
what I want to say is,</font>

233
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?</font>

234
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.</font>

235
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it okay with you?</font>

236
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure about #24?</font>

237
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:17,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye, you solved those later problems
then went back to #24.</font>

238
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

239
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

240
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.</font>

241
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.</font>

242
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The heart doesn't lie.</font>

243
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An exam is like slashing through
a jungle.</font>

244
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lose that momentum
and you're finished.</font>

245
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer to #24?
I don't care.</font>

246
00:16:55,056 --> 00:17:00,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!</font>

247
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all I care about.</font>

248
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you need is vigor.</font>

249
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vigor.</font>

250
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?</font>

251
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'll pay you
this time each month.</font>

252
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?</font>

253
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the fee,</font>

254
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.</font>

255
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

256
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a proper introduction?</font>

257
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.</font>

258
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kevin!</font>

259
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you feel like snacking
during your lesson, just call me.</font>

260
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you need anything, ask her.</font>

261
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She knows this house better than I...</font>

262
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, stop it!</font>

263
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, did he startle you?</font>

264
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How cute. His name's Da-song?</font>

265
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, our youngest.</font>

266
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, come say hi!</font>

267
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Mr. Kevin!</font>

268
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.</font>

269
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.</font>

270
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indians?</font>

271
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a fanboy personality?</font>

272
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,</font>

273
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he can barely sit still!</font>

274
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,</font>

275
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hoping he'd learn moderation
and focus.</font>

276
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But look.</font>

277
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's even worse.</font>

278
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,
maybe that's why.</font>

279
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.</font>

280
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing.</font>

281
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?</font>

282
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.</font>

283
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.</font>

284
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong.</font>

285
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strong, right?</font>

286
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got an eye for this.</font>

287
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a chimpanzee, right?</font>

288
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A self-portrait.</font>

289
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure enough!</font>

290
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding.</font>

291
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...</font>

292
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.</font>

293
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of them lasts even a month.</font>

294
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Da-song is just so hard
to control.</font>

295
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?</font>

296
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone just came to mind.</font>

297
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was her name?</font>

298
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica! Right, Jessica...</font>

299
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was in the same art school
as my cousin.</font>

300
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was her Korean name?</font>

301
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,</font>

302
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she returned to Korea.</font>

303
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illinois... tell me more.</font>

304
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her teaching is unusual,
but she knows how to handle kids.</font>

305
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got a special reputation
in her field.</font>

306
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But even though
her methods are unique,</font>

307
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she can help kids get
into good art schools.</font>

308
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:31,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?</font>

309
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to meet her?</font>

310
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though I heard she's
in high demand...</font>

311
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

312
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,</font>

313
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.</font>

314
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth</font>

315
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this mosaic arrangement.</font>

316
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.</font>

317
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gochujang is red, the rice...
well, anyway,</font>

318
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:16,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!</font>

319
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How exciting.</font>

320
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure Miss Jessica
must have already sensed this,</font>

321
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.</font>

322
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice lesson, Jessica.</font>

323
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, thank you for the introduction.</font>

324
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:41,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...</font>

325
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye.</font>

326
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we'll start with #38?</font>

327
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin.</font>

328
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

329
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that Da-song is
faking it all?</font>

330
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? What do you mean?</font>

331
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all a show.</font>

332
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acting like a genius,
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.</font>

333
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An artist cosplay.</font>

334
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song?</font>

335
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that thing,</font>

336
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he freezes and stares at the sky,
as if struck by inspiration.</font>

337
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:26,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he's walking along, then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes.</font>

338
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you know what I mean?</font>

339
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gives me the creeps.</font>

340
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He pretends that he can't live
a normal life.</font>

341
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me want to puke.</font>

342
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Da-song is pretending...</font>

343
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what's that got to do
with your studies?</font>

344
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm just saying.</font>

345
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, so in that sense,</font>

346
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you told me
about Da-song was very interesting,</font>

347
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so let's write about it
in English.</font>

348
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:11,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And be sure to use the word 'pretend'
at least twice.</font>

349
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, can I ask you a question?</font>

350
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

351
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That teacher Jessica.</font>

352
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:25,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she really your cousin's classmate?</font>

353
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

354
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's your girlfriend, right?</font>

355
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way... I just met her today.</font>

356
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?</font>

357
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you interested?</font>

358
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw her?</font>

359
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.</font>

360
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

361
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>

362
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you are interested.</font>

363
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye...</font>

364
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:18,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if we can compare Jessica
to a rose,</font>

365
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you are...</font>

366
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's study.
- Yes.</font>

367
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:12,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still.</font>

368
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

369
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>

370
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, get up!</font>

371
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Da-song!</font>

372
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your butt...</font>

373
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Madame, please leave us.
- What?</font>

374
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never teach with a parent
in the room.</font>

375
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...</font>

376
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait downstairs.</font>

377
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park Da-song?</font>

378
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>

379
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame?</font>

380
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want some plum extract?</font>

381
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

382
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.</font>

383
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that would be great.</font>

384
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Yes?</font>

385
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got an idea.</font>

386
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take two glasses of plum
extract to Da-song's room.</font>

387
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not a parent,
so you can go in!</font>

388
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's right!</font>

389
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll report back on
what's going on in there...</font>

390
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I think of it earlier?</font>

391
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

392
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They came out?</font>

393
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

394
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're done already?</font>

395
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame.</font>

396
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come sit next to me.</font>

397
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, go upstairs.</font>

398
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up!</font>

399
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song just painted this.</font>

400
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see...</font>

401
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather speak with Madame alone.</font>

402
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but she is...</font>

403
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, leave us.</font>

404
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame,</font>

405
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:15,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I study art psychology
and art therapy?</font>

406
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

407
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?</font>

408
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be frank,</font>

409
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,</font>

410
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to hear about this.</font>

411
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.</font>

412
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What to do?</font>

413
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind, then.</font>

414
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:43,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lower-right region of a painting is
called the 'schizophrenia zone'.</font>

415
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.</font>

416
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, phrenia...</font>

417
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here.</font>

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song painted this unusual shape,
right?</font>

419
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>

420
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?</font>

421
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's correct.</font>

422
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?</font>

423
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

424
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:09,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've stared at that painting
at every meal!</font>

425
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I had no idea.</font>

426
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.</font>

427
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.</font>

428
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to
open that box with me, Madame?</font>

429
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to open it.</font>

430
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:29,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions
per week,</font>

431
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:34,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?</font>

432
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

433
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of that my rate is
set at a very high level.</font>

434
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay with that?</font>

435
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my pleasure.</font>

436
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's dad is home.</font>

437
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, Da-song's new art teacher
is here.</font>

438
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.</font>

439
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Jessica! This is Dong-ik.</i></font>

440
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

441
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your help.</font>

442
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Class is over?</font>

443
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, just finished.</font>

444
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?</font>

445
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.</font>

446
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give her a lift, okay?</font>

447
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?</font>

448
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

449
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Jessica?</font>

450
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:29,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?</font>

451
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine.</font>

452
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.</font>

453
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

454
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mind if it's far away.</font>

455
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.</font>

456
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like it's going to rain.</font>

457
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ride the Benz, not the subway!</font>

458
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!</font>

459
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:56,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

460
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?</font>

461
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benzes?</font>

462
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.</font>

463
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You worked as a valet?</font>

464
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,</font>

465
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in that 6-month window?</font>

466
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was after the cake shop
went bust.</font>

467
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're moving
to the next stage already?</font>

468
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I set a trap in the Benz.</font>

469
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we're diving right in.</font>

470
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this is so metaphorical.</font>

471
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look Dad, we're eating in
a driver's cafeteria right now!</font>

472
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, a driver's cafeteria!</font>

473
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat as much as you want, kids.</font>

474
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even pay for it,
they did!</font>

475
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, have some more.
Eat up!</font>

476
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Dad.</font>

477
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat your fill!</font>

478
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do
to that woman yesterday?</font>

479
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

480
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was freaking out.</font>

481
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.</font>

482
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, I don't know!</font>

483
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:38,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest.</font>

484
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then suddenly she's weeping.</font>

485
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.</font>

486
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're home?</font>

487
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you eat yet?</font>

488
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is something wrong?</font>

489
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the housekeeper out?</font>

490
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's walking the dogs.</font>

491
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey.</font>

492
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was under my car seat.</font>

493
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.</font>

494
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

495
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, honey.</font>

496
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know
he was this kind of guy.</font>

497
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you pay him well?</font>

498
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he saving up by not paying
for a motel?</font>

499
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be a pervert.</font>

500
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He likes it in the car.</font>

501
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!</font>

502
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.</font>

503
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why in my car?</font>

504
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?</font>

505
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

506
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?</font>

507
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe this.</font>

508
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you know
what's strangest of all?</font>

509
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

510
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually if you have car sex,</font>

511
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:39,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.</font>

512
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

513
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how can you forget
your own panties?</font>

514
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.
It's hard to overlook.</font>

515
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.</font>

516
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get me?</font>

517
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh my</i>... meth or cocaine?</font>

518
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! The kids...</font>

519
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do?</font>

520
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if anyone finds white powder
in your car?</font>

521
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down, relax.</font>

522
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax</font>

523
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.</font>

524
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no need to call the police.</font>

525
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that!</font>

526
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:32,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"</font>

527
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

528
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So instead...</font>

529
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go?</font>

530
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay sure.</font>

531
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to mention panties
or car sex.</font>

532
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?</font>

533
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely not!</font>

534
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if he goes online
and accuses us...</font>

535
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give him a good severance.</font>

536
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was Da-song today?</font>

537
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was fine.</font>

538
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So class is finished?
- Yes.</font>

539
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, the last time you came,</font>

540
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our driver gave you a ride,
right?</font>

541
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

542
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This may be an odd question,</font>

543
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but nothing happened then?</font>

544
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he was very nice.</font>

545
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him
to go to Hyehwa Station,</font>

546
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he insisted
on driving me home.</font>

547
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That jerk!
He took you home late at night?</font>

548
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Revealing where you live?</font>

549
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I got off at Hyehwa.</font>

550
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, good girl. Very good.</font>

551
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica nice...</font>

552
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did something happen with him?</font>

553
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:42,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.</font>

554
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What incident?</font>

555
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't need to know.</font>

556
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.</font>

557
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, you're too young
and innocent!</font>

558
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a lot to learn
about people.</font>

559
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:03,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we were excited to have such
a young, hip driver, too.</font>

560
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But isn't an older driver better?</font>

561
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.</font>

562
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father's brother had
a driver just like that.</font>

563
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,</font>

564
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.</font>

565
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know a man like that?</font>

566
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, he was so mild-mannered.</font>

567
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but my relatives relocated
to Chicago.</font>

568
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if Mr.
Kim's free now?</font>

569
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?</font>

570
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

571
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't trust anyone now.</font>

572
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.</font>

573
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:51,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.</font>

574
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really want to meet him?</font>

575
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm deadly serious.</font>

576
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This chain of recommendations
is best.</font>

577
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How should I describe it?</font>

578
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A belt of trust?</font>

579
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one's different.
- Here.</font>

580
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.</font>

581
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this one.</font>

582
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a touch screen now.</font>

583
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.</font>

584
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, this thing?</font>

585
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

586
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking our time, are we?</font>

587
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a nice car.</font>

588
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it!
Come over here.</font>

589
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a meeting now.</font>

590
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a seat and wait here.</font>

591
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, nice to meet...</font>

592
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is it compatible
with a phone?</font>

593
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:03,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.</font>

594
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.</font>

595
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.</font>

596
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

597
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:19,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.</font>

598
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

599
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem to know the roads well?</font>

600
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything below the 38th parallel.</font>

601
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.</font>

602
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.</font>

603
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation.</font>

604
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... the head of a household,</font>

605
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the leader of a company?</font>

606
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:49,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...</font>

607
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's companionship of a sort,</font>

608
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that's how I've approached each day.</font>

609
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The years sure pass quickly.</font>

610
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.</font>

611
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:10,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.</font>

612
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i></font>

613
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i></font>

614
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Right.</i></font>

615
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i></font>

616
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i></font>

617
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:32,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but then she went on to work
for this family.</i></font>

618
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When the architect moved out,</i></font>

619
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i></font>

620
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>telling them, "This is a great housekeeper,
you should hire her."</i></font>

621
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i></font>

622
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She won't give up
a good job easily.</font>

623
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.</font>

624
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we need a plan.</font>

625
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.</font>

626
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not ask for some?</font>

627
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit.</font>

628
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So according to
what Da-hye told me,</i></font>

629
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i></font>

630
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i></font>

631
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i></font>

632
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>has trouble breathing, asthma,
a total meltdown!</i></font>

633
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.</font>

634
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I'm saying!</font>

635
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually when I get symptoms
like this,</font>

636
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I run to my room
and take my medicine,</font>

637
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.</font>

638
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?</font>

639
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's our housekeeper!</font>

640
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's true. Oh, how sad.</font>

641
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't sure
if that was really her.</font>

642
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.</font>

643
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was in the hospital?</font>

644
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few days ago I went
for my annual medical exam.</font>

645
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.</font>

646
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she talking
on the phone there?</font>

647
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway. I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop...</font>

648
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop,</font>

649
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but her words
came through clearly!</font>

650
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!</font>

651
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, your emotions are up
to here.</font>

652
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring them down to
about there.</font>

653
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so I couldn't help
but overhear.</font>

654
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it focused!</font>

655
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,</font>

656
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?</font>

657
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?</font>

658
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,</font>

659
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she was shouting
on the phone,</font>

660
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so upset she could
barely control herself!</font>

661
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuberculosis?
Come on...</font>

662
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:15,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.</font>

663
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:20,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do people still get TB?</font>

664
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad...</font>

665
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:26,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?</font>

666
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feels like a bygone era.</font>

667
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I saw it on the internet.</font>

668
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.</font>

669
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.</font>

670
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a kid like Da-song
in the house.</font>

671
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,</font>

672
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...</font>

673
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it, please!</font>

674
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad: Arriving in 3 mins</i></font>

675
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.</font>

676
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Madame</i></font>

677
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>2nd floor sauna room</i></font>

678
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Don't let her see you</i></font>

679
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have a seat.
- Yes.</font>

680
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.</font>

681
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?</font>

682
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understood.</font>

683
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:44,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he hears I brought
a TB patient to our home,</font>

684
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be hanged and quartered!</font>

685
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Madame.</font>

686
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I may presume
to say one thing.</font>

687
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no feelings
against that woman.</font>

688
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:04,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt I had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene.</font>

689
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this could be
seen as snitching or...</font>

690
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you worry.</font>

691
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't mention the TB.</font>

692
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.</font>

693
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simply and quietly.</font>

694
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a proven method.
That's the best.</font>

695
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>

696
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you... washed your hands?</font>

697
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:26,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?</font>

698
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere close by.</font>

699
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:29,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

700
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.</font>

701
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why such a craving
for braised ribs today?</font>

702
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.</font>

703
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who quit this week?</font>

704
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife wouldn't even tell me
why she quit.</font>

705
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:56,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.</font>

706
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:02,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper.</font>

707
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>

708
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She kept the house
in great shape,</font>

709
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she knew never
to cross the line.</font>

710
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't stand people
who cross the line.</font>

711
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps just one weak point?</font>

712
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eating too much.</font>

713
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always ate enough for two.</font>

714
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But considering all the work
she did...</font>

715
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:30,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.</font>

716
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in trouble now.</font>

717
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a week, our house will be
a trash can.</font>

718
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:41,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My clothes will start
to smell.</font>

719
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife has no talent for housework.</font>

720
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.</font>

721
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, you love her, right?</font>

722
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. I love her.</font>

723
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll call it love.</font>

724
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then would this help?</font>

725
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Care?
What is this?</font>

726
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just recently found out
about them.</font>

727
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:23,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.</font>

728
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:30,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.</font>

729
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:36,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself.</font>

730
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell from the card
they're high-class.</font>

731
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool design.</font>

732
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how do you know
about this company?</font>

733
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:49,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver.</font>

734
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might say they scouted me?</font>

735
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:59,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.</font>

736
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see...</font>

737
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You turned down this famous company
to work for me.</font>

738
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't forget that.</font>

739
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

740
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?</font>

741
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's why I brought it up.</font>

742
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to mention me.</font>

743
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell her
you found the company yourself.</font>

744
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

745
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you I can play
the good husband.</font>

746
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the back, there's a number
for consultations.</font>

747
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her to call there...</font>

748
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes on the road!</font>

749
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, this is
Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.</font>

750
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, this is The Care's main office?</font>

751
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's correct.</font>

752
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.</font>

753
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.</font>

754
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?</font>

755
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're not currently
a member, I assume?</font>

756
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's right. What steps do
I need to take?</i></font>

757
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.</font>

758
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready
to write this down?</font>

759
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...</font>

760
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...documents to prove
your income level,</font>

761
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I.E. the title to your property, etc.</font>

762
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our property title?
Yes.</font>

763
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, peaches!</font>

764
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have some too, Mr. Kevin.</font>

765
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

766
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it outside
the door next time.</font>

767
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And knock!
- Yes.</font>

768
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No entering during my lesson!</font>

769
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, miss!</font>

770
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Park Da-song!</i></font>

771
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>

772
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

773
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>

774
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>

775
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies!</font>

776
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies?</font>

777
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walkie talkies!</font>

778
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?</font>

779
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, how could you run out
from your lesson?</font>

780
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you buy all this?</font>

781
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:30,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no big deal.</font>

782
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

783
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

784
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

785
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing now?</font>

786
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, don't do that!</font>

787
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same!
They smell the same!</font>

788
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.</font>

789
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica smells like that, too.</font>

790
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do we all need
to use different soap, now?</font>

791
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.</font>

792
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And fabric softener.</font>

793
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time?</font>

794
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not it.</font>

795
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the semi-basement smell.</font>

796
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.</font>

797
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:26,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?</font>

798
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

799
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In an age like ours,</font>

800
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.</font>

801
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our entire family got hired!</font>

802
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, Dad!</font>

803
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we put our 4 salaries together?</font>

804
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense!</font>

805
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.</font>

806
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to Min!</font>

807
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,</font>

808
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!</font>

809
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That asshole's dead.</font>

810
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo's on the rampage!</font>

811
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't overdo it!</font>

812
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use this instead.</font>

813
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn you!</font>

814
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a fucking grip!</font>

815
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a grip!</font>

816
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

817
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a deluge!</font>

818
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:58,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.</font>

819
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But they're not rain clouds, over.</i></font>

820
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you, over.</font>

821
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:08,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Currently your sister's lip is
pouting like a duck's bill.</font>

822
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's super annoyed, over.</font>

823
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:16,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?</font>

824
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.</font>

825
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we have to go,
let's have fun.</font>

826
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye, this is no ordinary
camping trip.</font>

827
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right!</font>

828
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you miss
your brother's birthday?</font>

829
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way!</font>

830
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even your busy father is
taking time off to go.</font>

831
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!</font>

832
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?</font>

833
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The outdoor theater?</font>

834
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.</font>

835
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

836
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:46,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.</font>

837
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He loves it when it rains.</font>

838
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo.</font>

839
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie and Berry get this.</font>

840
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.</font>

841
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and for Foofoo...</font>

842
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.</font>

843
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

844
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.</font>

845
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs to run around
to feel happy.</font>

846
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's like the canine version
of Da-song!</font>

847
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>

848
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you lying down outside?</font>

849
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't he hot out there?</font>

850
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:50,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gazing at the sky
from home.</font>

851
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so great.</font>

852
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, want some water?</font>

853
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's sparkling, right?</font>

854
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung, some water?</font>

855
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telepathy... thank you.</font>

856
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

857
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, all these varieties
of alcohol.</font>

858
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:39,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Let me add another
to the mix!</font>

859
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pretty classy.</font>

860
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:48,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...</font>

861
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying?</font>

862
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?
It's Da-hye's diary.</font>

863
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her diary?</font>

864
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?</font>

865
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:09,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just so we can understand
each other deeper.</font>

866
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, are you two dating?</font>

867
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious.
She really likes me too.</font>

868
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A while back...</font>

869
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.</font>

870
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.</font>

871
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously.</font>

872
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son!</font>

873
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?</font>

874
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:42,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

875
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:47,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?</font>

876
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, washing
your daughter-in-law's socks!</font>

877
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:07,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like her.
She's a good kid.</font>

878
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's pretty,
but she's not wild.</font>

879
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:17,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now that we're daydreaming...</font>

880
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Da-hye and I marry,</font>

881
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.</font>

882
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at her.</font>

883
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year.</font>

884
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.</font>

885
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.</font>

886
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how your acting got so good!</font>

887
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:46,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acting is one thing,
but this family is so gullible, right?</font>

888
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The madame especially.</font>

889
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said it.</font>

890
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's so naive, and nice.</font>

891
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's rich, but still nice.</font>

892
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not "rich, but still nice."</font>

893
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Nice because she's rich."
You know?</font>

894
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:10,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, if I had all this money.</font>

895
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be nice too!</font>

896
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even nicer!</font>

897
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's true.
Your mom's right.</font>

898
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rich people are naive.
No resentments.</font>

899
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No creases on them.</font>

900
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.</font>

901
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those creases all get smoothed out.</font>

902
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ki-woo.</font>

903
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?</font>

904
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The driver before me.</font>

905
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Yoon.</font>

906
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:47,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be working somewhere else now,
right?</font>

907
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, he must be.</font>

908
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's young, got a nice physique.</font>

909
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must've found a better job.</font>

910
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking hell!</font>

911
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with her now?</font>

912
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:08,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?</font>

913
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! Come on, Dad!</font>

914
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just focus on us, okay?
On us!</font>

915
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!</font>

916
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome timing, huh?</font>

917
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:27,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!</font>

918
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jessica. Cheers.</font>

919
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:38,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...</font>

920
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about it?</font>

921
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to put it?
You fit in here.</font>

922
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This rich house suits you.
Not like us.</font>

923
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck off.</font>

924
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious!</font>

925
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:51,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, before...</font>

926
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.</font>

927
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like she's lived here for years.</font>

928
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:04,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which,
if this became our house,</font>

929
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we lived here,
which room would you want?</font>

930
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:14,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?</font>

931
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, I don't know.</font>

932
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:20,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.</font>

933
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We live here now, don't we?</font>

934
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting drunk in the living room.</font>

935
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we live here.
Why not?</font>

936
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our home right now.
It's cosy.</font>

937
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?</font>

938
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:42,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, but suppose Park walked
through that door now.</font>

939
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your dad?</font>

940
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd run and hide like a cockroach.</font>

941
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids, you know at our house,</font>

942
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:57,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?</font>

943
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?</font>

944
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting fucking tired of this.</font>

945
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A cockroach?
- Yeah.</font>

946
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? What's wrong?</font>

947
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter?</font>

948
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.</font>

949
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

950
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fooled you!
Didn't I?</font>

951
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Dad.</font>

952
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:32,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?</font>

953
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.</font>

954
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?
Fucking puppy.</font>

955
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is it at this hour?</font>

956
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

957
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing here?</font>

958
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old housekeeper?</font>

959
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she here for?</font>

960
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:07,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She won't stop ringing it.</font>

961
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raising a racket.</font>

962
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is it?</font>

963
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:17,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hello! I'm...</font>

964
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The madame's not in, right?</font>

965
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:20,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

966
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:25,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I worked here
for a very long time.</font>

967
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?</font>

968
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.</font>

969
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:37,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it,
but why are you here?</font>

970
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?</font>

971
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

972
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.</font>

973
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just that...</font>

974
01:03:55,165 --> 01:04:02,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot something in the basement
under the kitchen.</font>

975
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:08,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I left, they pushed me out
so quickly...</font>

976
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you let me in?</font>

977
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do?</font>

978
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't in the plan.</font>

979
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for the trouble.</font>

980
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

981
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, thank you.</font>

982
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can put your raincoat...</font>

983
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll just be a second.</font>

984
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.</font>

985
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what did you leave below?</font>

986
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want to come down with me?</font>

987
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just go ahead.</font>

988
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me push this!</font>

989
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull it! From over there.</font>

990
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

991
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull!</font>

992
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull it hard!</font>

993
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

994
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I scare you?</font>

995
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you!</font>

996
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

997
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>

998
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

999
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1000
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>

1001
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>

1002
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

1003
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I'm here!</font>

1004
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is all this?</font>

1005
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>

1006
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I'm fine.</font>

1007
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No you're not!</font>

1008
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, really.</font>

1009
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you say that?</font>

1010
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm really hungry.</font>

1011
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck it!</font>

1012
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many days has it been?</font>

1013
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must've been so hungry!</font>

1014
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1015
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a nice woman. She let me in.</font>

1016
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.</font>

1017
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was wedged under the shelf.</font>

1018
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's why.</font>

1019
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:16,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't open it
from the inside.</font>

1020
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.</font>

1021
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would be too in this situation.</font>

1022
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:27,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?</font>

1023
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know my name?</font>

1024
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:35,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.</font>

1025
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.</font>

1026
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to speak to you alone.</font>

1027
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Talking about.</i></font>

1028
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Chung-sook.</font>

1029
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.</font>

1030
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?</font>

1031
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me sis!</font>

1032
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.</font>

1033
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:07,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.</font>

1034
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This tastes great.
What happened to your face?</font>

1035
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you later.</font>

1036
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.</font>

1037
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeding your husband.</font>

1038
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:23,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all! I bought all his food
with my salary.</font>

1039
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so unfair!</font>

1040
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how long has
your husband been down here?</font>

1041
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on a sec.
4 years?</font>

1042
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 years, 3 months and 17 days.</font>

1043
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, it's June now.</font>

1044
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:44,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 years ago
when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,</font>

1045
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the time before Mr. Park's family
moved in,</font>

1046
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:51,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought my husband down here.</font>

1047
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide</font>

1048
01:08:56,215 --> 01:09:00,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.</font>

1049
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,</font>

1050
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.</font>

1051
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So only I know about it.</font>

1052
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's how it happened.</font>

1053
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:19,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now that I know, I've no choice
but to call the police!</font>

1054
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No please, sis!</font>

1055
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As fellow members of the needy,
please don't.</font>

1056
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not needy!</font>

1057
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're needy!</font>

1058
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:34,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've no house, no money,
only debts!</font>

1059
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, please!</font>

1060
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:40,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.</font>

1061
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:44,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.</font>

1062
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used loan sharks?</font>

1063
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all my fault.</font>

1064
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Taiwan cake shop.</font>

1065
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.</font>

1066
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was overwhelmed by debt.</font>

1067
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please take this.</font>

1068
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1069
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:05,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not much,
just a modest sum.</font>

1070
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we'll send it
to you every month.</font>

1071
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In return,
just once every 2 days,</font>

1072
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please leave him some food.</font>

1073
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No no, just once a week.</font>

1074
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.</font>

1075
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:23,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.</font>

1076
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis!</font>

1077
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that?</font>

1078
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait... Jessica?</font>

1079
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim?</font>

1080
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1081
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, my ankle!</font>

1082
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?
Sorry.</font>

1083
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, my foot.</font>

1084
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't call me Dad!</font>

1085
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:55,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.</font>

1086
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1087
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?</font>

1088
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you some family of charlatans?</font>

1089
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, sis...</font>

1090
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!</font>

1091
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?</font>

1092
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad, my foot.</i></font>

1093
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No reception in the basement,
right?</font>

1094
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.</font>

1095
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:21,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...</font>

1096
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:24,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!
It's too late now!</font>

1097
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!</font>

1098
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady, are you crazy?</font>

1099
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!</font>

1100
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did those nice people
ever do wrong?</font>

1101
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do this to them?</font>

1102
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop right there!</font>

1103
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I'll push the 'send' button.</font>

1104
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1105
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down, ma'am.</font>

1106
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't push!</font>

1107
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go up, honey.</font>

1108
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time for you to get some fresh air!</font>

1109
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:25,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, this 'send' button is
like a missile launcher.</font>

1110
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, honey?</font>

1111
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:33,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.</font>

1112
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!</font>

1113
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,</font>

1114
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after witnessing
the charlatan family video,</font>

1115
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was unable to contain
his shock and fury</font>

1116
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at their wicked,
despicable provocation!</font>

1117
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've missed your jokes, honey!</font>

1118
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:58,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,</font>

1119
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:04,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead</font>

1120
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!</font>

1121
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:12,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!</font>

1122
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:17,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,</font>

1123
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:22,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...</font>

1124
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands in the air, fuckers!</font>

1125
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Higher!</font>

1126
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You scumbag family.</font>

1127
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Husband?</font>

1128
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Husband.</font>

1129
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:32,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wife?</font>

1130
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:33,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1131
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Son?
- Yes.</font>

1132
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Daughter?
- Daughter.</font>

1133
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You neanderthals.</font>

1134
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?</font>

1135
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:48,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this home suffused
with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?</font>

1136
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cretins!</font>

1137
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know about art?</font>

1138
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would they know?</font>

1139
01:13:54,347 --> 01:14:01,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?</font>

1140
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.</font>

1141
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it to me!</font>

1142
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job!
Delete it!</font>

1143
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, don't send it by accident.</font>

1144
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1145
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, do you know
how to make ram-don?</font>

1146
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ram-don?</font>

1147
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:50,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.</font>

1148
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.</font>

1149
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.</i></font>

1150
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, the camping...?</font>

1151
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My god, what a disaster.</i></font>

1152
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:08,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,</font>

1153
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Da-song was crying
and refusing to go home.</font>

1154
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:15,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anyway, ram-don as soon
as we walk in, okay?</i></font>

1155
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you're almost here?</font>

1156
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8 minutes, according to the GPS.</font>

1157
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You arrive in 8 minutes...</font>

1158
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Start boiling
the water right away!</i></font>

1159
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is ram-don?</font>

1160
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, quickly!</font>

1161
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font>

1162
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ramen / Udon</i></font>

1163
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, I can't drag her any further!</font>

1164
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1165
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1166
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.</font>

1167
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this!</font>

1168
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome home!</font>

1169
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!</font>

1170
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-song!</i></font>

1171
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-song!</i></font>

1172
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madame!</font>

1173
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:30,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you
just eat the ram-don?</font>

1174
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall I?</font>

1175
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wait. I can give it
to my husband.</font>

1176
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's sirloin in here.</font>

1177
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cooked through?
Medium well done.</font>

1178
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:13,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i></font>

1179
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:20,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.</i></font>

1180
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i></font>

1181
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Shut up!</font>

1182
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, do you want some ram-don?</font>

1183
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song doesn't want it?</font>

1184
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1185
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.</font>

1186
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you staring?</font>

1187
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:54,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.</font>

1188
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Respect!</i></font>

1189
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do this every day?</font>

1190
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:05,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, I even send whole sentences
to thank him.</font>

1191
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone of your age should know it.</font>

1192
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:09,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know what?</font>

1193
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morse Code.</font>

1194
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:15,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sensor's going batty.</font>

1195
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.</font>

1196
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ridiculous, right?</font>

1197
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Running around,
trying to please a kid.</font>

1198
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not some kind of prince.</font>

1199
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the youngest. It's common.</font>

1200
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please understand.</font>

1201
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song is a bit... unwell.</font>

1202
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.</font>

1203
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was an incident.</font>

1204
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What incident?</font>

1205
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:55,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?</font>

1206
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.</font>

1207
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a birthday party
at home that day.</font>

1208
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,</font>

1209
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:17,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.</font>

1210
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.</font>

1211
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even in bed, he couldn't stop
thinking about it.</font>

1212
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:29,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...</font>

1213
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,</font>

1214
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he was all...</font>

1215
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:50,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.</font>

1216
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever seen
a child have a seizure?</font>

1217
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1218
01:21:55,829 --> 01:22:00,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.</font>

1219
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:05,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.</font>

1220
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:12,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you live
in a place like this?</font>

1221
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:15,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, lots of people
live underground.</font>

1222
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially if you count
semi-basements.</font>

1223
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:21,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?</font>

1224
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel comfortable here.</font>

1225
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels like I was born here.</font>

1226
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I had my wedding here, too.</font>

1227
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.</font>

1228
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my old age,
love will comfort me.</font>

1229
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So please.
Let me live down here.</font>

1230
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway...</font>

1231
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:57,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.</font>

1232
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:02,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.</font>

1233
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.</font>

1234
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's dad says it's just
a part of growing up.</font>

1235
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:15,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say a ghost
in the house brings wealth.</font>

1236
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, the money's been
good recently.</font>

1237
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank god.</font>

1238
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay here for now.</font>

1239
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoonie, what's wrong?</font>

1240
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something under there?</font>

1241
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1242
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

1243
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom!
- Yeah?</font>

1244
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How could you?
- What?</font>

1245
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:51,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?</font>

1246
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1247
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:56,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,
then ate it yourself.</font>

1248
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want her to make one?</font>

1249
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the point!</font>

1250
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?</font>

1251
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed.</font>

1252
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way!</font>

1253
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Ki-jung?</font>

1254
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under there! Hurry!</font>

1255
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:22,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3!</font>

1256
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song?</font>

1257
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, cut it out!</font>

1258
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.</font>

1259
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Park Da-song!</font>

1260
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:37,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?</font>

1261
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:42,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?</font>

1262
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

1263
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, here.</font>

1264
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:55,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you take after to be so stubborn!
Look at this rain!</font>

1265
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>OMG Kevin. Da-song camping
in the yard.</i></font>

1266
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:12,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.</font>

1267
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have it.
I can't believe him.</font>

1268
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.</font>

1269
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.</i></font>

1270
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Da-hye!</font>

1271
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.</font>

1272
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.</font>

1273
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the living room,
do you copy?</font>

1274
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Copy, over.</i></font>

1275
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:37,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.</font>

1276
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got it, over.</i></font>

1277
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that tent going to leak?</font>

1278
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.</font>

1279
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should we sleep here?
- What?</font>

1280
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got a full view of the tent.</font>

1281
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good idea.
I'll feel much better.</font>

1282
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:54,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1283
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's watch over him as we sleep.</font>

1284
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a kid...</font>

1285
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

1286
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that smell coming from?</font>

1287
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What smell?</font>

1288
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim's smell.</font>

1289
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.</font>

1290
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not sure what you mean.</font>

1291
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
You must have smelled it.</font>

1292
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:30,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That smell that wafts through the car,
how to describe it?</font>

1293
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.</font>

1294
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1295
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like an old radish?</font>

1296
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1297
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know when you boil a rag?</font>

1298
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It smells like that.</font>

1299
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:52,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, even though he always seems
about to cross the line,</font>

1300
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he never does cross it.
That's good.</font>

1301
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.</font>

1302
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that smell crosses the line.</font>

1303
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It powers through right
into the back seat.</font>

1304
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How bad can it be?</font>

1305
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1306
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hard to describe.</font>

1307
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.</font>

1308
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:18,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been ages
since I rode a subway.</font>

1309
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People who ride the subway
have a special smell.</font>

1310
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1311
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't this like the car's back seat?</font>

1312
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:46,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if Da-song comes back in?</font>

1313
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry!</font>

1314
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can just pull my hand back.</font>

1315
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't...</font>

1316
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:06,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it clockwise.</font>

1317
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1318
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know where.</font>

1319
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have those cheap panties?</font>

1320
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:36,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1321
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.</font>

1322
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.</font>

1323
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1324
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then buy me drugs.</font>

1325
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy me drugs!</font>

1326
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat this instead.</font>

1327
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like it?</font>

1328
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.</i></font>

1329
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:09,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Emergency! Emergency, over!</i></font>

1330
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:12,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Emergency!</i>
- What?</font>

1331
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, over!</font>

1332
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, what's wrong?</font>

1333
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I can't sleep, over.</i></font>

1334
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:23,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So stop it and come in, okay?</font>

1335
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:26,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go sleep in your soft bed, over.</font>

1336
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:27,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right!</font>

1337
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:29,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't want to, over.</i></font>

1338
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Park Da-song.</font>

1339
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just sleep...</font>

1340
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did it turn out back there?</font>

1341
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:19,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1342
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The people in the basement.</font>

1343
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:31,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I tied them up.</font>

1344
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will we do now?</font>

1345
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1346
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:41,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do now,
what's our plan?</font>

1347
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been wondering...</font>

1348
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would Min do
in this situation?</font>

1349
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Min wouldn't be
in this situation!</font>

1350
01:33:55,505 --> 01:34:01,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?</font>

1351
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:07,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?</font>

1352
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So nothing happened.
You understand?</font>

1353
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:16,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got my own plan.</font>

1354
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:19,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you two just forget
about it, okay?</font>

1355
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go home.</font>

1356
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go take a bath.</font>

1357
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing there?
Hurry up!</font>

1358
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1359
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stay there.
This is all sewage water.</font>

1360
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was our window open?</font>

1361
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me out, Ki-taek!</font>

1362
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo!</font>

1363
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:32,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Ki-woo, close the window!</font>

1364
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:35,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got shocked?</font>

1365
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dizzy.</font>

1366
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on a sec.
Wait.</font>

1367
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I'm dizzy.</font>

1368
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung, be careful.</font>

1369
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything.</font>

1370
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:26,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I've got a concussion.</font>

1371
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see you.</font>

1372
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:55,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, that woman Chung-sook...</font>

1373
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

1374
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a nice person.</font>

1375
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She kicked me down the stairs.</font>

1376
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat after me.</font>

1377
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook...</font>

1378
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook...</font>

1379
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ki-woo!</font>

1380
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing there?</font>

1381
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:33,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1382
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:52,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Help... M...</i></font>

1383
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:58,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

1384
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:00,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

1385
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:05,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was your plan?</font>

1386
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1387
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:12,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before, you said you had a plan.</font>

1388
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will you do?
About...</font>

1389
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:17,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the basement.</font>

1390
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:23,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?</font>

1391
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No plan at all.</font>

1392
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:29,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No plan.</i></font>

1393
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why?</font>

1394
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:40,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.</font>

1395
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around us.</font>

1396
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:48,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"</font>

1397
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:51,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But look now.</font>

1398
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:55,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's sleeping on the floor,
us included.</font>

1399
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:00,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why people shouldn't make plans.</font>

1400
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:06,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.</font>

1401
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:12,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if something spins out of control,
it doesn't matter.</font>

1402
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country.</font>

1403
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:22,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of it fucking matters.
Got it?</font>

1404
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

1405
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:29,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1406
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

1407
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>

1408
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:38,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it.</font>

1409
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of everything.</font>

1410
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1411
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you hugging that stone?</font>

1412
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?</font>

1413
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:01,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps clinging to me.</font>

1414
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:07,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you need some sleep.</font>

1415
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious.</font>

1416
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps following me.</font>

1417
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Jessica! Sorry to call
on Sunday morning.</font>

1418
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:34,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you free for lunch today?</font>

1419
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:38,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're having a birthday impromptu
for Da-song.</i></font>

1420
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:41,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A birthday party?</font>

1421
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:44,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.</font>

1422
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:48,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.</font>

1423
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:51,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Please come by 1 pm,</i></font>

1424
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:54,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll count today
as one of your lessons.</font>

1425
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:57,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?
See you soon!</font>

1426
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom.
- Yeah?</font>

1427
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:03,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?</font>

1428
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:06,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?</font>

1429
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:10,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.</font>

1430
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:14,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?</font>

1431
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:18,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...</font>

1432
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:22,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.</font>

1433
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pay him overtime.</font>

1434
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect</font>

1435
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:39,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone sit down,
I'll explain!</font>

1436
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:43,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Da-hye: We're having a party,</i></font>

1437
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and mom said to invite you!</i></font>

1438
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:50,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sis, in the basement...</i></font>

1439
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have 10 outdoor tables.</font>

1440
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:57,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First take them all out,
then arrange them...</font>

1441
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:01,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, come to the window.
I need to show you.</font>

1442
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With Da-song's tent
in the middle,</font>

1443
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:08,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">curve the tables outward...</font>

1444
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A crane's wing formation!</font>

1445
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:14,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!</font>

1446
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the tent
as the Japanese warship.</font>

1447
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:22,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our tables will make
a semicircular crane's wing formation.</font>

1448
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then near the tent will be
the barbeque grill, firewood and such.</font>

1449
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:28,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arrange them all there!</font>

1450
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:32,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh sure, bring your husband too!</font>

1451
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1452
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:37,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents,
just come!</font>

1453
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:38,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1454
01:43:38,087 --> 01:43:40,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What dress code?</font>

1455
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:43,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!</font>

1456
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:50,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!</font>

1457
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know my culinary skills!</font>

1458
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:58,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right! We'll get drunk
in the daytime.</font>

1459
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1460
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:03,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...</font>

1461
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet, he's sleeping!</font>

1462
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!</font>

1463
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:28,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to all the rain yesterday.</font>

1464
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1465
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:34,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we traded camping
for a garden party.</font>

1466
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lemons into lemonade.</font>

1467
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:45,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, that rain was such
a blessing!</font>

1468
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:51,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And definitely no presents,
I mean it!</font>

1469
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:56,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, just squeeze
your Mini Cooper into the garage.</font>

1470
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:57,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on up!</font>

1471
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:03,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!</font>

1472
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:07,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here!
It's been so long!</font>

1473
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you no presents!</font>

1474
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were thinking of something else.</font>

1475
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:33,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1476
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While kissing me,
you thought of something else.</font>

1477
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1478
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:45,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.</font>

1479
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1480
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:53,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone looks gorgeous, right?</font>

1481
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:58,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.</font>

1482
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look so natural.</font>

1483
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-hye.</font>

1484
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I fit in here?</font>

1485
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1486
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:16,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this setting, do I fit in?</font>

1487
01:46:26,422 --> 01:46:28,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are you going?</font>

1488
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to go down.</font>

1489
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay with me.</font>

1490
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:35,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to go down there.</font>

1491
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?</font>

1492
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:46,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to those people, down lower.</font>

1493
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:49,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, what is that?</font>

1494
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.</font>

1495
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so embarrassing.</font>

1496
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>

1497
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:04,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped.</font>

1498
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the concept is simple.</font>

1499
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:11,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'll be a parade with Jessica
carrying a birthday cake.</font>

1500
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:15,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we jump out and attack Jessica.</font>

1501
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swinging our tomahawks!</font>

1502
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:19,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1503
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:24,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.</font>

1504
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:29,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally he'll save Jessica the cake princess,
and they'll all cheer.</font>

1505
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:31,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something like that.</font>

1506
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:33,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly, isn't it?</font>

1507
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:38,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess your wife likes events
and surprises.</font>

1508
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:39,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, she does.</font>

1509
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's particularly
into this party.</font>

1510
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying your best, too.</font>

1511
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:51,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you love her, after all.</font>

1512
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:58,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim.</font>

1513
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:02,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting paid extra.</font>

1514
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:12,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of this as part of your work,
okay?</font>

1515
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:25,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you go down below?</font>

1516
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:29,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?</font>

1517
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:30,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reach an understanding?</font>

1518
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly!</font>

1519
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all got too fucking worked up
last night.</font>

1520
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:38,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad was going on about some plan...</font>

1521
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.</font>

1522
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:44,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this down to them.</font>

1523
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:45,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They must be hungry.
- Right.</font>

1524
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let them eat first.</font>

1525
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:50,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come next time for sure!</font>

1526
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:54,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you are, Jessica.</font>

1527
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?</font>

1528
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a special favor to ask.</font>

1529
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:00,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1530
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is... how to describe it?</font>

1531
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song's trauma recovery cake?</font>

1532
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!</font>

1533
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:34,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, are you okay?</font>

1534
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you...?</font>

1535
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:52,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, mister!</font>

1536
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:42,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin? Kevin!</font>

1537
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:51,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song, happy birthday!</font>

1538
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:53,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations!</font>

1539
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:01,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit...</font>

1540
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:13,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stop!</i></font>

1541
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chung-sook!</font>

1542
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:16,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ki-jung!</font>

1543
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out here, Chung-sook!</font>

1544
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:21,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the blood! Push down
on the wound!</font>

1545
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:27,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Da-song!</font>

1546
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:29,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey!</font>

1547
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:33,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go, don't!</font>

1548
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurts.</font>

1549
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The emergency room!</font>

1550
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the car!</font>

1551
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?</font>

1552
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:57,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't wait for an ambulance!</font>

1553
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop pushing, Dad!</font>

1554
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:02,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes it hurt more.</font>

1555
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Car keys!
The car keys!</font>

1556
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:06,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw them!
Throw me the keys!</font>

1557
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1558
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch it!</font>

1559
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Mr. Park.</font>

1560
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me?</font>

1561
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:35,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect!</font>

1562
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:06,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Opening my eyes for the first time
in a month,</i></font>

1563
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:07,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I saw a detective.</i></font>

1564
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:12,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the right to
an attorney...</font>

1565
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who looked nothing like
a detective.</i></font>

1566
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:21,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he laughing?</font>

1567
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a sec.</font>

1568
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:28,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i></font>

1569
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:33,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.</font>

1570
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:35,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They keep laughing.
For no reason.</font>

1571
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear me?</font>

1572
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you hear me?</font>

1573
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then do I have to do it again?</font>

1574
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:43,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>

1575
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Miranda thing.</font>

1576
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:51,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the right to remain silent.</font>

1577
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:54,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything you say can and
will be used against you...</font>

1578
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:56,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He keeps laughing, look!</font>

1579
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:05,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even when I heard

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper-class home</font>

1588
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,183

1589
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:59,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,</font>

1590
01:57:59,864 --> 01:58:05,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive.</font>

1591
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:09,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.</font>

1592
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:15,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.</font>

1593
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:19,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,</font>

1594
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:22,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disappeared into the neighboring alleys.</font>

1595
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:28,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,</font>

1596
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:32,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they have yet
to find any witnesses.</font>

1597
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:35,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Given the situation,</font>

1598
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:40,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not an exaggeration to say that
Kim vanished into thin air.</font>

1599
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:48,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Actually Mom and I had no idea
where Dad was.</i></font>

1600
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:56,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us.</i></font>

1601
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:04,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Eventually the news went quiet,</i></font>

1602
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and after the tails stopped,</i></font>

1603
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:10,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I started going up that mountain.</i></font>

1604
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:16,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>From up there,
you get a great view of the house.</i></font>

1605
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:23,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That day, despite the cold,</i></font>

1606
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:27,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I felt like staying longer.</i></font>

1607
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:43,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dash-dash-dot-dot</font>

1608
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>

1609
02:00:12,414 --> 02:00:13,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Son!</i></font>

1610
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:19,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter.</i></font>

1611
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:25,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You were a Boy Scout,</i></font>

1612
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:29,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>so I'm writing this just
in case.</i></font>

1613
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Have your injuries healed?</i></font>

1614
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:40,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.</i></font>

1615
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm doing fine in here.</i></font>

1616
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:51,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Though thinking of
Ki-jung makes me cry.</i></font>

1617
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:58,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Even now, what happened that day
doesn't seem real.</i></font>

1618
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:02,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It feels like a dream,</i></font>

1619
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and yet it doesn't.</i></font>

1620
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:11,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i></font>

1621
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where I needed to go...</i></font>

1622
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A house where such
a grisly crime took place</i></font>

1623
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:59,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>would surely not be easy
to sell.</i></font>

1624
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:05,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mr. Park.</font>

1625
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:12,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house.</i></font>

1626
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:17,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Still, thanks to the house
being empty,</i></font>

1627
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:22,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i></font>

1628
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:26,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i></font>

1629
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:34,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best.</i></font>

1630
02:02:38,476 --> 02:02:42,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But those real estate
sharks sure are clever.</i></font>

1631
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:51,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i></font>

1632
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and managed to sell the house.</i></font>

1633
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:57,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i></font>

1634
02:02:57,954 --> 02:03:00,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the family is usually out.</i></font>

1635
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:05,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i></font>

1636
02:03:06,296 --> 02:03:10,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i></font>

1637
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:17,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It turns out Germans eat
more than just sausage and beer.</i></font>

1638
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:20,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What a relief.</i></font>

1639
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:27,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i></font>

1640
02:03:31,863 --> 02:03:35,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Today at least I was able
to write you a letter.</i></font>

1641
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:41,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i></font>

1642
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i></font>

1643
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:53,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So long.</i></font>

1644
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're home, Ki-woo?</font>

1645
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:10,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1646
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:29,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i></font>

1647
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A fundamental plan.</i></font>

1648
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:37,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm going to earn money.</i></font>

1649
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:40,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A lot of it.</i></font>

1650
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:47,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,</i></font>

1651
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but first I'll earn money.</i></font>

1652
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:55,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.</font>

1653
02:04:56,447 --> 02:05:00,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, we don't show this house
to just anyone.</font>

1654
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:05,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i></font>

1655
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:10,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i></font>

1656
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:13,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Because the sunshine is
so nice there.</i></font>

1657
02:05:15,133 --> 02:05:16,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All you'll need to do</i></font>

1658
02:05:17,385 --> 02:05:19,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>is walk up the stairs.</i></font>

1659
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:46,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Take care until then.</i></font>

1660
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:53,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So long.</i></font>
