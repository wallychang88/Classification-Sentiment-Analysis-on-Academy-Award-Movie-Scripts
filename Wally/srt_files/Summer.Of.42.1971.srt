1
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,050
When i was 15

2
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,220
And my family came
to the island for the summer,

3
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,223
There weren't nearly
as many houses or people

4
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,808
As there are now.

5
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,311
The geography of the island

6
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,313
And the singularity
of the sea

7
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,692
Were far more noticeable then.

8
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,737
If a guy wasn't
to die of loneliness,

9
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,739
His family made certain

10
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,159
That other families
from his neighborhood

11
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,787
Contributed other kids
to the island.

12
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,047
Look out, hermie!

13
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:35,965
Is he playing?

14
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:36,841
Look out.

15
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,679
Present with me
in the summer of '42 were

16
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,974
Oscy, my best friend,

17
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,101
And benjie,

18
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,437
My next-To-Best friend.

19
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,356
We called ourselves

20
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,400
The terrible trio.

21
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,875
And that house up there...

22
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,211
That was her house.

23
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,131
Nothing from that first day
i saw her

24
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
And no one that has
happened to me since

25
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,179
Has ever been as frightening

26
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,806
And as confusing.

27
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,435
For no person
i've ever known

28
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,729
Has ever done more

29
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,940
To make me feel more sure,

30
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,650
More insecure...

31
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,777
More important...

32
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,030
And less significant.

33
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,327
He's going to
take her

34
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
Right into
that bedroom.

35
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,414
Better put the
wood down first.

36
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,124
Ahh...
funny.

37
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,376
Hey, come on!

38
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,711
Oscy, for
christ's sakes!

39
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:58,923
Hey, come on,
hermie!

40
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,967
Will you move
your ass?

41
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,193
Give it back,
oscy!

42
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,513
Ha ha ha!

43
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,482
Oh, no!

44
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,279
Ha ha ha!

45
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,246
Boy, i'd like
to feel

46
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,040
Every one
of those girls.

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,833
You know...

48
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,418
I should have
tripped on them.

49
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,295
They'd never know
i was getting a feel.

50
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,214
That's not
how to do it.

51
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,924
So, what's the way
to do it?

52
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,344
You have to
say things.

53
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,888
Alright. I'll say,
"excuse me."

54
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,140
You know
what i mean.

55
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,768
You can't just fall
on a girl.

56
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,102
It isn't done.

57
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,145
Why not?

58
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,064
I did it with
gladys potter.

59
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,942
She was only 12.
What did she know?

60
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,027
I don't know.

61
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,571
Didn't seem
to mind, though.

62
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,573
Well, she
was surprised.

63
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,368
So was i.
Nothing to feel.

64
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,286
Hey, come on,
benjie.

65
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,829
Stop dragging.

66
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,917
I don't know what's
going to become of him.

67
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,503
He has
no emotions.

68
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,840
Aw,
he's just confused.

69
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,634
Yeah.

70
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,678
Yeah, so am i.

71
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,139
I've been waking up
lately

72
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,641
In the middle of the night.

73
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,351
A lot.

74
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,354
Yeah,
that's ok.

75
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,064
I do, too.

76
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,607
You do?

77
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:22,983
Yeah.

78
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,318
Yeah, but...

79
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,029
I wake up
feeling crazy

80
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,698
And thinking
about vera miller.

81
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,201
So what?

82
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,453
So i hate
vera miller.

83
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,830
Jesus!

84
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,040
You think
i'm in love with her?

85
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,668
Gee,
i don't know.

86
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,297
God, i hope
i'm not in love with her.

87
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,799
I hate her.

88
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,218
Well, what kind
of thoughts

89
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,678
Do you have
about her?

90
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,139
I forget.

91
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,766
Then how can
i help you?

92
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,227
Who the hell's
asking for help?

93
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,895
What are you
talking about?

94
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,981
Nothing you'd
understand.

95
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,649
Ah, screw you!

96
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,902
That's your
whole problem, benjie.

97
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,238
You're only interested
in screwing me.

98
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,240
Try screwing
a girl.

99
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,950
Ok!

100
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,618
"Ok," he says.

101
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,414
You wouldn't know
the first thing to do.

102
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,082
Would so!

103
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,293
Ok, what's the first
thing you do?

104
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,086
You feel them!

105
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,088
Wrong!
You kiss them.

106
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,632
We didn't kiss
gladys potter!

107
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,135
We weren't in love
with gladys potter.

108
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,511
You're in love,
with a girl

109
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,305
You should
kiss a girl first.

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,473
Ain't that right
hermie?

111
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,057
It's polite.

112
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,059
It's not required.

113
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,437
It's required,
you ninny.

114
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,189
It is not.

115
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,149
How do you know?

116
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,359
Because i found
a book.

117
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,292
If my mother knew
i took that book

118
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,835
It doesn't belong
to me.

119
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,378
It doesn't belong
to my mother.

120
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,130
It belongs
to the house.

121
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,677
If you get fingerprints
on those pages,

122
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,262
It's your funeral.

123
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,017
My mother's gonna
miss that book.

124
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,227
It's the biggest
on the shelf.

125
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,020
Books fell
as i pulled it out.

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,063
Hold it.

127
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,147
Hurry up!

128
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,525
Kill me, i don't
read as fast as you.

129
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,571
Ok, turn.

130
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,412
Jesus! Do you believe
this stuff?

131
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,122
Yeah. It's
a medical journal.

132
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,457
Why should they lie?

133
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,918
How do they take
pictures like that?

134
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,546
They must have
special cameras.

135
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,548
What drugstores
would develop them?

136
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,593
If we took them in,
we'd be in reform school.

137
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,221
I guess they developed
them themselves.

138
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,724
Yeah.
I guess that's it.

139
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,560
Let me look.

140
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,811
You'll foam
at the mouth.

141
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,187
It's my book!

142
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,564
Let him look.

143
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,571
There!
They're doing it!

144
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
I don't
believe it!

145
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,948
You'd better.

146
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,616
One day
your turn's gonna come.

147
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,493
And you better
know what to do.

148
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,954
My parents
never did that!

149
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,080
Never!

150
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,665
Why not?

151
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,250
Because
it's stupid.

152
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,543
Hate to break
the news,

153
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,836
But that's
how it's done.

154
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,462
Stop pushing me
around.

155
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,673
It could be
dangerous.

156
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,509
It looks dumb
in the pictures,

157
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,969
But when you're
in love,

158
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,721
It should be
very pleasant.

159
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,932
How do you know?
You've never done it.

160
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,892
It's here
in the book!

161
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,936
In black
and white!

162
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,938
That's why
people kiss first--

163
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,898
They get to know
each other.

164
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,942
Then they're
in love.

165
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,110
Then they make--

166
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,362
Foreplay!
It's called foreplay.

167
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,407
Everyone gets undressed,
and they play foreplay.

168
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,034
He does this,

169
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,077
She does this,
and he does this,

170
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,413
And before you know it,
they're screwing!

171
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,041
What could be
simpler than that?

172
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,668
Listen. Before i saw
these pictures,

173
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,420
I didn't think
it was possible,

174
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,006
But these are pictures,
benjie, pictures!

175
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,425
These aren't drawings.
I've seen them.

176
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,469
These are pictures!

177
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,610
In emergency,
it could mount, oh...

178
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,363
.350-Caliber jobs,

179
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,907
Probably handle about...

180
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,326
A dozen or so
depth charges.

181
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,079
Ah, it'd sink
if it hit a fish.

182
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,581
Stripped down,
it could do 30, 40 knots.

183
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,042
Yeah,
30 or 40 knots!

184
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,211
30 or 40 knots!
Straight down!

185
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,504
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
Yeah, yeah.

187
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,415
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8,

188
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,585

190
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,801
26, 27.

191
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,220
1, 2, 3, 4,

192
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,013
5, 6, 7, 8,

193
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,598
9, 1 0, 11, 12...

194
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,643
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª

195
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,646
...18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23,

196
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,649
24, 25, 26, 27,

197
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,068
28, 29, 30...

198
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,781
...35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40...

199
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,371
44, 45, 46, 47...

200
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,290
...51, 52, 53...

201
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,307
I wish somebody

202
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,310
Would invade
this dopey island!

203
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,564
I'm going mad!

204
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,692
Mad.

205
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:04,945
Hey.

206
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,698
Hey, oscy,
it's that lady again.

207
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,795
Aw, hermie, you're
not going to go

208
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,840
Into another deathlike
trance again, are you?

209
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,302
I swear, hermie.
What's come over you?

210
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,262
That's a very old
person over there.

211
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,473
I don't see
the attraction.

212
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,475
Maybe it's
her mind.

213
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,562
Maybe their minds
meet and say hello.

214
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,607
Why don't you go
say hello to her mind?

215
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,150
Go on, go say hello.

216
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,443
Cut it out.

217
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,653
If she's the love
of you're life,

218
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,657
Go say hello.
We want to see you.

219
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,202
Maybe you're a hotshot lover
we don't know about.

220
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,746
Cut it out.

221
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,331
Knock it off!

222
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,458
Go say hello
to her.

223
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,709
Come on,
go say hello!

224
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah!
Go say hello!

225
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,962
We want to
see you.

226
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,341
Go say hello
to her!

227
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,397
Hey, lady
in the pink suit!

228
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,607
It's hermie
the rape artist!

229
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,567
It's jack
the ripper!

230
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,236
It's herman
the german!

231
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,489
Nazi spy!
It's a sex fiend!

232
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,950
It's hermie
the rape artist!

233
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,288
Come on.

234
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,304
Uhh!

235
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,431
Ah!

236
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:39,891
God damn!

237
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,103
Oscy, i'll...

238
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,609
Hey, come on,
herm-Herm-

239
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,112
Hermie!
Come on.

240
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,697
We were
only kidding!

241
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,242
It was a joke!

242
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,747
Look out, oscy!
Look out!

243
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,389
Knock it off,
hermie!

244
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,100
Knock it off!

245
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,477
Cut it out!

246
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,063
I'm going to
let you go.

247
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,941
I'm going to
let you go.

248
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,698
Ok.

249
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,492
Ah!

250
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,951
God damn it,
hermie!

251
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,913
You're really crazy!
You know that?

252
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,997
Crazy!

253
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,166
Jesus!

254
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,796
That's enough,
god damn it!

255
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,925
Son of a bitch!

256
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,760
Oh, jesus.

257
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,018
Jesus, oscy!
You killed him.

258
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,937
Aah!
Shit!

259
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,231
Hey, leave him
alone, benjie.

260
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,190
Leave him alone!

261
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,108
Aah!

262
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,609
Leave him a--

263
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,031
The son of a
bitch threw sand

264
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,491
In my face.

265
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,284
Oh, god damn it!
I mean...

266
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,328
We'll see you later,
hermie.

267
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,456
Bastards.

268
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,882
Hermie,
where are you going?

269
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,509
The planet mongo.

270
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,261
It's not even 8:00.

271
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,429
I can't do anything
about that!

272
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,306
What did you eat?

273
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,391
An elephant.

274
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,434
Bring me back
a newspaper.

275
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,769
Ok!

276
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,605
And time magazine
for your father.

277
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,357
Jesus.

278
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,213
Ow!

279
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,715
Oh!

280
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,985
May i offer
some assistance?

281
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,072
Oh, yes, you may.

282
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,741
I really didn't expect
to buy so much.

283
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,826
I should have
brought my wagon.

284
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,830
Yeah, you should have
brought your wagon.

285
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,415
Yes.

286
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,003
What you really need
is a wagon.

287
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,672
I think you're right.

288
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,090
I can take one.

289
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,217
No, it's ok.

290
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,970
If we both take some,
we can manage.

291
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,222
I'll happily pay you.

292
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,640
I wouldn't
think of it.

293
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,642
My house
is pretty far.

294
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,935
I know where it is.

295
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,978
You do?

296
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,313
Yeah. It's that way.

297
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,277
Are you sure it's ok?

298
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,112
Yeah, it's ok.

299
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,114
Won't you let me
take one?

300
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,199
No. Oh, no.

301
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,159
Do you live
on the island?

302
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,744
In the summer.

303
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,746
With your family?

304
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,166
Yeah. But they
don't bother me.

305
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,210
I pretty much
go my own way.

306
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,392
Aren't they pretty?

307
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,810
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

308
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,895
I couldn't resist.

309
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,867
I got a 12-Page
letter today.

310
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,869
Oh? That's nice.

311
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,537
It sure is.

312
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,612
Hey, hermie!

313
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,322
Somebody called you.

314
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,366
Not me.

315
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,284
Is your name hermie?

316
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,660
Yeah.

317
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,996
Well, somebody
back there called you.

318
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,040
No, not me.

319
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,042
Well, he called
hermie.

320
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,420
Well, hermie's
a pretty common name.

321
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,588
Oh.

322
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,817
This is it.

323
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,819
I can go further.

324
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,154
Oh, there's
really no need.

325
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,531
Ok.

326
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,450
Oh, can you
bring them in?

327
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,993
Sure.

328
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,083
Hold on.

329
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,546
Got it.

330
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,507
In there,
in the kitchen.

331
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,550
Ok.

332
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,593
Put them
on the table.

333
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,012
Whoops.

334
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,434
They should
make these bags stronger.

335
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,810
I think
you're right.

336
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,937
Please let me
give you some money.

337
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,897
I wouldn't
think of it.

338
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,358
How can i repay you?

339
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,235
It's ok, really.

340
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,363
I'm going to
have coffee.

341
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,031
Would you like some?

342
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,076
Sure.

343
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,995
Great. Sit down.

344
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,131
Ooh, these are
marvelous doughnuts.

345
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,716
Help yourself.

346
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,511
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

347
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,349
You drink coffee,
don't you?

348
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,727
I consume a couple
of cups a day.

349
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,980
Well, i have milk.

350
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,065
Oh, no.
I take it black.

351
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,028
Are you
in high school?

352
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,571
I'm a sophomore.

353
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,490
I thought you
were older.

354
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,535
Next year i'll be
a junior, and so on.

355
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,496
Don't be in a hurry.

356
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,081
You may end up
in the army.

357
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,791
I'm prepared to go.

358
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,127
I'm taking
preflight courses

359
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,545
In high school.

360
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,422
I guess
i'll get my wings.

361
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,633
Maybe i can team up
with my brother.

362
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,843
He's a paratrooper.

363
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,931
Maybe i can
drop him out.

364
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,351
So your brother's
a paratrooper.

365
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,062
Yeah.

366
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,523
Mostly i have
a sister in high school.

367
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,528
Coffee's ready.

368
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:14,739
I hope it's alright.

369
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,199
It's from this morning.

370
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,118
It looks fine.

371
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,041
I have a little bit
of sugar.

372
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,501
Would you like some?

373
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,003
Oh, no, thanks.
I'll take it black.

374
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,184
I forgot to tell you,
it's awfully hot.

375
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,103
Are you alright?
Have some milk.

376
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,772
Could i have ice water?

377
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,153
I'll put ice
in your coffee.

378
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,280
You could have
ice coffee.

379
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,406
Sure. Great.

380
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,532
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,536
Are you alright?

382
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,954
It's ok.

383
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,455
I'm really sorry.

384
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,295
Do you have many friends
on the island?

385
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,297
Yeah, two.

386
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,176
But they're...immature.
You know.

387
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,929
What do you do
to keep yourself busy?

388
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,974
Well, i lean
toward basketball,

389
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,019
But there's a lot
to be said for baseball.

390
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,689
In baseball you don't
get round-Shouldered

391
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,982
From dribbling.

392
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,402
No, that's true.

393
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,030
Mmm.

394
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,369
Do you like music?

395
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,830
Yeah. Yeah,
i'm quite musical.

396
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,249
Oh, do you
play an instrument?

397
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,460
Yeah. I sing.

398
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,130
I think a voice
is like an instrument.

399
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,507
I do, too.

400
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,927
And then for a change,
you can always whistle.

401
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,056
I can see that.

402
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,182
Mmm.

403
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,435
You'll like those.

404
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,603
They're good.

405
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,938
I think i'll be going.

406
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,899
Do you have to go?

407
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,525
Yes. I really think
i should.

408
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,902
Oh, wait.

409
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,279
Take the rest
of the doughnuts.

410
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,281
It's the least
i can do.

411
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,491
Thank you.

412
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,159
No, i thank you.

413
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,745
You're welcome.
It was a privilege.

414
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,622
Next time,
i'll take my wagon.

415
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,248
Yeah, i think
you should.

416
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,917
You could get
a hernia.

417
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,212
Good-Bye, hermie,
and thanks again.

418
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,923
Good-Bye.
You're welcome.

419
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,635
Perhaps i'll
see you again sometime.

420
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,387
It would be
a privilege.

421
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,098
Good-Bye.

422
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:46,599
Bye.

423
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,979
Hernia! Jesus!

424
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,748
Hermie!

425
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,833
Hey!

426
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,210
Hey, hermie!

427
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,295
Wait a minute!

428
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,133
Hermie, hold on.

429
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,430
Hi.

430
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,223
You were in there
a long time.

431
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,684
Could have been
out in 10 seconds.

432
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,685
What happened?

433
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,811
We had drinks.

434
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,229
You're kidding!
He had drinks.

435
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,272
Big deal.

436
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,606
She let you
get funny?

437
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,191
Oh, you're a dope.

438
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,901
An older woman
like that?

439
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,653
What's a little feel
to her?

440
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,613
She let you
have a feel?

441
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,574
She gave me
some doughnuts.

442
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,243
Probably stinks
from perfume.

443
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,828
Grow up.

444
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,249
What happened in
there all that time?

445
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,668
I wasn't aware
of the time.

446
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,670
It flew quickly.

447
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,923
I'd like to
give her a feel.

448
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,092
I thought you
were mature, oscy.

449
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,552
It's mature
to feel girls.

450
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,512
My brother
does it.

451
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,181
Then how come
he's a dentist?

452
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey, don't be
such a big shot,

453
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,809
And don't
tell us

454
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,603
Something went on
with that lady.

455
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,480
I ain't telling
you anything.

456
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,482
Which is the same
as telling us

457
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,567
A lot went on.

458
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,152
Screw you.

459
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,612
I ain't saying
something happened

460
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,030
If nothing happened.

461
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,406
Nothing happened.

462
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,283
If you believe
something happened,

463
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,409
I'm sorry for you

464
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,702
Because nothing
happened.

465
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,537
Jesus! I didn't
even know her name.

466
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,414
You expect us
to believe that?

467
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,208
I don't care
what you believe.

468
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,751
I'm going home.

469
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,004
My father's waiting
for his time magazine.

470
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,673
Going home?

471
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,551
Yeah, going home.

472
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,678
I got a few things
to think over.

473
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,222
I'm going home.

474
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,474
What are you
going to do later?

475
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,100
Kill myself.

476
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,102
No, after that.

477
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,189
I don't know, oscy.
I don't know!

478
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,860
Hernia! Jesus!

479
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,627
Good evening.

480
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,671
Fine night
for an evening of movies.

481
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,591
Are you old enough
to be up this late?

482
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,593
I have two
charming friends.

483
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,304
You have ice cream
on your face.

484
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,516
Ah, that perfume.
I grow dizzy.

485
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,603
My friends and i
would like you three ladies

486
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,521
To join us
in the movies.

487
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,523
Dutch treat,
i suppose.

488
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,318
Yeah, but we'll spring
for refreshments.

489
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,697
Where are they?

490
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,533
It's those
two rascals there.

491
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,493
Where?

492
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,995
Over there.

493
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,997
Smile. Look older.

494
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,541
Here, come on.

495
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,377
They're coming
this way.

496
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,588
What's yours?

497
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,547
Oscy.

498
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,757
Don't panic.

499
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,133
I'm sweating.

500
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,802
Don't sweat.

501
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,222
This is hermie
and benjie,

502
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,308
And this
is miriam.

503
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,227
This is aggie,
and this is gloria.

504
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,939
Hermie, you're
with aggie

505
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,899
Because you're
both intellectual.

506
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,610
Benjie, you're with
gloria... because.

507
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
I have to go home.

508
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,988
If gloria doesn't go,
we don't.

509
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,323
Benjie.

510
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,158
It's not important
that i go .

511
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,159
Don't be silly.

512
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,577
I don't
want to go.

513
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,537
Well, then
we won't go.

514
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,664
Go without her.

515
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,290
She's our friend.
We're together.

516
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,833
Go without me.

517
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,126
She wants us
to go.

518
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,086
She doesn't.

519
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,212
She does.

520
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,463
She does not.

521
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,048
She left.
Let's get in line.

522
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,424
The night's
still young.

523
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,134
We'll miss the cartoon.

524
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,512
Hello.

525
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,680
Hi.

526
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,567
Then we each
want a 15-Cent candy.

527
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,903
Yeah, sure, ok.

528
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,326
15 cents.

529
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,120
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,622
Hey, that's
the last time

531
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,708
I ever do anything
for benjie.

532
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,502
He's too young.
It's beyond him.

533
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,462
He almost screwed up
the whole arrangement.

534
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,048
I got bad news.

535
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,675
What?

536
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,385
You have to
lend me a dime.

537
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,429
Here's a nickel.

538
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,930
Wait, i got
some pennies.

539
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,227
Hey, catch the boobs
on miriam.

540
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,146
You catch them.

541
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,732
If she throws them,
i'll be ready.

542
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,567
If those boobs
come at me,

543
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,901
I'll catch them.

544
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,405
Oh, hermie, hi.

545
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,322
Hi, there.

546
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,782
You going
to the movies?

547
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:37,742
Yeah.

548
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,119
That's nice.
Good seeing you.

549
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,332
Hey, she really
knows you.

550
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,251
Jesus, this is
embarrassing.

551
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,377
What?

552
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,171
Her seeing me
with that.

553
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,589
Uh, hermie.

554
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,716
Could you come by
thursday afternoon?

555
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,551
I have some things
to move,

556
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,011
And i think
i'll need help.

557
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,387
Sure. Ok.

558
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,638
Great.

559
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,599
Thursday morning
would be better.

560
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,517
About 10:00?
Is that ok?

561
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,603
Sure.
We'll have coffee.

562
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,646
You like it black,
right?

563
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,981
Yeah, right.

564
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,692
See you thursday.
Enjoy the picture.

565
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,988
Hey, you're in.

566
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,239
Shut up.

567
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,325
You're in boy.
I can't believe it.

568
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,993
She's mad about you.

569
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,244
Coffee at 10:00.
Shit.

570
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,829
Will you shut up?

571
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,791
I'm excited. I'm squeezing
the crap out of miriam

572
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,167
When the lights
go out.

573
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,752
You're really something.

574
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,712
You can't even wait
till after the cartoon.

575
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,215
I can't wait.
I can't wait.

576
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,473
Silly name, isn't it?

577
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,266
My father named me
after a professor

578
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,476
He was fond of.

579
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,563
I was j.D. In college.
My wife calls me j. Duveaux.

580
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,565
I'm jerry to my friends.

581
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,902
Now, won't you tell me
who you are?

582
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:59,323
My name is vale,
v-A-L-E.

583
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,325
On the passenger
list,

584
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,285
It will be
c. Vale, boston.

585
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,870
Stop it.

586
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,123
Are you one
of the vales of boston?

587
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,834
One of the lesser
ones.

588
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,420
Which one?
Is it miss or mrs.?

589
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,383
It's aunt. Every family
has one, you know.

590
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,218
But aunt what?

591
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,972
My name
is charlotte vale.

592
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,849
Miss charlotte vale.

593
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,394
It was like
a miracle happening,

594
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,980
Like having your child.

595
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:32,356
Stop it!

596
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,024
Alright,
alright.

597
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,861
I even allowed myself
to indulge in the fantasy

598
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,487
That both of us
loving her

599
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,823
In doing what was
best for her together,

600
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,993
Would make her seem like
our child after a while.

601
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,037
I see no such fantasy
has occurred to you.

602
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,708
Again, i've been
a sentimental fool.

603
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,626
It's a tendency i have.

604
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,171
Wait a minute.

605
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,506
I was afraid you
were keeping tina

606
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,674
Out of pity,

607
00:36:58,884 --> 00:36:59,967
But there was
no pity

608
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,094
In your ridicule
of me just now.

609
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,263
Now, i know you
still love me.

610
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,307
And, it won't die,
what's between us.

611
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,808
Do what you will--

612
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,145
Ignore it,
neglect it, starve it.

613
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,980
Stop it!

614
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,398
...both of us
together.

615
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,817
Please let me go.

616
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,611
Oh, charlotte.

617
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,949
Please let me go.

618
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,381
Jerry...

619
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,676
Dr. Jackworth
knows about us.

620
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,762
When he said
i could take tina,

621
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,139
He said, "you're
on probation."

622
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,558
Do you know
what that means?

623
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,977
It means
i'm on probation

624
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,687
Because of you
and me.

625
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,025
He allowed this visit
as a test.

626
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,986
If i can't
stand such tests,

627
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,991
I'll lose tina,
and we'll lose each other.

628
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,162
Jerry, please help me.

629
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,418
Shall we just have
a cigarette on it?

630
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,296
Yes.

631
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,126
May i sometimes
come here?

632
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,795
Whenever you like.

633
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,797
It's your home, too.

634
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,133
The people here
love you.

635
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,093
I look at you
and tina

636
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,805
And see everything
peace and contentment.

637
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,598
Of course.
And just think,

638
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,851
It won't be
for this time only.

639
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,770
That is, if you'll
help me keep what we have.

640
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,275
We'll both try
to protect

641
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,986
That little strip
of territory that's ours.

642
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,197
We can talk
about your child.

643
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,615
Our child.

644
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,202
Thank you.

645
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,955
And will you be
happy, charlotte?

646
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,541
Oh, jerry,
don't let's ask

647
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,876
For the moon.

648
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,045
We have the stars.

649
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,239
Where do you live?

650
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,450
You live off
the point?

651
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:13,869
Let's go
to the beach

652
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,496
And watch the
surf roll in.

653
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,122
No, we really
have to go.

654
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,499
Ah, come on.

655
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,002
No. Maybe, we'll see it
on the beach tomorrow?

656
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,837
Will you be on
the beach tomorrow?

657
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,464
I won't be
on a mountain.

658
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,673
Then we'll see you.

659
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,301
Bye.

660
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,931
Yeah, bye.

661
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:38,936
Come on.

662
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,738
How'd you
make out?

663
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,198
Pretty good.

664
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,449
What did
you do?

665
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,742
I held
her breast.

666
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,160
You didn't.

667
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,037
For almost
11 minutes.

668
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,872
Fantastic!

669
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,041
11 full minutes.

670
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,376
You timed it.

671
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,838
Yeah. The longest
i ever got

672
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,257
Was eight minutes
with lila harrison.

673
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,092
So you broke
your record.

674
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,593
By three minutes.

675
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,430
What did it
feel like?

676
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,392
What do you mean?
It felt like a breast.

677
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,060
Didn't it feel
like an arm?

678
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:24,440
An arm? No,
it felt like a breast.

679
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,525
I'll bet it
felt like an arm.

680
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,820
Why like an arm?

681
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,822
Because it was
an arm.

682
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,949
What's the matter
with you?

683
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,076
You were feeling
her arm.

684
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,829
That's what i was
trying to tell you.

685
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,957
You squeezed an arm
for 11 minutes.

686
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,417
The eight-Minute
record

687
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,627
With lila harrison
still stands.

688
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,754
God damn it,
you're lying.

689
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,965
I wouldn't lie about
an arm, hermie.

690
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,677
An arm.

691
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,972
Jesus,
i was passing out,

692
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,640
And it was an arm.

693
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,477
Yeah...
a very lovely arm.

694
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,146
Well, you're
a son of a bitch.

695
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,063
What?

696
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,816
Why didn't you
let me think

697
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,026
It was a breast?

698
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,153
I thought
you should know

699
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,031
So you wouldn't make
that mistake again.

700
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:17,075
You wanted to ruin
my memory of it.

701
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,535
What do i care

702
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,330
If you spend your
life squeezing arms?

703
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,415
I thought you
should face reality,

704
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,250
Especially if
you're timing it

705
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,085
And going
for records.

706
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,464
I guess you're right.

707
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,717
Oh, god!

708
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,428
How can i ever
face her again?

709
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,975
Make sure she's
wearing long sleeves.

710
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,896
Ha ha ha!
An arm.

711
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,981
An 11 -Minute arm.

712
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,692
Ha ha! An arm.
Oh, god.

713
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,278
Lila harrison,
your record's safe!

714
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,279
Ha ha ha!

715
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,115
Lila harrison.
Oh, jesus!

716
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,288
"Nothing
is too heavy

717
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,165
When love
is in the air."

718
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,418
"Laughter becomes you."

719
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,089
"Coffee is exquisite."

720
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:13,423
Exquisite?

721
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,068
Is that you,
hermie?

722
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,528
It is i.

723
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,697
Come on in.
The door's open.

724
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,787
I'll be out
in a minute.

725
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,455
Why don't you
sit down?

726
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,708
I certainly will...

727
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,751
I shall.

728
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,004
Well...

729
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,114
Hi.

730
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,414
Hi.

731
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,002
We'll have the coffee
later, alright?

732
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:33,962
Yeah.

733
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,673
Ok.

734
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,216
Your coffee's
exquisite.

735
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,718
Thank you.

736
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,179
I hope it wasn't
an inconvenience

737
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,764
For you to
come by.

738
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:44,848
It's ok.

739
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,567
What's up there?

740
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,361
Dust.

741
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,946
Oh. May i see?

742
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,156
Sure.

743
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,337
Oh, there's lots
of room.

744
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,381
We shouldn't have
any trouble.

745
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,846
Thank you.

746
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,349
You're right.
There's lots of dust.

747
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,267
Laughter
becomes you.

748
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,688
I guess
the best thing to do

749
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,606
Is hand you the boxes
one at a time.

750
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:35,982
Don't you think?

751
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,192
Yeah, ok.

752
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,318
Great.

753
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,214
How are you
doing?

754
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,175
Fine.

755
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,725
Hermie, what's wrong?
Are you alright?

756
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,353
Yeah.

757
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,732
Well, your leg
is shaking.

758
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,820
I don't think your
ladder's too good.

759
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,366
Do you want me
to hold it?

760
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,749
I think you better
hand me another box.

761
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,709
Oh.

762
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,048
Just two more.

763
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,771
That's it.
Come on down.

764
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,160
Good job.

765
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,037
Yeah.

766
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,794
This time you
really must let me

767
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,253
Give you some money.

768
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,005
No, i couldn't take it.

769
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,508
I couldn't possibly
have gotten those boxes

770
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,009
Up there myself.

771
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,805
It's ok. I like you.

772
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,809
That's very sweet
of you, hermie.

773
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:35,352
I like you, too.

774
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,650
I mean, i don't like
many people.

775
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,504
Hermie!

776
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,381
Hey, hermie!

777
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,216
Come on!

778
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,845
Come on,
will you?

779
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:10,971
Hurry up.

780
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,390
Get up here.
Come on.

781
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,349
What happened?

782
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,725
Ah, nothing.

783
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,352
What went on
in there ?

784
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,478
Nothing.

785
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,981
Come on,
try to remember.

786
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,692
Well,
the way it went,

787
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,151
We went in
and chatted.

788
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,653
Yeah.

789
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,697
Then i put the boxes
in the attic.

790
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,323
Then she kissed me.

791
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,324
Kissed you?

792
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:32,617
Yeah. Right here.

793
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,244
See any lipstick?

794
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,912
Jesus, he's right.
Lipstick.

795
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,915
No. That's blood.
It's a mosquito bite.

796
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:42,586
No, that's
definitely lipstick.

797
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,713
Oscy, i like her
kissing me, not you.

798
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,425
It's blood.
She's a god damn vampire.

799
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:49,759
As i left,

800
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,803
I'm sure she asked me
to come back...

801
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:52,721
Anytime.

802
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,097
You know,
hermie,

803
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:55,849
I really think
you struck gold.

804
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,392
I really do.

805
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,190
Benjie, we'll need
the book again.

806
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,068
You drooled on it
before.

807
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,070
I'll get blamed
for warped pages.

808
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,488
My glasses
for the book.

809
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,698
You'll have fun

810
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,992
Identifying
enemy aircraft.

811
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,160
You'll be a hero.

812
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,912
Nothing flies
over this island

813
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:17,871
Except birds.

814
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,539
Maybe they're
enemies.

815
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,082
No go.

816
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,459
It's a fair swap.

817
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,086
Keep the glasses
for two days.

818
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,964
What's more,
if you don't,

819
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,966
I'll break
your nose.

820
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:30,926
Aw, come on.

821
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,344
Come on,
hermie!

822
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,221
In the name
of america,

823
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,182
I award you
these glasses.

824
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,113
Hey, benjie,
come on.

825
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,074
Hurry up,
hurry up.

826
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,533
Come on.

827
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,787
Come on, hurry up.

828
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,275
Wait.

829
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,403
Shh.

830
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
Come on.

831
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,166
And now
backstage wife,

832
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,419
The beloved story
of mary noble,

833
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,337
Now mary noble,
war wife,

834
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,173
As her husband larry,
a former broadway star,

835
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,175
Is now
lieutenant noble...

836
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,052
Ok, come on. Shh.

837
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,804
Somewhere in
the south pacific.

838
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,431
You'll recall

839
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,224
That when we last
heard from larry...

840
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,104
Were stranded
on an island

841
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,273
After their boat
had been wrecked...

842
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,035
Come on.

843
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,121
Mrs. Larson didn't.

844
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,165
She didn't,
but now she does.

845
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,958
Now she does
use duz.

846
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,126
Mrs. Larson knows...

847
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,254
Duz does everything
in her wash.

848
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:34,340
She's convinced this new kind
of soap...

849
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,717
It's even improved
her disposition.

850
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,385
She used to be...

851
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,678
Watch that step.

852
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,055
Ok, ok.

853
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,517
You wouldn't dirty up
so many towels

854
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,061
If you had to
wash them.

855
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,479
And she'd tell
her daughter.

856
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,897
I know
your rayon undies

857
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:49,981
Don't look bright
anymore...

858
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,775
Come on, come on.

859
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,694
But then mrs. Larson
discovered duz...

860
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,823
Hermie, i just
cleaned in there.

861
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,742
God damn it.

862
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,245
Where's the paper?

863
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,206
It's in the drawer.

864
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,839
Where's the carbon paper?

865
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:16,466
In there.

866
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,184
What are you doing?

867
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,270
I'm making two copies,
one for me and one for you.

868
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,690
Keep it with you
and learn it.

869
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,109
What for?

870
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,694
You can't call
on your lady with a book.

871
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,072
I'm condensing it.
Point by point.

872
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,908
Just stay close to this.
You'll do ok.

873
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,785
Oscy, i'm troubled.

874
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,787
I think i have a deep
feeling for her.

875
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,122
So what?

876
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:51,376
I don't want to just
lay her. I respect her.

877
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:53,837
There's something
you have to understand.

878
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,463
It's alright
to respect her,

879
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,756
But she
won't respect you

880
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,633
If you don't try
to lay her.

881
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,051
I don't believe that.

882
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,553
It's true.
My brother told me.

883
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,179
That's the way ladies are.

884
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,974
They want you to try
even if they don't let you.

885
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,018
Because even though they don't
let you, they want you to.

886
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,062
I think
i understand.

887
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,231
Good. Then you
can start memorizing.

888
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,324
Oh, this is crazy.

889
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,159
What?

890
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,160
Point 3.

891
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,245
What's crazy about it?

892
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,205
I've never
heard of the word.

893
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,000
Latin--The original
guys were latins.

894
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,043
I wouldn't know
how to pronounce it.

895
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,337
You don't pronounce it,
you just do it.

896
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,381
I don't know
where it is.

897
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,719
What the hell
is this in number 4?

898
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,264
That's latin, too.
It's all in latin, hermie.

899
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,809
I may have to ask
where these things are.

900
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,520
They're all approximately
in the same place.

901
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,105
"Seek and ye shall find."

902
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,066
Besides, she's supposed
to help you out.

903
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,695
I hope so. I'll need
all the help i can get.

904
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,909
Point 6, hermie--
Very important.

905
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,243
Foreplay.

906
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,871
Right. That word
keeps cropping up.

907
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,582
Well, i still don't
know what to do.

908
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,917
What do i say?

909
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,460
"How about
a little foreplay?"

910
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,462
You don't have
to say a word.

911
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,755
Oh, yeah?

912
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,341
Point 2 states
we should converse.

913
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,885
When you get to point 6,
there's no more talking,

914
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,720
Just moaning and sighing.

915
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,680
Just moan and sigh.

916
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,599
Well, she'll
think i'm sick.

917
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,726
She'll be moaning
and sighing, too.

918
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,062
It's going to
get noisy.

919
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:36,981
I got news
on miriam today.

920
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,691
A lifeguard told me.

921
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,653
Once she gets started,
she's supposed to be something.

922
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,780
I'm home, hermie.

923
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,491
If i follow
these 12 points,

924
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,784
She might have
a kid.

925
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,369
I can't
afford a kid,

926
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,578
At this stage.

927
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,038
So the whole
thing's off.

928
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,999
Hermie, you are
really dumb.

929
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,627
I may be dumb, but i
won't be a father.

930
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,379
Two wrongs,
don't make a right.

931
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,590
You use protection.
You use a rubber.

932
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,592
Haven't you heard
of a rubber?

933
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,718
Course i have.

934
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,887
Ok, that's
what you use.

935
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,597
I have mine.

936
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,226
When my brother
went into the service,

937
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,727
He willed it to me.

938
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,772
I've been carrying it
ever since.

939
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,357
It's my lucky charm.

940
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,694
How much for it?

941
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,821
Hey, it's
from my brother.

942
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,698
It's a family heirloom.

943
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,575
Get your own.
Go to the drugstore.

944
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:33,037
I won't risk it.
I'm underage.

945
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,291
Also, women shop
in drugstores.

946
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,792
Where do you want
to get them?

947
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,544
A sporting goods store?

948
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,337
If you were
a good friend,

949
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,505
You'd lend me yours.

950
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:43,840
What?

951
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,216
I'll return it.

952
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,594
I'm beginning to think
maybe you're a homo.

953
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,096
Swell, oscy.
Thanks a lot.

954
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,598
No, i mean you
don't know anything.

955
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:56,311
A rubber is used once
by only one party.

956
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,981
Not even best friends
go halfsies on a rubber.

957
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,692
Forget the whole
damn thing.

958
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,652
I'm doing this for you.

959
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,154
I'm doing this
out of friendship

960
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,823
Because...
well, your time has come.

961
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,117
Yeah, well,
just forget it.

962
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,703
I can't.
It's all arranged.

963
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,330
What's arranged?

964
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,373
The marshmallow roast
on the beach tonight.

965
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,000
Me and miriam,
you and aggie.

966
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,461
Don't try to get out of it.
It's all set.

967
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:22,962
Here are
your instructions.

968
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,631
I'm not interested
in aggie.

969
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,508
You're not ready
for the older lady.

970
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,635
I'm sharpening you up
on someone else.

971
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,429
Aggie is all i got.

972
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,431
Oscy,
you're really crazy.

973
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,224
Yeah, i'm crazy, mad.
Wow!

974
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,059
Shh.

975
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,685
Sorry. Hey, listen.

976
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,730
I'm not asking you
to get through point 12.

977
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,482
Cause i don't
believe in miracles.

978
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,650
I'll be happy
if you get to point 2.

979
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,652
Now, just give it
a try.

980
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,071
Forget it.

981
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,114
I'm not sticking
my neck out for aggie.

982
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,742
Listen, tomorrow morning
you'll thank me.

983
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,786
Tonight, i'll bring
the marshmallows,

984
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,329
And you bring a rubber.

985
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,436
Hey, go on.

986
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:21,771
Alright.

987
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,650
Well, go on.
Come on.

988
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,193
Get in there.

989
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,323
Go on, hermie.

990
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,585
Anything else?

991
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,546
Oh, yes. A bottle
of cod-Liver oil.

992
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:47,922
Oh, ma.

993
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,590
Shut up.
It's good for you.

994
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,511
$2.18. Thank you.
Come again.

995
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:56,514
Move.

996
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,057
Alright,
alright.

997
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,476
Move already.

998
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,972
Can i help you?

999
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,974
No, no.
Just looking.

1000
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,134
Did you get them?

1001
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:16,594
Not yet.

1002
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,012
Well, go get them.

1003
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,680
There's a lady
in there.

1004
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,806
Oh.

1005
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:54,715
Ok, get going.

1006
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:55,800
Ok.

1007
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:56,717
Go on.

1008
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,219
Alright.

1009
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,472
Go on!

1010
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,825
Yes?

1011
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,120
It's me, the same
guy as before.

1012
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,456
I stepped outside
for some air.

1013
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,461
What are you
looking for?

1014
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:33,879
Maybe i
can help you.

1015
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,299
I'll know
when i find it.

1016
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,312
Tell me what it is.

1017
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,400
I'll tell you.
I just remembered.

1018
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:57,653
Well?

1019
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,949
A strawberry
ice cream cone.

1020
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,912
Alright.
Come with me.

1021
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,712
One dip or two?

1022
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,590
Better make it
a triple.

1023
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,142
Alright.

1024
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:30,686
That'll be 10 cents.

1025
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,983
There's something
else i need.

1026
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,526
I just
remembered.

1027
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,279
Well, what is it?

1028
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,450
Sprinkles.

1029
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,037
Alright.

1030
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,627
Sprinkles.

1031
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,337
Here you go.

1032
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,630
Thanks a lot.

1033
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,675
That will cost you
12 cents.

1034
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,305
Is there
something else?

1035
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,393
Well, i hate
to bother you,

1036
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:11,894
But, uh...

1037
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,773
Speak up, son.

1038
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,860
How about
a napkin?

1039
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,822
Alright.

1040
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,158
Anything else?

1041
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,202
How about
some rubbers?

1042
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,208
Pardon?

1043
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,128
I understand
that you carry them.

1044
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:39,755
Carry what?

1045
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,258
Oh, come on.
You know what.

1046
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,885
Contraceptives.

1047
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,929
Yeah! Right!

1048
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,348
And you want to
buy some.

1049
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:50,766
Yeah.

1050
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:53,936
What for?

1051
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,022
Come on.
You know what for.

1052
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:01,861
Alright.

1053
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,332
What brand?

1054
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:16,959
Brand?

1055
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:18,502
Brand and style.

1056
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:20,921
The usual.

1057
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,174
There's a number
to choose from.

1058
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,473
Do you have to
flash them around?

1059
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,434
Which is
your usual?

1060
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,108
The blue ones.

1061
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,068
How many
would you like?

1062
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:45,488
Three dozen.

1063
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,032
You're planning
a big night?

1064
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,534
Just the usual.

1065
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,872
That will
be $12.

1066
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,540
$12?

1067
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,876
And 12 cents
for the ice cream.

1068
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,796
How much
just for a dozen?

1069
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,006
$4.00.

1070
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,634
And how many
for $1.00?

1071
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,927
Three.

1072
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:10,805
I'll take two.

1073
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,681
They come three
to a package.

1074
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,020
Can i just owe you
for the ice cream cone, then?

1075
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,357
Alright now,
son.

1076
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,192
Fun is fun,

1077
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,693
But how old
are you?

1078
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,111
16.

1079
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:27,905
How old?

1080
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,990
On my next birthday.

1081
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,410
What are you planning
to do with these?

1082
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,581
They're for my brother.
He's older.

1083
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,041
Why can't
he come in

1084
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,626
And get them
for himself?

1085
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,336
Well, he's sick.

1086
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,839
Then what's he
need them for?

1087
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,341
For when
he's feeling better.

1088
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,593
He's a ranger.

1089
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:50,594
Oh.

1090
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,473
Do you know what
these are used for?

1091
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,727
Sure. You fill them up
with water,

1092
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,563
Then you throw them
off the roof.

1093
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,399
I just wanted
to make sure you knew.

1094
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,068
Of course, i know.

1095
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:09,530
My brother wouldn't send me
without telling me.

1096
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,532
We'll call it
$1.00 even,

1097
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,200
Including
the ice cream.

1098
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,577
Ok!

1099
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,456
Thank you!

1100
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,462
Hi, hermie.

1101
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:26,755
Hi, aggie.

1102
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,383
I had a nice time
at the movie.

1103
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:31,594
I'm sorry if i was
rough on your arm.

1104
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,220
That's alright.

1105
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,889
Is it healing well?

1106
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,265
It's ok, really.

1107
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,017
I'm looking forward
to tonight.

1108
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,812
Oscy's outside. He's
bringing the marshmallows.

1109
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:42,813
Yeah.
I saw him.

1110
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,231
What are you
bringing?

1111
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,193
I'll--I'll see you
later, aggie, ok?

1112
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,403
Tonight.

1113
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,321
Bye.

1114
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,530
Bye.

1115
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,924
Can i toast you another
tasty marshmallow?

1116
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,508
If you like,

1117
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,469
But shouldn't
we save a few

1118
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,012
For oscy
and miriam?

1119
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,141
We may never
see them again.

1120
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,019
They seem to be
getting along very well.

1121
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,732
Yes. They're
very friendly.

1122
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,818
Hermie!

1123
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,987
Hermie!

1124
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,448
Psst!
Hermie!

1125
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,200
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

1126
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,034
Sure.

1127
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,035
Thank you.

1128
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,039
Let me see
your notes.

1129
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,707
Mine are
all sweaty.

1130
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:46,543
Come on.
Fork over them.

1131
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,087
What number
are you up to?

1132
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,213
6.

1133
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:52,549
6 is foreplay!
You're up to 6?

1134
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,386
That crazy miriam's
up to 9!

1135
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:56,971
You're kidding!

1136
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,640
I'm not kidding.
She's ruining my timing.

1137
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:02,101
Mm-Hmm.

1138
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,852
Jesus christ!

1139
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:06,522
How are you doing
with aggie?

1140
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,357
Well, we're up
to the marshmallows--

1141
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,317
No time.
I got to go.

1142
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:23,622
That was oscy.

1143
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:24,707
Yes.

1144
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,920
Feel like
another marshmallow?

1145
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,255
What's that paper?

1146
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,049
This?

1147
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,552
Uh, it's a map.

1148
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,095
A buried treasure.

1149
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,347
Yeah. Yeah,
i think so.

1150
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:41,807
Can i see it?

1151
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:43,851
Why don't you
just have

1152
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,227
Another
marshmallow?

1153
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,480
Oh, alright.

1154
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,116
Hermie!

1155
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,745
Hermie!

1156
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,246
Would you
excuse me again?

1157
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:05,330
Yes.

1158
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,874
You're very kind.

1159
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:09,877
What?

1160
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,128
Give me
a rubber.

1161
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,713
What happened
to your heirloom?

1162
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,714
It was spoiled.

1163
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,424
I guess they
don't keep.

1164
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,593
Come on.
For pete's sake!

1165
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,889
Come on.
It's cold.

1166
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,442
Don't you even
say thank you?

1167
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,069
Thank you, hermie.

1168
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,205
Why did miriam
say thank you?

1169
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,124
Because
she's a lady.

1170
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,626
Oh, i see.

1171
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,377
See what?

1172
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,754
Pardon?

1173
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,798
You said you saw.
What did you see?

1174
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,633
Oh, actually
nothing.

1175
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:58,801
Then don't
say you see

1176
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,427
When you don't.

1177
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:01,470
Ok.

1178
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:22,950
Psst!

1179
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:32,918
Need a rubber?

1180
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:35,337
I need
a breather.

1181
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,048
I also need
another rubber.

1182
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,511
Did you get
to point 12 yet?

1183
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:43,762
12?

1184
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,974
Hermie, we're
so far past 12.

1185
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,309
But that's as far
as the book goes.

1186
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,061
What's after 12?

1187
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,607
Well...
there's 13...

1188
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,943
And 14...

1189
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,320
And 15...

1190
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,115
Hermie, you have
no idea.

1191
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,325
And 16...

1192
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,578
And 17 and 18.

1193
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,462
I think
miriam and i

1194
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:19,173
Should be
getting home now.

1195
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,175
I'll take you home.

1196
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,218
I think i'd
better get miriam.

1197
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:27,014
Hey, aggie,
i don't think so.

1198
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,433
Aggie,
i'll take you home.

1199
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,533
Hi.

1200
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,494
Oh, hermie, hi.

1201
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:13,870
How have you been?

1202
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:16,373
Fine, thank you.
And you?

1203
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:17,749
Pretty good.

1204
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:18,583
Good.

1205
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,757
Mmm, what
a beautiful morning!

1206
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,176
Should be
a really nice day.

1207
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:30,804
Yeah.

1208
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:36,059
How are the boxes we put away?
Any trouble?

1209
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,104
No. They're fine.
They're still up there.

1210
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,898
I think
they'll be alright.

1211
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,283
I'd ask you
to the movies,

1212
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,826
But it's
the same picture.

1213
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,704
Like to see it
again?

1214
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,874
Oh, no, thanks.

1215
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,668
I don't blame you.

1216
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,670
Once you know
the ending,

1217
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,213
It kills the thrill.

1218
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,390
Tide's coming in.

1219
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,478
Yeah, so it is.

1220
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,988
Have any other heavy
objects you want moved?

1221
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,492
Oh, no, none
that occur to me.

1222
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:36,203
Well, if you
can think of any,

1223
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,162
Feel free.

1224
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,831
Alright,
i will.

1225
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,124
Thank you.

1226
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,054
Will you be
at home tonight?

1227
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,598
Pardon?

1228
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,892
I thought
i might drop by.

1229
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:00,936
I have to be
in the neighborhood.

1230
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,025
Feel free
to drop by.

1231
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,072
I'm not saying
i can come for sure.

1232
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,490
Don't plan on it.

1233
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,324
No.

1234
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,369
Getting late.

1235
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,912
I've got to get
to the post office

1236
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,330
And get
these letters off.

1237
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,208
I'll run them down
for you.

1238
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:25,001
No, thanks.
It's tricky postage,

1239
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,420
Overseas and all.

1240
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,213
Thanks anyway.

1241
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:33,593
Hello!

1242
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,430
I don't even
know your name.

1243
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,849
Oh, dorothy.

1244
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:41,184
I had a cat
named dorothy.

1245
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,728
It got hit
by a truck.

1246
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:46,314
Bye!

1247
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:42,913
Hi.

1248
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,670
You know what?

1249
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,922
What?

1250
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,757
It's all over.

1251
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:54,925
What?

1252
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,301
Me and miriam.

1253
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:57,886
What happened?

1254
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,554
I'm embarrassed
to tell you.

1255
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,597
Then don't tell me.

1256
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,390
You won't
believe it.

1257
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,017
After last night,
i'll believe anything.

1258
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,685
No. It's not
what you think.

1259
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,063
Look, oscy.
I'm in kind of a hurry.

1260
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,106
We had an argument
this afternoon.

1261
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,026
I went over to her house to
apologize.

1262
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,779
She's got
appendicitis.

1263
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:17,697
Took her over
to the mainland.

1264
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,407
Hope they
leave her there.

1265
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,536
I hope they don't
cut up her boobs.

1266
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,621
I don't think
the scar goes that far.

1267
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,164
She told me she's
breaking our date.

1268
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,542
The next thing
i know, appendicitis.

1269
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,961
She goes
to extremes.

1270
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,047
They loaded her on the
speedboat on a stretcher.

1271
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,757
Maybe it's all
for the better.

1272
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,759
How can you say
such a dumb thing?

1273
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,177
Because i'm not
really interested.

1274
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,263
Bullshit.
You're interested.

1275
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,682
You took a long look
at us last night.

1276
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,141
We knew you were looking.

1277
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,269
I only
caught a glimpse.

1278
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,770
Will you shut up oscy.

1279
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,772
I don't want to hear
your dirty details.

1280
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,482
You don't want me
to tell you?

1281
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,067
I don't wanna
hear about it.

1282
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,652
I was gonna tell you everything.

1283
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,028
Don't.

1284
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,948
When you want to hear,
i won't tell you.

1285
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,032
Good.

1286
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,118
Something's wrong with you.
You're not normal.

1287
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:03,952
Good.

1288
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,036
Going to her house?

1289
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,079
Screw you.

1290
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,164
Got your
instructions handy?

1291
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,584
It won't
be like that.

1292
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:11,668
You wouldn't
understand it.

1293
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,003
Because you're
so crass.

1294
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,629
Crass? What the hell
is crass?

1295
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:15,755
Just leave me alone.

1296
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,507
What are you
so mad about?

1297
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:18,675
I don't know!

1298
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,260
Got your
rubbers?

1299
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,012
You're a regular
comedian.

1300
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:22,846
You know what?

1301
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,848
I'm sorry i tried
to help you.

1302
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,057
That makes
two of us.

1303
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,227
I gave you my binoculars
to get you educated.

1304
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:32,897
Word's getting out
you're a homo.

1305
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,399
If you don't
cut it out,

1306
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,401
You'll get
a fat lip!

1307
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,780
Ah!

1308
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:54,669
Homo!

1309
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,013
Hello?

1310
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,770
Hello?

1311
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:09,703
Hello?

1312
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,011
Hello?

1313
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:00,837
Hello?

1314
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,889
Dorothy,
it's hermie,

1315
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,475
Hermie
from the beach.

1316
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,284
Hi, hermie.

1317
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,621
Hi.

1318
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,631
I don't look
very nice, do i?

1319
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:30,844
I think you do.

1320
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:32,971
I think i don't.

1321
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:40,598
I'm sorry.

1322
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,823
Good night, hermie.

1323
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,244
Good night.

1324
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,188
Miriam pulled through.

1325
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,737
I talked to her mother
this morning.

1326
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:29,867
Jesus. They didn't
even operate.

1327
01:36:30,577 --> 01:36:31,952
They froze her.

1328
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,126
I'm relieved
about it.

1329
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,421
But she's through
for the summer.

1330
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,799
Won't be back
on the island again.

1331
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,056
My first lay...
gone with the wind.

1332
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,317
Hey, have you seen
benjie anywhere?

1333
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:05,778
That rat
still has my glasses.

1334
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:16,288
Hey, you know,
you shouldn't feel so bad,

1335
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18,248
No matter
what happened.

1336
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:23,504
You don't
have to tell me.

1337
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,926
But if you want to
tell me, you can.

1338
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,808
You don't have to
unless you want to.

1339
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:52,991
Sometimes life is
one big pain in the ass.

1340
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:07,798
Hey, i thought
maybe we'd attack

1341
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:09,842
The coast guard
station tonight.

1342
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:11,760
You know,
give them a scare?

1343
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:29,374
"Dear hermie,
i must go home now.

1344
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,753
"I'm sure you'll understand.

1345
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,172
"There's much i have to do.

1346
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,301
"I won't try and explain
what happened last night

1347
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,179
"Because i know that,
in time,

1348
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,640
"You'll find a proper way
in which to remember it.

1349
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:49,478
"What i will do
is remember you,

1350
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:54,983
"And i pray that you be spared
all senseless tragedies.

1351
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,237
"I wish you good things,
hermie,

1352
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,114
"Only good things.

1353
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,951
Always, dorothy. "

1354
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:11,458
I was never
to see her again,

1355
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:15,045
Nor was i ever to learn
what became of her.

1356
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,590
We were different then.

1357
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,592
Kids were different.

1358
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:24,930
It took us longer to understand
the things we felt.

1359
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:29,267
Life is made up of small
comings and goings

1360
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,145
And for everything
we take with us,

1361
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,357
There is something
that we leave behind.

1362
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,111
In the summer of '42,

1363
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:42,531
We raided the coast guard
station four times.

1364
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:46,576
We saw five movies
and had nine days of rain.

1365
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:51,623
Benjie broke his watch,
oscy gave up the harmonica,

1366
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,209
And in a very special way

1367
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:58,755
I lost hermie... forever.
