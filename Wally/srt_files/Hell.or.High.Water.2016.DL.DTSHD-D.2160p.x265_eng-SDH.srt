176
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,178
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

177
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,679
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.

178
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,768
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.

179
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,145
Maybe,
if you can find the tree.

180
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,026
(CHUCKLES)
God, I love West Texas.

181
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,615
- Ranger.
- Hi there.

182
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,660
Wasn't much of a robbery.

183
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,744
Got off with just under $7,000.

184
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,790
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.

185
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,501
- No ink pack?
- Nope.

186
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,335
- Smart.
- That was smart.

187
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,422
Can we get a look
at the video?

188
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,591
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

189
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,137
This here is Ranger Hamilton.

190
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,597
- Ranger.
- Sir.

191
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,517
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

192
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,894
We got cameras, but they're switching us
over to a digital system

193
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,313
that feeds into the computer.

194
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,149
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.

195
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,109
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.

196
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,319
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras

197
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,613
to some sort of
recording device.

198
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,077
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

199
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,370
Oh.

200
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,830
Faces covered?

201
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,876
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...

202
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,585
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

203
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,171
Tweakers, maybe?

204
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,422
Maybe.

205
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,424
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

206
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:09,553
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.

207
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,140
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

208
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,516
Can I take a look inside?

209
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,892
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,560
ALBERTO:
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

211
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,688
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?

212
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,814
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,275
Not very nice.

214
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:29,197
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

215
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,450
Black, white?

216
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,244
Their skin or their souls?

217
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,498
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

218
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,290
White.

219
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,668
From around here somewhere
is my guess,

220
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,587
you know, from their voices.

221
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,006

same deal with the branch in Olney.</i>

223

224
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,930
Do they have video?

225
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,515

My word.
Get your hands off that.

228
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:07,444
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.

229
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,362
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

230
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,241
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

231
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,702
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

232
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,247
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.

233
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,455
That's my guess.

234
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,543

a few banks to get there.

238
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,481
You take them to the funeral?

239
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,944
Like I said,
they don't know anything.

240
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,325
When's the last time
you saw them?

241
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,583
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

242
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,962
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

243
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,715
You talk to them on the phone?

244
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,929
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

245
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,222
Go see them tomorrow.

246
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,979
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

247
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,856
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.

248
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,902
We can't spare it,
you know that.

249
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,114
Maybe we should hit
another branch.

250
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,121
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.

251
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,084
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.

252
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,502
You?

253
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,383
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

254
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,511
Because you asked,
little brother.

255
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,187

a ways to go yet.

260

Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.

261
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,177
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...

the reverse mortgage.

the property tax from 2012 to now.

698

That's another $11,000.

699
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:31,683
So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.

700
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,480
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

701
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,191
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.

- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.

the least they could.

on a guaranteed return.

on his bank accounts and the ranch,

1213
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:04,489
DA wouldn't do it.

1214
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,157
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.

1215
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:09,451
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

1216
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:11,621
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1217
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:13,206
People don't start out
robbing banks.

1218
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,665
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

1219
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:17,292
Besides,
when we was out there,

1220
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,045
we saw two crews from Chevron

1221
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,463
capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.

1222
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:23,173
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull

1223
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,551
2,000 barrels a month
off that place.

1224
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,261
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody

1225
01:28:28,429 --> 01:28:30,097
set to clear $50,000 a month

1226
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:33,351
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.

1227
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,560
Midland manages the trust?

1228
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:41,066
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

1229
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,110
I don't think the bank cares
about anything

1230
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:44,945
but keeping that trust
right where it is.

1231
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,448
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

1232
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:54,079
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

1233
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,289
Oh, I hear you.

1234
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,210
(SIGHS)

1235
01:29:00,378 --> 01:29:01,754
You like my desk?

1236
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,214
I don't hate it.

1237
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,426
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

1238
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,193
(TV PLAYING)

1239
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:46,733
Know who I am?

1240
01:30:51,072 --> 01:30:53,366
I'm the man
who killed your brother.

1241
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,659
I know.

1242
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,787
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

1243
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,793
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.

1244
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,963
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.

1245
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,714
I figure you got one, too.

1246
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,056
Mind if I sit?

1247
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:22,727
Go ahead.

1248
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:47,502
You want a beer?

1249
01:31:48,713 --> 01:31:51,715
Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.

1250
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:03,352
Thanks.

1251
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:11,193
It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,

1252
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,986
now that it's cooled down.

1253
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:24,832
How did you do it?

1254
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,419
Oh, never mind.

1255
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,503
I'll figure that out in time.

1256
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:32,756
Why?
Why did you do it?

1257
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:37,010
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.

1258
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:40,013
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.

1259
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:45,727
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.

1260
01:32:45,895 --> 01:32:47,062
It made him feel good.

1261
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,776
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,

1262
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:55,404
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis

1263
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,447
or whatever else
he could think to buy.

1264
01:32:57,615 --> 01:33:01,826
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.

1265
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:03,369
But not you.

1266
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,957
There's nothing new
around here...

1267
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:12,088
except them pumpjacks.

1268
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:13,838
Each one of them
making you a month

1269
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:17,259
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

1270
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:20,303
Help me understand, then.

1271
01:33:23,099 --> 01:33:25,351
Help me understand
why four people died...

1272
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,940
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

1273
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,192
that it don't seem you need.

1274
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,443
You got a family?

1275
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,903
My partner had a family.
A big one.

1276
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,906
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1277
01:33:40,074 --> 01:33:42,408
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

1278
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:45,954
By setting this thing
in motion.

1279
01:33:47,164 --> 01:33:50,333
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

1280
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,588
Oh, no.
This was smart.

1281
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:55,965
This was you.

1282
01:33:59,844 --> 01:34:01,636
I've been poor my whole life.

1283
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,726
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1284
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,605
It's like a disease...

1285
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,276
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

1286
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:17,527
That's what it is.

1287
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:21,031
Infects every person you know...

1288
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:23,701
but not my boys.

1289
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,703
Not anymore.

1290
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:31,750
This is theirs now.

1291
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:38,089
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1292
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:41,260
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

1293
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:46,098
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

- Howdy.
- What's going on?

1296
01:35:29,058 --> 01:35:31,517
The hogs are back
in the garden.

1297
01:35:31,685 --> 01:35:34,145
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

1298

Who's this?

1299
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:38,859
I'm an old friend
of your husband.

1300
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:41,111
Ex-husband.

1301
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:44,406
I'm just working on the house.

1302
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:47,243
Oh, you don't live here?

1303
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,204
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.

1304
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,375
On.

1305
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,961
The things we do
for our kids, huh?

1306
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:00,589
Well...

1307
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:03,801
I best be going.

1308
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,093

01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,054
Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,

1310
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,847
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1311
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,100
Start painting the extension

1312
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:12,433
and then help Randy
with his homework

1313
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:15,478
when he gets back
from school, okay?

1314
01:36:15,646 --> 01:36:16,688
Okay.

1315

and finish this conversation,

you're welcome anytime.

I'm ready to be done
with this.

You'll never be done with it
no matter what.

But you won't be alone.

1326

It's gonna haunt me, too.

If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.

1328
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:57,353
Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.
