Your voice of choice.

94
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,297
The world's only 12-hour
strong man on the air.

95
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,046
Here on WE-LOVE radio, 108 FM.

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,379
The last on your dial,
but first in your hearts,

97
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,590
and that's the truth, Ruth.

98
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,174
Here I am. Am I here?

99
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,601
Ya know it. It ya know.

100
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,553
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy

101
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,062
doing the nasty to ya ears,
ya ears to the nasty.

102
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,108
I's only play da platters dat matter

103
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,902
the matters dey platter,

104
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,571
and that's the truth, Ruth.

105
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,903
<i>From the heart of Bed-Stuy,
you're listening to WE-LOVE radio.</i>

106
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,659
Doing the ying and the yang,
the hip and the hop,

107
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,366
the stupid fresh thing,
the flippity-flop.

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,588
I have today's forecast for you.

109
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,551
Hot! Sss!

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,470
The color for today is black.

111
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,638
That's right, black.

112
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,888
So you can absorb some of these rays
and save that heat for winter.

113
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,142
So you wanna get on out there,
wear that black and be involved.

114
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,144
Also today's temperature's
gonna rise up over 100 degrees.

115
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,100
So that's a Jheri-curl alert.

116
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,526
That's right, Jheri-curl alert.

117
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,048
If you have a Jheri-curl,
stay in the house

118
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,190
or you'll end up with a permanent plastic
helmet on your head forever.

119
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,652
<i>All right, we're going to
say hello to Mister and Missus,</i>

120
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,077
<i>that's Mister and Missus.</i>

121
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,576
<i>And happy birthday to Big Red,
Little Red</i>

122
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,703

123
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,580
<i>If you're careful
and stay out of this heat,</i>

124
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,582
<i>you might live to be that old yourself.</i>

125
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,416
<i>There's also a water shortage,
so keep those showers down to one minute.</i>

126
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,717
<i>Two minutes
if you're showering with a friend.</i>

127
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,546
<i>- You better get on out there.</i>
- Oh, damn!

128
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,839
It is hot!

129
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,219
<i>You'll get that pink slip.</i>

130
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,802
<i>So get up, get up, get up
and get on out there!</i>

131
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,039
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

132
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,305
<i>We don't want to see
anybody losing their jobs</i>

133
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,265
<i>'cause ain't nobody
got no money as it is.</i>

134
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,316
<i>All right.
Now we're going to talk about it.</i>

135
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,718
<i>The streets are coming alive.
We're going to rock 'n' roll...</i>

136
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,029
Good m-m-morning.

137
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,362
M-M-My name is Smiley.

138
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:00,122
This is M-M-M-M-Malcolm... X.

139
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:06,379
And this is M-M-M-M-Martin K-K-King.

140
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,133
Now, th-they are d-d-dead.

141
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:21,064
But w-we still h-h-have to f-f-f-fight

142
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,268
a-against ap-apartheid.

143
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:31,529
10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100.

144
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,110
20, 40, 60, shit!

145
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:39,074
80... 300.

146
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:44,083
20, 40, 60, 80... Wait, that's 300.

147
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:50,089
300, 350, 450... cash dollar bills.

148
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,528
Mookie. Why are you always
bothering me when I'm sleeping...

149
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,358
Wake up, wake up.

150
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,034
Stop breathing down my neck!

151
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,908
Why should I wake up, Mookie?

152
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,365
It's gonna be hot today, Jade.

153
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,667
Saturday's the only day
I get to sleep late.

154
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,587
Damn.

155
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,291
Stop, Mookie. That's not funny.

156
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,627
Why don't you leave me alone
when I'm sleeping?

157
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,949
What's the matter? You don't love
your brother Mookie anymore?

158
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,259
I loves you, Jade.

159
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,717
I'll get a lock
and keep your ass out of here, Mookie.

160
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,397
Why don't you go to work, man,
and leave me alone for once?

161
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,223
Later. Got to get paid.

162
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,433
Yeah, brush your teeth.

163
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,268
I brushed my teeth.

164
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,944
Your breath stinks.

165
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,031
It's your upper lip.

166
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,358
What's up, there, Sal?
How you doin' there, boy?

167
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,444
Man, I got to get me
a Cadillac like that.

168
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,998
I'm gonna get me a car just like that.
Big old Cadillac.

169
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,786
Oh, it's hot.

170
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,878
Sonny, how's the vegetables, huh?

171
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,585
Good morning, Sal, Pino, Vito.

172
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,341
Pop, you talk to that air-condition guy?

173
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,013
I been calling him all week.

174
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,466
He won't come around
unless he has a police escort.

175
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,264
Pino, get a broom and sweep up front.

176
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,065
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.

177
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,987
- Huh?
- Get a broom and sweep out front.

178
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,074
What?

179
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,241
Get a broom and sweep out front!

180
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,160
See, Pop?
It's just what I was telling you.

181
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,238
Every time you tell Pino what to do,

182
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,415
he tells me to do
what you told him what to do.

183
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,117
He's brain-dead, Pop, for years.

184
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,708
- Both of you, shut up.
- Tell Pino!

185
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,109
What, am I talking to myself, here?
Is that what I'm doing?

186
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,920
I didn't want to come to work anyway.

187
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,253
I hate this friggin' place.
I detest it like a sickness.

188
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,804
You-You detest this place
like a sickness?

189
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,845
That's, like, really hate, you know?
That's hate.

190
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,310
- I didn't say that.
- Oh, you didn't say that?

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,892
What, I just heard it.
Am I going crazy?

192
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,978
Did I just hear that, Vito?

193
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,531
I mean, do you think you can do better?

194
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,233
No, I didn't think so.

195
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,865
You see, Pino,
this is a respectable business,

196
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,446
and there's nothing wrong with that.

197
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,643
If there's something wrong with that,
I want you to tell me.

198
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,034
You... No, you can tell me right now.

199
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,438
- Is there something wrong with that?
- No.

200
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,065
All right. There's nothing wrong.
All right? Okay?

201
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,580
Look, do me a favor.

202
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,007
- Get a broom and sweep up.
- Tell Vito.

203
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,676
What are you, deaf or what?
Pop asked you.

204
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,674
I'm going to kill somebody today.

205
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,414
- I can't believe it, you know?
- What?

206
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,474
That you like her.

207
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,022
- I don't like her.
- Yeah?

208
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,519
Yeah, I don't like her.

209
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,193
Hell no.

210
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,780
- Hey.
- Hi, Mookie.

211
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,207
Mookie.

212
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,374
Hey, Mook.

213
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,293
Mornin', Mookie.

214
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,624
Morning, Miss Mother Sister.

215
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,334
Now Mookie, don't work too hard today.

216
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,420
The man says it's going to be hot
as the devil.

217
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,381
I don't want you falling out
from the heat, you hear me, son?

218
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,133
- I hear you, Mother Sister. I hear you.
- Good.

219
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,219
- All right.
- I'll be watching you, son.

220
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,181
Mother Sister always watches.

221
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,853
Mookie...

222
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,731
You're late again.

223
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,117
You live up the block, what?
Your Cadillac broke?

224
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,824
Hello, Sal, Vito.

225
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,076
Yo, Mook. What up?

226
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,166
Just coolin'.

227
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,367
Just coolin'.
You're still late.

228
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,374
Why don't you Relax, Pino?
Take it easy. You'll live longer.

229
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,304
Here, take the broom.
The front needs sweeping.

230
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,748
Wait a minute. I just got here.

231
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,834
You sweep.
I bet you Sal asked you first anyway.

232
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,009
That's right.

233
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,461
Vito, stop that.

234
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,048
You know, just fuck that shit.
I deliver pizzas.

235
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,849
- That's what I get paid for.
- You get paid to do what we say.

236
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,054
What we say? Did you hear Sal?
I didn't hear Sal say nothing.

237
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,314
- Who's working for who, huh?
- Shh.

238
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,317
Come on in, Mayor.

239
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,522
Morning, gentlemen.

240
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,575
Pino, Mookie, Vito, Sal.

241
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,074
- How are you?
- Ooh-whee.

242
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,907
It's gonna be a scorcher today.
That's for sure.

243
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,500
Need any work done 'round here?

244
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:38,047
Daddy...

245
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,089
Why don't you leave him alone?
Huh?

246
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,509
He's a good man.
Leave him alone.

247
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,095
Choose your weapon, Mayor.

248
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,804
You dropped something, Mayor.

249
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,849
You are going to have
the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn.

250
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,777
Clean as the Board of Health.
Ha!

251
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,854
All right, Mayor.

252
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,356
Pop, I don't believe this shit.

253
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,157
You running welfare or something?

254
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,702
Every day you give this <i>azupep</i>
a dollar.

255
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,600
- What's <i>azupep?</i> What's this <i>azupep</i> shit?
- Are you Italian? Do you know <i>azupep</i>?

256
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,536
The Mayor ain't no <i>azupep.</i>

257
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,226
Every day you give this <i>azupep</i> a dollar
for sweeping our sidewalk.

258
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,663
What do we pay Mookie for, huh?
He don't even work.

259
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,749
I work harder than him,
and I'm your own son.

260
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,427
Pino, let's see you carry
six large pies up six flights of stairs,

261
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,049
no elevator either and shit.

262
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,632
- Why don't you both shut up?
- Yeah, tell 'em, Pop.

263
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,472
And why don't you shut up,
too, Vito?

264
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,679
- Me and you are gonna have a talk.
- Aw, says who?

265
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,808
- Says who?
- Says who?

266
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,139
- Says me.
- Who are you?

267
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,600
Hey, hey!
Now what did I just say?

268
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,186
Don't start that
"Mookie don't work" shit, all right?

269
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,942
- Yo, Ahmad!
- I coulda done that.

270
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,866
Man, shut up. Yo, Ahmad!

271
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,364
Shit. Look, stop.

272
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,557
Look, Punchy, you want to do
any more screaming, be my guest.

273
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,413
'Cause I'm too through.

274
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,081
Yo, who's out here yelling my name?

275
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,772
- Well, Punchy told me to.
- Punchy told me to.

276
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,664
Don't listen to this knothead.
It'll get you in trouble, girl.

277
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,758
Heard that, Punchy.

278
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,004
- Yo, Ella? Ella?
- What?

279
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,131
You got a brain, right?
Use it.

280
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,432
Peace, y'all.

281
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,720
- Peace, Radio Raheem.
- Peace, man.

282
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,597
You the man.
I'm just visiting.

283
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,977
- It's your world, G.
- For real, in a big motherfuckin' way.

284
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,808
Yo, that boy's livin' very large.

285
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,894
Even walks in stereo.

286
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,147
Yo, P.E.'s in full effect, boy!

287
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,778
Radio Raheem like a motherfucker.

288
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,870
Radio Raheem.
Blastin' that big box.

289
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,618
Cold rockin' the scene.

290
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,919
Where's the Miller High Life?

291
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,417
Where is the Miller High Life?

292
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,000
No more High Life.
You look what we have and buy.

293
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,380
No more High Life?

294
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,632
What kind of a joint is this?

295
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,384
How come no more High Life?

296
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,888
Look, doctor, this ain't Korea or China
or wherever you come from.

297
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,811
You get some Miller High Life
in this fuckin' joint.

298
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,897
You buy another beer.

299
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,811
Da Mayor...

300
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,561
don't drink this Lite shit.

301
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,988
Tastes like cold pot liquor.

302
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,655
All right, all right.
But you're askin' a lot

303
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,111
to make a man change his beer.

304
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,867
You askin' lot, doctor.

305
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,168
Hey! You old drunk!

306
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,247
What did I tell you about drinkin'
in front of my stoop?

307
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,799
Move on.
You're blockin' my view.

308
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,927
You are ugly enough.
Don't stare at me.

309
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,803
The evil eye doesn't work on me.

310
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,682
Mother Sister,
you been talkin' about me for 18 years.

311
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,727
- What I ever done to you?
- You a drunk fool.

312
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,853
Besides that?

313
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,484
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

314
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,688
And nobody don't bother the Mayor
but you.

315
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:53,321
The Mayor just tend to his own business.
I love everybody.

316
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,990
- I even love you.
- Hold your tongue!

317
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,946
You don't have that much love.

318
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,158
One day, you gonna be nice to me.

319
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,579
We may both be dead and buried,
but you gonna be nice.

320
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,456
At least civil.

321
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,390
I told you.
I'm not going to babysit for you,

322
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,721
and that's it!

323
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,225
What are you talking about?

324
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,228
Yesterday you said
you were gonna do it.

325
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,758
Now today you're changing your mind?

326
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,233
No, I'm not changing...

327
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,235
Get off of me, Mami, please!

328
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,739
It's, like, I do everything for you,
but you can't do shit for me!

329
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,070
Yeah, right.

330
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,827
Right, Mami.
No, it's not like that, Mami.

331
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,831
Uh-huh. I can do everything for you, Mami,
but you won't do shit for me, right?

332
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,666
Stop it!

333
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,255
That lady makes me sick!

334
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,058
Your father makes me sick, too.
Everybody makes me sick.

335
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,969
Shit.

336
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,647
Your father ain't no real father.
He's a bum.

337
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,775
Chump change, to-the-curb,
pulling no major pub, bum!

338
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,779
Mike.

339
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,028
Fuck Mike Tyson!
Mike Tyson ain't shit.

340
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,861
I remember when he mugged that woman
right there on Lexington.

341
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,849
- I remember that shit.
- And you're going to tell him that?

342
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,785
I'll tell him that. I ain't...
Fuck Mike Tyson!

343
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,787
- To his face?
- You goddamn right!

344
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,869
Mike Tyson will knock
your goddamn eye out.

345
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,857
- I ain't scared of Mike Tyson.
- You talk shit now.

346
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,817
- I'll drop him like a bad habit.
- ML, you hear that?

347
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,707
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Yeah, boy.

348
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,966
If Tyson dream about whippin' my ass,
he better wake up and apologize.

349
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,887
Well, gentlemen,
the way I see it...

350
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:43,060
if this hot weather continues,
it's going to melt the polar caps

351
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,979
and the whole wide world.

352
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,978
And all those parts
that ain't water already

353
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,025
will surely be flooded.

354
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,729
You dumb ass, simple motherfucker!

355
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,655
Now, where you read that shit, eh?

356
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,027
The polar caps.

357
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,235
- Oh.
- Don't worry about it.

358
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,036
And when it happens,
and I'm in my boat,

359
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,035
and you black asses are drowning,

360
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,708
don't call for me
to throw you no rope,

361
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,083
- no lifesaver, or no nothing.
- No nothing.

362
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,505
You fool,
you 30 cent away from a quarter.

363
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,050
How the fuck you gonna get a boat?

364
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,297
Hey, yeah, boy.

365
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,844
Don't worry about it.

366
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,096
Goddamn right,
don't worry about it.

367
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,844
Look at you.
You're raggedy as a roach,

368
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,766
eat the holes out of doughnuts.

369
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,389
Raggedy motherfucker!

370
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,187
- Shit, don't worry about it.
- I'm in good shape, eh?

371
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,856
I'm in good shape.

372
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,605
I'll be back on my feet soon enough.

373
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,187
Not in them raggedy-ass shoes!
Look at you.

374
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,648
Shoes so run over,
he gotta lay down to put 'em on.

375
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,110
- So, ML, ML, ML, tell me.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,742
So when is all this goddamn ice
supposed to melt?

377
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,699
Hello. Sal's Pizza.

378
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,500
Yep.

379
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,328
Meatball hero, eggplant Parmesan.

380
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,663
You got it.

381
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,760
Yeah, we deliver.
Of course, we deliver.

382
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,429
All right. Where is that?

383
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,757
You gonna pay now
or you gonna pay on layaway?

384
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,887
How much?

385
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,227
You been coming here at least
three times a day.

386
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,475
What are you, a retard?

387
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,393
It's $1.50.

388
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,726
Yo Sal, put some cheese
on that motherfucker, man.

389
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,560
Extra cheese is $2.00.

390
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,025
- $2.00?
- Yeah, $2.00.

391
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,572
Hey, you can forget that shit.

392
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,659
Yeah.

393
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,003
What...

394
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,501
Damn, Sal, you're cheap, man.

395
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,930
...right, and he called him a bum.

396
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,740
- A bum?
- I don't think he was a bum.

397
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,764
He just wasn't right,
and he wasn't compassionate.

398
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,794
- As Sal would say...
- I need passion in my life.

399
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,354
As Sal would say,
he's a <i>mamaluke.</i>

400
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,935
He's a <i>mamaluke!</i>

401
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,487
Yeah, right.

402
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,609
Yo, Mook!

403
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,442
- Mookie!
- What?

404
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,324
How come you got
no brothers up on the wall?

405
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,413
Man, ask Sal, all right?

406
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,519
Hey, Sal, how come you got
no brothers up on the wall here?

407
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,580
You want brothers on the wall?
Get your own place.

408
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,252
You can do what you wanna do.

409
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,297
You can put your brothers and uncles,
nieces and nephews,

410
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,501
your stepfather, stepmother,
whoever you want, you see?

411
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,460
But this is my pizzeria.

412
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,347
American-Italians on the wall only.

413
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,743
- Take it easy, Pop.
- And you...

414
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,929
Hey, don't start with me today.

415
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,019
What?

416
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,181
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,
but you own this.

417
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,647
Rarely do I see
any American-Italians eating in here.

418
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,194
All I see is black folks.

419
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,864
So since we spend much money here,
we do have some say.

420
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,950
Boop.

421
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,913
You lookin' for trouble?

422
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,615
Are you a troublemaker?
Is that what you are?

423
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,088
- You making trouble?
- Yeah, I'm a troublemaker.

424
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,206
I'm making trouble.

425
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,753
You're a real ball-breaker.

426
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,749
Relax. You're always coming in here
looking for trouble, aren't you?

427
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,880
Suppose I busted your head.
How would you...

428
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,431
Oh, Mookie, you want to get
your friend out of here?

429
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,850
What, you gonna kick me out now?
You gonna kick me out?

430
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,178
No, I'm not kicking you out.
You're kicking yourself out.

431
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,041
What? Look, we want some brothers
up on the wall...

432
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,649
You know, Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela,
you know, Michael Jordan!

433
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,736
Tomorrow!

434
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,420
Come on, Mookie.
Get him out. All right?

435
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,341
- I'm trying to get him out!
- Yo, I paid for this.

436
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,482
Take your slice.
I know you paid for it. Let's go.

437
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,471
Yeah, all right, you're kicking me out.
Gonna beat me in the head.

438
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,889
- Gonna kick me out.
- Come on. Let's go.

439
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,913
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right.
Look, I paid for my...

440
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,866
- Look, boycott Sal's! Boycott Sal's.
- Go!

441
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,575
I got your boycott swinging.

442
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,669
Boycott Sal's.

443
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,662
Yo, I paid...
What you laughin' at?

444
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,464
Mookie, I paid for my slice, man.

445
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,416
Yo, man, come on.
I spend much money in there!

446
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,238
- What are you trying to do?
- What am I trying to do?

447
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,240
- What are you trying to do?
- I want brothers up on the wall.

448
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,284
I gotta work here, man.
You're fucking my shit up, man.

449
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,702
And this is between me and Sal, man.

450
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,121
- You're fucking me up.
- I ain't trying to fuck you up, Mook.

451
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,102
You know, I ain't trying to fuck you.
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,430
You're sorry?

453
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,141
Look, come back in a week,
it'll be squashed, all right?

454
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,726
- A week?
- A week.

455
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,071
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right?

456
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,072
- Bet. Bet.
- Bet.

457
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,939
Pizza.

458
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,070
Mook...

459
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,367
Stay black!

460
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,267
I mean, this guy's your friend,
right?

461
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,186
If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
Is he your friend?

462
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,896
- He's my friend.
- Okay, if he don't behave,

463
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,333
I don't want him in here anymore.
He's out.

464
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,038
I can't do nothing with him, Sal.

465
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,465
- You talk some brother talk to him.
- Brother talk?

466
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,969
Look, people are free to do
the hell whatever they want to do.

467
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,513
What free?
What the hell are you talking about? Free?

468
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,807
Free? There's no free here.

469
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,009
I'm the boss.

470
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,890
No freedom. I'm the boss.

471
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,142
You want freedom?
There, that's free.

472
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,002
You take an order, and you take it out.
He's got an order there for you.

473
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,814
Come on, let's go, move.
Come on! Let's go to work here!

474
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,841
- What are you laughing at?
- You're standing here doing nothing.

475
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,857
Him...
You're afraid of the goddamn oven.

476
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,430
- Hit the oven!
- Is this the address?

477
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,200
That's the address.
"Is that the address?"

478
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,745
Is that what he just asked me?
Is that the address?

479
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,499
Mookie.

480
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,131
Come here, doctor.

481
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,968
- Mayor, I got to go. I'm working.
- Come here, doctor.

482
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,670
This is the Mayor talking.

483
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:11,723
All right. All right.

484
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,682
- Doctor?
- Come on, what? What?

485
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,928
Always do the right thing.

486
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,893
- That's it?
- That's it.

487
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,721
I got it. I'm gone.

488
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,899
M-M-Mookie...

489
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,150
How you doin', Smiley?

490
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,356
P-P-Pay...

491
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,409
- t-two d-d-dollars.
- The other one, the other one.

492
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,828
- T-Two d-d-dollars.
- The other one, Smiley.

493
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,157
One-One d-dollar.

494
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,367
That one.
Tonight, when I get paid.

495
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,750
When... When you get p-p...

496
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,083
- Bye, M-Mookie.
- Bye, Smiley!

497
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,177
M-M-M-M-Malcolm.

498
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,173
M-M-M-M-Martin.

499
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,255
M-M-M-M-Martin.

500
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,054
Shit.

501
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,606
Seen your brother this morning.

502
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,399
Yeah, on his way to work, I hope.

503
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,400
This might take a little bit of time,
Mother Sister.

504
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,824
I got nowhere to go.

505
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,368
We haven't had a good sit-down
for a long while.

506
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,454
Mm.

507
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,207
Tender-headed runs in my family.
Are you tender-headed?

508
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,374
Yeah. Me, too.

509
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,751
I don't fool with it.
That's why only you can touch it.

510
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Ouch!

511
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,042
I'm sorry, Mother Sister.
The comb got caught.

512
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,878
Be gentle, child.
Mother Sister's an old woman.

513
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:33,972
Yes, Mother Sister.

514
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,844
Ooh-whee!

515
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,267
I didn't know
you had such beautiful hair.

516
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,436
Fool, there's a lot in this world
you don't know.

517
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,185
I'm not stopping.
I'm on my way.

518
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,530
Mother Sister,
why are you so cruel to Da Mayor?

519
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,823
It isn't right.

520
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,269
I ain't studying no Mayor.

521
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,444
He reminds me
of my least favorite peoples,

522
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,575
my tenant and my ex-husband.

523
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,408
Goddamn! Bless his soul.

524
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,578

Oh, my God!

563
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,217
Did you see that, man?

564
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,391
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

565
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,851
It's Radio. Radio, man.

566
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,356
Hey, what's up, Radio?

567
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,405
What's up Radio?

568
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,871
Don't! Stop! Stop!

569
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,962
Yo! Don't be fucking
with the water now.

570
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,139
Oh, man, go ahead, man.
Go ahead, you got it!

571
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,433
There's going to be
a lot of fucking trouble

572
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,680
if you get this car wet.

573
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,887
Ain't nobody fucking around, man.

574
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,222
Why don't you just go ahead?

575
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,308
This is an antique there, hotshot.

576
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,063
Man, go ahead!
It's a what?

577
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,985
Hey, man, I'm...
I'm serious, man!

578
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,188
All right.
Okay, you won't get wet, man.

579
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,614
Yeah, well, make sure I don't.

580
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,927
- Go ahead!
- You're not gonna...

581
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,429
- Just hurry up, man. Damn.
- Drive the car!

582
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,534
All right, I'm driving it.

583
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,765
You ain't got no business
in this neighborhood, anyway!

584
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,810
- Get out! Get out, motherfucker!
- Come on, let's go!

585
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,497
- Hey, fuck you back!
- Turn the fucking water. Turn the water!

586
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,670
Go!

587
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,472
Those son of a bitches!

588
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,720
They got me fucking soaked!

589
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,177
Officer! Officer, wait a minute.
Hold it!

590
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,354
I want an arrest made right now!

591
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,709
- Right now!
- What's the matter?

592
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,793
- I'm fuckin' soaked!
- Calm down.

593
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,754
Would you please calm down, sir?
Tell us what happened.

594
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,191
Two black kids,
they soaked me with the fire hydrant.

595
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,567
They ruined my car! Look!
This is an antique!

596
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,618
- They got me fuckin' soaked!
- So where are they?

597
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,697
Where are they?
Brilliant fucking question!

598
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,097
- Where are they?
- They ran away!

599
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,282
Where do you think they are?

600
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,333
- Do you wish to file a complaint, sir?
- Yeah, I want to file a complaint.

601
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,454
I want 'em locked under the fucking jail.

602
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,147
Hey, Marco,
I'm gonna turn off the water, okay?

603
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,504
- Yeah.
- Where you going? Where's he going?

604
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,360
Did you happen to catch the name
of the suspect, sir?

605
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,252
Officer,
what the fuck are you doing?

606
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,489
- Fuck that hydrant.
- Just calm down.

607
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,407
- Calm down, my ass!
- Did you happen to catch the name?

608
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,431
Fuck you, their names!

609
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,223
Moe and Joe!
What do I know their names?

610
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,425
Moe and Joe what, sir?

611
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,637
Moe and Joe what?
Moe and Joe what?

612
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,143
Moe and Joe Black.
How's that?

613
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,269
They're brothers, sir?

614
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,212
Yeah, they're brothers.
Yeah, they're fucking brothers.

615
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,195
This hydrant
better not come back on again,

616
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,572
or there's going to be hell to pay!

617
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,650
Come answer to me, goddamn it!

618
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,359
Ask him. He knows.

619
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,445
He's a witness.
He saw the whole fucking thing!

620
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,246
Go on, man.
Tell him what happened.

621
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,972
Would you let us do
the questioning, sir?

622
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,913
Fucking bullshit.

623
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,587
- You know anything about this?
- Who were the punks?

624
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:05,344
Doctors, those that'll tell don't know,

625
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,718
and those that know won't tell.

626
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,638
- What the fuck is that? Voodoo shit?
- Wise guy.

627
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,721
Hey, Mayor don't know nothin',
all right?

628
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,681
Hey! He's leaving?

629
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,982
Keep this hydrant off.
Huh?

630
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,559
You wanna swim?
Go to Coney Island.

631
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,316
Ho, I'm talking to you!
He's leaving? What about me?

632
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,274
- What about you?
- I suggest you get to your car quick,

633
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,529
before these people start
to strip it clean.

634
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,326
Have a nice day, sir.

635
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,959
He left there about a half hour ago?

636
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,289
No, no problem. Thank you.
Yeah, half hour, right.

637
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,624
Mookie left...
Where the hell you been, Mookie?

638
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,755
I got a business to run, okay?

639
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,881
Run it then, all right?

640
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,592
- Take that to the radio station.
- To Love Daddy?

641
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,844
Yeah, Love Daddy.

642
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,891
Hey, Pop, I'm going
to go with Mookie, okay?

643
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,439
Yeah. You make sure
Mookie don't jerk around.

644
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,141
- Wait up, Mook!
- Oh, where you going?

645
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,235
You ain't going anywhere.

646
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
- Where the hell you going?
- How you doing?

647
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:10,320
Vito, I know Pino's your brother and shit,
but you should kick his ass.

648
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,697
The next time he touches you,
you should kick his ass.

649
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,280
- Whoa, whoa!
- The next time he hits you, fuck him up!

650
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,831
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, yo, Mook.

651
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,160
I mean, I appreciate this concern,
and all,

652
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,620
but I don't think
it's any of your business, really.

653
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,252
I know it's none of my business,
but you need to kick his ass.

654
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,628
Smiley, not now.

655
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,261
If I had a brother like him,
we'd be fighting all the time.

656
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,667
- Look, first of all...
- Smiley!

657
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,637
First of all, Mook,
you don't got a brother like him.

658
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,093
Smiley, get out of here!

659
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,790
First of all,
you don't got a brother like him.

660
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,458
If you did, you wouldn't know
what to do with him

661
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,959
because you never had
a brother like him.

662
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,586
He's my brother.
I'm not going to hit him.

663
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,570
- I got a sister.
- You never clocked your sister.

664
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,104
- But I got a sister.
- Does she bug you like Pino bugs me?

665
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,301
Yeah, but you're not supposed to hit
a girl like you hit a guy.

666
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,969
- All right.
- Just fuck your brother up one time.

667
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,236
It'll be over with, we'll be out of
this fucking conversation, all right?

668
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,122
You think it might do some good?

669
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,700
Yes, all right?
A lot of good.

670
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,581
Let's give...
Love Daddy!

671
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,631
Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling,
but help has arrived.

672
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,209
My main man Mookie has saved the day!

673
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,467
Straight from Sal's Famous Pizzeria
up the block.

674
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,765
Step up to the mike, Mookie.

675
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,264
Come on. Come on!
Don't be shy.

676
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,265
Mmm, this smells good.

677
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,688
Go ahead.
This is your Love Daddy talking,

678
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,357
Starvin' like Marvin.
Say something to the people.

679
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,811
All right, Love Daddy.
I'd like to dedicate this record

680
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:32,069
with all my heart and soul...
to Tina.

681
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,072
All right!
Let me put this song on

682
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,950
while I go to work
on this chicken parmigiana hero

683
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,703
with extra cheese
and extra s-sauce.

684
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,757
Yo, Stevie, man.
Chill, man.

685
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,280
- Shut up, man. I'm trying to read.
- Have some fucking respect, huh?

686
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,904
- It's just a bad dream, man.
- What'd you hit me in the neck for?

687
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,180
It's just a bad dream, man.

688
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,436
Yo, man, lower that, man!

689
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:18,486
- I want to listen to my salsa music!
- Chill! Chill! Chill!

690
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,788
You think you got it like that, bro?
<i>¿Chocolate?</i>

691
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,328
Let's go, motherfucker!

692
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,250
Turn it up, Stevie, baby!

693
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,296
- Blow it, man, blow it!
- Yeah, blow it away!

694
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,734
Turn it up, Stevie!

695
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,920
- Yeah, Yeah!
- Turn up the bongos!

696
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,502
Oh, yeah!

697
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,806
Salsa!

698
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,521
- Yo, Steve! Put it up louder, Steve.
- Yeah, man!

699
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,529
<i>Pendejo!</i>
Yeah, what's up?

700
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,694
You got it, bro.

701
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,868
Hey, <i>pendejo!</i>

702
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,288
Come on, Steve, man.

703
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,083
You're dead, choco-man.

704
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,712
He's a punk anyway, man.

705
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,386
Yo, <i>pendejo!</i>

706
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,299
What's up?

707
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,977
He's a sucker, man. He's a punk.
He's a sucker, man.

708
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,555
- See that game last night?
- Uh-huh. I saw it.

709
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,060
Best pitcher in the game...

710
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,146
Dwight Gooden.

711
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,339
- I knew you were gonna bring that up.
- Who's better?

712
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,820
You know Roger Clemens is better.

713
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,274
Clemens sucks, man.
He can't carry Dwight's jock.

714
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,221
- Oh, man. How can you say...
- Dwight's best in the game.

715
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,765
- Who won consecutive Cy Young Awards?
- Dwight's best in the game.

716
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,371
- What's up, Buggin' Out?
- Got you.

717
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,823
- What's happening?
- You the man.

718
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,144
- No, you the man.
- No, you the man.

719
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,168
No, you the man.

720
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,981
- No, you the man.
- No, I'm a struggling black man

721
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,497
trying to keep my dick hard
in a cruel and harsh world.

722
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,799
Yo, hey, what's up
with the white boy?

723
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,625
Buggin' Out, don't start no shit,
all right?

724
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,758
Vito's down.
Vito's down, all right?

725
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,089
- All right?
- Yeah, right.

726
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,048
- Vito's down.
- Yeah.

727
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,259
Phew.

728
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,061
Yo!

729
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,782
Damn.

730
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,941
Yo!

731
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,952
Yeah?

732
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,585
You almost knocked me down.
Man, the word is, "Excuse me."

733
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,858
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Not onlyjust knocked me down,

734
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,841
you stepped on my brand-new
white Air Jordans I just bought.

735
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,606
And that's all you can say is,
"Excuse me?"

736
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,239
- What, you're serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

737
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,143
- I'll fuck you up quick two times!
- Two times!

738
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,409
Who told you to step
on my sneakers?

739
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,493
Who told you
to walk on my side of the block?

740
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,912
- Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
- I own this brownstone.

741
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,100
Who told you to buy a brownstone
on my block, in my neighborhood

742
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,056
on my side of the street?

743
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,503
What do you want to live
in a black neighborhood for, anyway, man?

744
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,189
- Motherfuck gentrification.
- Well?

745
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,441
As I understand it,
this is a free country.

746
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,509
- A man can live wherever he wants.
- Free country.

747
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,594
Free country?

748
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,361
Man, I should fuck you up for saying
that stupid shit alone!

749
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,037
Yo, man,
your Jordans are fucked up!

750
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,615
Damn, man. You might
as well throw them shits out.

751
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,870
Them shits is broke!

752
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,438
They looked good before
he messed them up.

753
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,455
He did this shit on purpose, man.
He was even talking about your mama.

754
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,610
I heard that shit, too.
Man, they used to be so fine!

755
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,737
- Yo, man, how much you pay for 'em?
- A hundred bucks!

756
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,718
- American dollars.
- $108 with tax.

757
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,407
- I'd give him 100 headaches.
- Look, you're lucky

758
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,172
the black man has a loving heart.

759
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,952
Next time you see me coming,
you cross the street.

760
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,736
- I'm out of here.
- Yo, man, break his feet!

761
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,612
- Damn, my brand-new Jordans!
- Take his bike!

762
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,041
I should make you
buy me another pair!

763
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,931
- Black Panther, whip his ass!
- Take his bike!

764
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,170
- Man, kick his ass!
- You're lucky I'm a righteous black man!

765
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,277
Otherwise, you'd be
in serious trouble, man! Serious!

766
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,026
- Fuck him up!
- Man, let's fuck him up.

767
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,927
Man, why don't you
move back to Massachusetts?

768
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,658
I was born in Brooklyn.

769
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,038
Get outta here!

770
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,874
I should send Vito
with you all the time.

771
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,834
Yeah. No more 90-minute deliveries
around the corner.

772
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,667
Pino, I work hard like
everybody else in here, all right?

773
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,251
You know that's true, Pino.

774
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,221
Vito, come here.

775
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,807
Come here.

776
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,349
What's going on between you two?

777
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,839
You guys boyfriend and girlfriend
or something? Something I don't know?

778
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,354
- What'd we just talk about?
- What?

779
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,028
- What did we just talk about?
- What are you talking about?

780
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,075
- Smack him.
- Hey! Hey!

781
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,449
Any smacking around here
is gonna be done by me.

782
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,575
You gonna listen to this <i>shagamay,</i>
listen to him tell you to smack me,

783
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,669
your older brother?

784
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,548
Just remember who you are,
all right?

785
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,093
Your name is Vito Frangione,
not Vito Muhammad.

786
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,588
Huh?

787
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,022
I would love for you
to stay out of my business.

788
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,025
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, okay?

789
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,605
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?

790
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,030
What Muhammad shit?

791
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,904
Look...
Don't fuck me, all right?

792
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,615
Oh, man.

793
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,614
Fuck, man.

794
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,666
I hate this place.
I hate this place.

795
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,890
What a waste.

796
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,648
As I was saying before we were
so rudely interrupted

797
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:26,104
- by New York City's finest...
- What was you saying?

798
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,109
The motherfucker wasn't saying shit.

799
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,532
Yeah. Look at that.

800
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,571
Look at what?

801
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,075
It's a goddamn shame.

802
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,076
What's a goddamn shame?

803
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,328
- Sweet Dick Willie.
- That's my name.

804
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,910
Goddamn, man,
do I have to spell it out?

805
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,496
Come on, man,
make it plain.

806
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,674
Okay, but listen up.
I'm going to break it down.

807
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,250
Let it be broke, motherfucker.

808
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,960
- Can you dig it?
- It's dug.

809
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,469
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street.

810
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,433
I bet you they haven't been
off the boat a year

811
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,831
before they opened up
their own place.

812
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,142
That's right, man.
It's been about a year.

813
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,269
A motherfuckin' year
off the motherfuckin' boat,

814
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,817
and they already got a business
in our neighborhood.

815
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,361
A good business...

816
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,065
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

817
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,071
for longer than I care to remember,

818
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,904
and I've been here a long time.

819
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,364
- Yeah, he been here a long time.
- Hey, boy.

820
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,450
And now, for the life of me...

821
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,623
You know,
I can't figure this out.

822
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:27,252
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses...

823
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,257
or you black asses are
just plain dumb.

824
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,181
Fuck you.

825
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,178
It's got to be because we're black.

826
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,726
Ain't no other explanation.
No, no, I know, man.

827
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,724
You know it's true.
Ain't they always trying

828
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,334
to keep the black man
to be about shit!

829
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,941
Oh, oh!
You motherfuckers hold that shit down.

830
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,690
I'm tired of that old excuse.
I'm tired of hearing that shit.

831
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,692
- Shit.
- You know, I tell you. I swear, man,

832
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,617
I will be one happy fool
when we open our own business

833
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,443
right here in our neighborhood.

834
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,871
I swear to God.
I will be first in line to spend

835
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,936
- what little money I got.
- I'll be right there with you, man.

836
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,453
You motherfuckers are always talking
that old Keith Sweat shit...

837
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,209
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that."

838
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,589
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
but sit your monkey ass on this corner.

839
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,796
Hey, ML,
when you gonna get your business?

840
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,055
Huh?
Yeah, just like I thought.

841
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,677
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing.

842
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,634
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Hear me?

843
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,915
I'm gonna go there and give them
Koreans more of my money.

844
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,682
Fuck outta my way, goddamn.
It's Miller time, motherfuckers.

845
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,233
Old moose head fuckers
telling me what to do.

846
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,959
And Coconut,
you got a lot of damn nerve.

847
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,988
You got off the boat, too.
Hell, leave me alone. Shoot.

848
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,442
Hey, Kung Fu! Come on.
Give me one of them damn beers, damn it.

849
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,597
- What? No more free beer.
- Get your ass in there and serve me some.

850
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,099
- No more free beer.
- Don't be pushing on me, baby.

851
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,989
- Hey, man, no more free beer.
- I'll drop you.

852
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,811
- Don't start no shit with me.
- Mr. Sweet Dick.

853
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,542
That's right.
Sweet Dick Willie is my name.

854
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,628
That's my name.

855
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,501
It's a motherfuckin' shame.

856
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,756
Man, ain't that a bitch?

857
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,174
- Hey, doctor. What's your name?
- Eddie.

858
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,679
- How old are you?
- Ten.

859
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,806
Question: What makes Sammy run?

860
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,139
- I said my name is Eddie.
- What makes Sammy run?

861
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,226
- My name is Eddie Lovell.
- Relax.

862
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,106
Eddie,
I want you to go to the store for me.

863
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,687
Question: How much is it gonna cost?

864
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,551
How am I supposed to know
how much it's gonna cost

865
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,055
if I don't even know
what I'm buying?

866
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,701
Eddie, you're too smart
for your own britches.

867
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,747
Now listen to me. How much do you want
to go to the corner store for Da Mayor?

868
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,291
- Fifty cents.
- You got a deal. Here.

869
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,337
I want you to get me a quart of beer.
Miller High Life.

870
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,257
Anybody bother you, say it's
for your bedridden, old granddaddy.

871
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,958
Now, go on. Go!

872
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,470
What is wrong with him, man?

873
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,548
He ain't be giving nobody no money.

874
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,758
- Leave the man alone.
- Look at this here, man.

875
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,788
- This is nice, man.
- You need to cut this shit out.

876
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,812
Man, who told you
you were the mayor of this block?

877
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,389
Shit, he's self-appointed.

878
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,566
- Man, leave the man alone. Damn.
- Shut up!

879
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,392
- Yeah, yeah, look, look, look.
- Damn.

880
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,446
- Y'all leave me the hell alone.
- Ah, man.

881
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,067
I ain't going out like that, man.

882
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,927
You walk up and down this block
like you own it.

883
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,238
For real, His Honor.

884
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,057
You're so old,
you're like a fossil.

885
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,870
Yo, man, you're a bum, man.
You're an old drunk zero, man.

886
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,559
Now what do you got to say
for yourself?

887
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,703
What you know about me?

888
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,671
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you.

889
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,215
What you know about anything?

890
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,053
Unless you...

891
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,255
Unless you done stood
in the door...

892
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,642
and listened to your five hungry children
crying for bread.

893
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,353
And you can't do
a damn thing about it.

894
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,022
Your woman standing there...
You can't even look her in the eye.

895
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,978
Unless you done that, you don't know me,
my pain, my hurt, my feelings.

896
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,154
- You don't know shit!
- Oh, man!

897
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,384
- Let the old man finish.
- Don't call me bum.

898
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,024
Don't call me a drunk.

899
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,411
Y'all ain't got the sense
that God give a billy goat!

900
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,410
Don't call me nothing!
It's disrespectful.

901
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,742
I know your mamas and your papas
raised you better.

902
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,374
Yo, man, I hope you finished
your little soliloquy, man,

903
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,297
'cause first of all,
I been peeing straight for years.

904
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,527
You understand what I'm saying?

905
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,883
And you're right.

906
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,007
I wouldn't stand in the doorway
listening to my five children go hungry.

907
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,635
I'd be out getting a job,
doing something, anything,

908
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,844
to put food in their mouths.

909
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,774
And you're right.
I don't wanna know your pain.

910
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,094
I don't care to know your pain.

911
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,429
You're the one that put yourself
in this situation, man.

912
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:14,733
Every day... Every day, I see you walk up
and down this block, inebriated.

913
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,171
- Chill, man.
- Never sober!

914
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,923
- He's an old man.
- But that's what D-A stands for.

915
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,404
"Da" Mayor... drunk ass.

916
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,571
Man, come on!

917
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,469
- Fuck that! This man's getting me mad!
- Ahmad, Ahmad!

918
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,972
He don't get no respect! He ain't never
gonna get respect here, boy!

919
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,765
How you gonna tell me
how my parents raised me?

920
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,327
- I respect those who respect themselves!
- Ahmad! Come on, man!

921
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,146
He's not gonna respect himself as someone
who drinks like a fuckin' fool!

922
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,251
Tina, I know
I haven't seen you in four days.

923
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,278
- I'm a working man.
<i>- Uh, that's really nice,</i>

924
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,544
<i>but you know, I work, too,
and I seem to make time.</i>

925
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,096
What do you want me to do, huh?

926
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,391
<i>I want you to spend some time
with me and Hector!</i>

927
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,685
<i>I want you to try
and make this relationship work.</i>

928
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,354
<i>If not, I'd rather not be bothered
with your ass.</i>

929
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,855
<i>- Mookie, you are too, too tired.</i>
- All right, all right. Damn.

930
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,651
I'll be over sometime today.

931
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,070
<i>You always say later!</i>

932
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,022
Later, say, if I get off work.

933
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,278
<i>Bring some ice cream.
I'm burning up.</i>

934
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,281
<i>Mookie, do you love me?</i>

935
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,994
- Do I love you?
- Mookie, get off the phone!

936
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,208
Be off in a second, all right, Sal?
Do I love you?

937
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,711
I dedicated a record
on Love Daddy's show to you.

938
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,086
<i>So what?</i>

939
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,295
How's anybody going to call in,
Mookie?

940
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,005
- All right!
<i>- My God, you probably wasted...</i>

941
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,467
You know, if that ain't love,
you're crazy.

942
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,802
Are you deaf or what?

943
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,309
Pino, I'm talking on the phone.

944
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,856
I can see that.

945
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,730
Tina, I gotta go.

946
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,435
Yeah, Pino's an asshole.

947
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,942
I'll see you later today.
Later!

948
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,615
Everybody happy?

949
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,701
Sal's Famous.

950
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,305
- <i>Yeah, delivery.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

951
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:53,165
- You got two large anchovy and pepperoni.
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

952
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,208
Okay. Just hold on one second.

953
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,786
See, Daddy?
Mookie's fucking talking on the phone,

954
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,667
people are trying to call in orders.

955
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,248
He's making us lose business.

956
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,628
Mookie!

957
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,461
Twenty minutes.

958
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,466
How come niggers are so stupid?

959
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,132
If you see a nigger,
kick his ass.

960
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,092
Fuck you,
and stay off the phone.

961
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,178
Hey, Mookie.
Forget about it.

962
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,514
Can I talk to you for a second?

963
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,278
What?

964
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,524
Pino, who's your
favorite basketball player?

965
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,990
Magic Johnson.

966
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,612
- Who's your favorite movie star?
- Eddie Murphy.

967
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,068
Who's your favorite rock star?

968
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,490
Prince. You're a Prince freak.

969
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,412
- Boss. Bruce.
- Prince.

970
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,499
Bruce.

971
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,326
Pino, all you talk about is
nigger this and nigger that.

972
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,420
And all your favorite people
are so-called niggers.

973
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,997
It's different.
Magic, Eddie, Prince...

974
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,586
are not niggers.

975
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,834
I mean, they're not black.
I mean...

976
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,013
Let me explain myself.

977
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,588
They're...
They're not really black.

978
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,077
I mean, they're black,
but they're not really black.

979
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,559
They're more than black.
It's different.

980
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,388
- It's different?
- Yeah. To me, it's different.

981
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,626
Pino, deep down inside,
I think you wish you were black.

982
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,233
Get the fuck out of here.

983
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,484
Laugh if you want to. You know,
your hair is kinkier than mine.

984
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,818
What does that mean?

985
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,400
And you know what they say
about dark Italians.

986
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,953
You know,
I been listening and reading...

987
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,123
- You been reading now?
- I read.

988
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,584
I've been reading about your leaders.

989
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,504
Reverend Al "Mister 'Do" Sharpton.

990
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,253
Jesse. "Keep hope alive."

991
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,335
- That's fucked up.
- "Keep hope alive."

992
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,135
Hey, that's fucked.
Don't talk about Jesse.

993
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,588
And even the other guy,
what's his name?

994
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,218
Faraman, Fairakan...

995
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,345
Minister Farrakhan.

996
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,435
Right. Sorry.

997
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,431
Minister Farrakhan.

998
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,765
Anyway, Minister Farrakhan
always talks about the so-called day

999
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,022

What does he say?

1001
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,027
"We will one day rule the Earth
as we did in our glorious past."

1002
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,824
- Yeah, that's right.
- What past you talkin' about?

1003
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,911
I mean, what did I miss?

1004
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,535
We started civilization.

1005
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,410
Man, keep dreaming, man.
Then you woke up!

1006
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,870
Pino, fuck you. Fuck your fucking pizza,
and fuck Frank Sinatra.

1007
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,956
Yeah? Well, fuck you, too,

Time out!

1032
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,282
Y'all, take a chill!

1033
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,281
Ya need to cool that shit out!

1034
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,910
And that's the double truth, Ruth!

1035
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,410
Sal, can you do me a favor?

1036
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,624
That depends, Mookie.

1037
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,796
Can you pay me now?

1038
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
I can't do that.

1039
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,048
Sal, just this once.
Can't you do me a solid, man?

1040
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,380
No. Tonight when we close.

1041
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,554
Sal, I want to get paid now.

1042
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,432
Look, you know you get paid tonight
when we close.

1043
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,184
All right? We're still open.

1044
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,982
All right, if I pay you now,
I won't see you tonight.

1045
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,525
That's a bet.

1046
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,228
Yeah, that's a bet, huh.

1047
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,591
I'm going to remember that, Sal.

1048
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,652
You got to do what you got to do,
you know?

1049
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,823
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,197
- I'm gonna remember that.
- I want you to remember that.

1051
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,870
Please do me a favor, huh, Mook?
Remember that.

1052
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,552
Come on, Sal.

1053
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,800
I can't.

1054
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,932
Radio Raheem!

1055
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,025
Mook.

1056
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,313
What's happening?

1057
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,144
- It's your world.
- Where you headed to?

1058
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,026
I'm going to get a slice.

1059
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,481
- You going down to Sal's?
- Word.

1060
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,113
I gotta make a few deliveries,
and I'll check you back there.

1061
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,240
- On the rebound.
- Bet. All right.

1062
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,664
Oh, shit! Let me check it out.

1063
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,126
- That's the hype!
- Newest latest.

1064
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,751
Let me tell you the story
of right hand/left hand.

1065
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,131
It's a tale of good and evil.

1066
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,926
Hate.

1067
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,255
It was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother.

1068
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,425
Love.

1069
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,308
These five fingers,
they go straight to the soul of man.

1070
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,853
The right hand... the hand of love.

1071
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,853
The story of life is this.

1072
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,156
Static.

1073
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,028
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

1074
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,701
and the left hand is kicking much ass.

1075
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,584
I mean, it looks like the right hand,
love, is finished.

1076
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,377
But hold on.
Stop the presses.

1077
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,295
The right hand's coming back.

1078
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,920
Yeah, he got the left hand
on the ropes now.

1079
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,842
That's right. Yeah. Ooh!

1080
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,296
It's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt and down!

1081
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,883
Ooh! Ooh! Left hand, hate,
K.O.'d by love.

1082
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,684
If I love you, I love you.

1083
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,939
But if I hate you...

1084
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,112
There it is, love and hate.

1085
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,444
- I love you, brother.
- Bet.

1086
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,116

Mookie,
how come you're not at Sal's?

1127
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,120
I'm working.

1128
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,670
What's this, Mookie? Another one
of your patented two-hour lunch breaks?

1129
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,668
I wanted to come home
and take a quick shower.

1130
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,466
- Hey, Sal's gonna get mad.
- You know, later for Sal.

1131

- and I'm your brother.
- Yeah.

1133
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,182
Yeah, Mookie, that's real smart.
You know, Sal pays you, Mookie.

1134
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,246
That's why you should work.
You ever think about that?

1135
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,710
Yeah, I work.

1143
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,236
Why don't you take better care of those?

- Yeah, take a shower.

Don't be yelling at me, now.

it's hot as a motherfucker.

1199
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,704
- Why don't you fan me with your ears?
- Stop playin'!

1200
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,911
Leave it alone.

1201
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,167
- Why y'all think everything is a joke?
- Man, shut up.

1202
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,214
Chill, man.
It's too hot for that.

1203
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,573
That's why I asked you
what you want to do.

1204
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,304
We don't have money
to do anything.

1205
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,361
I'm beat.

1206
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,860
Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking.

1207
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,788
Maybe we should sell this place.

1208
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,542
Get out while we're still ahead...
and alive.

1209
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,128
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?

1210
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,718
Maybe we could...
Couldn't we sell this

1211
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:39,343
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1212
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,930
There's too many pizzerias
already there.

1213
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,761
Then maybe we could try
something different.

1214
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,097
What am I gonna do?
That's all I know.

1215
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,352
What am I doing?
I been here 25 years.

1216
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,934
Where am I going?

1217
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,821
I'm sick of niggers.

1218
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,821
It's like I come to work,
it's <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

1219
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,327
I don't like being around them.
They're animals.

1220
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,872
Why you got so much anger in you?

1221
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,798
Why? I'll tell you why.
My friends, they laugh at me.

1222
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,297
They laugh right in my face.

1223
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,471
They tell me, "Go. Go to Bed-Stuy.
Go, go feed the moulies."

1224
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,556
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1225
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,724
Food on your table?

1226
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,228
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head? Huh?

1227
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,606
They're not your friends.

1228
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,068
If they were your friends,
they wouldn't laugh at you.

1229
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,489
Pop, what can I say?
I don't want to be here.

1230
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,204
They don't want us here.

1231
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,202
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

1232
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,244
in Bensonhurst,
and niggers should stay in theirs.

1233
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,704
I never had no trouble
with these people.

1234
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,632
I sat in this window, I...

1235
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,386
I watch these little kids get old.

1236
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,890
And I seen the old people get older.

1237
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,392
Yeah, sure, some of them don't like us,
but most of them do.

1238
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,308
I mean, for Christ sake, Pino,
they grew up on my food.

1239
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,442
On my food.

1240
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,858
Now, I'm very proud of that.

1241
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,907
You may think it's funny,
but I'm very proud of that.

1242
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,787
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh...

1243
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,455
Sal's Famous Pizzeria
is here to stay.

1244
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,998
I'm sorry.

1245
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,459
I'm your father,
and I love you.

1246
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,961
I'm sorry, but...

1247
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,672
but that's the way it is.

1248
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,689
Hey, S-Sal.

1249
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,267
- Hey, S-Sal.
- How you doing?

1250
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:59,403

1251
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,731
Get out.

1252
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,161
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1253
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,113
Get the fuck out of here!

1255
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,540
Sal.

1256
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,920
Come on. Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1257
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,690

1258
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,220
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, what?

1259
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,594
Oh, yeah?
Get a fucking job, man!

1260
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,801
Why don't you get a fucking job,
man?

1261
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,887
Go to fucking work!

1262
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,017
- Fuck you, man.
- S-S-Sal.

1263
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,769
Get out, man. Get out!

1264
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,020
See what I'm saying?

1265
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,523
Leave that boy alone, man.
You know he ain't right!

1266
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,947
- Goddamn!
- Get a fucking job, man!

1267
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,899
- I'm sick of this shit.
- You get a job!

1268
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,736
Huh? What? I got a job.
I got a job, man.

1269
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,266
- Bring your ass over here, punk!
- No, I ain't going over there.

1270
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,622
I got no reason to go over there.

1271
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,121
- F-F-F-Fuck...
- I got no reason to go over there.

1272
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,794

Hey, Willie, take it easy.
He didn't mean nothin'.

1281
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,644
- Okay?

1282
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,726
- Fuck you!
- This is what I'm talking about.

1283
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,978
Whoo!

1284
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,359
Let's go, Jade!

1285
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,109
Da Mayor, we need your leadership.

1286
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:32,368
- Doctor, what are you talking about?
- I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous.

1287
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,332
Shit.
Keep walking, doctor.

1288
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,502
I don't want to hear none
of your damn black foolishness.

1289
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,329
Damn. No juice.

1290
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,218
No, man, no.

1291
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,213
No!

1292
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,968
Hell, no, goddamn it.

1293
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,596
Sal ain't never done nothin' to you
before, man, and me neither.

1294
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,645
Hear me? What you ought to do
is boycott that goddamn barber

1295
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,768
that fucked up your head.

1296
01:02:58,858 --> 01:02:59,858
Shit.

1297
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,151
Come around here,
fuckin' with Sweet Dick Willie.

1298
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,923
- Go on, man. Get out.
- Get the fuck away.

1299
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:04,947
Go on, beat it.

1300
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,343
Would you sign a petition
to boycott Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1301
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,528
- What?
- What?

1302
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,827
Man, I ain't boycottin' jack,
you string-cheese head motherfucker.

1303
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,700
I'm about to go get a slice right now.

1304
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,747
Shit, I was born and raised
on Sal's pizza.

1305
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,621
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Shit.

1306
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,623
You crazy, man?

1307
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,545
As good as them motherfuckin' pizzas is?

1308
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,463
Black Panther eat pizza,
we eat pizza.

1309
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,416
- Boy!
- Yo, I heard you.

1310
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,376
I'll do it without your help.

1311
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,553
That's 75 cents.

1312
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,721
- Thanks.
- Thanks, hon.

1313
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,767
Sal! We're going to boycott
your fat pasta ass.

1314
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,140
You're gonna boy...
You're going to boycott me?

1315
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,643
You haven't got the balls
to boycott me.

1316
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,816
He's going to boycott me.
Are you kidding?

1317
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,063
Get... Here's your...
Here! Here's your boycott.

1318
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,237
Up your ass.
You're going to boycott.

1319
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,737
Here... Where you going?
Oh! Where you going?

1320
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,034
- I'm talking to you, Pino!
- I'm right here.

1321
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,954
All right, go inside.
I can take care of myself, all right?

1322
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,101
- Take it easy, all right?
- No, I want you to go inside.

1323
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,209
Here's your boycott! Up here!
Son of a bitch.

1324
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,413
Messed up my Jordans with muck.

1325
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,920
Damn!

1326
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,252
Get this thing straightened out, man.

1327
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,714
White boy, black man.
I can't believe this crap.

1328
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,220
- Ah, your Jordans are dogged!
- Oh, man! You, too?

1329
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,972
- Well, stop.
- Yeah, me, too.

1330
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,894
Oh, you hangin' out with baby sis.

1331
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,767
Look, Buggin' Out,
we're not hangin' out.

1332
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,895
- She's escortin' me back to Sal's.
- Stop lying. That's not even true.

1333
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,772
- I'm just goin' to get a slice.
- A slice?

1334
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,945
Yo, yo, Jade, you can't do that.
Not today.

1335
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,944
You don't know this, but I'm organizing
a boycott of Sal's Famous.

1336
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,570
Why? What'd he do?

1337
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,947
You know them pictures
he got on the wall of fame?

1338
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,280
- So?
- So? Wake up.

1339
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,867
- Don't you notice somethin' about them?
- No, Buggin' Out, I haven't.

1340
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,828
You know, you're wasting my time.
Just leave that shit alone.

1341
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,816
- You should. You really should.
- Hey, yo, Mook!

1342
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,297
- I'm gone.
- I'll see you there.

1343
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,500
Stay black, Mook.

1344
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,339
- So, Buggin' Out, how you been?
- How I been?

1345
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,637
Every single one of them pictures
is somebody Italian.

1346
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,591
- And?
- And we want some black people up.

1347
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,927
- So did you ask Sal?
- Yeah, I asked him.

1348
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,935
We don't want nobody in there,
nobody spending good money in Sal's,

1349
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,233
until we get black motherfucking pictures
on that wall.

1350
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,151
Buggin' Out,
what good is that gonna do, huh?

1351
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,234
You know, if you really tried hard,
Buggin' Out,

1352
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,594
you could direct your energies
in a more useful way, you know?

1353
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,860
Jade, you got to be down.
What, you ain't down?

1354
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:20,198
Yeah, Buggin' Out, I'm down, but I'm down
for something positive in the community.

1355
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,291
Are you down for that?

1356
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,958
Jade.

1357
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,505
Jade, I still love you anyway.

1358
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,334
Yeah, I still love you, too,
Buggin' Out.

1359
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,464
I'll see you later, man.

1360
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,511
Later. Damn.

1361
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,173
Man.

1362
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,218
You're pushing it, Mookie.

1363
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,348
You're really pushing it.

1364
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,353
I don't pay you good money
to have you jerk me around.

1365
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,963
Now, you keep it up,
you're gonna end up in the street

1366
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,354
with the rest of your homeboys.

1367
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,615
About time, Pop.

1368
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,165
Jade.

1369
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,036
- How you doin', Jade?
- Great.

1370
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,043
- Where you been?
- Just working hard. Keeping busy.

1371
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,874
- How's business going?
- Business is great.

1372
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,802
We were wondering when you
were gonna stop by and pay us a visit.

1373
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,761
- How's my brother doing?
- Well, he's, uh... Mookie is...

1374
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,887
He's great.
You know, he's a good kid.

1375
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,014
- Hey, Pop. Stop lying.
- Thanks.

1376
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,640
- He's only kidding, Jade.
- I know.

1377
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,893
- What can I fix you?
- Regular slice.

1378
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,521
No, no, I'm going to make you
something special,

1379
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,213
something very special,
if you don't mind.

1380
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,399
Yeah, no, that'd be great.
That'd be great.

1381
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,301
- Okay, what do you want to drink?
- Cream soda.

1382
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,191
Changed,
it used to be root beer.

1383
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,071
If I'm wrong, tell me if I'm wrong.

1384
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,119
I know.
I want a change of pace, you know.

1385
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,867
Hey, Vito, clean off the table
for Jade, okay?

1386
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,167
All right, Pop.

1387
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,666
Come here, Jade. Sit here.
This is the best booth.

1388
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,962

Twenty C Energizers?

1394
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,022
D. Not C. D.

1395
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,447
C Energizers?

1396
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,196

01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,177
Twenty D fuckin' batteries.

Hey, wait.
Yo, wait, wait, wait.

1405
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,075
- What's the date on them, man?
- Motherfuck...

1406
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,011
What's the date on them?

1407
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,514
- The date! The fuckin' date!
- What?

1408
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,437
Can you fuckin' speak English?
The date!

1409
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,105
- Date?
- Date. Date.

01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,812
- They're Marcha!
- Marcha?

1411
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,005
- Motherfuck...
- What you talkin' about, Marcha?

1412
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,029
1991.

1413
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,774
Oh, March.
That's March, motherfucker, March.

1414
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,904
Yo, man, you sure that's 20?

1415
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,078
- Twenty.
- No, man. No, no, no. Take 'em out, man.

1416
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,996
Count 'em again.

1417
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,869
Count the shits again, man.

1418
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,279
Motherfucker.

1419
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,055
May I help you?

1420
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:34,145
I want some flowers.

1421
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,236
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

1422
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,982
- It's very expensive.
- I know. I'll pay.

1423
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,761
I thought you might like these.

1424
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,634
I guess not.

1425
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:14,390
There is nothing like
the smell of fresh flowers.

1426
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,975
Don't you agree, Mother Sister?

1427
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,401
Summertime...
All you can smell is the garbage.

1428
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,525
Smell overpowers everything,

1429
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:27,487
especially the soft,
sweet smell of flowers.

1430
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,572
You don't mind,
I'm gonna sit right here,

1431
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,785
catch myself a breeze or two,
and then I'll be on my way.

1432
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,920
Thank the Lord,
the sun is going down.

1433
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,878
It is hot as blazes.

1434
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,092
Yes, Jesus.

1435
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:51,268
Well, guess I'll be on my way.

1436
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,363
- Oh.
- Oh, goddamn, man!

1437
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,198
Cut that shit down!

1438
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,285
You should play some Bobby "Blue" Bland
or something, you fucker.

1439
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,711
- What to say?
- Come on!

1440
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:21,040
- Man, I don't know how he does it.
- Oh, man! Goddamn!

1441
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,467
Loud-ass shit. Fuck.

1442
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,919
- ML?
- What?

1443
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,844
- Come here.
- What?

1444
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,139
Come hold this for me, baby.

1445
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:34,353
- Yo...
- Hold what, sucker?

1446
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,772
- You know what I'm talkin' about.
- That's okay.

1447
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,898
At least my moms didn't name me
Sweet Dick Willie.

1448
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,400
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- I told you about that "mama" shit.

1449
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,148
Hey, nobody talkin' about your moms.

1450
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,108
I ain't say nobody, motherfucker.
I said you!

1451
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,922
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, man, squash all that.

1452
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,571
- Just squash that shit.
- No, Dick, listen.

1453
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,203
- You know I didn't mean it like that.
- You did, too!

1454
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:58,377
- Shit.
- I just wanted to know

1455
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,080
who named you Sweet Dick Willie.

1456
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,508
Man, it's just a name.
Goddamn. Shit.

1457
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,302
- How you get the name ML?
- Yeah! Uh-huh.

1458
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,924
ML stands for ML.

1459
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,507
Now that's some stupid shit,
right there.

1460
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,968
You hear me?
That's some stupid shit.

1461
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,849
'Cause everybody know
why they call me Sweet Dick Willie.

1462
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,773
- Everybody.
- Boy, I swear, you Negroes kill me.

1463
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,976
- Shit.
- Always holding onto,

1464
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,231
always talking about your dicks.

1465
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:27,156
See, I don't know about you,
but it's too hot to fuck.

1466
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,528
Man, you out your fuckin' mind?

1467
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,453
It ain't never too hot
or never too cold for fuckin'.

1468
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:36,999
Hear me? I had my best
piece of woman on a humid day.

1469
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,228
- Shit.
- Ain't that something.

1470
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,209
Over in the projects.
Close to your woman.

1471
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,629
Hey, boy, get out of here, man!
Shit.

1472
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,547
- Oh, Lord, have mercy.
- Oh, boy. Hey, boy.

1473
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,593
Goddamn. I better
not see her naked on payday.

1474
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,928
<i>Piraguero!</i>
Everybody out!

1475
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,256
The Icee, Icee Man is here.

1476
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,593
Hey, hey!
Looking good, looking good.

1477
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:59,555
Here we are.
Look at these beautiful people, huh.

1478
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,733
The Icee man is here.
Ah, ah.

1479
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,671
- I want coconut.
- Give me lemon.

1480
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,561
Tell me what you need. Aha!

1481
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,943
There you go, my love.
There you go.

1482
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,615
Aha, that's your color.

1483
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,021
- That's your flavor.
- Thank you.

1484
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,945
I want more syrup on mine.

1485
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,078
He's always drinking beer.

1486
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,332
Hey, hey, now!
Hey, where's everybody going?

1487
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,917
Ice cream!

1488
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:30,965
- Ice cream!
- Doctor!

1489
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,136
Doctor, don't you know no better

1490
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,438
than to run out in that street
in front of a car?

1491
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,274
What you trying to do,
kill yourself?

1492
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,478
- Come on. Let's get up. Come on.
- Ah.

1493
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,481
You gonna be all right.

1494
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,904
You gonna be all right, my boy.

1495
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,531
Eddie, you gonna be just fine.

1496
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,325
Eddie, what's wrong?

1497
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,952
Mayor knocked me down.

1498
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,162
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1499
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:06,793
Miss, that boy's
just scared to death.

1500
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,215
What happened...

1501
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,714
I was walking along the street,
minding my own business.

1502
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,887
I looked out and I seen your son
about to get hit by the car,

1503
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:18,343
so I dashed out to save him,
and I had to knock him down

1504
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:19,768
to keep us both from getting hit.

1505
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:25,191
Matter of fact, I saved two lives today...
his and mine.

1506
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,271
Eddie, is that the truth?

1507
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,820
Eddie, you hear me talking to you.

1508
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:32,759
Come on.
I'm talking to you, boy.

1509
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,900
He gonna be fine, miss.
Just fine.

1510
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,848
What'd I tell you about lying?

1511
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,955
What'd I tell you?

1512
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,124
- Mommy, Mommy! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ease up!

1513
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,745
Get upstairs, now!

1514
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,954
And when your father come home,
he gonna wear your little behind out, too!

1515
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,462
Miss, you didn't have
to hit your boy like that.

1516
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,134
He's already scared to death.

1517
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,883
I appreciate you helping my Eddie,
I truly do.

1518
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,181
But I'll have nobody question
how I raise him.

1519
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,304
- Not even his daddy.
- You're right, miss.

1520
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,144
You're right.

1521
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,687
Excuse me.
I don't want to sound like a jerk.

1522
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,690
- But can I say something here, Jade?
- Yeah, Sal.

1523
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,440
You got the biggest eyes
I've ever seen in my life.

1524
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,553
They, like, jump right out of your head.
You know that?

1525
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,990
I feel embarrassed even saying that.
I feel like a jerk.

1526
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:22,413
- Thanks, Sal. Thanks a lot.
- All right, don't even mention it.

1527
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,617
It was delicious.
Thanks a lot.

1528
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,167
- I gotta talk to you.
- Mookie.

1529
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,791
I got to talk to you.
Come on, come on.

1530
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,998
- All right, Mookie.
- Come on. Let's go.

1531
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:34,214
Hey, Jade, don't forget
to come back soon, okay?

1532
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,545
Hey, Mookie, take it easy.
What are you grabbing her arm?

1533
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,925
You're going to bust her arm.

1534
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,760
Vito...

1535
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,890
Jade, I do not want you
in Sal's no more, all right?

1536
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,067
- Mookie, what? Stop tripping.
- No, you're trippin'.

1537
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,109
Read my lips.
Don't come in Sal's no more.

1538
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,607
What are you so worked up about?

1539
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,190
The way Sal looks at you.
About the way he talks at you.

1540
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,945
- He's just being nice.
- Nice?

1541
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,867
- He's completely innocent.
- Innocent?

1542
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:01,365
I didn't stutter.
You heard me.

1543
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,742
Look, all Sal wants
to do is hide the salami.

1544
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,745
You're really crude, Mookie.
You know that?

1545
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,748
I admit it. I'm crude.
Do not come in Sal's anymore.

1546
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,330
- You are not welcome.
- You got a lot of nerve, you know that?

1547
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,711
I'm gonna tell you something
for the last time, Mookie.

1548
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,043
Stop trying to play
big brother to me, okay?

1549
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,503
I'm a grown woman!

1550
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,134
You can hardly pay rent,
and you're gonna tell me what to do?

1551
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,341
- Come off it!
- That makes no sense at all.

1552
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,801
- Oh, it doesn't, huh?
- No.

1553
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,853
You got your little $250 a week,
plus tips.

1554
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,101
- I'm getting paid.
- Peanuts.

1555
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,897
You know, in a while,
I'll be making a move, all right?

1556
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,070
- Yeah, when?
- Don't worry about it.

1557
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:36,800
- When, Mookie? That's what I wanna...
- Don't worry about it.

1558
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,281
- When?
- Don't worry about it.

1559
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,470
- Jade, don't come here no more.
- Look, it's got nothing...

1560
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,780
We're not talking about that.

1561
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,682
Take your skinny butt
around the corner and go home.

1562
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,142
I'm tired of supporting
a grown woman, okay?

1563
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,268
Take your butt around the corner.

1564
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,249
I'm tired of supporting
a grown man. Okay?

1565
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,203
I wanna know when you're gonna
pack your bags and go, okay, Mookie?

1566
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,066
Hey, just don't come in Sal's no more,
all right?

1567
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,673
- I'll be back.
- And no more pizza, either.

1568
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,345
I don't care if you fire me
this exact fucking moment.

1569
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,581
If you're saying
what I'm thinking you're saying,

1570
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,847
you better not say it
because I don't wanna hear.

1571
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:14,477
Yeah, hear this. Do me a favor.
Leave Jade alone.

1572
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,113
You know, Mookie, not for nothin',

1573
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,987
but if you were just
a little bit taller,

1574
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,319
I'd kick you right in the ass
for what you're thinking.

1575
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:27,873
As a matter of fact, I should
kick your ass on principle alone.

1576
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,120
Here. You got a delivery.

1577
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,207
This the right address?

1578
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:41,007
Yeah, what is this with the...
Yeah, it's the right address, Mook.

1579
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,589
That's the right address.
Yeah, I wrote it myself. Why?

1580
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,423
I'm checking.
Sometimes you make a mistake

1581
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,352
and I deliver fucking pizzas
to the wrong fucking address.

1582
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,053
I don't make mistakes.
I don't make...

1583
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,433
- You don't make mistakes?
- No.

1584
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,234
Hey, hurry back, okay?
Don't get lost. We're still open.

1585
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,481
Do me a favor.
Make the pizza, huh?

1586
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,703
Mr. Mayor.

1587
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,866
I saw what you did.
That was a foolish act.

1588
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,331
But it was brave.

1589
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,413
- That child owes you his life.
- I wasn't trying to be a hero.

1590
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:19,045
I just seen what was happening,
and I reacted.

1591
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,343
Didn't even think.

1592
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,032
Probably wouldn't have done it
on second thought, if I had thought.

1593
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,469
Yeah, Da Mayor's getting to be
an old man, now.

1594
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:29,267
I ain't run like that in years.

1595
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,346
I went from first to home
on a bunt single.

1596
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:35,728
Scored the winning run. It was two out
in the bottom of the ninth.

1597
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:39,061
It was August 1, 1939.
Snow Hill, Alabama.

1598
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,738
Ol' Mud Cat Bunch-of-Bones
was the pitcher.

1599
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,110
Now, he hated my guts.

1600
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,661
He ran back, come down off that mound,
and I took off

1601
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:51,035
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass, I...

1602
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,163
Maybe I, uh...

1603
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,620
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often, huh?

1604
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,546
Maybe you shouldn't.

1605
01:17:58,632 --> 01:17:59,668
Don't get happy.

1606
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,959
This changes nothing between you
and me.

1607
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:06,171
You did a good thing, and Mother Sister
just wanted to thank you for it.

1608
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:07,597
I want to thank you.

1609
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,182
You're welcome.

1610
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:23,063
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

1611
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,989
What the hell took you so long?
Is it hot?

1612
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:27,488
Lady, I've never delivered
a cold pizza in my life.

1613
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:38,999
Come here.

1614
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,366
You know,
you think you're slick, Tina.

1615
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,177
I know. How else
was I gonna get you up here?

1616
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,849
I haven't seen you for a week.

1617
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,394
I'm working, you know.
Making money, getting paid.

1618
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,813
I see you forgot
the ice cream again.

1619
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,474
Ah, shit, I forgot.

1620
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,934
Yeah, you know, your memory's
getting really ridiculous.

1621
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,173
- It's disgusting.
- I forgot. I got things on my mind.

1622
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,063
Yeah, and I really wanted
some ice cream, too.

1623
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,260
It'll make you any happier,
I'll run out and get some.

1624
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:10,243
No, no, no. That's out.
You won't come back, either.

1625
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,451
- You know, I can't be staying long anyhow.
- How long?

1626
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,991
- Long enough to do the nasty.
- Ahh!

1627
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,624
No, come on, Mookie! That's out.
Hold up. Wait a minute.

1628
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,705
First of all, it is too hot,
all right?

1629
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,540
And if you think I'm gonna
let you get some,

1630
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,751
put your clothes on
and leave here

1631
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,836
and not see your black ass
for another week,

1632
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,468
- you must be bugging.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1633
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,423
Yeah, right.
And my name is Boo Boo the Fool.

1634
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,100
So no nasty, huh?

1635
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,853
- No.
- Tina, let's do something else, then.

1636
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,771
- What?
- Trust me.

1637
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,065
Trust you? Uh, Mookie,
the last time I trusted you,

1638
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,267
we ended up with a son.

1639
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,069
- Remember your son?
- I do remember my son. His name's Hector.

1640
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,915
What are you trying to say?
I'm a bad father?

1641
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,324
On the strength.

1642
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,405
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- What? What?

1643
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:52,495
Over here.

1644
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,499
Tina... take your clothes off.

1645
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:03,456
Mookie, I already told you
it's too fuckin' hot to make love.

1646
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:04,835
- It's too fuckin' hot.
- Yeah.

1647
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:07,237
- Why are you always cursing?
- I don't fuckin' curse that much.

1648
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,718
"I don't fuckin' curse that much."

1649
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,198
What the hell are you talking about,
Mookie?

1650
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,838
- All you do is curse.
- I do not!

1651
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,096
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight, all right?

1652
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,051
And that's it.

1653
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,684
- No rawness?
- No. No rawness.

1654
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,621
Why it's always gotta be like that
when you come over here and shit?

1655
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,339
- It's not always like that.
- It always has to be fuckin' like that...

1656
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,730
Mookie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1657
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,940
I'm not cursing.

1658
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,072
Mookie. Come on!

1659
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,199
I mean it.
I'm not playing.

1660
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,702
"I'm not playing."

1661
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,835
Damn, don't be so anxious.

1662
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,756
That's right. Take it off.

1663
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:55,970
- You're sweating.
- Of course I'm sweating, you moron.

1664
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,017
It's only 100 degrees in here
and shit.

1665
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,980
Look, freeze. Don't move.
I'll be right back, okay?

1666
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,086
- What do you mean you'll be right back?
- Just stay there.

1667
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,191
Where you going?

1668
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,065
I'll be right back.

1669
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,924
What the hell you got me
standing on the bed for?

1670
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,280
Where the hell you going?

1671
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,950
How's my son, Hector?

1672
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:23,251
Honey, do you hear that?
He wants to know how you are doing.

1673
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,751
And he has the straight face
of asking about it.

1674
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,384
Good for nothing.

1675
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,008
English! English!

1676
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,968
I want my son to speak English,
all right?

1677
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,262
- Why don't you just get out of my kitchen?
- It's bad enough his name is Hector.

1678
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,684
Get out of my kitchen.
I don't want to hear anything.

1679
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:50,190
Get out. Out, I said.

1680
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,361
Yes, children.

1681
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,239
This is the cool-out corner.

1682
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,791
We're slowing it down
for all the lovers in the house.

1683
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,495
I'll be giving you
all the help you need.

1684
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,545
Musically, that is.

1685
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,248
This shit is cold.

1686
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,049
Supposed to be cold.
It's an ice cube.

1687
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,547
Later for your shit.

1688
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,379
<i>Mira.</i>

1689
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:17,930
<i>- Mira.</i>
- What?

1690
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:22,264
Tina, you don't got a forehead.
You got a eight-head.

1691
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,812
Mookie,
you're corny as shit.

1692
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,730
You got one of them Sade foreheads.

1693
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,524
Fuck you.

1694
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,227
Goddamn,
that's a big-ass forehead.

1695
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,153
I need an iceberg...

1696
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,238
It'd be better than this ice cube.

1697
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,446
Thank God for the lips.

1698
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,575
Thank God for the neck.

1699
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,292
Thank God for kneecaps.

1700
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,876
Thank God for elbows.

1701
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,967
Thank God for thighs.

1702
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,264
Thank God for the right nipple.

1703
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,181
Thank God for the left nipple.

1704
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,273
Feels good.

1705
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,976
Ah. You likes,
you likes, you likes.

1706
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,902
Anyway.

1707
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,365
I got to be going.

1708
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,567
You better come back.

1709
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,071
I'll be back tonight.

1710
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,282
You better come back,
or else I'm gonna kick your ass.

1711
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,656
- Oops.
- What?

1712
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,742
Guess I got to be back then.

1713
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,076
All right.

1714
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,458
All right.

1715
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,165
All right.

1716
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,127
- Get out of here.
- I gotta go.

1717
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,757
- Bye.
- Bye.

1718
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:49,063
- I'm not leaving yet.
- Get out of here.

1719
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,562
- All right. Later.
- Later.

1720
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:57,405
So just out of curiosity,
how long you gonna stick around here?

1721
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,902
You mean tonight?

1722
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,608
I mean the neighborhood,
you know.

1723
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,694
Well, I figure about 50 years.

1724
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,308
Yeah, because I'm going into
the real estate business, you know.

1725
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:08,329
I figured I'd put up a big high-rise
in the neighborhood.

1726
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,665
- Yeah. Lot of people want to move here.
- Why not?

1727
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:13,747
You want a condominium?

1728
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,401
Put a couple of straws in there,
Mr. Trump.

1729
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,462
- But of course.
- Mr. Trump's.

1730
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,419
- Trump's Pizza.
- I heard of that place, man.

1731
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,573
- No, it's Trump's Plaza.
- Oh.

1732
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,200
- Do me a favor. Get out of here.
- See you, Sal.

1733
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,840
Take care, Salvatore.

1734
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:28,224
Pino, take the soft drinks
out of the back and load up here, okay?

1735
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,554
Okay, Pop.

1736
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,023
Sal, if you want me
to deliver faster,

1737
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,712
you gotta give me
a jet rocket or something.

1738
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,979
'Cause I can't be running with pizzas.
The cheese ends up on one side.

1739
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,939
Mookie, I didn't say nothing.

1740
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,741
You must have a guilty conscience.
You got a guilty conscience?

1741
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,535
Sal, I'm not guilty of anything.

1742
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:45,932
You gotta be guilty of something.

1743
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,539
Otherwise you wouldn't come in here
saying the things you said.

1744
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,706
Come on, Sal.

1745
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,409
Where we going?

1746
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,744
Oh, shit.

1747
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,149
- You're corny.
- Vito, give me a hand. Come on.

1748
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,539
Corny as shit.

1749
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,302
- Come on, Vito.
- What?

1750
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,004
What the fuck's the matter?

1751
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,595
Vito, I want you to listen to me.
I'm your brother.

1752
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,851
I may smack you around
every once in a while,

1753
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,854
but I'm still your... your brother.

1754
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,362
So what, Pino?
So fucking what?

1755
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,483
I love you, man.

1756
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,619
I'm listening, I'm listening.

1757
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,913
Good, 'cause I want you to listen.

1758
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:31,241
Jesus Christ, Pino.
I said I'm fuckin' listening.

1759
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:34,954
Good. Vito, black, white.
No.

1760
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,664
- No, no, no.
- No?

1761
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,777
- What the hell you talking about?
- Are you listening to me?

1762
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,042
Stop busting my balls, Pino.

1763
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,378
I said I'm fuckin' listening
ten fuckin' times already.

1764
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,088
Mookie is not to be trusted.

1765
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,701
- I trust him, Pino. I fuckin' trust him.
- No, no.

1766
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,717
No <i>mulignan</i> can be trusted.

1767
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,348
The first time you turn your back,
boom.

1768
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,521
The spear, right here, man,
in the back.

1769
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,940
Yeah?
How do you know this?

1770
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:58,143
- I know.
- How do you know, man?

1771
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,444
- I know. I read.
- Give me a break, Pino.

1772
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,467
I never seen you read nothing
in your fuckin' life.

1773
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,357
Read your history.

1774
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,908
It's historical.

1775
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,781
He, them,
they're not to be trusted.

1776
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,991
- What do you want me to do about it?
- I want you to be on fucking guard, man.

1777
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,745
Fuckin' hit me?

1778
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,871
You be on guard,
'cause Mookie has Pop conned,

1779
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,577
so we got to look out for him.

1780
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,233
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1781
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,919
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1782
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,922
- Yeah?
- Vito! Pino! Let's go!

1783
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,719
We'll be right there, Pop.

1784
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,513
One minute.

1785
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:31,013
You better listen to what I say
or I'll rip you...

1786
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,265
I'll fuck you up.
You know I'll fuck you up.

1787
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,272
- You know something, Pino?
- What?

1788
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,046
You don't know everything
you think you know, man.

1789
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,673
You think you know it,
but you don't know it.

1790
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,531
Mookie, he listens to me.
You don't, man.

1791
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,863
He does, man.
You fuckin' don't.

1792
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,663
You're fuckin' stabbing me
in the back, man.

1793
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,296
Radio!

1794
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,922
Buggin', what's up?

1795
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,298
How you been, man?

1796
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:08,630
Living large, bro.

1797
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,133
Yo, that the only tape you gots?

1798
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,095
You don't like Public Enemy, man?
The shit's dope.

1799
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:17,771
No, I'm down, but you don't
be playing nothing else.

1800
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,895
I don't like nothing else.

1801
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,443
Yo, check this, man.
You know Sal?

1802
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,612
Yeah, I know that motherfucker.

1803
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:28,157
I've been trying to organize a boycott of
Sal's Famous, you know what I'm sayin'?

1804
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,860
I almost had to bust him
in the head today, man.

1805
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:35,995
Gonna tell me... Tell me, Radio Raheem,
to turn down my box and shit, man,

1806
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,246
and didn't even say "please."

1807
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,204
Who the fuck he think he is,
Don Corleone and shit?

1808
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,381
He makes much money off
us black people,

1809
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,468
and all he got up in there
on the wall is Italians.

1810
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:49,421
You know, Sylvester Stallone,
okeydoke-lookin' motherfuckers.

1811
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,159
- You see what I'm saying, homeboy?
- On the strength.

1812
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:54,676
Yeah, well we shouldn't buy one slice,
spend one red penny up in there

1813
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,057
till he put folks of color
up on that wall.

1814
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,355
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1815
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,307
- Yo, you got my back?
- Your back is got.

1816
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,233

- My brother.

1817
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,398
Yo, Smiley.
Come here, man.

1818
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:07,689
What you listening to?

1819
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:12,569
M-M-M-Malcolm.

1820
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,823
M-M-M-Malcolm, huh?

1821
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,655
Cut off that rap music!

1822
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:19,117
I'm in here trying to get me
some motherfuckin' goddamn sleep.

1823
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,294
- Yo, I'll fuck you up quick!
- Two times!

1824
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:26,420
Th-Th-Th-three t-times!

1825
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:31,763
Sal, start counting my money tonight
'cause I gots to get paid.

1826
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:37,934
Come on, Vito.
Come on.

1827
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,606
This is terrific.

1828
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,863
I mean we had a great,
great day.

1829
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,779
You know something?

1830
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:57,865
There's nothing like a family
in business working together.

1831
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,871
I'm gonna rename the place.

1832
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,455
I'm going to call it Sal
and Sons' Famous Pizzeria.

1833
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,487
Why not? You guys are gonna
take it over someday, anyway, right?

1834
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,466
And, Mookie...

1835
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:18,677
Mookie, I want to tell you that there's
always gonna be a place for you here,

1836
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,059
right here at Sal's,
Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

1837
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:24,293
Because you've always
been like a son to me.

1838
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,546
Yo, Sal! Can we get some pizza, man?

1839
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:29,313
We're closed, man! We're closed.

1840
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:31,944
- You shut up!
- Shut the fuck up, man!

1841
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,117
All right, let them in.
Let them in.

1842
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,819
They love my pizza.

1843
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,575
Four slices,
and I'm out of here.

1844
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:39,906
Sal, we're trying to go home!

1845
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,457
- Open the door, Mookie!
- Shut up!

1846
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,705
You ain't nothing
but a delivery boy, bitch!

1847
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,331
- Simple ass!
- Stupid!

1848
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,714
Man,
shut the fuck up!

1849
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,153
- Sit your black ass down!
- Shut up, man! Fuck you!

1850
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:53,635
Yo, Sal, Sal,
four slices, man, regular.

1851
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,465
- To go, all right?
- Hey, why you gotta curse?

1852
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,799
Looking good.

1853
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,681
- Looking real good, man.
- Fuck it, man. Come on. I'm hungry, man.

Turn that jungle music off!
We ain't in Africa!

1868
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,633
Why it got to be
about jungle music?

1869
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,760
Why it got to be about Africa?

1870
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,467
It's about them fucking pictures!

1871
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:45,350
It's about turning that shit off
and getting the fuck out of my place!

1872
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,476
Radio Raheem!

1873

Until you get some black people

1887
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,891
- We niggers now.

1888
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,560
You fucking white trash!

Come here.

01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,981
Yo, get him out!

1983
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,274
- Fuck that, man!
- Bitch!

1984
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:25,903
Radio!

1985
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,616
No!

1986
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,664
No!

1987
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,916
Mookie, they killed him.

1988
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,717
They killed Radio Raheem!

1989
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:49,884
It's murder.

1990
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,699
They did it again,
just like Michael Stewart.

1991
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,885
Murder! Eleanor Bumpers!
Murder!

1992
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:56,934
Damn, man! It ain't safe
in our own fucking neighborhood!

1993
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,057
Never was.
Never will be.

1994
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:01,959
We ain't gonna stand for this shit
no more, Sal. You hear me?

1995
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:05,021
Ain't gonna stand
for them fuckin' police. Punk!

1996
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:07,774
It's as plain as day.

1997
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,114
They didn't have to kill the boy.

1998
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,240
They killed him.

1999
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,747
You ain't shit, Sal.
Shit, man.

2000
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:40,094
You do what you gotta do.

2001
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,724
Aw, fuck that, Sal!

2002
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:44,898
Listen, listen, listen.
Good people, please.

2003
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,976
Let's all go home.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

2004
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:48,652
Yeah. You, boy!

2005
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:51,822
If we don't stop this
and stop it now,

2006
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:55,197
we gonna do something we're gonna regret
for the rest of our lives.

2007
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,279
Sal and his boys had nothing
to do with what the cops did.

2008
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:01,912
One of the police was black!

2009
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,395
- Leave him alone.
- I'm gonna get you

2010
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:05,581
and them three stooges,
Sal, you hear me?

2011
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:06,957
Go on, Mr. Sal.

2012
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,290
- How'd you do it, man?
- Go on.

2013
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:11,184
You see how they had him
in a choke hold, man?

2014
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,377
I knew that choke hold
was killing people, man!

2015
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:14,990
- This ain't no kid, man.
- He had a radio.

2016
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:17,802
- You can't save him.
- He had a radio, a fucking radio!

2017
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,599
He died because he had a radio!

2018
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:22,098
All he wanted pictures on the wall,
and he died!

2019
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:24,680
Sal, what you got to say, Sal?

2020
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,893
...called the cops!

2021
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,102
Vito called the cops!

2022
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,280
Your son called the cops, boy!

2023
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:35,608
Man, get the fuck out of here, man!

2024
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,158
Somebody's gotta pay.

2025
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,528
Fuck that, man!

2026
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:46,628
Aw, shit.

2027
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:50,839
Hate!

2028
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,461
No!

2029
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,892
Let him go! Let him go!
Sal, this is Da Mayor.

2030
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,041
- What are they doing?
- Come on, Sal.

2031
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,654
- What are they doing?
- Sal, Sal, Sal.

2032
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,421
- Sal, come on. Come on, quick.
- What the fuck are they doing?

2033
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:39,721
Get them out of there!

2034
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:40,968
Get...

2035
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:42,765
That's my place!

2036
01:39:42,852 --> 01:39:45,595
- That's my fucking place!
- Sal!

2037
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:47,145
Fucking niggers.

2038
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,190
Radio!

2039
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,700

Burn it down!
Burn it down!

2045
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:26,392
Come on, let's clean house.
Shit. Come on.

01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,357
I no white.
I no white!

2047
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,105
It's your turn, sucker!

2048
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:36,107
- I no white! I no white!
- No white!

2049
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:39,110
- I no white! I'm black!
- What? Black?

2050
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,783
- Yeah, I black!
- Me black! Me black!

2051
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,485
- Where you black at?
- Me black!

2052
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:44,579
- I black!
- Me!

Me black!

2057
01:40:56,425 --> 01:41:00,840
- Open your eyes, motherfucker!
- ML, leave the Korean alone, man.

2058
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,930
He's all right.

2059
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,056
Yeah, leave him alone, man.

2060
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:07,350
Yeah? He's all right.

2061
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:10,019
- He's black. Ain't that a bitch?
- Shit.

2062
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:39,591
Oh, fuck you, now!

2063
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:42,461

Good people, we're giving you
one more warning to please go home!

01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:20,374
This is our home!

2078
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:21,675
Okay, you've had your warning!

2079
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,923
Hose the black fuckers down!

01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,604
Get off of me! Get the fuck off me!

Back up, man.

01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:52,452
Yo! Yo! Yo!

01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,998
Well, come on!
Come on!

2084
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:55,747
Get your fuckin' black hands off me!

2085
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:07,741
- Come on, asshole. Come on!
- Hold still, goddamn it!

2086
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,785
Come on. Move it.
Motherfucker, come on!

2087
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:11,536
- I'll break your arm.
- Is this Birmingham?

2088
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,893
Fucking Alabama.
Yo, where's Bull Connor?

2089
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:19,395
Son of a bitch!

2090
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:22,853
Oh, no! No!

2091
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:27,699
No!

2092
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:30,744
Oh, no!

2093
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:35,495
No! No!

2094
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,166
Oh, no!

2095
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:38,869
No!

2096
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:44,500
No! No!

2097
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,303

2121
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:18,518

2122
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:22,265
I saw it,
but I didn't believe it.

2123
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:25,692
I didn't believe it,
what I saw.

2124
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:27,940
Are we gonna live together?

2125
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:31,398
Together, are we gonna live?

2126
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,529
This is your Mister Señor Love Daddy

2127
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:38,239
talking to you from WE-LOVE Radio,
108 FM on your dial,

2128
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,450
and that's the triple truth, Ruth.

2129
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:42,910
<i>Today's weather?</i>

2130
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:45,329
<i>Hot!</i>

2131
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:50,215
<i>Wake up!</i>

2132
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:54,091
Fuck!

2133
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,513
My money. Shit!

2134
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,261
Where are you going?

2135
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,467
To get my money.

2136
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:00,644
Ah, don't try that shit,
okay?

2137
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:02,165
You know,
you're gonna run out of here

2138
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,727
and I ain't gonna see your black ass
for another fuckin' week.

2139
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,817
- Tina, it's not even like that.
- It is like that.

2140
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,693
You don't give
a fuckin' shit about me,

2141
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,896
and you definitely don't give
a shit about your son.

2142
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,947
Look, I care about you.
I care about my son.

2143
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,135
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God.

2144
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:16,492
- Why don't you be a man?
- I am a man, all right?

2145
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:19,947
Then act like a man.
Why don't you be a fucking man, Mookie?

2146
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:23,287
Shit.
I'm so tired of your shit.

2147
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,835
Why do we have to go over this
shit again and again and again?

2148
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:28,789
Because you don't fuckin' listen,
Mookie!

2149
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,296
If you listen to me,
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2150
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,377
like a fucking radio,
all right?

2151
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,907
Look what kind of mother you are,
using fuckin' language like that.

2152
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:37,409
- What kind of mother am I?
- Why don't...

2153
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:40,767
You need to... Your ass isn't even here!
So don't be telling me

2154
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:42,956
- what kind of mother I am.
- Get another vocabulary, all right?

2155
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:45,438
- Why don't you get a fucking life?
- Yeah.

2156
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:46,765
- Look...
- Look what?

2157
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,587
- I'll be back.
- What... Don't leave, Mookie.

2158
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:50,477
- I'll be back.
- Don't leave.

2159
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:52,312
'Cause I'm tired of this shit,
all right?

2160
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,989
You walk out that door, that's it.
All right?

2161
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:58,535
I have to get my money from Sal.
I'll be back, all right?

2162
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,122
Your shit is to the curb, Mookie,
all right?

2163
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:03,869
And I'm tired of it, all right?

2164
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,123
'Cause you need to step off
with your stupid-ass self, okay?

2165
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:10,046
And you need to get a fucking life,
Mookie, all right,

2166
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,087
because the one you got, baby,
is not working, okay?

2167
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,544
And I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2168
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:19,844
Fuckin' ass, stupid ass,
fuckin' <i>pendejo.</i>

2169
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:22,347
Shit.
I'm tired of this fucking shit.

2170
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:25,436
Good morning.

2171
01:47:27,608 --> 01:47:29,565
Is it a good morning?

2172
01:47:29,652 --> 01:47:32,019
Yes, indeed.

2173
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:34,570
You almost got yourself killed
last night.

2174
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:38,867
I've done that before.

2175
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:45,706
Where did you sleep?

2176
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:48,994
I didn't.

2177
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:54,792
I hope the block is still standing.

2178
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,052
We're still standing.

2179
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,430
What do you want?

2180
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,927
I want my money.
I want to get paid.

2181
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,303
You don't work here no more.

2182
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,350
Sal, I want my money.

2183
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:49,054
Your money couldn't begin to pay
for the window you broke.

2184
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:51,265
Motherfuck a window.
Radio Raheem is dead.

2185
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,102
I know he's dead.
I was here. You remember?

2186
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:58,859
He's dead because of his buddy.
That cocksucker started all this shit.

2187
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:01,111
He's responsible for that kid's death.

2188
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:04,444
And he wanted to close me,
and you stood there like a fuck

2189
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,120
and you watched 'em burn me down!

2190
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:08,994
I watched it. I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem.

2191
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:11,354
You're gonna get over
from the fuckin' insurance anyway, Sal.

2192
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,836
- You know the deal.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

2193
01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:15,333
This ain't about money.

2194
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:17,040
I could give a fuck about money.

2195
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,716
You see this fuckin' place?

2196
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:21,215
I built this fuckin' place!

2197
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,763
With my bare fuckin' hands!

2198
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:26,262
Every light socket,
every piece of tile.

2199
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,843
Me! With these fuckin' hands!

2200
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:30,553
You know what the fuck that means?

2201
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:33,014
Yeah, it means pay me
my motherfucking money.

2202
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,725
- That's what it means, Sal.
- Okay, Mookie.

2203
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:39,107
How much do I owe you?

2204
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:42,407
My salary is 250.
250 a week.

2205
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,332
One...

2206
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,125
that's two...

2207
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:55,040
that's three...

2208
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:57,084
that's four...

2209
01:49:57,883 --> 01:49:59,340
and that's five.

2210
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:02,423
You got $500.
You're a rich fucking man.

2211
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,630
Are you happy? You happy?

2212
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:07,591
He's got 500 fuckin' dollars!

2213
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:09,220
He's a big man!

2214
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:10,973
He's a rich fucking man!

2215
01:50:11,063 --> 01:50:14,477
He's never gonna have
any more trouble!

2216
01:50:14,566 --> 01:50:15,602
Not Mookie!

2217
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,354
He's fuckin' rich!

2218
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:18,810
Who the fuck you yelling at?

2219
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:22,193
You're wealthy, Mookie.
You're a real fuckin' Rockefeller.

2220
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:26,989
You got your fuckin' pay.
Now leave me alone, huh?

2221
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:29,822
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

2222
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,291
I owe you 50 bucks.

2223
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:36,077
- Keep it.
- You keep it.

2224
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,412
- You keep it.
- You keep it.

2225
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:39,372
- No, you keep it.
- You keep it.

2226
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,173
I don't believe this shit.

2227
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:47,013
Believe it.

2228
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:50,058
Are you sick?

2229
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:53,056
I'm hot as a motherfucker.
I'm all right, though.

2230
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:57,853
Well, they say it's even gonna
get hotter today.

2231
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:03,563
What are you gonna do
with yourself?

2232
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:06,650
Make that money.
Get paid.

2233
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:10,369
Sal, I got to go see my son,
if it's all right with you.

2234
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:23,421
<i>Hey, Mook. It's the Mook man.</i>

2235
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,344
<i>I see you walking down the block.
Go on home to your kid.</i>

2236
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,137
<i>Now the news and weather.</i>

2237
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:30,840

a blue-ribbon panel, and I quote,</i>

be destroyed by anyone."</i>

2240

<i>His Honor plans to visit our block today.</i>

2241
01:51:40,444 --> 01:51:43,357
<i>Maybe he should hook up
with our own Da Mayor, buy him a beer.</i>

2242
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:47,111
<i>Your Love Daddy says register to vote.</i>
