1
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,744
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!

2
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,480
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!

3
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:45,015
Forward! Platoon, halt.

4
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,226
At ease.

5
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,830
What was that number in Paris?

6
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:05,378
All heads up. Right face.

7
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,338
Forward march.

8
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,874
Extend. Hut!

9
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,946
Swing right. Hut!

10
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:58,426
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.

11
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,769
Beats those replacement camps.

12
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:03,328
You said the war would be over
by Christmas.

13
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:07,638
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.

14
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:13,638
The spitting image
of Camp Wolters, Texas.

15
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,476
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.

16
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,991
But all he does is fly around
in a private plane looking for ugly places.

17
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:26,184
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.

18
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,694
Then he checks up on the climate.

19
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,497
If it's too hot in summer for human life
and too cold in winter...

20
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,732
and if it has more rain, fog, wind,
and snow...

21
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:40,607
than any other spot he can find,
then he plants the American flag...

22
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,446
and proclaims it a US Army camp.

23
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,411
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?

24
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:47,882
Bombshell.

25
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,818
Box steps.

26
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:59,121
To the rear, freeze! Forward!

27
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,661
To the right flank, freeze!

28
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:07,937
Forward! Platoon, halt!

29
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,869
At ease!

30
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,842
<i>Forty-two sixty what?</i>

31
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,409
<i>- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!</i>

32
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,316
Platoon, attention. Right face.

33
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,810
Forward march!

34
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,225
The Screaming Eagle.

35
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:36,460
They know who you are
when you wear that on your sleeve.

36
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,128
It wasn't bad enough
being in Infantry Replacement.

37
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,502
We have to volunteer
for the 101st Airborne.

38
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,701
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.

39
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:48,473
There must be a difference
or they wouldn't give you extra pay.

40
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:52,210
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.

41
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:56,948
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted
and sewing on shoulder patches.

42
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,422
Why did they have to put us
in different companies?

43
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:03,257
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.

44
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,889
His job is to find out who your buddy is
and then to split you up.

45
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,126
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.

46
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:13,296
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.

47
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,861
So long, Hooper.

48
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,237
Thanks.

49
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,846
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy...

50
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,822
who said he'd court-martial the first man
who tossed his gas mask away?

51
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,322
We ripped out the masks...

52
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,418
and used the carriers
for toting that cognac we liberated.

53
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,430
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."

54
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,366
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad...

55
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,893
but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.

56
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,738
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?

57
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,073
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.

58
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,342
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...

59
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,112
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.

60
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,811
All except the replacements.

61
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,444
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?

62
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,955
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.

63
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,391
Make yourself at home,
but on some other sack.

64
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,592
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

65
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,974
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.

66
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,148
Daisy Mae won't know you
when you get back to Dogpatch.

67
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,208
That's for dang sure.

68
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,548
Abner, will you please stop saying that?

69
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:10,853
Fellows, look what I found.

70
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,294
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.

71
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,125
At ease, men.

72
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,825
I heard the war was on its last legs,
so I thought I'd come back.

73
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:22,836
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg...

74
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:26,601
and a month later he comes back in time
for a three-day pass to Paris.

75
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,699
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.

76
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:31,836
<i>Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.</i>

77
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,610
And me brooding all the time
about my dear buddies back there...

78
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,652
defending the Republic.

79
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,086
Will you look at that girl bait.

80
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:46,356
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad
just as soon as we hit Paris.

81
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:50,996
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?

82
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,994
No, I was just sitting here.

83
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,667
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.

84
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,500
What's it like, Holley?

85
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,046
- Paris?
- Yeah.

86
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,912
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.

87
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:12,478
But I happened to hear about a place
that might interest you. Place Pigalle.

88
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,358
Pig Alley.

89
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,829
Be sure to bring your dog tags,
because one night in Pig Alley...

90
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,195
Excuse me.

91
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,835
Because you're going to think
you're the Caliph of Baghdad.

92
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:31,135
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.

93
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:34,733
Compared to Pig Alley,
it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.

94
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:39,543
How about you and me
boarding up in Paris?

95
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,743
What's the matter,
did Pop Stazak disown you?

96
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,413
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.

97
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,189
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.

98
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:53,124
But I'm getting me a private room
and private bath in Paris...

99
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:56,063
if I have to get it at the point of a gun.

100
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,362
The big brain wants to get away
from us common people.

101
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:03,429
He hasn't got anybody around here
to chat with about the Einstein Theory.

102
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:05,770
What do you mean? He's got me.

103
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:09,139
There ain't nothing
we like to talk about better.

104
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:14,406
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.

105
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:17,152
He got hit in Holland.

106
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,524
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.

107
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:43,777
<i>- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?</i>

108
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,577
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.

109
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,642
They're just making me a civilian,
that's all.

110
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,850
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.

111
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,359
It ain't the arthritis.

112
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,522
They got a report from the Red Cross...

113
00:10:57,594 --> 00:11:00,825
that my wife is too sick
to take care of the kids.

114
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:04,399
So I let them talk me into accepting
a dependency discharge.

115
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,265
Glad you made it, Pop.

116
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:10,399
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.

117
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:14,839
One of these days
you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie...

118
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:16,937
right square in those GI teeth.

119
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:20,780
Such language. You should have
learned him better manners, Pop.

120
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,285
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?

121
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:26,415
Any day now. I have to sweat out
a letter of confirmation...

122
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,119
from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.

123
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:31,822
No, I decided to catch that football game.

124
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,024
That's swell. It'll be rugged
waiting around here all alone.

125
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,467
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?

126
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:41,404
That's for dang sure.

127
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:46,336
I'm glad to see you guys
finally got the junk off my cot.

128
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,279
How about dousing that light?

129
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,686
Paris trucks are leaving early.

130
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,511
Okay, douse it.

131
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:27,617
All right, roll out of them sacks.

132
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:30,587
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.

133
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:34,622
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.

134
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,095
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.

135
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,361
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?

136
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:43,733
Beats me. The Krauts
made a breakthrough someplace.

137
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:45,669
They tell me it's gonna be cold...

138
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:49,573
so wear your long johns and two pairs
of pants. Three, if you can get them on.

139
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,270
But they told us yesterday
we'd be off the line for good.

140
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:54,370
They didn't get the order
till after midnight.

141
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:58,384
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.

142
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,911
This is strictly for the birds, brother.

143
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:05,784
Beats anything
ever I stuck my finger in before.

144
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,418
"General, I need a crack division
to plug up that gap."

145
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,398
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."

146
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,062
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."

147
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,627
"Not at all, General."

148
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:26,311
Maybe the adjutant
can put in a phone call.

149
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,275
Yeah. It's only a technicality.

150
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:32,113
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!

151
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,221
It's a secret move,
so rip off your shoulder patches.

152
00:13:56,611 --> 00:14:00,775
Sarge, you got any of them
rubber overshoes, them galoshes?

153
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,943
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.

154
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,889
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.

155
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,795
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.

156
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:20,530
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.

157
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,729
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.

158
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,740
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.

159
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,011
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.

160
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,444
I understand your problems, men.

161
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,416
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.

162
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:40,683
And 17 weeks at OCS,
and he's an officer and gentleman...

163
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,486
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!

164
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,282
Shut up!

165
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,950
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?

166
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:50,685
<i>Do you speak French, sir?</i>

167
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,555
<i>Yes. Immediately.</i>

168
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,959
<i>- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.</i>

169
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,665
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.

170
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,575
What time is it, Hansan?

171
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,185
- 11:30.
- What?

172
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,419
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.

173
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:24,325
11:30 a.m. Central Standard Time.

174
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:28,696
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?

175
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,059
What's the use of changing your watch?

176
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:34,730
What's the use? You're here,
you're not in Springfield, Illinois.

177
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,237
I hear you.

178
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,611
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.

179
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:50,786
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.

180
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,517
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.

181
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,821
He found a home in the Army.

182
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:03,290
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

183
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,038
Chocolate, please.

184
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,739
Isn't she cute?

185
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,103
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

186
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:16,340
Here.

187
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:26,154
Get a load of mama!

188
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:32,121
I'd like to keep her in chocolate
for about a week.

189
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,429
What's she saying, Jarvess?

190
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,767
She wants to know
if we'd like to come inside and warm up.

191
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:49,246
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!

192
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:29,186
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.

193
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,553
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?

194
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,856
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.

195
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,028
They only occupied France for four years.

196
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:39,564
Naturally they left a few spies
when they pulled out.

197
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:42,659
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies...

198
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:45,364
so we'll know what's going on
once in a while?

199
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:50,435
Get them inside! Come on!

200
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,406
On the double!

201
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,489
Kinnie, how about getting
these men in out of the hot sun?

202
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,724
Wolowicz, Garby,
in there with the second platoon.

203
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,320
This corner house.

204
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:18,569
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.

205
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:22,075
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?

206
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:25,738
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.

207
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,872
For once, we get a break.

208
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,928
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting
this place in a hurry.

209
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,157
I wouldn't mind holing up here
till Christmas.

210
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:49,204
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.

211
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:13,726
<i>This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.</i>

212
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,263
Let's see if we can get some news.

213
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,829
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.

214
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,665
<i>Ask her. I'll guarantee you
she can sprechen sie Deutsch.</i>

215
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,407
Let's live a little, Jarvess.

216
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,942
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.

217
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,084
These two little children,
they live with me, but...

218
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,527
<i>Slowly, please.</i>

219
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,820
She said she's not the mother
of the two little girls.

220
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:22,195
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.

221
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,494
They all got a sob story.

222
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:30,734
<i>- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.</i>

223
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,270
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.

224
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,574
What you say, please?

225
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,945
I said do you think
the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?

226
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:40,346
What he say?

227
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:43,547
<i>Is there any coffee left?</i>

228
00:21:43,754 --> 00:21:47,417
<i>- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.</i>

229
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:50,585
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.

230
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,059
They're all alike here.

231
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:55,826
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.

232
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,800
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.

233
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,996
Yeah, it's about that time.

234
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:05,263
We sure come a far piece today.

235
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:09,176
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.

236
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,486
Poor tired soldiers.

237
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:24,387
- You want?
- Thank you.

238
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,264
I go now?

239
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,638
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.

240
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:43,208
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe...

241
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:46,114
you're either out on your feet
or you get the order to move.

242
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,983
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.

243
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,383
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

244
00:22:58,396 --> 00:22:59,795
Good night.

245
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,765
- Where are you going?
- Guard.

246
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:23,055
What did she say?

247
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:28,192
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate
from the kids till Christmas.

248
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:32,493
I wish I knew for sure
we'd be here tomorrow.

249
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,795
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?

250
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,200
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts...

251
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:40,705
so the air corps can come out
and win the war for us.

252
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,873
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.

253
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:47,811
This may go down in history
as the greatest gamble of the war.

254
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:51,380
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.

255
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:56,222
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?

256
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:58,754
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.

257
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:12,764
Wake me up early, will you?

258
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,339
<i>Maybe.</i>

259
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,622
I ought to report this
to the Inspector General.

260
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:38,290
There's supposed to be 18 inches
between bunks.

261
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,800
This is dangerous, spreads germs.

262
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:30,176
There's some hot coffee on the stove.

263
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:31,852
I can use it.

264
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:37,250
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.

265
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,837
Halt. Password.

266
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,967
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.

267
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,448
I thought the 101st
was the only division here.

268
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,886
They will be
as soon as the rest of us can get out.

269
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,083
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.

270
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:12,650
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.

271
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:16,562
Tanks, planes. Everything
you ever heard of and then some.

272
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:19,098
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker
in English.

273
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:22,500
It said Hitler will give Paris
to the Germans for a Christmas present.

274
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:25,506
But they told us
it was just a weak little counterattack.

275
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:29,443
They'll probably tell you
that this is a strategic withdrawal.

276
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:51,156
<i>- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.</i>

277
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:57,463
I'll be back in a minute.

278
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:02,039
Keep an eye on... What's going on?

279
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:05,740
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.

280
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:09,080
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.

281
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:12,743
Maybe she'll give you a refund
on those chocolate bars.

282
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:15,424
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?

283
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,791
Anything you gotta do,
you better do in 30 seconds.

284
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,993
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.

285
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,518
Drop your packs and rolls.

286
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,425
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.

287
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,485
Third platoon,
any time there's a dirty detail.

288
00:29:30,563 --> 00:29:33,657
Let's not be having
any talk like that, soldier.

289
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:36,391
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.

290
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:38,370
Watch out for snipers.

291
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,985
Snipers, the man says.

292
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:57,476
Second squad, over here. Dig in.

293
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:10,122
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.

294
00:31:10,198 --> 00:31:14,829
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?

295
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:19,536
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.

296
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:23,403
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.

297
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,537
Come on, Hansan, let's go.

298
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,761
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.

299
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,273
Get out of here.

300
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:37,783
I'm sorry.

301
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,884
Let's not try to reach China this time.

302
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,622
There's no sense digging
if you don't go deep.

303
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,321
Last time we dug one together...

304
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:21,922
you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.

305
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,551
- How does it look?
- Great.

306
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,147
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.

307
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,057
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.

308
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,054
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.

309
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,895
Oh, no!

310
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,505
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole...

311
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,106
and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.

312
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,959
Will you stop yapping?

313
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,792
First and third squads
gotta run patrols all night.

314
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,195
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.

315
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,703
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.

316
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:36,335
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog...

317
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,972
really gets to you.

318
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,780
I feel kind of woozy myself.

319
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,417
Let's go, Hansan.

320
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,123
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.

321
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,379
When you were in that camp
in New York...

322
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,818
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.

323
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:23,412
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?

324
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,253
That's right. She came there to see you.

325
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,392
Did you phone your kids long distance?

326
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,923
Yeah, just before we shipped out.

327
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:34,189
- Why?
- What did that cost?

328
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:36,369
$2 for three minutes.

329
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,934
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking...

330
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,336
it's probably about as far from New York
to Wichita, where your kids were...

331
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:49,915
as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles,
where my folks are.

332
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:53,413
And when you get back home...

333
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:56,247
what would that be, about 200 francs?

334
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,719
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.

335
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,588
Tell them that I...

336
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,690
Well, you'll think of something.

337
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,927
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.

338
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:40,056
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.

339
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:42,797
Put on that steel pot
and get over to the roadblock.

340
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:46,203
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.

341
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:49,107
They said to look out
for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.

342
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,610
What about the password?

343
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:53,704
That might be nice to know,
in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.

344
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:56,307
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.

345
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,064
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.

346
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,862
Okay, you get half of them.

347
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,899
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.

348
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,100
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.

349
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,573
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics
wouldn't let me off the line.

350
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,477
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.

351
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,313
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.

352
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:06,018
Yeah, it sounds good.

353
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,240
Halt! Password!

354
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:26,941
- Bug.
- Jitter.

355
00:38:32,516 --> 00:38:35,007
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.

356
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:38,282
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchâteau.

357
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:41,979
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.

358
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:48,026
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.

359
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:49,759
Good. Let's go.

360
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:59,406
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.

361
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:02,169
Must be a new replacement.

362
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:20,464
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.

363
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,794
Yes, sir.

364
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:52,755
Oh, no!

365
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,199
Look, Pop, it's snowing!

366
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,247
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.

367
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:10,782
You didn't, by any chance hear...

368
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,910
that it's kind of cold
and a little on the wet side, did you?

369
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:16,181
Man, it's really coming down.

370
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:20,322
Well, close the window, Johnny,
and fix that hole in the roof.

371
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:28,523
You should know better
than to take off your boots in a foxhole.

372
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,035
You might want to start running fast.

373
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,698
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.

374
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:37,800
I ain't got no galoshes.

375
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:14,277
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?

376
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:18,478
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.

377
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,279
- K Company?
- Yeah.

378
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,747
I got a buddy in K Company.

379
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:34,057
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.

380
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:37,837
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.

381
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,099
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.

382
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:43,735
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.

383
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,802
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.

384
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:52,609
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?

385
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:54,681
Nobody by that name in K Company.

386
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:58,588
Yes, there is. He came in with
the new replacements just the other day.

387
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:01,260
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.

388
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:03,691
What's up?

389
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:07,632
That kid they got at last night,
name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.

390
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:12,431
Now I can finish
making out my morning report. Thanks.

391
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:19,743
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.

392
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:22,612
You don't know what hit you.

393
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:26,716
You didn't even know his name.

394
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,521
We didn't even find his dog tags.

395
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,035
<i>Chatsburg News.</i>

396
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:56,443
<i>Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.</i>

397
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,985
I'll take it.

398
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:07,830
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.

399
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,699
You act as if I want a discharge.

400
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:14,196
Man, I like it here.

401
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,670
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going
to choose up sides for a snowball fight.

402
00:43:22,578 --> 00:43:24,944
Hand these letters out
with the rations, Hansan.

403
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:27,710
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.

404
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:31,310
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed
lemonade powder:

405
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:35,488
"Simply add water
and serve ice-cold. Delicious."

406
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:39,885
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.

407
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:44,723
I want to be sure you'll be around to take
over the platoon if I have to go back.

408
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:47,531
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.

409
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:50,598
I want three volunteers
to go out on a patrol.

410
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:52,904
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.

411
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,968
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?

412
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,112
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.

413
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:04,681
G-2 says the Krauts
dropped some paratroops last night.

414
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:08,623
And they might be hiding in that patch
of woods on the other side of that farm.

415
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:12,058
G-2. Wonderful how
they always know what's cooking.

416
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,654
Well, I can tell you something
they do know.

417
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:19,733
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms
infiltrated right through this area.

418
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,068
They blew up a bridge
on the road to Neufchâteau.

419
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,506
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?

420
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,606
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.

421
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:31,375
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.

422
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:35,782
Spoke English perfect. Knew our
password, plan of deployment, everything.

423
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:41,423
Kinnie, how about showing me
the way to the aid station?

424
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,926
I'm freezing.

425
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:46,627
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.

426
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:48,962
Never felt so sick in my life.

427
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:52,831
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.

428
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:58,764
He's really bad.

429
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:02,335
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back
to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.

430
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:05,781
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.

431
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,877
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.

432
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:14,125
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

433
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:17,820
Guys get sick, guys get wounded,
and nothing ever happens to me.

434
00:45:17,896 --> 00:45:20,660
Nothing except that time
you broke your faux choppers.

435
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:24,725
It was when you were back. Kipp found
out you can't keep a man on the line...

436
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:26,795
unless he's got
at least six teeth of his own.

437
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:28,395
I didn't know about that.

438
00:45:28,473 --> 00:45:30,839
So he broke his GI teeth
with the butt of his rifle.

439
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:32,605
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.

440
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:35,475
He was off the line for two weeks
getting a new set made.

441
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,982
Let's get this patrol on the road.

442
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:42,383
That's incoming mail.

443
00:45:53,566 --> 00:45:56,364
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.

444
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:03,668
We've had good deals before,
but this is the best one yet.

445
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:06,709
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.

446
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:09,306
I found a home in the Army.

447
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:27,696
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.

448
00:46:35,174 --> 00:46:37,939
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.

449
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,016
I hope he makes it. They should
never have sent him back on the line.

450
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,320
Some guys just can't take it.

451
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:58,229
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.

452
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,360
My name is Layton.

453
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:04,333
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.

454
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:10,470
Thanks.

455
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,661
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.

456
00:48:06,735 --> 00:48:09,101
A whole division
could be hiding in that forest.

457
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,105
Nice job for a three-man patrol.

458
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:15,633
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how
they'll know we ran into some Krauts.

459
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:32,586
- What's the password?
- Texas.

460
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:35,663
Keep them covered. They may be German.

461
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:39,724
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.

462
00:48:40,303 --> 00:48:42,430
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.

463
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,001
Will this road take us
to Third Bat headquarters?

464
00:48:45,073 --> 00:48:46,802
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.

465
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,811
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?

466
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:55,344
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.

467
00:48:55,418 --> 00:48:58,045
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...

468
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,248
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?

469
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:03,780
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.

470
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,191
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?

471
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:07,956
We're not taking any chances.

472
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,828
What is this?

473
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:14,302
What kind of nonsense...

474
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:16,865
Drop those rifles.

475
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:19,869
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.

476
00:49:19,942 --> 00:49:22,843
<i>- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.</i>

477
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:24,573
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.

478
00:49:24,647 --> 00:49:27,582
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.

479
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,517
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

480
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:35,080
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.

481
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:38,318
May I suggest, sir,
that you study up on baseball?

482
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:40,157
I guess I'd better.

483
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:44,030
By the way, you might tell your buddy
that Cesar Romero is out.

484
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:46,296
She's married to Harry James.

485
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:52,770
Let's go.

486
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,844
They really should have sent out
a bigger patrol.

487
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,683
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?

488
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:36,947
Nobody.

489
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:39,421
I'm just saying
the best way is to tell them...

490
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,982
you heard voices talking in German.

491
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,526
Let's say we heard voices talking
in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.

492
00:50:53,638 --> 00:50:55,401
That paper any good?

493
00:50:56,741 --> 00:51:00,006
<i>Best in the world. Sedalia News.</i>

494
00:51:04,115 --> 00:51:08,177
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and
you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.

495
00:51:08,386 --> 00:51:09,785
Get a load of this.

496
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:13,051
"Our Changing Times,
by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...

497
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:16,560
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist
and her favorite husband...

498
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,858
"now on active duty, US Army."

499
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:21,763
You knew I worked on a newspaper.

500
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:23,994
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.

501
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:27,835
I was too good. I wrote a piece
about the real meaning of the war...

502
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:31,706
the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.

503
00:51:31,777 --> 00:51:34,837
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.

504
00:51:35,915 --> 00:51:38,679
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train...

505
00:51:39,218 --> 00:51:41,243
waving bye-bye to my wife.

506
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:45,786
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.

507
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:50,559
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...

508
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:53,322
I'd get those wire releases...

509
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:57,733
and know that I was the first person
in town who had the news. All the news.

510
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:02,404
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows
what's going on in Bastogne.

511
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:05,835
All I know is
what's happening to the second squad...

512
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,142
in the third platoon of I Company.

513
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,380
Watch this one.

514
00:52:22,128 --> 00:52:23,322
Strike!

515
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:26,789
Can't hit them if you can't see them.

516
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:33,665
Now the count's three and two.

517
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,076
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.

518
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:54,024
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.

519
00:52:54,294 --> 00:52:56,286
Burn it in, boy. Come on.

520
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,927
A hit right over second base.

521
00:53:03,004 --> 00:53:05,995
There, the center fielder
made a shoestring catch. You're out.

522
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:08,898
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?

523
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,069
Don't you get it? Right over second base.

524
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:13,170
- Texas.
- Leaguer.

525
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:15,905
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.

526
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:19,509
Hiya, fellows.

527
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:23,314
What's the situation, Lieutenant?

528
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,361
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.

529
00:53:26,427 --> 00:53:29,590
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.

530
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,656
You can tell them to stop worrying
about this area.

531
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,530
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.

532
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,104
<i>- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.</i>

533
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,198
- So long.
- So long, fellows.

534
00:53:57,759 --> 00:54:00,455
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.

535
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:41,659
Come on!

536
00:55:48,906 --> 00:55:50,635
Kraut tanks!

537
00:55:58,483 --> 00:55:59,973
No. Take off, will you?

538
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:03,315
If they think we're all getting away,
maybe I've got a chance.

539
00:56:03,387 --> 00:56:05,788
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.

540
00:56:14,432 --> 00:56:17,697
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.

541
00:56:57,943 --> 00:56:59,205
Let's go.

542
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:41,578
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.

543
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:44,748
Think we've got enough
antitank grenades to do any good?

544
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:46,452
We ain't got any.

545
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:08,709
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?

546
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:10,306
What?

547
00:58:10,383 --> 00:58:14,342
Sir, our usual defense against tanks
is to call for artillery...

548
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,514
and then run like a jackrabbit.

549
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,922
We've got orders to hold these positions.

550
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:23,191
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery
and keep our heads down.

551
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:27,699
We could send out some bazooka men,
if we had any bazookas.

552
00:58:29,402 --> 00:58:32,099
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.

553
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:43,374
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.

554
00:58:44,085 --> 00:58:45,746
Concentration 17.

555
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:50,651
Item three to ltem:

556
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:54,022
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.

557
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:56,530
Concentration 17.

558
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:01,626
Roger. Start the fireworks.

559
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,762
That's great. Artillery can't miss.

560
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,037
They've got Roderigues to use
for an aiming stick.

561
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:12,011
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues
as soon as this barrage lifts.

562
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,048
With what, a sponge?

563
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:18,913
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?

564
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:21,319
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.

565
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,858
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.

566
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:26,655
Your squad sent for the meat wagon
after the last shelling.

567
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:28,787
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.

568
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,212
Is he bad?

569
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,883
A shell landed
right on the edge of his foxhole.

570
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,977
His shoulder's like a sieve.

571
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,816
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.

572
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,292
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.

573
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:05,563
You're in charge now.

574
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:09,133
Leadership. That's what I got.

575
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:22,145
Where's Roderigues?

576
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:24,648
He'll be along, Pop.

577
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,286
Should have worn my shoulder pads.

578
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:34,687
In a couple of months you'll be flipping
those forward passes as good as ever.

579
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,358
Yeah, left-handed.

580
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,242
He's a good man, Holley...

581
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,241
but still a little jumpy.

582
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,811
He can move in with me.

583
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:55,844
You could do worse.

584
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,550
He sleeps warm and quiet.

585
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,422
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.

586
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,454
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.

587
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,328
Say hello to Standiferd.

588
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:14,395
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?

589
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,773
Is that incoming mail?

590
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,945
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.

591
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:26,574
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.

592
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,647
Where's Roderigues?

593
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,354
Let's take a walk, Pop.

594
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:48,637
How much longer
are they going to leave him out there?

595
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:55,875
<i>Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.</i>

596
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:57,949
I want three volunteers.

597
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,421
It's a long walk, Pop.

598
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:15,723
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.

599
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:18,364
You don't have to, Layton.

600
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:21,369
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.

601
01:02:25,677 --> 01:02:28,441
What are you looking for, Kipp,
your discharge?

602
01:02:28,513 --> 01:02:30,640
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?

603
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:33,843
They were searching me on
a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.

604
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,251
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.

605
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:40,120
I hope it's nice and warm
back where you're going.

606
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:43,921
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.

607
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,101
No! Keep your eye open.

608
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:21,955
He used to see snow
way off in the mountains.

609
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:27,528
They say it's just like going to sleep.

610
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,380
He was a religious kid.

611
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:46,185
When anyone got hit...

612
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:50,323
he used to say it was God's will.

613
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,762
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.

614
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:42,739
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on
yesterday under a news eclipse...

615
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:47,336
"from which filtered the fact that German
armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."

616
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:49,208
We're in Belgium, aren't we?

617
01:05:49,281 --> 01:05:51,840
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.

618
01:05:53,084 --> 01:05:56,680
"War Department authorities report
that morale is high all along the front.

619
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:59,656
"Battle-hardened doughboys

620
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:01,420
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.

621
01:06:01,493 --> 01:06:04,724
"Air activity was halted by
thick, swirling fog.

622

Hey, that's us.

01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:19,201
Then you'll be proud to know
that you are making a heroic stand...

625
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:23,009
"hurling back the best
that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."

626
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:27,348
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.

627
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,750
Is the 101st the only division up here?

628
01:06:29,822 --> 01:06:32,348
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.

629
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:35,724
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.

630
01:06:35,795 --> 01:06:38,592
Well, this might be it. It looks official.

631
01:06:39,332 --> 01:06:40,856
<i>Chatsburg News.</i>

632
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:51,133
<i>And The Dogpatch Gazette.</i>

633
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:56,981
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie,
before those feet of yours get any worse.

634
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:00,076
They won't take frozen feet
unless they start to change color.

635
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:04,523
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.

636
01:07:04,624 --> 01:07:07,252
All they got at the aid station
is aspirin and iodine.

637
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:10,125
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.

638
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:14,900
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.

639
01:07:14,968 --> 01:07:17,904
It must have been after the meat wagon
got there with Wolowicz.

640
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:21,998
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.

641
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:25,340
They say the fight they put up
was one for the book.

642
01:07:42,163 --> 01:07:46,497
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?

643
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:50,837
The dreams are getting better all the time.

644
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:53,704
I was back home in Baltimore...

645
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:58,069
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.

646
01:07:58,712 --> 01:08:01,306
That dream's against regulation, soldier.

647
01:08:01,382 --> 01:08:04,647
You know what our boys overseas
always dream about.

648
01:08:04,985 --> 01:08:07,818
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!

649
01:08:08,223 --> 01:08:11,680
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home...

650
01:08:12,494 --> 01:08:15,554
just give me a hot dog
and a slice of that pie.

651
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,627
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?

652
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,862
No sirree. All I want is a...

653
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:28,006
So long, Holley.

654
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:30,409
So long, Pop.

655
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,505
<i>- Au revoir.
- I found them!</i>

656
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:36,551
I found them in another pocket!

657
01:08:36,985 --> 01:08:40,819
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.

658
01:08:41,556 --> 01:08:45,550
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:

659
01:08:45,861 --> 01:08:48,887
"Private Ernest J. Stazak
will proceed to Paris...

660
01:08:48,964 --> 01:08:52,161
"where transportation to the US
will be arranged."

661
01:08:52,234 --> 01:08:55,226
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?

662
01:08:55,604 --> 01:08:57,766
Here, read it yourself.

663
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,038
I don't care what it says.

664
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:03,339
Nobody's leaving Bastogne,
and nobody's coming in...

665
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:08,013
except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.

666
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:10,150
Surrounded?

667
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:15,388
If this is one of your crummy jokes...

668
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,325
I'll knock those GI teeth
right down your throat.

669
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:27,192
Take it easy, Pop.

670
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:31,331
He wouldn't have those teeth back
in his mouth if there was any way out.

671
01:09:53,563 --> 01:09:55,191
Tough break, Pop.

672
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,931
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.

673
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,572
It's against the rules of war
to shoot at civilians.

674
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:11,739
I'm sorry, Kipp.

675
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:42,971
Them poor devils
in the footslogging infantry...

676
01:10:43,513 --> 01:10:46,142
nothing but walk, walk, walk.

677
01:10:46,217 --> 01:10:48,242
The airborne, that's the life.

678
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,517
It's great up here in these gliders,
drifting along over the clouds.

679
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:22,251
They're liable to have you up
in juvenile court for smoking.

680
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:24,516
This your first time
away from home, Layton?

681
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:27,820
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.

682
01:11:28,726 --> 01:11:31,388
My folks stayed for a while
at a town near camp.

683
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:35,593
Did Mama rub your little footsies
after those nasty 20-mile hikes?

684
01:11:37,436 --> 01:11:40,166
She made me brush my teeth
twice a day...

685
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:43,471
so I wouldn't have to
have them all pulled out.

686
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:54,082
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

687
01:11:54,787 --> 01:11:57,847
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.

688
01:11:57,923 --> 01:12:00,984
You'll die of old age
before you see a shadow around here.

689
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:03,153
This fog ain't never gonna lift.

690
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:06,762
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?

691
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:09,165
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

692
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:10,963
I don't believe that, Kipp.

693
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:13,869
Reverend Layton
will now lead us in prayer.

694
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:16,108
Might not be a bad idea.

695
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:22,575
The C.O. Says you're to dig in
at that railroad embankment.

696
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:25,015
The rest of the company's
moving back 500 yards.

697
01:12:25,085 --> 01:12:26,211
Right.

698
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:33,556
Third platoon,
whenever there's a dirty detail.

699
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:38,220
Let's go, men. On your feet.

700
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:56,748
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.

701
01:12:56,816 --> 01:12:59,513
Listen to Holley,
making a noise like a sergeant.

702
01:12:59,587 --> 01:13:03,716
He's really GI now since he took over
the squad. Right on the ball.

703
01:13:04,225 --> 01:13:06,659
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.

704
01:13:07,294 --> 01:13:09,524
Let's be chicken those bolts.

705
01:13:16,002 --> 01:13:17,663
Check your rifles.

706
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:51,071
Why can't they pass down
some information?

707
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:54,969
If a man gets hit, he must at least know
what country he's dying in.

708
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:57,739
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.

709
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,474
I've asked you 800 times...

710
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:03,040
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.

711
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,083
Can't see them.

712
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:50,612
I'm with you, Holley.

713
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:53,712
Come on.

714
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:21,806
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!

715
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:26,919
Let's go, Abner!

716
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,361
Mama.

717
01:18:58,819 --> 01:19:00,582
Wait till it clears.

718
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:05,678
Hold your fire.

719
01:20:26,175 --> 01:20:29,008
Tell them to come out with their hands up.

720
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:04,836
Layton, you and Joe
check them for maps and papers.

721
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:08,311
See if any of them are still kicking.

722
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:30,840
Get the prisoners and wounded
back to Bastogne, Sergeant.

723
01:21:30,907 --> 01:21:33,103
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.

724
01:21:33,177 --> 01:21:35,872
I'm going to put this man in
for a Silver Star.

725
01:21:58,368 --> 01:22:02,533
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.

726
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:12,343
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.

727
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:14,180
How do you know
what Holley was thinking?

728
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:16,743
How do you know if he was thinking at all?

729
01:22:16,821 --> 01:22:17,981
Things just happen.

730
01:22:18,056 --> 01:22:21,322
Afterwards you try to figure out
why you acted the way you did.

731
01:22:21,393 --> 01:22:24,486
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.

732
01:22:24,662 --> 01:22:28,359
You just joined the biggest club
in the Army. Everybody belongs.

733
01:22:28,433 --> 01:22:32,871
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?

734
01:22:32,937 --> 01:22:34,633
A good thing somebody did.

735
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:37,834
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.

736
01:22:38,109 --> 01:22:41,044
It happened so fast,
you had no time to look at your watch.

737
01:22:41,112 --> 01:22:43,945
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was
in Springfield.

738
01:22:44,015 --> 01:22:47,281
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.

739
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,391
Let's get out of here, chum.

740
01:23:14,646 --> 01:23:16,079
Thanks, Pop.

741
01:23:17,717 --> 01:23:19,343
I'll drop back later.

742
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:21,545
Just don't get carried back.

743
01:23:29,995 --> 01:23:33,192
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?

744
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:38,265
Morphine. Him.

745
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:45,101
No more morphine?

746
01:23:46,379 --> 01:23:47,778
That's great.

747
01:24:20,914 --> 01:24:24,112
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.

748
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:42,030
They're way too big.

749
01:24:43,938 --> 01:24:46,099
I wished we'd found them yesterday.

750
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:50,535
Let's go, men. Chow!

751
01:24:50,612 --> 01:24:53,409
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!

752
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,722
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.

753
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,088
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.

754
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,560
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.

755
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:11,628
I wanted to go back on the line.

756
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:13,894
But they're short-handed
in the kitchen, see.

757
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:16,335
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.

758
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,464
I wouldn't mind a little action
for a change.

759
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:22,534
How about you and me switching?

760
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:26,172
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.

761
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:30,749
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.

762
01:25:31,219 --> 01:25:33,414
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.

763
01:25:35,156 --> 01:25:36,852
I don't even see those things.

764
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:39,291
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.

765
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:51,097
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.

766
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,440
Where's the kid?

767
01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:57,372
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess,
putting on those dry clothes.

768
01:25:57,446 --> 01:26:00,279
Bettis, how about breaking loose
with a bottle of cognac?

769
01:26:00,349 --> 01:26:01,508
We ain't got any.

770
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:04,052
I'll settle for some hot water
to wash my feet in.

771
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:05,712
Coming right up.

772
01:26:13,529 --> 01:26:16,054
Bettis, you got any trading material?

773
01:26:16,132 --> 01:26:19,829
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.

774
01:26:19,902 --> 01:26:21,665
A half a loaf is...

775
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:23,570
Where is it?

776
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,308
I could have sworn it was on that table.

777
01:26:39,755 --> 01:26:41,485
Hello, soldier.

778
01:26:51,101 --> 01:26:53,068
Pull up a chair, Holley.

779
01:26:57,841 --> 01:26:59,808
Today you are a man.

780
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,935
This is Antwerp, up here.

781
01:27:26,336 --> 01:27:29,203
To the north and the east
are the British and the Canadians.

782
01:27:29,272 --> 01:27:33,334
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away,
is the French First Army.

783
01:27:34,078 --> 01:27:37,137
The Americans are stretched out
all the way in between.

784
01:27:38,716 --> 01:27:40,478
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut...

785
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:43,849
at least 20 Allied divisions
will be strictly out on a limb.

786
01:27:44,121 --> 01:27:45,851
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.

787
01:27:47,725 --> 01:27:50,785
This is where the Krauts
found a soft spot in our line.

788
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:53,758
You see why Bastogne is so important.

789
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:56,356
It's at the main intersection
of seven main highways...

790
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:58,902
one of them leading straight to Antwerp.

791
01:27:59,037 --> 01:28:01,028
Don't know if we can hold out.

792
01:28:01,839 --> 01:28:03,739
That sounds like ours.

793
01:28:06,644 --> 01:28:08,009
It is ours!

794
01:28:12,618 --> 01:28:13,879
Can't see a thing.

795
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:16,317
The supplies they've got to drop,
we wouldn't want.

796
01:28:16,387 --> 01:28:18,150
A crate of eggs for Berlin.

797
01:28:18,222 --> 01:28:20,748
If bombers can get through,
why can't C-47s?

798
01:28:20,826 --> 01:28:21,883
In this pea soup?

799
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:24,860
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.

800
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,956
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.

801
01:28:28,033 --> 01:28:31,560
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!

802
01:28:32,037 --> 01:28:34,699
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

803
01:28:35,674 --> 01:28:37,301
You can say that again.

804
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:45,081
I thought they had us surrounded.

805
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:46,609
Halt.

806
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:57,262
I speak English. Who is here in command?

807
01:28:57,763 --> 01:28:59,924
I am here in command.

808
01:29:00,332 --> 01:29:02,892
We have a message
for the commanding general.

809
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:06,496
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.

810
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:29,088
Try it again, Jarvess.

811
01:29:36,903 --> 01:29:39,702
All I can get out of them
is their name and rank.

812
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:43,709
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.

813
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,803
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.

814
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,517
How would you like some nice K rations?

815
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:14,230
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.

816
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:24,916
What did he say?

817
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,948
They want us to surrender.

818
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,246
"Surrender or be killed," he says.

819
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:30,582
Us?

820
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:34,391
Tell him to go take a flying leap
at a rolling doughnut.

821
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:07,623
The Major thinks General McAuliffe
must have misunderstood.

822
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:10,096
We've appealed
to the well-known American humanity...

823
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:13,066
to save the people of Bastogne
from further suffering.

824
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:17,662
We have given you two hours to consider
before raining destruction upon you.

825
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,799
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.

826
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:24,543
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"

827
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:38,526
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?

828
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:40,755
"Nuts" is strictly negative.

829
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,331
We will kill many Americans.

830
01:31:54,277 --> 01:31:55,905
On your way, bud.

831
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:26,834
I feel better. For once we know
what's going on around here.

832
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:28,241
For once we get the story...

833
01:32:28,312 --> 01:32:31,577
before my wife writes it up
and it's the daily news.

834
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,060
Here goes my last butt.

835
01:33:18,429 --> 01:33:21,455
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.

836
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,426
Chaplain. I forgot.

837
01:33:26,304 --> 01:33:28,272
We've got nothing to worry about.

838
01:33:28,339 --> 01:33:31,934
Holy Joe is going to pray for us
at the Christmas services.

839
01:33:36,014 --> 01:33:39,575
"They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength.

840
01:33:40,318 --> 01:33:43,151
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles."

841
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,616
If the fog lifts.

842
01:33:48,059 --> 01:33:50,550
"They shall run, and not be weary."

843
01:33:51,662 --> 01:33:53,858
Unless they have frozen feet.

844
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:57,761
"And they shall walk, and not faint."

845
01:33:58,737 --> 01:34:02,036
If they don't lose too much blood
before the medics come up.

846
01:34:23,062 --> 01:34:25,530
Another airmail message from the Krauts.

847
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:29,891
"Merry Christmas, soldier,
and our deepest sympathy.

848
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:33,099
"It's tough being away from home
at this time of year...

849
01:34:33,172 --> 01:34:36,437
"especially when you're surrounded
and outnumbered 10-to-1.

850
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:41,106
"Don't you feel your loved ones
worrying about you, praying for you?

851
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:44,617
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping
you'll come home again.

852
01:34:45,251 --> 01:34:48,880
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?

853
01:34:49,288 --> 01:34:52,587
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.

854
01:34:53,192 --> 01:34:57,630
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you
only 300 yards away."

855
01:35:47,848 --> 01:35:49,213
Anybody here from Ohio?

856
01:35:49,283 --> 01:35:50,807
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.

857
01:35:50,885 --> 01:35:52,785
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.

858
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:55,947
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?

859
01:35:56,023 --> 01:35:57,684
Here, sir.

860
01:35:57,758 --> 01:36:00,090
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.

861
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:02,857
So am I.

862
01:36:03,497 --> 01:36:07,627
These services aren't just for Lutherans,
any more than just for men from Ohio.

863
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,794
I merely happen to be in your area.

864
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:14,239
In other areas, there are other chaplains
of various denominations and religions.

865
01:36:14,843 --> 01:36:17,276
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.

866
01:36:18,513 --> 01:36:21,346
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services...

867
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:23,680
for some of the men of the Jewish faith.

868
01:36:23,752 --> 01:36:25,480
How did I do, Levenstein?

869
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:27,384
Not bad for a beginner, sir.

870
01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:32,148
Now it's nearly Christmas...

871
01:36:32,227 --> 01:36:35,924
and here we are in beautiful Bastogne
enjoying the winter sports.

872
01:36:38,099 --> 01:36:40,260
And the $64 question is:

873
01:36:40,735 --> 01:36:42,760
"Was this trip necessary?"

874
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:51,812
I'll try to answer that.

875
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,348
But my sermons,
like everything else in the army...

876
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:56,577
depend on the situation and the terrain.

877
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:59,519
So I assure you
this is going to be a quickie.

878
01:36:59,588 --> 01:37:01,716
Was this trip necessary?

879
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:05,655
Let's look at the facts.

880
01:37:05,927 --> 01:37:08,418
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.

881
01:37:08,831 --> 01:37:12,927
A great many people tried to deal
with them, and a lot of them are dead.

882
01:37:13,069 --> 01:37:14,433
Millions have died...

883
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:17,994
for no other reason
except that the Nazis wanted them dead.

884
01:37:18,074 --> 01:37:22,238
So, in the final showdown,
there was nothing left to do except fight.

885
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:25,604
There's a great lesson in this.

886
01:37:25,981 --> 01:37:29,315
Those of us who've learned it
the hard way aren't going to forget it.

887
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:34,084
We must never again
let any force dedicated to a super-race...

888
01:37:34,423 --> 01:37:37,119
or a super-idea, or super-anything...

889
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,688
become strong enough
to impose itself upon a free world.

890
01:37:41,497 --> 01:37:44,625
We must be smart enough
and tough enough in the beginning...

891
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,499
to put out the fire
before it starts spreading.

892
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:51,205
So my answer to the $64 question is:

893
01:37:51,907 --> 01:37:54,933
Yes, this trip was necessary.

894
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,172
As the years go by,
a lot of people are going to forget.

895
01:38:00,349 --> 01:38:01,839
But you won't.

896
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:04,282
And don't ever let anybody tell you...

897
01:38:04,353 --> 01:38:07,754
you were a sucker
to fight in the war against Fascism.

898
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:11,522
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.

899
01:38:14,631 --> 01:38:16,929
Let us pray for this fog to lift.

900
01:38:18,168 --> 01:38:19,795
Almighty God...

901
01:38:25,509 --> 01:38:29,707
The organist is hitting those bass notes
a little too loud for me to be heard.

902
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:33,307
So let us each pray in his own way,
to his own God.

903
01:39:14,892 --> 01:39:17,657
When you hear planes, men,
don't bother to look up.

904
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:19,095
They'll be ours.

905
01:39:19,264 --> 01:39:21,788
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.

906
01:39:24,737 --> 01:39:29,332
Layton, you haven't got
a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?

907
01:39:29,742 --> 01:39:32,005
I'm on that new lemonade diet.

908
01:39:32,076 --> 01:39:35,341
Drop another nickel in the jukebox,
will you, chum?

909
01:39:39,984 --> 01:39:42,578
<i>We interrupt this program
with an important announcement.</i>

910
01:39:42,654 --> 01:39:45,623
<i>A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...</i>

911
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:47,784
<i>lead to the following weather forecast.</i>

912
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:51,887
<i>Continued cold, more snow,
and no sign of the fog lifting.</i>

913
01:39:52,297 --> 01:39:55,460
<i>And now an old favorite,
which is growing more and more popular...</i>

914
01:39:55,534 --> 01:39:59,026
<i>with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.</i>

915
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:23,660
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.

916
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,664
What am I supposed to use
for ammunition? Spitballs?

917
01:40:26,733 --> 01:40:28,791
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.

918
01:40:28,867 --> 01:40:32,395
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.

919
01:40:32,472 --> 01:40:34,269
Try and get some news on that radio.

920
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:38,401
Krauts have got it jammed up,
everything except their own wavelength.

921
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:39,978
I'll try again.

922
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:45,140
They ain't even dug in.

923
01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:46,583
- Holley.
- What?

924
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:50,117
Is there anything to those stories
about Krauts shooting prisoners?

925
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:53,489
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.

926
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:57,318
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol
on you when you're captured...

927
01:40:57,397 --> 01:40:58,989
they blow your brains out with it.

928
01:40:59,065 --> 01:41:01,226
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.

929
01:41:03,036 --> 01:41:06,200
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.

930
01:41:07,607 --> 01:41:09,074
Thanks a lot.

931
01:41:09,709 --> 01:41:13,611
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act
for a civilian to carry firearms.

932
01:41:28,496 --> 01:41:31,522
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.

933
01:41:32,867 --> 01:41:34,960
Other side of the hill! Dig in!

934
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:04,161
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

935
01:42:04,232 --> 01:42:07,962
leads me to believe
that German bombers are over Bastogne...

936
01:42:08,136 --> 01:42:09,626
fog or no fog.

937
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:14,501
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.

938
01:42:14,976 --> 01:42:16,443
Yeah, I've been thinking...

939
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:18,705
the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant...

940
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:21,908
the pill roller who gives us those shots
with a square needle...

941
01:42:21,983 --> 01:42:23,848
I'm bleeding for them.

942
01:42:45,674 --> 01:42:47,335
<i>... let me avoid death...</i>

943
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:49,240
<i>let me have forgiveness...</i>

944
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:51,041
<i>the eternal farewell.</i>

945
01:43:40,363 --> 01:43:42,525
Fall out in and draw a rifle!

946
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:45,226
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.

947
01:43:46,936 --> 01:43:50,270
The medics told me I wasn't supposed
to go up anymore. You can check.

948
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:51,966
Get your blanket.

949
01:44:04,554 --> 01:44:07,421
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!

950
01:44:09,626 --> 01:44:11,652
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.

951
01:44:11,728 --> 01:44:14,253
Follow me, all of you, on the double!

952
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:22,327
That's all, brother.

953
01:44:23,573 --> 01:44:25,803
Hey, you! Front and center!

954
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:33,377
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.

955
01:44:33,451 --> 01:44:37,046
Last time I was out on the range,
they were still using the.03.

956
01:44:37,988 --> 01:44:40,958
All litter cases will prepare
to be evacuated immediately...

957
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,356
to air raid shelters.

958
01:44:42,427 --> 01:44:45,658
All walking wounded
will fall out and draw rifles.

959
01:45:16,962 --> 01:45:20,829
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated,
clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.

960
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:24,426
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.

961
01:45:24,503 --> 01:45:28,462
To load it, you just pull the bolt back
like this, and stick the clip in.

962
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:40,078
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.

963
01:45:40,954 --> 01:45:44,047
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.

964
01:46:06,846 --> 01:46:09,406
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.

965
01:46:14,887 --> 01:46:17,823
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.

966
01:46:18,524 --> 01:46:20,652
Lieutenant, take the second squad.

967
01:46:20,794 --> 01:46:24,161
First squad! Third squad! Over here.

968
01:46:48,689 --> 01:46:50,280
Save it, Layton.

969
01:46:50,456 --> 01:46:54,017
They'll be getting a lot closer,
and we'll still be here.

970
01:47:54,222 --> 01:47:55,712
It's shining!

971
01:48:17,245 --> 01:48:18,770
How have you been?

972
01:48:25,288 --> 01:48:29,383
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!

973
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:44,139
Drive them out of there! Blast them!

974
01:48:49,178 --> 01:48:50,975
C-47s!

975
01:49:09,031 --> 01:49:10,521
What was that about eagles?

976
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:13,068
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles.

977
01:49:24,348 --> 01:49:26,248
"They shall run and not be weary."

978
01:49:26,315 --> 01:49:29,114
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

979
01:50:19,937 --> 01:50:23,395
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?

980
01:50:23,674 --> 01:50:26,700
I got a little old lamp I got to fill
back in Bastogne.

981
01:50:44,262 --> 01:50:45,594
K rations.

982
01:50:46,698 --> 01:50:48,096
All dinners.

983
01:50:55,074 --> 01:50:57,008
Hey, fellows, here it is.

984
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,477
Hey, fellows, come and get it.

985
01:51:13,693 --> 01:51:15,284
Here, take your watch.

986
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:37,308
Daddy, what are them things?

987
01:52:38,979 --> 01:52:42,471
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.

988
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:44,814
<i>Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.</i>

989
01:52:44,885 --> 01:52:47,115
What will they think of next?

990
01:52:47,855 --> 01:52:50,881
Tank job, cigarette for papa?

991
01:52:53,994 --> 01:52:55,962
<i>Got a Stars and Stripes?</i>

992
01:52:58,132 --> 01:53:01,295
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.

993
01:53:03,438 --> 01:53:06,464
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.

994
01:53:09,743 --> 01:53:11,233
Hey, handsome.

995
01:53:13,715 --> 01:53:15,045
Good luck!

996
01:53:22,056 --> 01:53:25,082
The folks back home
knew we'd get out of this.

997
01:53:25,426 --> 01:53:28,725
They heard relief was breaking through
two days ago.

998
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:32,099
Fine. I'd hate to think
they'd been worrying.

999
01:53:33,935 --> 01:53:37,302
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium,
not Luxembourg.

1000
01:53:38,273 --> 01:53:41,333
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.

1001
01:53:41,409 --> 01:53:43,934
You mean you're not happy in the service?

1002
01:53:44,013 --> 01:53:46,504
I didn't say that. I love it.

1003
01:53:46,982 --> 01:53:48,813
You found a home in the Army, chum.

1004
01:53:48,883 --> 01:53:51,647
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.

1005
01:54:31,027 --> 01:54:34,463
Third platoon, on your feet.

1006
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,328
Fall in.

1007
01:54:41,203 --> 01:54:43,434
Oh, no!

1008
01:55:19,177 --> 01:55:21,371
About face.

1009
01:55:35,393 --> 01:55:37,418
Forward march.

1010
01:55:59,116 --> 01:56:01,142
Whatever happened to Jody?

1011
01:56:11,696 --> 01:56:13,426
All right. Come on.

1012
01:56:13,531 --> 01:56:16,466
What do you want these guys to think,
you're a bunch of WACs?

1013
01:56:16,534 --> 01:56:19,935
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.

1014
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:32,928
