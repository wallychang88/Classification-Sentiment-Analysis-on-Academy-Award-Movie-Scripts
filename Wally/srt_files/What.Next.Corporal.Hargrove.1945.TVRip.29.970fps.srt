00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,376
What Next, Corporal Hargrove? (1945)

[Band playing You're
in the Army Now]

[Band playing The Caissons
Go Rolling Along]

4
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,953
A few short weeks after
D-Day, the allied

5
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:39,093
forces broke out of the
Normandy Peninsula.

6
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,766
Most of the American
army was racing

7
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:45,169
across the plains and fields
of France toward Paris...

8
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,371
Most, but not all.

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,207
Man: All right. Heave!

10
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,177
Heave!

11
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,247
Come on, fellas! All together!
Heave!

12
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,349
Cut it, Lupot! Cut it!

13
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,818
[Truck idling]

14
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,854
You know, this is almost as
tough as basic training.

15
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,857
Well, it won't be too long till
V-E Day. Let's just sit it out.

16
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,192
If I don't get this gun up
on that road and catch up

17
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,361
with the battery, you know what's
going to happen to me, don't you?

18
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,963
Yeah. You'll get busted.

19
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,666
That's right. I've been a
corporal for 5 days now,

20
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,835
and I want to make
it an even week.

21
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:19,737
All right, fellas, now, once
more. Start it up, Lupot!

22
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,238
Here we go!

23
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,174
Heave!

24
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
Hargrove!

25
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,244
Yes, sir... I mean,
yes, sergeant.

26
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,379
Where is Sergeant Hill?

27
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,314
Uh, well, he left
me with the unit,

28
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,916
and he went on a
reconnaissance,

29
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,251
and then we got shoved
off into the ditch.

30
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
It was either them or us,
and they were officers.

31
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,856
All right, keep trying
to get started,

32
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,858
and I'll see if I can't
send back a wrecker.

33
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,893
Send a mess truck, too, sarge.
We may be here for days.

34
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,928
Now, we're headed for Mardenne.
That's about 40 miles.

35
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,163
Here's a map, and I'll
show you where it is.

36
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,465
Just stay with this road.

37
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,233
If you can't catch
up with the battery,

38
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,941
check with the M.P.s
handling the traffic.

39
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,938
All right, let's get started
around here. Come on. Get busy.

40
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,941
Fighters coming in!

41
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,154
Uh, turned out to be
our own, sergeant.

42
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:12,423
Fathead.

43
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,458
Now, use your head, Hargrove,

44
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,694
and don't get fouled up
behind the German lines.

45
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:19,597
Don't lose your gun, and
whatever you do, don't open fire

46
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,567
on anything or anybody that
doesn't first open fire on you.

47
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,935
Right.

48
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,838
All right, let's get
busy around here.

49
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,845
You know, he doesn't
seem to have

50
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,379
much confidence
in me, does he?

51
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,848
I wonder why.

52
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,883
Don't worry about a
thing, corporal.

53
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,885
The crew is with youse 100%.

54
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,386
Thanks, Burk. Let's get going.

55
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:44,889
Lupot, when I give you the
signal, you gun her like mad.

56
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,391
Everybody back to their original
positions on the double.

57
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,893
"On the double."

58
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,828
I knew we'd get to
that before long.

59
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,230
We'll get her out this time,
fellas. I'll help you.

60
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,599
Heave!

61
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,200
[Everyone yelling]

62
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,168
Come on!

63
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,703
Keep it going!

64
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,204
Watch it, corporal!

65
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,839
Heave! Come on, push!

66
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,042
Don't break your
backs on me, now.

67
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,610
Hey! Hey, come on!

68
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,579
[Men cheering]

69
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,822
Corporal Hargrove, sir.

70
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,191
We're "B" Battery,
352nd Field Artillery.

71
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,659
You're blocking
traffic, corporal.

72
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,294
Get that truck off the road.

73
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,001
But, sir, we're trying
to rejoin our unit.

74
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,864
I'm sorry, corporal. I have
a priority column here.

75
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,232
Get that truck off the road.

76
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,201
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,470
Back in the ditch, Lupot.

78
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,319
Well, come on, Hargrove.
Think of something.

79
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,954
Heave.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,601
We're not getting
anywhere on this road.

81
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,237
The battery might move again, and we'll
never catch up to Sergeant Cramp.

82
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,338
Hey! Hey!

83
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,206
I think I've worked out
a shortcut, though,

84
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,408
if a certain side road
up ahead is open.

85
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:13,344
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

86
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,346
Oh, sure. You're the corporal.

87
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,948
The intersection
is plainly marked.

88
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,249
There's a side road

89
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,685
that goes directly
into the town we want.

90
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,022
Well, here it is on the map.
Look for yourself.

91
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,057
Burk: Corporal, you
got something.

92
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,226
We're on a road now.
That's good enough for me.

93
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,663
Are you going to defy an order

94
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,098
issued by the supreme
commander of this truck?

95
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,533
No, corporal.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,368
All right. By the authority

97
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,704
of the power invested in me,

98
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,438
we're going to
take the shortcut.

99
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:42,540
Burk: Mais oui!

100
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,208
How is your French
coming, Billy?

101
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,777
Get a load of this:

102
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,079
Ne cirez pas les bouts de ma
moustache, s'il vous plait.

103
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,067
Hargrove: Wonderful! Hey,
fellas, listen to this.

104
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,816
Go on, bill. Give it to them.

105
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,854
Ne cirez pas les bouts de ma
moustache, s'il vous plait.

106
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,023
What does that mean?

107
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:04,295
It means "please do not wax
the ends of my mustache."

108
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:07,431
Great, great. Well, from now
on, you're staff interpreter.

109
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,300
I learned another one, too.

110
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,969
Ne decrochez pas les chevaux

111
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:16,808
parce que le patron a ete
abattu par l'eclair.

112
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,810
What does that mean?

113
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,845
It means...

114
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,814
Do not unhitch the horses,

115
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,817
as the innkeeper has been
struck by lightning.

116
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:29,553
I hope I come to something that's about
girls or eating pretty soon.

117
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:30,855
Man: Ah, girls!

118
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,156
Eating!

119
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,859
You know, I wish you
wouldn't get me thinking

120
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,195
about girls and eating
at the same time.

121
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,763
It's very confusing.

122
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,864
I wish we'd stop pretty soon

123
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,365
and let that mail
catch up to us.

124
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,334
Hey, yeah, you got some royalties
coming to you from that book.

125
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,169
Who wants royalties? I
want to hear from Carol.

126
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,337
She had some pictures made.

127
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:47,872
She's going to
send them to me.

128
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,373
Pictures? He's got
12 of them now.

129
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,808
11.

130
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,810
Ellerton, you will
appreciate these,

131
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,812
being a true artist.

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,580
Her name is Carol...

133
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,582
Men: And she lives
in New York,

134
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,584
and she has brown
hair and blue eyes,

135
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,320
and she works for
the Red Cross.

136
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,322
Did I mention her before?

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,824
She's a swell girl.

138
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,592
Ah, you guys are just jealous.

139
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,560
Lupot!

140
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:10,828
Lupot: Yo!

141
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,097
Head down the road until
you hit that intersection,

142
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,299
about 4 miles. We're going
to take a shortcut.

143
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,834
Lupot: Yo!

144
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,036
I'll direct you from there.

145
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:28,819
Sergeant, we're not
going into position

146
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,330
around Mardenne. We're
moving on ahead of it.

147
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,110
The French have liberated the town, and
other units will move in to clean it up.

148
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,171
Yes, sir.

149
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,586
[Snaps fingers]

150
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:36,654
Hargrove.

151
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:37,655
What is it, sergeant?

152
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,123
Sir, I've got one gun

153
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,325
and a crew back on the road...
Corporal Hargrove.

154
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:44,095
They were stalled an hour, and
Hargrove's headed for Mardenne.

155
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,363
Well, go on back
and tell them.

156
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,665
Yes, sir.

157
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,066
Come on.

158
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,839
Lupot!

159
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:55,973
Yo.

160
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,474
That's the road I want
up ahead, to the left.

161
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,542
Ok, corporal.

162
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,278
Oh, boy. At the
rate we're going,

163
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:02,065
we'll catch up with that
battery in no time.

164
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,915
Hargrove: We're headed
for Mardenne, sergeant.

165
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,817
We're going to
rejoin our battery.

166
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,151
Well, go ahead.

167
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,220
All right, go ahead, Lupot!

168
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,302
If we keep on going in
this direction, sarge,

169
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,337
we'll be back where
we came in on D-Day.

170
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,006
That fatheaded Hargrove. I wonder
what could have happened to him.

171
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:31,008
Maybe he made a
separate peace.

172
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,244
Come on. Let's get
back to the battery.

173
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,559
Man: Nice landing, corporal.

174
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:52,296
Ha ha ha!

175
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,832
Boy, I ruined my tail
assembly on that one.

176
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,434
Hargrove, what did
you see up there?

177
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,503
Not a sign of the
United States Army.

178
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:01,038
Didn't expect you would.

179
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,139
Why?

180
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,807
Well, it's just
that I didn't see

181
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,476
any "K" ration boxes
along the road.

182
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,178
Everywhere the army's been,
you find those boxes.

183
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,348
Yeah, and there's no
wire laid along here.

184
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,815
Hmm.

185
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,251
How's that, corporal?

186
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:14,352
Uh-huh.

187
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,320
You know, I'd know
that uh-huh anyplace.

188
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,023
That means we're in trouble
and we're headed for more.

189
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,361
Oh, I wouldn't say that. That's the
town up ahead. I'm positive of that.

190
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,298
I'm just a little curious about what
happened to the rest of the army.

191
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,635
Well, Mardenne is our position,
and that's where we're going...

192
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,637
If I have to take the
town singlehanded.

193
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:35,373
Burk: That's the
stuff, corporal.

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,342
Hargrove: All right, let's get out our
camouflage. Mulvehill, get out of there!

195
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,078
You and Burk cut down some of
that shrubbery... on the double.

196
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,392
Hold still, will you?

197
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,692
It tickles.

198
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,262
Hargrove's right. We got to
be camouflaged, don't we?

199
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,398
I may get the Chestnut Blight.

200
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,100
Well, we'll get a tree
surgeon to spray you.

201
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,648
Hold it, Lupot. Hold it.
Pull over to the side.

202
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,551
Not in the ditch.

203
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,857
Hargrove: I'm going
on reconnaissance.

204
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,393
Hey, corp, you don't want to go in
there alone. Let me go with you.

205
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,561
Men: Yeah.

206
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,196
Shh! Quiet.

207
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,667
I'm going to sneak up that ditch and
see if I can't locate the battery.

208
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,936
I can do it much better alone.

209
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,438
Men, reluctantly: Ok.

210
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:44,641
Now, you stay here, and
above all, keep quiet.

211
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,713
[Canteens clatter]

212
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,148
Quiet.

213
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:54,918
[Whispering] Hey, corporal,
we won't make a sound.

214
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,830
[Children shouting]

215
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,366
The Americans are coming!

216
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,034
Man: The Americans!

217
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,802
Man: Get the mayor!

218
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,371
Get the mayor!

219
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,872
The Americans are coming!

220
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:17,008
Monsieur le maire,
the Americans.

221
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,610
They're on the side road.
They're coming this way.

222
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,612
Jeannie, do you hear?
The Americans.

223
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,114
Get my hat and coat!

224
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,483
There's one cannon and
a truck of soldiers.

225
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,285
I saw them plainly. The
others will surely follow.

226
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,254
Jeanne: I want to go, too!

227
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,722
Come, come. Summon everyone

228
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,758
and bring flowers and
wine and food! Come!

229
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:38,662
Man: Let's go! Come on!
The Americans are coming!

230
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,518
Go on. Scat!

231
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:03,854
Get out of here, you little...
You little saboteur.

232
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,589
Get out of here.

233
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,127
Go on! Go on!

234
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,466
Stop here! We'll
greet them here!

235
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,034
And silence!

236
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,370
Perhaps we should go down
the road to meet them.

237
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,940
No. We'll wait here and receive
them with proper dignity.

238
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:27,511
Oh, it will be a brave sight...
this big American army,

239
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,547
their colors flying,

240
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:32,416
music. Maybe they
have their own band.

241
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:33,884
Jeanne: Yes!

242
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,187
We must give them
a big welcome!

243
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,822
Voila! There they are!
There they are!

244
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,625
Wait! Wait! Don't
touch anything!

245
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,898
Is this Mardenne?

246
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,335
Yes, it is. Are you
the American army?

247
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,571
Well, yes. I'm part of it.

248
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:55,573
[Cheering]

249
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,744
As the Mayor of Mardenne...

250
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,247
excuse me. A little
improvised speech.

251
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,683
As the Mayor of Mardenne
and as the leader

252
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,154
of our French forces of resistance
in our district here...

253
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,655
I have many other functions,

254
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,457
but I don't want to
mention it here...

255
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,927
I have the great privilege
and great pleasure

256
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,796
to greet our dear friends,

257
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,632
our liberators,

258
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,034
the American armed forces!

259
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:26,270
[Cheering]

260
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:33,076
Well, thanks, uh... On
behalf of myself, uh...

261
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,946
Well, on behalf of
myself, thanks.

262
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,482
I thank you... ahem... too.

263
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,084
Uh, now, if you
will come with me,

264
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,620
m-Mr...

265
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,488
Oh, excuse me. Oh.

266
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:45,789
Lieutenant.

267
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:48,058
Oh, no. Corporal.

268
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,627
Oh, corporal.

269
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:52,296
Oh, corporal! Oh, that's a
very honorable rank.

270
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,930
I myself was corporal

271
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,567
in the last war in
our glorious army,

272
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,068
so it's nothing, uh...

273
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,070
Now, if you want to...

274
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,839
oh. It's, uh... Oh, yes.
That's my daughter...

275
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,741
Jeannie...

276
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:07,211
And corporal...

277
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,146
Uh, Hargrove, mayor.

278
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,148
Hargrove mayor... uh,
Hargrove, mayor.

279
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,350
[Laughter]

280
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,927
Now, if you'll summon
your comrades,

281
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:27,665
we can go to my house
and have a nice lunch.

282
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,700
Man: Did somebody say lunch?

283
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,203
Just lead on, governor.
Lead on.

284
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,370
Woman: Ooh!

285
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,206
[Crowd cheering]

286
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,408
Mayor: Here they are!

287
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,314
Of course, we knocked out so many tanks
and vehicles in the first advance,

288
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:45,349
it was very difficult
to keep track of them,

289
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,552
but I was able to keep track
of what we destroyed each day.

290
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,689
I have a little list right here.
Ah, here it is.

291
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,657
Uh...

292
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:57,094
Uh, 123 tanks, assorted sizes.

293
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,863
63 armored cars,
that's including half-tracks.

294
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,833
236 trucks... Vehicles,

295
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,803
not counting horse-drawn
carts or squad cars.

296
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,806
Of course, we owe
all our success

297
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,475
to our leader Hargrove.

298
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,976
Oh, Corporal Hargrove.

299
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,545
Fine type. Wonderful man.

300
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,480
You can take my word for it,

301
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,449
he won't be a
corporal for long.

302
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:19,783
Man: He's to be promoted?

303
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,752
Well, I can't say definitely,

304
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,955
but believe me, he
won't stay a corporal.

305
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,457
Ah, what coolness.

306
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:27,524
Mmm.

307
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,526
What daring, what courage.

308
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,027
What an imagination.

309
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,195
Oh, imagination.

310
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,464
Oh!

311
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:37,401
Yes, those are the real
qualities of a military man.

312
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,871
I can say it because somehow
I'm in the same position,

313
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,373
but I...

314
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,608
Well, I wonder where the
sightseeing party is.

315
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,943
They've been gone 2 hours now,

316
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,713
and they only paid
for the hour tour.

317
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,815
Man: I think I hear them
now, Monsieur Himmeville.

318
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,317
Mulvehill: Uh, it's Mulvehill.

319
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,085
M...Himmeville, yes.

320
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,288
Oh, yes, here he is...
Corporal Hargrove.

321
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,323
Mayor: Oh, good evening!
Welcome, corporal.

322
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,692
Hargrove: Quite a town
you've got here, mayor.

323
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,695
And we have had a fine
talk with Monsieur M...

324
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,163
Mulvehill:
That's right, indeed.

325
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,732
Hargrove: You didn't sell
them anything, did you?

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,568
Uh, well, mayor, Private Mulvehill
is quite a good talker.

327
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:14,338
Mayor: Oh, yes. Where did you
leave your comrades, corporal?

328
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,106
Oh, I wanted to tell
you about that.

329
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,874
I saw a big barn
down the road,

330
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,778
and Jeanne told me that it was
empty, so if you don't mind,

331
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,946
I'd like to billet the
boys there for the night.

332
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,348
D'historio's barn, father.

333
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,351
In a barn? Impossible.
No, I can't allow that.

334
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,320
Hargrove: But I don't
like to impose on you.

335
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,907
Oh, please, corporal. A man with
your record, your achievements,

336
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,857
to sleep in a stable...
I'm ashamed.

337
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,859
That would be an
insult to our allies.

338
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:39,262
After all, Marion, if our good friends
want to make us more comfortable...

339
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,532
excuse me, sir, but what has
this con man been telling you?

340
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,367
Con man? What's that...
con man?

341
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,404
Oh, con man is an American
phrase meaning friend.

342
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,905
Hargrove: Oh, it does?

343
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:51,575
Mayor: No. Not a word.
Come, follow me. My hat.

344
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,144
Hargrove: But, mayor,
the barn is fine.

345
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,681
Ha ha ha!

346
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,517
Yahoo-hoo-hoo!

347
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,185
Mulvehill: Burk! Burk!

348
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,421
Didn't you learn any manners

349
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,323
with those French lessons?

350
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,760
Get your filthy feet
off that spread!

351
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,769
Ahh!

352
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:23,640
Oh, you were going to get it fixed
for us to stay in a stable.

353
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,908
What a fixer!

354
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,543
How do you like this?

355
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,345
You know, something's wrong.

356
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,347
They're treating me as if I
was a big shot or something.

357
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,350
Well, that's your natural
manner... very impressive.

358
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:37,821
You know, the mayor said you
reminded him of a tall Napoleon?

359
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,056
He did? Well, there
you are, you see?

360
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:42,058
They think I'm a
visiting diplomat.

361
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,727
Well, just be diplomatic.

362
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,764
If you ever get stuck with
anything, just call on me.

363
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,098
Yeah?

364
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:53,470
Especially if you get stuck
with the mayor's daughter.

365
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:57,107
Yeah. I tried to kiss her on the
way over here, and she said,

366
00:17:57,174 --> 00:18:00,411
[Imitating jeanne] "No! It would
not be fair to the corporal!"

367
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,512
What?

368
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,714
Jeanne: Corporal?
Corporal Hargrove?

369
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,848
Uh-huh.

370
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,483
Look, tell her I'm not in.

371
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,452
Tell her I was
called out of town.

372
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,509
Mulvehill: I will
not permit you to

373
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:12,856
jeopardize my comfort,
Corporal Hargrove.

374
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,225
Uh, the corporal will
be right down...

375
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,727
Honey.

376
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,034
Oh! Hey, it's nice up here.

377
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,036
So peaceful and quiet.

378
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:31,141
Let's sit down, shall we?
It's quite a climb to the top.

379
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,810
Sure.

380
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,952
Out that way is
the next village,

381
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,856
where he have the fire and
the cinema in peacetime.

382
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,259
Also, there are
the school and...

383
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,795
There is a stadium for games.

384
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,797
Is that a fact?

385
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,999
Well, isn't that interesting?

386
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,937
Uh, you don't have
a coat, Jeanne?

387
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,939
Aren't you a little cold?

388
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,239
No.

389
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,942
Are you cold?

390
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,276
No.

391
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,311
No. As a matter of fact,

392
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,547
I was thinking it
was rather warm.

393
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,483
Also, in the village
over there...

394
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,384
you know, speaking
of the stadium,

395
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:17,688
you don't happen to know any recent
American baseball scores, do you?

396
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:20,223
Baseball? Oh, it is a game?

397
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,258
Oh, wonderful game.

398
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:25,128
Is that the only
game you play?

399
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,297
Well, no. Uh... But
it just so happens

400
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,566
that it's a very close
race for the pennant

401
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,568
in the National
League this year.

402
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,716
You see, I'll explain it to you.
There are 8 teams...

403
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,171
your friend Mulvehill,

404
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:39,175
when he walked with me,
he tried to kiss me.

405
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,343
Oh...

406
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,112
Well, about the pennant,

407
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,849
the winning team then plays the
winning team in the American League,

408
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,018
and that's what we
call the World Series.

409
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,621
Of course, I would
not let him kiss me.

410
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:52,623
Well, I should think not...
that wolf.

411
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,291
Wolf? You mean like
the animal wolf?

412
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,962
Well, it's what we call a
fella who chases after girls.

413
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,498
Anyway, the world series
consists of 7 games,

414
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,801
and the team who
wins 4 out of the 7

415
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,336
becomes the world's champion.

416
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,338
But you are not a wolf?

417
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,806
Me?

418
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,176
No.

419
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,712
You wish for the girls
to chase after you, hmm?

420
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,213
Oh, no, no. Not that.

421
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:20,316
Oh, but it is clear.
If you are the wolf,

422
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,952
then you chase
after the girls.

423
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,387
If you are not the wolf,

424
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:27,891
then the girls chase after you.
What else?

425
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,292
Well...

426
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,029
You know, there must be
some answer to that,

427
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,465
but, uh, I just can't
think of it right now.

428
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,636
Isn't it, uh, getting
awfully late, Jeanne?

429
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,371
Only about 9:00.

430
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,806
9:00?

431
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,875
Oh, well, I've got to
get home to my boys.

432
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,309
They're my responsibility.

433
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:49,179
All right, Mr. Wolf.

434
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,586
Hargrove: Well, the battery
must have been sidetracked,

435
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,754
so I can't say how long
we're going to be here.

436
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,322
[Man speaking
French excitedly]

437
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,792
Jeannie, help me!
My wife, the baby.

438
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,194
We are all alone. I
run all the way...

439
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,196
we must get Madame Godinot.
Come!

440
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,999
What's he so excited about? His
wife and baby are all alone?

441
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,636
No, no. My wife is
going to have a baby!

442
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,571
Oh! Oh, well, let's go.

443
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,208
Hey, wait a minute. What
do you want me for?

444
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,210
Oh, it is too far.

445
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,345
If you could take us in
your truck, it would help.

446
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,214
Oh. Oh, well, come on.

447
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:30,621
She's in here.

448
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,623
Godinot: We will send
for you in due time.

449
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,124
Man: Yes, madame.

450
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:36,660
Be sure and tell
her to be calm.

451
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,329
And you, my friend,

452
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:42,565
my benefactor, am I not calm?

453
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,200
Well, sure.

454
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,403
Oh!

455
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:50,007
Yeah, you're getting
calmer all the time.

456
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,742
Boil water!

457
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,511
Yes, sergeant!
Uh, yes, madame.

458
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:57,313
Funny how she reminds
me of Cramp.

459
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,420
All right. Up!

460
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,488
Soldier!

461
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:06,857
Yes, sir. Command me.

462
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:08,859
The water! The hot water!

463
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,326
It's boiling, madame.

464
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,195
Well, be quick about it.

465
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,897
Hurry up.

466
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,699
How do you feel?

467
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,669
I'm fine. Fine. Ca va.
Ca va. I'm calm now.

468
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,704
Oh, good. Well, stay that way.

469
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,573
Uh, it might help you if you
put some wood on the fire.

470
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,341
Ah, wood, yes!

471
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,846
Thank you.

472
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,481
[Door opens]

473
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:32,983
Hargrove: Hello.
How is everything?

474
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,384
Oh, it will be fine.

475
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,186
I must have some clean sheets
and towels for madame.

476
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,388
Oui, mademoiselle. Tout
de suite. Tout de suite.

477
00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:40,390
I can never thank you
enough for coming with us

478
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:41,758
and for being so helpful.

479
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,060
Oh, that's all right.

480
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,062
Just don't tell the guys
in the crew about it,

481
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,362
or they'll kid my ears off.

482
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,431
Here, mademoiselle. Take
everything. Command me.

483
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,567
Jeanne: Thank you. Now,
be calm, won't you?

484
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,070
Man: I am an icicle. I am a
creature without nerves.

485
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:55,338
The water. Quick, quick!

486
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:00,510
Here, here. Let me do it.

487
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:07,784
Relax, now, won't you? You'll
be a father before you know it.

488
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,285
Just be calm.

489
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:12,122
I'm calm. Monsieur,
I am a man of iron.

490
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,057
You can inquire
in the village.

491
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,159
Who fought the Germans in
our guerrilla movement?

492
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,861
Who fought them with ferocity?

493
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,796
Who blew up their ammunition?
Who...

494
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:20,764
[Baby crying]

495
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,199
Listen!

496
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,800
It's a boy, Billiet!

497
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:24,868
Oh!

498
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,302
Isn't it wonderful?

499
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,537
Aw, great.

500
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:29,106
Isn't that...

501
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,143
That's it. Just relax.

502
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,383
Mayor: We shall always
remember you, our liberators,

503
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,152
with great affection
and esteem.

504
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,653
Isn't that so?

505
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,223
Oh, yes. Very affectionately.

506
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,225
Well, you've all
been very kind,

507
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,893
and thank you for everything.

508
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,196
Cramp: All right, let's break
it up and get to rolling.

509
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:54,965
Crowd: Bye!

510
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:56,967
These artillery men seem
to have softened up

511
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,902
the local situation
for us, major.

512
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,871
Yes. They've done pretty well.

513
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:06,877
Bye!

514
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,178
Good luck!

515
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,713
Good-bye! Come back soon!

516
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,353
I located Hargrove and the
crew in Mardenne, sir.

517
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,355
I thought you checked the road
into that town, sergeant.

518
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,891
I did, but Hargrove
worked out a shortcut.

519
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,358
He went off of the main road.

520
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:23,426
Against orders?

521
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:24,828
He was trying to
beat the traffic

522
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,629
and join up with the battery
a little sooner, sir.

523
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:28,031
All right, sergeant.

524
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,266
Yes, sir.

525
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,170
Corporal Hargrove
reporting, sir.

526
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,371
You may go, Private Hargrove.

527
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,873
Yes, sir.

528
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,119
[Artillery firing in distance]

529
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,327
Oh, my aching back!

530
00:24:57,394 --> 00:24:58,695
Oh!

531
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:02,833
Oh! Dig it, shovel it, scoop
it, pile it, move it.

532
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,567
We've got to get this done.

533
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,303
It's a garbage pit, you know.

534
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,038
We've got to get it finished

535
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,140
before they get here
with the garbage.

536
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,742
Looks like I've changed my
garbage cans for this shovel.

537
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,712
I thought we came overseas
to get out of all that.

538
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,115
Cramp: All right, let's stop the
yakking and dig. Come on. Scoop.

539
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,885
What do you expect us to
do, sarge, strike oil?

540
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,020
I expect you to get your
garbage pit dug nice and deep.

541
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,355
And after that,

542
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,382
I got a few other chores
around the place for you.

543
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,825
When you finish up here,

544
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,727
come on over to the
ammunition dump.

545
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,675
You see, Monsieur Mayor, in
these nearby communities,

546
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:49,179
we know very little about the civil
governments which have taken over.

547
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,249
Now, for maximum security, we must
have reports on those officials...

548
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,417
whether or not they can
be completely trusted.

549
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,552
Your men can furnish us
with that information.

550
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,821
Yes, I know, major,
but you see,

551
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,823
my men have so much to do.

552
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,327
We have the fields and
all necessary repairs

553
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:07,297
and the restoration of all the
damage. It's very difficult.

554
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,333
Man: Oh, it shouldn't take long,
Monsieur Mayor. Perhaps a week.

555
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,569
We can discuss it. Of course, I
can't tell you the answer now.

556
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:14,837
[Speaking French]

557
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,806
Oh, no more for me, thank you.

558
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:17,974
Man: No, thanks.

559
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,810
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to disturb you.

560
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,279
I was only wondering...

561
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:24,314
Wondering about
Corporal Hargrove...

562
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,650
If he's located nearby.
Is there any news of him?

563
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:28,851
Oh, yes.

564
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,021
Corporal Hargrove. Fine
lad, splendid soldier.

565
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,755
You can see it immediately.

566
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,958
You know him, of
course, major.

567
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,359
Corporal harburg?

568
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,361
No, I don't think so.

569
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,863
Corporal Hargrove,
Monsieur Major.

570
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,866
Yes. He's the artillery man who stumbled
in here the day before we took over.

571
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,501
That's him.

572
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,404
Oh, yes. Now I remember.

573
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:50,206
Created quite an
impression, as I recall.

574
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:53,843
Yes, he became quite dear to us.
Oh, what a man.

575
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,711
What a soldier.
What a character.

576
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:58,148
You see, I'm an expert
in those matters,

577
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,649
so I can tell you.

578
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,384
I would like to tell you...

579
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,353
about that other matter,
Monsieur Mayor.

580
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,389
Just think it over. There's no
hurry. We'll discuss it later.

581
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,958
Mayor: It was very nice.

582
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,292
Jeanne: Au revoir.

583
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Good-bye.

584
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:11,694
Mayor: Come... Again.

585
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:14,331
Man: Come and get your mail.

586
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:15,398
Gilly!

587
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,532
Here!

588
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,534
Mulvehill!

589
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:20,603
Hargrove!

590
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,605
Hargrove!

591
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,576
Catch it.

592
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:28,778
Thanks, sarge.

593
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,014
Hey, they're from Carol!

594
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,251
Don't go away. I'll
be right back.

595
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,787
Here's a package for
you, too, Mulvehill.

596
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,789
Hiya, sarge.

597
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,257
Cramp: Hi, fellas.

598
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:42,925
Hey, he's happy.

599
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,996
Must be reading about
some new kind of shovel.

600
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,763
Ha ha ha!

601
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,299
Cramp.

602
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,802
Yes, sir.

603
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,005
Just what happened to
Hargrove and Mulvehill

604
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,007
when we lost them back in...

605
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:59,476
What's the name of that town?
Mardenne.

606
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:02,645
Oh, back there. Nothing
that I know of, sir.

607
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,748
Ain't much I'd put past them.
Why, captain?

608
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,850
Well, I've got an
order detailing them

609
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,819
for military government
detail back there.

610
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,221
Why, those shiftless slackers.

611
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,689
They didn't wangle it. This
came through from way high up.

612
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,258
You don't know Mulvehill, sir.

613
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,827
I'd suspect him if it came
from supreme headquarters.

614
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,162
Hey, Mulvehill!

615
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,597
Yes, sergeant. Yes.

616
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:22,798
Hargrove!

617
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,235
Did you want me, sarge?

618
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:26,769
I called you, didn't I?

619
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,738
Well, I'm, uh...

620
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:31,541
Not quite finished
with the ditch, sarge.

621
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:33,276
Cramp: No, leave it.

622
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,111
All right. With pleasure.

623
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,213
Mulvehill, you
parlez-vous any French?

624
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,415
Beg your pardon?

625
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:40,323
Hargrove, do you know
anything about a transfer

626
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,385
for you two men to civil
affairs in Mardenne?

627
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,353
No, sir.

628
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,421
Mulvehill?

629
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,621
No, sir.

630
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,091
You've been temporarily
assigned to duty there.

631
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,992
Arrange to get them
back, sergeant.

632
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,528
Yes, sir.

633
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,798
Oh, now, don't look
at me, sergeant.

634
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,733
If I could fix transfers,

635
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,170
there's one I would
have arranged long ago.

636
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:03,273
Don't look at me, sarge.
It's all news to me, honest.

637
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,409
Naturally, if someone at Mardenne
was impressed with our fine...

638
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:07,677
that's enough.

639
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,080
It's lucky for you two guys
I can't prove anything.

640
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,347
Yes, sir.

641
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,648
Ahem. Uh...

642
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,817
Will I have time to finish
my ditch, sergeant?

643
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,419
Get over to the
Service Battery.

644
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,654
I'll arrange to send
you back on a truck.

645
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:21,524
I only wish I could
shoot you out of a 105.

646
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,266
I've got Hargrove and
Mulvehill outside, major.

647
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,302
Who? Oh, the charm boys.

648
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,904
I thought we might assign
them to the M.P. squad.

649
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:36,539
Then we can call on them

650
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,508
for liaison work
whenever we needed them.

651
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,543
Good. Bring them in.

652
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:44,380
Hargrove. Mulvehill.

653
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,421
At ease.

654
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,023
You men have been in
this town before?

655
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,559
Yes, sir, but we didn't
do anything, captain.

656
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,561
You got to know the
mayor, didn't you?

657
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,331
Yes, sir. We got here by
mistake after they had

658
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,799
wiped out the German
Garrison by themselves.

659
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,835
I guess they were pretty happy

660
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,171
to see any American troops...
even us.

661
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,406
All right, Hargrove. Get on
over to the mayor's house.

662
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:13,643
Tell him that Major Kingby would
like to have 5 or 6 of the French

663
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,391
assigned to check up on these civil
officials in the area. Got that?

664
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,413
Yes, sir.

665
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:18,314
Get going.

666
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:19,582
Yes, sir.

667
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,318
You can report to the M.P.
headquarters, Mulvehill.

668
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:23,819
Yes, sir.

669
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:31,894
Let's see what happens.

670
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:43,706
[Knocks on door]

671
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,644
Oh, mon cher ami!

672
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:54,350
Oh...

673
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,085
Come.

674
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,862
Looks like the kid got action.

675
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,364
How do you like that?

676
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,432
I'd have been arguing with
the old boy for 3 hours.

677
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:11,867
Then he would have told me

678
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,437
he'd like to talk it over
with his colleagues.

679
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,506
Looks like it's all
in the approach.

680
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,680
Now, why didn't I
think of that?

681
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,389
Sergeant! Mulvehill,
look who's here.

682
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:37,059
Oh, I hate to say this, but
you're a sight for sore eyes.

683
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,895
How's the battery, hmm?
How's Gilly and Burk?

684
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:41,864
What's the matter with you?

685
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:43,399
Very pretty!

686
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,401
Very, very pretty.

687
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,304
Now, look, we didn't make up this
color scheme. We were issued these.

688
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:52,007
The sergeant doesn't approve of
anything unless it's caked in mud.

689
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:55,278
What kind of a racket have
you two guys got here?

690
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,879
What do you mean racket?

691
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:59,815
You think men of our character would
stoop to swindle a deal like this?

692
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,851
I'd hate to have
to count up to 3

693
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:03,353
while you thought it over.

694
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,321
Oh, sarge, now, quit
kidding, will you?

695
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,390
Tell us about the battery.
Are you still up the line?

696
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,691
Just for the time being.

697
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,693
We're cleaning the Krauts
out all through there,

698
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,695
and the infantry's pushing
up pretty fast.

699
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:13,763
We're going right along.

700
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:14,664
Oh, good.

701
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,232
We're on our way
to Paris, huh?

702
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,600
We? Ha ha!

703
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,370
I was coming back this way,
so I brought you some mail.

704
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,804
Hargrove: Thanks, sarge.

705
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:24,274
Well, so long, fellas.
Toodle-oo.

706
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:29,746
Hello there. Ooh, I
like your uniform.

707
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:31,581
It is so pretty.

708
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,583
Hargrove: Sarge, you're
blocking traffic.

709
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,319
Well, let them wait.

710
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,354
I came to invite
you to dinner.

711
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,090
Papa would like it very
much if you would come.

712
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:44,494
Oh, well, I'm awfully sorry,
but you see, I'm on duty now.

713
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,562
But Papa has already arranged
with Captain Parkson.

714
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,564
It is all right
for you to come.

715
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:49,632
Oh.

716
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,501
So it is all fixed?

717
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:54,337
Well, yeah, yeah.
I'll come over later.

718
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:58,574
Oh, come early, and we will pick
some flowers for the table.

719
00:32:58,642 --> 00:32:59,642
Good-bye.

720
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,677
Good-bye.

721
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,846
Ha ha ha! What a dumb detail!

722
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,381
Tisk tisk tisk.

723
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:08,050
You might strain yourself bending
over to pick the flowers,

724
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:11,688
but Papa could fix it so you
would get the decoration.

725
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,022
[Laughs]

726
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:16,659
Look, sarge, it wasn't that
way at all. You see, she...

727
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,394
All right, so what?

728
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,763
My, isn't it dusty
around here?

729
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:24,133
And will I get it from
the battery commander

730
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,536
if I'm not crisp and dandy.

731
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,071
Well! Chin up, chaps.

732
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,073
Ha ha ha!

733
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,477
Ha ha ha!

734
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,312
Ha ha ha!

735
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,815
Go on. Just make a crack.

736
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,917
Go on. Just make a crack.
Make a crack.

737
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:47,757
[Bell ringing]

738
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,427
Oh, Monsieur Mulvehill!
Good morning.

739
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,830
Monsieur Sutin, uh...

740
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,832
As the most modern,
up-to-date,

741
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,834
and progressive merchant
in this community,

742
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,335
I'm sure you'll be interested

743
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:01,537
in what I have to discuss
with you this morning.

744
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,308
You don't even
want to hear it?

745
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,011
The very latest in
modern merchandising.

746
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,014
I am busy. I have the
bread in the oven.

747
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:14,417
Oh, well, now, uh, maybe
you'd be interested

748
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,386
in a sensational postwar plan

749
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:19,622
to turn this charming little
village into a tourist paradise...

750
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,024
big hotel, gambling casino,
the trimmings, you know.

751
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,994
Excuse me. My bread
is in the oven.

752
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,263
I must watch my dough.

753
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:36,338
Parkson?

754
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,707
Yes, sir?

755
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,709
Got a job for the French here.
Details are all in there.

756
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,217
See that the mayor
gets it, will you?

757
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:42,545
Hargrove is due
back any minute.

758
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,046
I'll have him take
it right over.

759
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,048
Good. Certainly getting bang-up
cooperation these days.

760
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:48,017
See that it stays that way.

761
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:50,052
Yes, sir. Oh, uh,
this just came in.

762
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,654
It's from Army headquarters.

763
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,689
They think you're
doing a great job

764
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:56,526
and handling the French
situation brilliantly.

765
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,993
Anything else, major?

766
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,462
Not at the moment.

767
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,730
Yes, sir.

768
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,834
Hello, Hargrove. How are you?

769
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,836
Oh, I'm fine, thank you, sir.

770
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,237
Good!

771
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,209
Well, you look
startled, Hargrove.

772
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:17,179
Yes, sir. The major hasn't
spoken to me like that before.

773
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:20,316
Maybe the major is just beginning
to realize your fine qualities.

774
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:22,852
Yes, sir. Sometimes it
takes quite a while, sir.

775
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,354
Oh, take these reports
over to the mayor.

776
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:28,357
Ask him to study them and let me
know how he can help us. I need...

777
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:29,859
Well, what's the matter?

778
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,360
Oh, nothing, sir.

779
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:33,362
You're on good terms with
the mayor, aren't you?

780
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,864
Oh, yes, sir.

781
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,766
His daughter isn't
mad at you, is she?

782
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,367
On the contrary, captain.

783
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:39,435
That's fine.

784
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,237
Uh, captain, you
see, on this job,

785
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:45,140
I, uh... I'm with
her all the time.

786
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,476
Oh, tough luck.

787
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,644
Well, I've got a
girl back home,

788
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,646
and I don't think
she'd exactly approve

789
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,414
of these foreign
entanglements, captain.

790
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,416
Hargrove, your
conscience is clear.

791
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,785
Isn't it?

792
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,186
Oh, yes, sir.

793
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,154
It's in the line of duty, and
I'm sure you've done nothing

794
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,656
to encourage this romance.

795
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,792
Maybe not, but on
the other hand,

796
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,326
I haven't done anything

797
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,795
to discourage it either.

798
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,797
I'm afraid I haven't got
much character, captain.

799
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,765
If you'd like to send
me back to the battery,

800
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,166
it's all right.

801
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:14,336
Not a chance. We need the
cooperation of the French here.

802
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,131
They're doing a fine
job, and your liaison

803
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,640
work with them has
been outstanding.

804
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,342
You might even get a
promotion out of it.

805
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,777
Is that a fact?

806
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:24,413
If it's too much trouble,
captain, don't even bother

807
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,416
because they always bust me
in a couple of days anyway.

808
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,718
Uh...

809
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:31,353
While we're having this
little conversation, captain,

810
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:34,724
I'd like to ask you your
advice about something.

811
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:38,494
Do you think that if I told
Jeanne about my girl back home,

812
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,029
that she would understand?

813
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:42,865
What?! Hargrove, if you
do anything like that,

814
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,234
I'll personally see to it
that you finish out this war

815
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,169
in the dirtiest
job I can dig up.

816
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:49,906
Before you know it, the
girl will be sore at you,

817
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,874
and then the mayor
gets tough with us.

818
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:53,876
If that happens,
it's permanent K.P. For you,

819
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,678
garbage detail.

820
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:01,316
Oh, no. Not that.
Not garbage cans.

821
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:04,820
Just that. Now, hustle over to
the mayor with these papers.

822
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:07,156
Get him to start on
them right away.

823
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,390
Yes, sir.

824
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:23,005
Hello, wallingford. Sold any
interesting gold bricks lately?

825
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,406
No.

826
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,341
Why don't you give it up, Tom,
and live on your army pay?

827
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,710
Never.

828
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,581
Marion has told me how you are
unable to swindle anybody.

829
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,849
It is too bad. I'm very sorry.

830
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,885
I will speak to my father.

831
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,722
Oh, no, now, none of that.
I'll make good on my own.

832
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,757
Proud people, the Mulvehills.

833
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:43,859
You bet. Why, I've just
begun to fight.

834
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,696
I'll put over some kind
of deal in this town,

835
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:49,699
even if I have to give
them their money's worth.

836
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,305
Oh, poor Tom.

837
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,774
I like him. He is a nice man.

838
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:00,776
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
sign anything.

839
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:04,146
He has always told me very
nice things about you.

840
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,949
Really? Well, I still
wouldn't sign it.

841
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,720
You are worried
about something?

842
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,822
Me? Oh, no. Nothing at all.

843
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:15,725
But you are grave and concerned.
I see it.

844
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,760
No. I was just thinking.

845
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,831
Then I will be quiet and
permit you to think.

846
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:25,334
I was thinking how quiet and
peaceful this village is.

847
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:27,503
I'm happy that you like it.

848
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,172
It's going to be
tough to leave it.

849
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,207
You are going away?

850
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,076
Well, I'm in the army, Jeanne,

851
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,544
and the company may move

852
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,947
or they may send me
back to my battery.

853
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,683
You see, I haven't got
much to say about it.

854
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,685
Then I will go, too.

855
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,186
You can't do that.

856
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:46,956
Oh, but I want to do that.

857
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,624
Look, Jeannie, you're probably

858
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:51,393
getting your emotions
a little mixed up.

859
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,297
You feel the way you think you feel
about me because of gratitude.

860
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,300
No. It is not gratitude.
I am certain.

861
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,269
Oh, sure, it is.

862
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:03,539
It's not me. It's the
United States Army.

863
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:05,074
No, not so many as that.

864
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,876
Well, it's the
idea of the army.

865
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:09,278
The German occupation was
pretty terrible for all of you,

866
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:10,780
and the army kicked them out,

867
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,748
and that's why
you feel the way

868
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,016
you think you feel.

869
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,218
You are trying to tell me
that you do not like me,

870
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:17,820
that you wish to go away.

871
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,589
Oh, no, I'm not, Jeanne.
Not at all.

872
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:23,492
Yes. Yes, I feel it... Here.

873
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,194
You hate me.

874
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:28,497
Oh, honestly, I don't.
Don't cry, Jeanne.

875
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:32,968
Yes!

876
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,469
Oh, look. Look, Jeanne...

877
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:37,606
Look, I'm not mad at you,
and I don't hate you.

878
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:39,975
Now, don't cry. I'm
crazy about you!

879
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:45,981
Good work, Hargrove. I like
your devotion to duty.

880
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,186
Well, for a small
investment in advertising,

881
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,822
the whole American army
will be at your doorstep,

882
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,858
their watches in one hand,
their money in the other.

883
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,961
Most desirable,
Monsieur Himmeville.

884
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,996
Most desirable.

885
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:03,632
I see a huge army camp.

886
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,235
The men are unhappy.

887
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:08,204
Why?

888
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:11,741
Their watches are out of order.
They don't know what time it is.

889
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:13,709
An airplane hovers overhead.

890
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,745
It showers leaflets upon them.

891
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:18,748
They run, they pick
up the leaflets.

892
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:20,582
They smile, they laugh.

893
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,418
They come running
to Marcel Vivin.

894
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:24,920
To Marcel Vivin!

895
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,889
I could buy new equipment,

896
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,959
perhaps hire assistants to
handle the flood of business.

897
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:32,828
Well, of course, you'd have
to enlarge the premises.

898
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,930
It can be done.
It can be done.

899
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:39,201
Well, suppose we say a down payment
at this time of 500 francs

900
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,336
just to get the
campaign started?

901
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,974
Well, of course, 750
francs would be better,

902
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,343
then, when we see our advertising
taking effect, why, we...

903
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:52,014
Marcel! Marcel! I have news.
Wonderful news.

904
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,116
N-no. Everything is safe.
We'll be rich.

905
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:56,252
Later. Later. Just
think of it, Marcel...

906
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,254
all those beautiful
watches safe in Paris.

907
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,256
Not now. We'll
talk of it later.

908
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,857
But I do not understand.
Why...

909
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,793
Oh, pardon, monsieur.
I did not know...

910
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,828
no. It's quite all right.

911
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,130
Monsieur... Himmeville
is our friend.

912
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:11,233
However, we'll talk of it
later when we are alone.

913
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,302
Yes, I will go now.
Good day, Marcel.

914
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:14,636
Good day, Monsieur Himmeville.

915
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:16,872
Yes, we'll talk of this later.

916
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,373
Well, that's, uh...

917
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:21,076
That's very good news.
Congratulations.

918
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,378
Please forget what
you've heard.

919
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:26,115
Let's discuss our advertising.

920
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,884
You will require 750
franc as a down payment.

921
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:30,920
Well, that is quite agreeable.

922
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:33,388
These watches... were
there many of them?

923
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,724
It was quite a large shipment.

924
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:38,194
It came in just before
the occupation of Paris.

925
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,696
We could do nothing except
bury them in a house.

926
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,664
But let's turn to
our advertising.

927
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,399
Monsieur Vivin, of
course you realize

928
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:47,002
it will be some time before
you can get to Paris.

929
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,070
Ah.

930
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,405
That house may be
searched at any moment.

931
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:53,075
Oh, by the way, where did
you say that house was?

932
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,410
It is centrally located.

933
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:56,846
Uh-huh.

934
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,380
Hmm.

935
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:01,250
No doubt you of the
military will be in Paris

936
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,418
long before a civilian
is permitted to return.

937
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,187
That might be.

938
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:08,757
If you know someone who
would be interested

939
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:12,427
in the enormous profit to be
made from a small transaction...

940
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,363
Well, I'll keep it in mind.

941
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,566
For a trifling sum, a
few thousand franc,

942
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,935
a fine profit could
be realized.

943
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,904
I have a diagram

944
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,374
indicating everything
in detail.

945
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,945
Of course, you are a dreamer,

946
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,882
a visionary, like myself,

947
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,384
uninterested in
money or profit,

948
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,087
but perhaps you know someone.

949
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,488
I do.

950
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:40,923
I do.

951
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,026
Now, don't tell anybody about
this. I'll be right back.

952
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,862
[Whispering] Don't breathe
a word of this to anybody.

953
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,298
My lips are sealed.

954
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,202
Now, will you listen?

955
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,504
There's a fortune
to be made in this.

956
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:57,739
The First Army is headed
straight for Paris.

957
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,809
The first chance we get,
we scoop up this treasure,

958
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:03,012
and from then on,
we're sitting pretty.

959
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,080
Look, it's no use.
We're stuck.

960
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,149
I talked to the captain today,

961
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,651
and he won't let me go
back to the battery.

962
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,654
Marion, if you go
in on this with me,

963
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:16,191
I will personally guarantee
that we will be sent back.

964
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,692
You will? How?

965
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,694
How? What? When?

966
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:23,098
I give you my word of honor.
Isn't that enough?

967
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,166
Nope.

968
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:26,635
This is the scheme
of the century.

969
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:29,238
Now, will you
please shell out?

970
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,373
Oh...

971
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,375
Look, I'll...

972
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:37,012
wait a minute, Mulvehill! That's all
the money I've got in the whole world!

973
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,348
Well, I'll try to get
you some change.

974
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,160
Oh, quaint, isn't it?

975
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:52,727
Let me congratulate you.

976
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:55,197
Oh, yes. Thank you very
much, Monsieur Vivin.

977
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,499
I have to run along now.

978
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,735
Au revoir, my
dear Halberville.

979
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:03,172
That's Mulvehill.

980
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,573
Helmeville.

981
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,108
Ha ha. Yes.

982
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,944
Ha ha ha.

983
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,418
Hi.

984
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:18,053
Oh! I thought for a minute

985
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,055
you were going to
miss out on a meal.

986
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,623
Now, don't be bitter, chum.

987
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,852
Why not? You not only walked
away with all of my dough,

988
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,961
but you know darn well we're
never going to get into Paris.

989
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,696
You know, I've been giving
that a lot of thought.

990
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:30,332
Yeah, I'm afraid of that, too.
That means more trouble.

991
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,334
Ah, "C" ration hash again.

992
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:36,138
You know, sergeant, this lacks but
one thing to make it perfect.

993
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,106
What's that?

994
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:38,707
Chloroform.

995
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:41,310
Man: Hey! You almost
bought it that time.

996
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,345
You know, I can't wait to get
to Paris and those watches.

997
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:44,546
Ha ha ha.

998
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,315
What do you mean, ha ha ha?

999
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,503
Because you know we're never
going to get out of here.

1000
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:50,585
You better start paying me back
some of that dough you borrowed

1001
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:52,054
to pay for that map, too.

1002
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,722
You know, I've been thinking.

1003
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:56,892
We're stuck in this town because
that girl's attached to you.

1004
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,029
Now, uh, why don't we get
the girl out of town?

1005
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:02,597
Why? Because, you addlebrained
idiot, she won't go.

1006
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:05,134
And even if we get sent
back to the battery,

1007
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:07,336
she said she was
going to follow me.

1008
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,870
Well, it's all set.

1009
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,408
She's waiting over at the
house to say good-bye to you.

1010
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:13,475
What?

1011
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,610
Hey! This food is
bad enough, bud,

1012
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:17,346
without your foot in it.

1013
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,448
Yeah, well, excuse me.
Here, here. Take mine.

1014
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,550
You'll love it.
Every minute of it.

1015
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:23,385
Tom, you miracle man.
How did you do it?

1016
00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:24,819
Tell me, what did you say?

1017
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:25,921
It was a cinch.

1018
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:27,889
She told me she was
going to follow you.

1019
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,491
That gave me an idea.

1020
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,493
I told her that would
be impossible.

1021
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:34,863
Then I gave her a pitch
about what might be done.

1022
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:37,866
She leaves tonight to
join the French WACs.

1023
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,601
Ah, that's wonderful!

1024
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,103
I knew you would...

1025
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,105
Man: Ugh! No!

1026
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,474
You got that?

1027
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,276
Hello. Operator?
What's happened?

1028
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,910
Operator!

1029
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:52,814
The wire's out again.

1030
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:55,745
Yes, sir. Check your radio.

1031
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:58,121
Somebody coming this
way must have tripped

1032
00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:59,702
over the wire and knocked
everything haywire.

1033
00:45:59,766 --> 00:46:00,822
They'll get right on it, sir.

1034
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,824
We haven't had anything
like that happen

1035
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,326
since Hargrove
left the battery.

1036
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,627
That's right, sir.

1037
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:06,695
[Knock on door]

1038
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,029
Come in.

1039
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:11,900
Private Hargrove
reporting, sir.

1040
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:13,668
I should have known.

1041
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:15,704
Well, welcome home.

1042
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,174
I haven't done anything.

1043
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:24,613
On your way over here, you didn't
happen to trip over any wires, did you?

1044
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,982
Well, as a matter
of fact, I did,

1045
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:29,851
but I didn't hurt
myself, sarge.

1046
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:32,254
Get back to your section.

1047
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,288
Hi, sarge.

1048
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,690
Ahem. I was just
trying it on for size.

1049
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:12,161
Well, get back to your section before I
think of something else for you to dig.

1050
00:47:12,228 --> 00:47:13,962
Right, sarge. Right
away, sarge.

1051
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,797
On the double. I'm going.

1052
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:19,067
Hey, are we still batting out
congas on that roll over there?

1053
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:22,771
No. We're shelling some strongholds
the Krauts are trying to reinforce.

1054
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,307
Ah! That's my meat. Here,
let me at that lanyard.

1055
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,342
That's for me. Here we go!

1056
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,311
We finished that
mission, Hargrove.

1057
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,745
Oh, you point killer.

1058
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:32,714
See if you can get
fire direction

1059
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,950
and find when the ammunition
train will be in, Sergeant Hill.

1060
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,521
Operator?

1061
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:41,390
Operator?

1062
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:43,892
Operator?

1063
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,160
Gone dead on you?

1064
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:46,861
Yes, sir. The wire seems
to be out, lieutenant.

1065
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,398
I'll run over to the switchboard
operator and see what I can find out.

1066
00:47:49,465 --> 00:47:50,965
No. Let's get this
wire fixed right away.

1067
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,568
Yes, sir.

1068
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,236
Hang onto that, Hargrove.

1069
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,438
I'll get the wire section
for Lieutenant Morley.

1070
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:57,506
Ok, sarge.

1071
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,773
You just missed it, Hargrove.

1072
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,442
Fire direction said
we dropped one

1073
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,743
right on an ammunition train.

1074
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,812
Mulvehill: And we got it
without you on the sights.

1075
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:05,814
Hargrove: Oh, well, that
was just a lucky hit.

1076
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,782
Oh, get him. They'd count
it as a direct hit for you

1077
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,318
if it landed in
the same country.

1078
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:11,320
Oh, is that so? Well, let
me tell you something!

1079
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,322
Man: Hey, Hargrove. Don't
shout into the phone.

1080
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:16,091
They may still be plugged
into fire direction.

1081
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:17,559
Oh, my gosh.

1082
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,495
Hello?

1083
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,863
Hello?

1084
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:22,964
Hello!

1085
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:25,066
Ha ha! Oh, it's dead.
Not a sound.

1086
00:48:25,134 --> 00:48:28,169
It's going to take them hours
to repair that line anyway.

1087
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,005
It's as dark out there as
a supply sergeant's soul.

1088
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:33,842
Now's my chance to tell the
old man what I think of him.

1089
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:35,844
Give me that. Ha ha!

1090
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:36,978
Hello?

1091
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,680
Hello?!

1092
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,216
Oh, so you can hear me, eh?

1093
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:44,419
Well, this is
Mulvehill speaking.

1094
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,355
Thomas Mulvehill.

1095
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:49,157
Just plain Private Mulvehill
due to prejudice.

1096
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:51,126
Otherwise, I would have been

1097
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:53,295
commissioned in the
field months ago!

1098
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,297
That's telling
them, huh, fellas?

1099
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,933
Listen, while you're about it, ask him
why he broke the eminent Hargrove,

1100
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,470
the best artillery man
in all of France.

1101
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:05,374
Yeah, and put in for a 30-day
furlough for me, too, will you?

1102
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,841
Yeah, uh...

1103
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:11,112
Well, colonel, you just watch your
step from now on, that's all.

1104
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,250
You know, I wish this was a pay
telephone. You know what I'd do?

1105
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,253
Men: You'd call your girl.

1106
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,622
I guess it sort of shows
on me, doesn't it?

1107
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,324
Well, I would. I
would call Carol,

1108
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,092
and I'm not ashamed
of it either.

1109
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,894
Man: Nothing to be
ashamed of, kid.

1110
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:28,530
Of course it isn't.
Nothing whatever.

1111
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,332
I didn't say a thing.

1112
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,767
Well, don't.

1113
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,870
Oh, I'm sick of trying to
dig my way into Berlin.

1114
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:40,208
I'm tired, and I'm cold,
and I'm homesick.

1115
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,177
I'm sick of these foxholes.

1116
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:44,913
I'm sick of "K" rations.

1117
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,650
And, oh, brother, how sick
I am of the way I smell!

1118
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:49,884
Ha ha!

1119
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:52,521
You know, I wish I could
talk to Carol, though.

1120
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,523
You got a phone. Go ahead.

1121
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,491
Don't be silly. You can't...

1122
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,859
Uh...

1123
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:59,961
By George, I will.

1124
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:05,367
Hello, operator. Get
me Regent 6-6599.

1125
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,737
Deposit 364 bucks, please.

1126
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,373
Oh, yeah, would you
hurry, operator, please?

1127
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,308
Hello? Hello, Carol.

1128
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:16,378
Love... 3,000 miles away
with a dead telephone,

1129
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,947
and he gets the
number in a second.

1130
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:21,817
He sure makes a sucker
out of Marconi.

1131
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:23,785
Oh, shut up, will you?

1132
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,520
Hello, Carol.

1133
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:29,090
I, uh... I'd like to say
a lot of things to you,

1134
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:32,394
but I can't very well because
I'm with a bunch of the guys,

1135
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,997
but I just wanted to talk to you
because I miss you so much.

1136
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:40,402
I, uh... I don't like being
so far away from you, honey.

1137
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,338
I wish I could be nearer to you so
I could see you once in a while

1138
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:46,007
and, well, where I could
sort of look forward

1139
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:48,677
to seeing you the
rest of the time.

1140
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,412
You know, I, uh...

1141
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,049
I wish I could just sort of
reach out and... and touch you.

1142
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:00,021
Here's Baker's trunk line.
You splice it.

1143
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:01,089
Right.

1144
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,358
Give me Sergeant Hill's line.

1145
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:08,062
You sure that's it?

1146
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,731
Yeah, yeah. That's it.

1147
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:13,869
We'll have to change the direction of
our fire to around 1800 mils, Drake.

1148
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:16,905
Now, that should bring us nearer
the center of our sector.

1149
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,940
That fool phone keeps
holding us up.

1150
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:22,043
Maybe I can get right through to
your battery. Is this your computer?

1151
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:24,479
Man: Yeah, but I think
that line's out, too.

1152
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,981
Hargrove: Yeah,
well, good night.

1153
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:29,183
Good night. Parting
is such sweet sorrow

1154
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,453
that I shall say good
night till it be morrow.

1155
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,455
Sleep dwell upon
thy eyes, peace...

1156
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,424
man: Hey, better cut it short.

1157
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:38,460
Oh, yeah. Well, Carol,
we better hang up now

1158
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:41,496
because this phone might be
hooked up with headquarters,

1159
00:51:41,564 --> 00:51:44,433
so now a lot of brass hats
might be eavesdropping.

1160
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,934
So good night, precious.

1161
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,436
Man: Good night, lover!

1162
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:49,471
Good... What?

1163
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:59,848
[Band playing The Caissons
Go Rolling Along]

1164
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:28,443
Hargrove: All right, men, on the double.
Let's unload this. On the double!

1165
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:30,445
You know, when they
make you a corporal,

1166
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:33,582
it doesn't go to your head;
It goes to your vocal cords.

1167
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:36,084
Hargrove: Come on!
All the way.

1168
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:39,253
All the way. Drop it.
Put her down.

1169
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,289
Hey, Paris is out
there somewhere.

1170
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:42,557
That's for me.

1171
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:45,560
You hear that, Hargrove? Paris
is out there somewhere.

1172
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:48,162
Paris! The city of wealth.

1173
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,098
Ah, the Germans are
out there, too.

1174
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,666
Let's get this ready to fire.

1175
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:54,035
All right, men, on the double.
Ellerton, get the ammo.

1176
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:55,169
There we go. Spread it.

1177
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:57,071
He's all corporal,
isn't he, sergeant?

1178
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:59,841
Sure is. He ain't the coolest
head in the battery,

1179
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:01,309
but he tries hard.

1180
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:04,245
How did he work out when we tried
him at the observation post?

1181
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:06,815
All right. Promoted him
to sergeant after that.

1182
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,349
Yeah, I remember.

1183
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,852
2 days later, he was
busted for backing a truck

1184
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,353
right into the division C.P.

1185
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:14,990
But he was all right in the
observation crew, sir.

1186
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:16,257
Well, we'll try him again.

1187
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:17,686
We're short an
instrument operator,

1188
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:19,895
and he probably knows enough
procedure to fill the bill.

1189
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:20,962
Yes, sir.

1190
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,364
Get your aiming circle set up.

1191
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,972
Hello.

1192
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,307
You think that we'll get
into Paris tomorrow, sarge?

1193
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,577
Well, I don't know. I
haven't gotten my report

1194
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,045
from General Eisenhower
yet today.

1195
00:53:37,112 --> 00:53:39,280
Hargrove, been talking to
the old man about you.

1196
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:42,250
Uh-oh. You want to cut
them off yourself?

1197
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:44,085
No, not yet.

1198
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:46,521
Do you suppose you could work
in an observation post again

1199
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,189
without gumming up
the whole campaign?

1200
00:53:48,257 --> 00:53:51,960
Oh, sarge. That's my meat.
"Eagle-eye Hargrove," they call me.

1201
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,562
Keep digging.

1202
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,909
I want to check with our
liaison officer here.

1203
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,779
Hello, captain. What's the best
place around here for the O.P.?

1204
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,166
Well, I think about 500 yards
up the road and to the right.

1205
00:54:13,215 --> 00:54:15,295
That ought to give you a
pretty good range of vision.

1206
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:17,452
Can darn near see our guns
from that high a ground.

1207
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:18,853
Any cover up there?

1208
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,355
There are 2 or 3 shot-up
tanks and a house or 2.

1209
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:23,324
Ok. We'll be up
there somewhere.

1210
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:25,627
You have any missions for
us, contact us by radio.

1211
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,129
Right. And, uh, keep your eye
open for some Kraut stragglers.

1212
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,098
We bypassed a lot of
them in the woods.

1213
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,499
They may drift back your way.

1214
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:33,101
Thanks, captain.

1215
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:35,604
Go on about 300 or 400 yards,
Hargrove. Keep to the right.

1216
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:37,338
They're moving up
some more artillery.

1217
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:39,708
We've got to spot it
and knock it out fast.

1218
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,116
Lieutenant, how about that?

1219
00:54:48,183 --> 00:54:50,118
Man: No, that's no good.

1220
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:52,487
When you've been at this a
little longer, Hargrove,

1221
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:55,490
you'll realize that if a spot
for an O.P. Looks good to you,

1222
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:57,626
it will look just as
good to the enemy.

1223
00:54:57,693 --> 00:54:59,427
They'll shell your
ears off every time.

1224
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:02,463
We'll have to get up along that
ridge and find a hole somewhere.

1225
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:04,065
Let's go.

1226
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,872
[Incoming missiles]

1227
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,074
[Explosions]

1228
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,782
There goes your cozy
nook, Hargrove.

1229
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,984
I can pick them, can't I?

1230
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:24,519
It's ok. You'll learn.

1231
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:26,054
Come on. Let's find...

1232
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,624
oh, lieutenant, it was a pretty
punk idea about that house before,

1233
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,092
but maybe it's better now.

1234
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,861
They've hammered it
pretty hard already,

1235
00:55:32,928 --> 00:55:35,830
and they probably figure they've
knocked out whatever was in there.

1236
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,666
Well, it's only a suggestion.

1237
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,534
It's not bad. Let's try it.

1238
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:46,941
Hargrove: There's some of
their artillery, lieutenant.

1239
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:52,013
Can we get fire
direction, sergeant?

1240
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,015
Just a minute, sir.

1241
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:54,983
Operator.

1242
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,484
Give me fire direction.

1243
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:57,886
Just a minute.

1244
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,622
I have fire direction,
lieutenant.

1245
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,691
Fire mission.

1246
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,392
Fire mission from Baker O.P.

1247
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:06,294
Coordinates...

1248
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:08,529
8-0-4 point niner.

1249
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:11,532
Coordinates 8-0-4 point niner.

1250
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,969
Dash 1-6-3 point 7.

1251
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:17,338
Dash 1-6-3 point 7.

1252
00:56:17,406 --> 00:56:20,374
Concentration 2-7-6,
Battalion Baker.

1253
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:22,677
3 volleys. Set a range.

1254
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:24,645
Battery right.

1255
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,115
Elevation 3-6-0.

1256
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,751
Set.

1257
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,019
Ready.

1258
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:33,755
On the way.

1259
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,190
On the way.

1260
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,395
300 left. Repeat range.

1261
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:44,565
Right 4-8-3-6-0.

1262
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:46,667
Fire!

1263
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,936
On the way.

1264
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,776
5-0 short. Fire for effect.

1265
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,879
5-0 short. Fire for effect.

1266
00:57:00,482 --> 00:57:01,616
Baker's firing.

1267
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:03,384
Battalion is firing.

1268
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:13,694
It's amazing how
good the battery is,

1269
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,563
considering I'm not with them.

1270
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,434
Request intermittent
harassing fire

1271
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:23,638
on road intersection
just fired upon.

1272
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:29,043
No, there's nothing
moving now.

1273
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:33,248
Oh, this is terrible.

1274
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:36,951
Oh, no, no, sir. I
didn't mean you.

1275
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,619
Hargrove.

1276
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:41,956
Stop eating while you talk on that
phone. You'll have them firing on us.

1277
00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:43,624
Hargrove: Yes, sir.
I'm all through.

1278
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:44,692
I'll take it.

1279
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,795
Better keep an eye
peeled toward the woods

1280
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,163
once in a while, Hargrove.

1281
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,265
A Kraut patrol might
sneak up on us.

1282
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:52,133
No. Not on me, they won't.

1283
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:55,503
There's some more flashes.
That's a new position.

1284
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,147
Hey, Lieutenant! Staple!

1285
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,116
Ok, Hargrove.

1286
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,151
Where are you, Staple?

1287
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,420
Staple: I guess I'm all right.

1288
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,764
Hello?

1289
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,766
Hello? Operator?

1290
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,101
It's dead.

1291
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:29,103
Must have got our
wire that time.

1292
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:30,538
Almost got my wire, too.

1293
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:32,173
Try the radio.

1294
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,844
Well, we'll try
what's left of it, sir.

1295
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:38,346
Hargrove, you get
back to the battery.

1296
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:39,613
Yes, sir.

1297
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:41,782
Give them these coordinates
on that last position.

1298
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,017
Yes, sir.

1299
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:45,186
Get another radio. Staple,
you stay here with me.

1300
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:47,188
We'll try to get
our wire back in.

1301
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:48,256
Yes, sir.

1302
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,457
And, Hargrove, be careful.

1303
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:50,859
Yes, sir.

1304
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,464
Halt!

1305
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,700
It's me... Hargrove.
Don't shoot.

1306
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,502
Give the password.

1307
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,108
Um... I'm trying
to think of it.

1308
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,544
That proves
it's Hargrove, all right.

1309
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:12,713
Oh, I got it!
It's Lana Turner.

1310
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:13,982
Ok.

1311
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:21,256
Lieutenant Dillon wants
you to blast away

1312
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:23,791
at coordinates 805.1-163.8.
You got it?

1313
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:25,793
I'm going to get right
over to fire direction

1314
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,295
and check on your mission.

1315
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,297
Wait a minute, sarge. Our radio
and wire were knocked out,

1316
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,300
and the lieutenant wants me to get
another radio and come right back.

1317
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,302
Get Hargrove the radio. He's got
to get back to the O.P.

1318
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,771
Come on! Don't sit there
with egg on your face!

1319
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:39,307
Get what the man wants!
Hustle!

1320
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,009
Right away, sir.

1321
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:46,047
Ah, this is worth
fighting for.

1322
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,483
[Distant artillery fire]

1323
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,485
I wish Hargrove
would get back.

1324
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:53,454
He made the
battery, all right.

1325
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:56,791
They're opening up on the
coordinates he gave them now.

1326
00:59:56,858 --> 00:59:58,326
Good. Good.

1327
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,328
But I wish he'd get
back in with that radio

1328
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:06,767
so we can keep in touch
with the battery.

1329
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:08,736
Sir, we'd better
get out of here.

1330
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:11,272
They'll have this place
pulverized soon.

1331
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,841
I think you're right.
Let's go.

1332
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,353
[Softly] It's me... Hargrove.

1333
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,022
Here. Hold this gun, will you?

1334
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:07,661
I thought for a
minute you'd gone.

1335
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:09,930
Do not make a noise.

1336
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,300
You are a prisoner.
Put that down.

1337
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:21,275
Now you will tell us
what we want to know.

1338
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:24,278
Where are your
headquarters located?

1339
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:26,714
About 300 yards to the right.

1340
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:28,282
What's wrong with
that lamebrain?

1341
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,784
Hargrove: Maybe I was off
a little bit on that one.

1342
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:33,287
It's more like 400
yards to the right.

1343
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:35,789
He's giving us the correction
on our last round,

1344
01:01:35,857 --> 01:01:37,291
but something's wrong.

1345
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,293
Somebody's up there with him.

1346
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:42,296
Baker, take that as a sensing.

1347
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:46,401
Left 72420.

1348
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:52,907
How far are your front lines?

1349
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:54,775
You're right on top of them.

1350
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:56,677
That did it. That's the range.

1351
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:58,779
That kid's gotten
himself captured,

1352
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,249
and he's giving us the range
right under their noses.

1353
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:03,751
We will start now, and
you will go with us.

1354
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:05,753
Oh, you won't be needing me.

1355
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,255
But we'll take you,

1356
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:09,257
and in case we should
encounter any difficulties,

1357
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:11,159
we will deal with you first.

1358
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:22,036
Wonder what Hargrove's up to.

1359
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:24,405
He should have been
back a long time ago.

1360
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:25,606
Shh!

1361
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:27,775
What is it?

1362
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:33,247
Only one of them has a gun.

1363
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:34,782
We can handle them.

1364
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:37,017
Look out for Hargrove.

1365
01:02:40,855 --> 01:02:42,823
Uh, we'd better go this way.

1366
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:45,293
We got to watch out
for the mines.

1367
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,694
Good.

1368
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:50,764
Duck, Hargrove!

1369
01:02:50,832 --> 01:02:52,633
[Speaking German]

1370
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:59,039
Sorry I took so
long, lieutenant.

1371
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:05,246
Well, there I was,
coming up to the O.P.,

1372
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,116
and on the inside was this flock
of Germans, armed to the teeth,

1373
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:09,550
but did that stop me?

1374
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:10,918
Frankly, no.

1375
01:03:10,986 --> 01:03:12,253
I crept up to

I didn't know
what to do, so...

1384
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,768
so you gave the
Germans your own gun

1385
01:03:27,836 --> 01:03:29,470
just to even things up.

1386
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:32,773
Oh, sergeant, have you been listening
to that Nazi propaganda again?

1387
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:35,276
I'm surprised at you,
taken in like that.

Oh, I like that.

1390
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,282
So you gave the
Germans your gun.

1391
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,816
You'd have probably
sold it to them!

the chatter and get back to work.

where to get off.

That's telling him.

1480
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,765
Sergeant, it
wouldn't do any harm

1481
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:53,267
if you were to give Hargrove
and myself a few hours off.

bring you something back...

which 2 men

1497
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:33,240
I could send out on
a little detail...

with some supplies.

1499

I've come to a decision.

1500
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:41,248
Yep. You and Hargrove.

1502
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,252

1503
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,754
Cramp: Evening, chaplain.

1504
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:47,922
Sergeant.

1505
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:49,590
Get a 3/4-ton truck
ready to roll,

1506
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,024
and you and Hargrove stand by.

1507

Yes, sergeant. Ha ha.

1508
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:00,768
I have an idea, sergeant,

1509
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,770
I kept Private
Mulvehill from using

1510
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,772
some very violent
language just now.

1511
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,640
I wouldn't be a bit
surprised, chaplain.

1512
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:09,944
Now, with all the
rations and supplies,

1513
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:11,779
you ought to have a
pretty good truckload.

1514
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,246
When you get back here,

1515
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:14,782
unload everything
at Service Battery.

1516
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,249

quartermaster railhead

cream for dessert,

There's a road up ahead.

1525
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,809

at this map again.

You stick to driving.

1527
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:44,812
Last time you looked at a map,

1528
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,814
you practically steered
us out of France.

1529
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,549
Oh, sorehead.

1530
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,824
Hey, Mac! Which way to the Q.M.
railhead?

1531
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,059
Follow us. We're
going there, too.

1532
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:01,328
Good deal. You
see, it's a cinch.

We fall in at the
end of this column,

1534
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:14,008
ah, we don't need
this anymore.

1535
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:17,477
Well, drive on!

1536
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,305
I sure wish you hadn't torn
up those directions, Tom.

1537
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:47,140
Cramp said that it
wasn't very far.

1538
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,643
Will you take it easy? This whole
column's headed for the railhead.

1539
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:51,645
You heard the man
say so yourself.

1540
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:52,980
Yeah, I know, but...

1541
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,715
forget it.

to "pretty baby"?

01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:17,071
I don't know, precious.
Did you lose her?

1546
01:11:17,138 --> 01:11:18,772
He must mean one
of those trucks

1547
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,774
that turned off back
at the railhead.

1548
01:11:20,842 --> 01:11:22,275
Turned off? Where? When?

1549
01:11:22,343 --> 01:11:23,744
Where are we now?

1550
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,480
In Paris. Out of the way, boys.
We're rolling.

1551
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,293
Hey! I know what we can...

1552
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:42,195
it's no good.

1553
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:45,599
Wait a minute! Why don't we...

1554
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,268
nope. That won't work either.

1555
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:51,271
Look, will you quit
thinking out loud?

1556
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:55,308
You got me going up and
down like an elevator.

1557
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:58,311
Well, the best bet is for us
to lie low till daylight.

1558
01:11:58,379 --> 01:12:01,314
Then we can go out of the
city like we came in.

1559
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:04,251
We can always tell Cramp
we had engine trouble.

1560
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:07,254
Cramp will fix our engines, too.
You know that.

1561
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:09,757
But I guess that is
the best thing to do.

1562
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:11,759
Have you got a piece of paper?

1563
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:14,261
I'll mark down the road
that we took coming in.

1564
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:16,263
That's a good idea.
Here you are.

1565
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,265
What is this, a map?

1566
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:19,767
A map? Let's see.

1567
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:21,769
Ho ho! I'll say it's a map!

1568
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:24,271
That's the location of that stuff
I bought from the jeweler.

1569
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:27,274
This is going to make us
rich when we get to Paris.

1570
01:12:27,341 --> 01:12:28,776
Paris.

1571
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,778
What am I saying?
We're in Paris!

1572
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:32,780
Look, will you not
get so excited?

1573
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:34,748
We're not going on
any treasure hunts.

1574
01:12:34,816 --> 01:12:36,283
What's the odds we're here?

1575
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,718
We can't budge till daylight.

1576
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,753
Hargrove, destiny
brought us here.

1577
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:42,289
Fate intended for us
to make some money.

1578
01:12:42,356 --> 01:12:43,757
An inscrutable higher wisdom

1579
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:45,793
guided us to this spot.

1580
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:48,295
Mulvehill, will
you listen to me?

1581
01:12:48,362 --> 01:12:50,297
We're in enough
trouble already!

1582
01:12:50,364 --> 01:12:53,801
Hargrove, don't fight destiny.

1583
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:55,803
Drive on.

1584
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,504
[Starts engine]

1585
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,578
Shh. Shh.

1586
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:06,814
23. This is it.

1587
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:15,923
Go ahead.

1588
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,990
Me?

1589
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,892
Well, you're not a
silent partner.

1590
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,928
I couldn't fit through there.

1591
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:23,097
Besides, you can make it easy.
Go ahead.

1592
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:25,099
I'll pass you the
shovel and flashlight.

1593
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:28,268
You mean I have to dig
it up all by myself?!

1594
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,270
Don't quibble about
technicalities.

1595
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:32,272
Are you scared?

1596
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,275
No. I shake like
this all the time.

1597
01:13:35,343 --> 01:13:37,277
You keep a watch out.

1598
01:13:37,345 --> 01:13:39,246
If anybody comes,
give me a signal.

1599
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:40,781
Yeah.

1600
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,249
[Thump]

1601
01:13:42,316 --> 01:13:44,284
Hey, you hurt?

1602
01:13:44,352 --> 01:13:46,253
That first step is a killer.

1603
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,288
Well, here. Start digging.

1604
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:50,290
You'll loosen up.

1605
01:13:50,358 --> 01:13:51,358
[Clang]

1606
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,692
Ouch!

1607
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,034
[Yawns]

1608
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,937
How's it coming?

1609
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:06,907
It looks like the
Panama Canal down here.

1610
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,409
All I found is 2
more blisters.

1611
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:11,245
Listen, maybe you're just
skimming the surface.

1612
01:14:11,312 --> 01:14:13,080
Why don't you dig
down a little deeper?

1613
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,683
I'd like to skim you.

1614
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:31,832
Hi.

1615
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,767
Who's down in that cellar?

1616
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:36,270
Oh, nobody. I'm just looking
for something I dropped.

1617
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:38,272
Hargrove: You'll have to
talk louder, Mulvehill.

1618
01:14:38,339 --> 01:14:40,007
I can't hear you.

1619
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:43,510
That's what I dropped.

1620
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:50,284
You see, sir, we can explain.

1621
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:52,786
We were just looking for
something that belonged to us,

1622
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:54,288
something we bought.

1623
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:55,789
23 Avenue Court, eh?

1624
01:14:55,857 --> 01:14:58,792
You men ever stationed in
a town called Mardenne?

1625
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,294
Yes, sir.

1626
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:03,263
Ever have any dealings
with a man named Vivin?

1627
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:05,732
Yes, sir. He's the one
that sold us the watches.

1628
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,734
You see, I have a
bill of sale here

1629
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:09,736
entitling me to any watches

1630
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:11,839
found in the cellar
of 23 Avenue Court.

1631
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:13,740
I know all about it.

1632
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:16,576
You're the third bunch we
found digging up that cellar.

1633
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,645
You've been swindled,
Private Mulvehill.

1634
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:20,113
[High voice] Me?

1635
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:21,748
[Normal voice] Me?

1636
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:23,217
That's just what I mean.

1637
01:15:23,284 --> 01:15:26,253
In the future, private,
don't be such a hick.

1638
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,256
Don't fall for every con
game that comes along.

1639
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,757
No, sir.

1640
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:32,492
Let's see your passes.

1641
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,261
Hargrove: Our passes?

1642
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,830
Yes, your passes.

1643
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:41,235
Oh, Paris.

1644
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:43,971
Paris, city of love.

1645
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,241
And here I am.

1646
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:52,079
I dig a cellar, and I
wind up in a cell.

1647
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:54,781
And to whom am I indebted

1648
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:56,783
for this rare experience?

1649
01:15:56,851 --> 01:15:58,785
T. Mulvehill, mastermind!

1650
01:15:58,853 --> 01:16:01,288
That's right. Kick a
man when he's down.

1651
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:04,724
You don't have to get down.
Just bend over.

1652
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,227
Is it my fault they
didn't believe the story

1653
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,229
of how we got to Paris?

1654
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,564
I told the M.P. sergeant,
I told the lieutenant,

1655
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:14,201
I told the captain,
I told the major.

1656
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:16,703
All they did was laugh at me.

1657
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:18,238
Well, I don't blame them.

1658
01:16:18,306 --> 01:16:19,739
It sounds crazy to me.

1659
01:16:19,807 --> 01:16:21,741
I don't see why they
should believe it.

1660
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:23,743
Well, I swore on my honor!

1661
01:16:23,811 --> 01:16:25,712
You'd think
they'd believe that.

1662
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,480
Ha ha ha!

1663
01:16:27,548 --> 01:16:29,950
Man: Good evening, chaplain.
How are you?

1664
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,484
Hey, there's the chaplain!

1665
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:35,022
Oh, the chaplain. I guess he goes
along with a firing squad, huh?

1666
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:37,490
No, dummy. Our chaplain.

1667
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:41,261
Hey, he's coming this way.

1668
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:44,264
I'll hail him. Maybe
he can help us out.

1669
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:46,233
Hargrove: Oh, forget it.

1670
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,268
Oh, uh, chaplain.

1671
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:50,870
Mulvehill, what are
you doing in there?

1672
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,339
I'm in trouble, chaplain.

1673
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,873
I can see that.

1674
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,776
As a matter of fact, Hargrove
and myself are both in trouble,

1675
01:16:56,844 --> 01:16:58,745
and if I could just talk
to you for a minute,

1676
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:00,647
I could explain it.
Honest, chaplain.

1677
01:17:00,714 --> 01:17:02,782
Oh, please, chaplain.

1678
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,184
All right.

1679
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:07,220
Aw, thanks, chaplain.

1680
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:09,622
Oh, what's the use?

1681
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,391
We've told that
story so many times

1682
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:12,926
that even I don't believe it.

1683
01:17:12,994 --> 01:17:15,462
It's pretty thin.

1684
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:20,500
It's not very
convincing, is it?

1685
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,569
You know, Mulvehill,
it's really a pity.

1686
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:24,596
This is probably the first
time in your whole life

1687
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,006
that you haven't
told the truth.

1688
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,740
Mulvehill.

1689
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,242
Yeah, that's me!

1690
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:30,877
Hey, now don't
desert the ship.

1691
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:32,745
I got a good idea.

1692
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:38,751
I realize you didn't leave
a combat zone, Mulvehill,

1693
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:40,420
but you're in this
area without a pass,

1694
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:42,255
and I don't think I
should interfere.

1695
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:44,257
According to the law,
chaplain, you're right.

1696
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:45,758
There's no doubt about it,

1697
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:47,760
but we wouldn't have
done a thing like this

1698
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:49,762
unless it was very important.

1699
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,764
If you could have
seen Hargrove,

1700
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:53,766
the way he was suffering.

1701
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:55,235
Suffering? What about?

1702
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,737
Tossing and turning,
not able to sleep.

1703
01:17:57,805 --> 01:17:59,739
What was wrong with him?

1704
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:01,274
W...

1705
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,243
No. No, chaplain.
You're right.

1706
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,213
It isn't fair to
burden you with this.

1707
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,015
Don't be ridiculous,
Mulvehill.

1708
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:09,649
Perhaps I can help.

1709
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:12,419
Well, it's a girl.

1710
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:16,223
Not just a girl, but the girl.

1711
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,225
It's such a beautiful love

1712
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:21,228
that just being a party
to it has purified me.

1713
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:23,230
Well, she was in Paris.

1714
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,198
She wanted to see Hargrove.

1715
01:18:25,266 --> 01:18:28,235
She needed him, and
he couldn't get here,

1716
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:30,203
and it was driving him crazy,

1717
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:33,240
and this just seemed to
be the only thing to do

1718
01:18:33,307 --> 01:18:35,708
to keep Hargrove from
cracking up entirely.

1719
01:18:35,776 --> 01:18:37,744
We only needed a few hours

1720
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:39,846
for them to get married.

1721
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:42,849
That's very touching.

1722
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:46,253
Of course, if somebody
cared about the happiness

1723
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,223
of just 2 plain kids,
it would be different,

1724
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,259
but this is the army...

1725
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:55,262
big, heartless, impersonal.

1726
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:58,265
Ah, I guess it has to be.

1727
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:00,267
Oh, I wouldn't say
that, Mulvehill.

1728
01:19:00,334 --> 01:19:02,269
Oh, no, they're right.

1729
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:05,205
We broke regulations. We
have to suffer for it.

1730
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,774
I must say, Mulvehill,
it's splendid of you

1731
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:10,577
to become involved in
your friend's difficulty.

1732
01:19:10,644 --> 01:19:12,079
It's very gratifying.

1733
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:15,782
That's my nature. I'm
Irish, you know.

1734
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:19,286
Just a big sentimental fool.

1735
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:21,521
Wait here, Mulvehill.

1736
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:27,846
I can't believe it! We're out!
And we got a pass!

1737
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:30,297
The chaplain took a
shine to me, I guess.

1738
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:32,265
He squared it with the M.P.s

1739
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,801
by personally guaranteeing
our return to the battery,

1740
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:37,304
and we don't have to be
back till tomorrow night.

1741
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:38,771
Isn't that wonderful?

1742
01:19:38,839 --> 01:19:41,808
He said he'd square
it with Cramp, too.

1743
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,776
Tom, I, uh... I owe
you an apology.

1744
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:45,812
I was a little rough on you

1745
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:47,280
back there in that jail.

1746
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:49,316
You were excited. Forget it.

1747
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:51,818
You don't owe me a thing...

1748
01:19:51,885 --> 01:19:54,321
Except maybe some money.

1749
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:55,888
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

1750
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,327
We're going to see Paris and
have a whale of a time.

1751
01:20:00,394 --> 01:20:02,295
Look, I've got a guidebook.

1752
01:20:02,363 --> 01:20:04,764
"The educational and cultural
possibilities of Paris

1753
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:07,267
"for the soldier on leave
are truly boundless.

1754
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:10,270
"The museums, the art
galleries, the libraries...

1755
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,506
all offer their facilities"...

1756
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:16,743
They're not allowed to
make dates. It says here.

1757
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:18,778
Really? Oh.

1758
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:20,280
Well, in that case,

1759
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:21,781
let's get some culture.

1760
01:20:21,849 --> 01:20:23,283
Now to continue.

1761
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,285
"The great many places
of historic interest

1762
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,287

1763
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:30,290
"such as the Tomb of
Napoleon, Versailles"...

1764
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,792
Jeanne: Marion! Oh!

1765
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,294
Marion!

1766
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,763
[Men whistling loudly]

1767
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:38,798
Oh, that's fine.

1768
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:41,301
You get the girl.
I get the coffee.

1769
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:42,769
Ha ha.

1770
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:45,805
I've always hoped whenever
I come in the Red Cross

1771
01:20:45,873 --> 01:20:47,807
that you might be in Paris.

1772
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:50,143
And I finally made it.

1773
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:52,111
I hope the rest
of the soldiers

1774
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,781
don't expect that
with breakfast.

1775
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:56,816
This is wonderful.
We've got a whole day,

1776
01:20:56,884 --> 01:20:59,786
and you can show us around
Paris, Jeannie. Here, sit down.

1777
01:20:59,853 --> 01:21:01,821
Mulvehill, get Jeannie a
cup of coffee, will you?

1778
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:03,256
You bet.

1779
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:04,991
Thank you.

1780
01:21:24,111 --> 01:21:25,778
Chaplain: Hello, Mulvehill.

1781
01:21:25,846 --> 01:21:27,280
Well, hello, chaplain.

1782
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:28,781
I've been looking for you.

1783
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:30,283
Oh, really?

1784
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,285
I put a call through to
the battery this morning,

1785
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:33,753
and everything's all fixed up.

1786
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:35,288
They had you down A.W.O.L,

1787
01:21:35,356 --> 01:21:36,756
but I took care of it.

1788
01:21:36,824 --> 01:21:38,791
Thank you, chaplain.
Thank you very much.

1789
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:40,293
Where's Hargrove?

1790
01:21:40,361 --> 01:21:41,761
Hargrove?

1791
01:21:41,829 --> 01:21:43,263
Oh, Hargrove!

1792
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,765
Oh, yes. Well... He
didn't come down yet.

1793
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,300
Oh, that's too bad.

1794
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:50,303
I wanted to congratulate
him and wish him luck.

1795
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:53,306
Well, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him, chaplain.

1796
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:55,308
Fine. Well, enjoy yourself.

1797
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:57,711
Thank you, chaplain!
Thank you.

1798
01:22:02,383 --> 01:22:03,750
There's Hargrove now.

1799
01:22:03,817 --> 01:22:05,218
[Cup rattles]

1800
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:06,286
Where?

1801
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:07,754
And with his girl.

1802
01:22:07,821 --> 01:22:10,022
Well, so he is. So he is.

1803
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:15,228
Let me do the talking.

1804
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,264
For Pete's sake, don't blow
up, no matter what I say.

1805
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:18,732
What is the matter with you?

1806
01:22:18,799 --> 01:22:20,767
Hargrove, it's so good to
see you up and around!

1807
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:22,269
You remember the chaplain.

1808
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,770
Oh, hello, chaplain.

1809
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:24,837
Hello.

1810
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:26,273
By the way, thank
you very much

1811
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,741
for getting us out of jail.

1812
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:29,776
It's a pleasure to see
you two together.

1813
01:22:29,843 --> 01:22:31,778
Oh, Jeannie, this is
Chaplain Mallowy.

1814
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:33,780
Jeanne: How do you
do, chaplain?

1815
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:35,749
Chaplain: You may not
know it, my dear,

1816
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:37,784
but I'm the cupid that
arranged all this.

1817
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:40,287
Chaplain, don't
let us keep you.

1818
01:22:40,354 --> 01:22:42,522
Oh, no. I've plenty of time.

1819
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:46,593
This fellow has been
eating his heart out for you,

1820
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,296
and now that I've met
you, I can understand it.

1821
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:50,597
Oh, Marion!

1822
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,506
He's a lucky chap to have
a sweetheart like you

1823
01:22:52,533 --> 01:22:54,133
and a friend like Mulvehill.

1824
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:56,603
Oh, well, thank you, chaplain.

1825
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,439
Yes, thank you very
much, chaplain.

1826
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,641
Tell me, have you had
the wedding yet?

1827
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:02,909
[Fork clatters]

1828
01:23:02,976 --> 01:23:03,976
Wedding?

1829
01:23:03,977 --> 01:23:05,378
Not yet, chaplain,

1830
01:23:05,446 --> 01:23:06,913
but it's all arranged,

1831
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,715
isn't it, Hargrove?

1832
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,750
[Voice cracks] Yeah.
Yes, I guess it is.

1833
01:23:10,818 --> 01:23:12,585
Are you all right, Hargrove?

1834
01:23:12,653 --> 01:23:14,053
Oh, everything is so sudden!

1835
01:23:14,121 --> 01:23:15,855
I do not know what to say.

1836
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:20,259
But, Marion, you
do not look happy.

1837
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,762
Oh, but he is. Look at him.

1838
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,364
He's speechless with joy.

1839
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:27,266
Is this the first you've known
about this wedding, Jeannie?

1840
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,502
Oh, yes, but it
doesn't matter.

1841
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,904
We wanted it to be a
surprise, chaplain.

1842
01:23:31,972 --> 01:23:33,440
Yes, apparently.

1843
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:35,408
Jeanne: Oh, it is
a big surprise.

1844
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:38,077
I do not hear from him
for ever so long,

1845
01:23:38,145 --> 01:23:41,113
and then I just bump into
him here at the Red Cross,

1846
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:44,116
and still he does not
mention the wedding,

1847
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:47,787
and now suddenly... it
must be the American way.

1848
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,790
Fast. Very fast.

1849
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:53,827
Did I say something wrong?

1850
01:23:55,596 --> 01:23:57,296
You men get back to
your organization.

1851
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,298
That was a shabby way to get
your release last night.

1852
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,800
But, chaplain...

1853
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:03,069
get back to your battery
at once. That's all.

1854
01:24:03,136 --> 01:24:04,738
Yes, sir.

1855
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,909
I'm so sorry about this.

1856
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:12,712
I didn't know anything
about it, believe me.

1857
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,714
What a dirty trick.

1858
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:17,250
Well, you finally topped
all your past performances

1859
01:24:17,317 --> 01:24:20,019
and finished up a double-dipped
heel, didn't you?

1860
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:21,521
Now, wait a minute.

1861
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:23,322
I had to tell the chaplain
something, didn't I?

1862
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,224
You made a sucker out
of the chaplain,

1863
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,760
out of me, and out of Jeannie.

1864
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:28,261
You had to bring
her in on it, too.

1865
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:30,288
Her feelings don't count.
My feelings don't count.

1866
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,231
Just as long as you can work
that big flapper of yours

1867
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:34,267
up and down in some
complicated swindle.

1868
01:24:34,334 --> 01:24:35,769
Well, my fine friend...

1869
01:24:35,836 --> 01:24:37,771
please do not fight over it.
It is all right.

1870
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,272
It's a matter of principle.

1871
01:24:39,339 --> 01:24:40,740
I'm fed up with this swindler.

1872
01:24:40,808 --> 01:24:42,275
You thought I was
pretty good last night

1873
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:43,743
when I got you out
of that cooler.

1874
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:45,779
Oh, sure. You know, I
took it for granted

1875
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:47,947
there was some petty
larceny involved in this.

1876
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,749
I've gotten used
to that with you,

1877
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:52,786
but I also thought that there would be
some things that you would stop at.

1878
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:54,287
Well, I was wrong,

1879
01:24:54,354 --> 01:24:56,289
but, brother, I'm not
going to be wrong again.

1880
01:24:56,356 --> 01:24:57,791
I'm going back to the battery

1881
01:24:57,858 --> 01:24:59,258
and take what's coming to me,

1882
01:24:59,326 --> 01:25:01,327
and I'm going to ask Cramp to
put me in another section,

1883
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:03,296
and take a tip from me...
don't speak to me,

1884
01:25:03,363 --> 01:25:05,398
because if you do and
I've got a shovel in my hand,

1885
01:25:05,466 --> 01:25:07,033
I'm going to swing it!

1886
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,235
Ok, if that's the
way you feel.

1887
01:25:09,303 --> 01:25:12,238
That's just how I feel!

1888
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:15,241
Good-bye, Jeannie.
I'm so sorry.

1889
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,477
Good-bye, Marion.

1890
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:36,729
I beg your pardon, miss.

1891
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:38,731
Were those 2 soldiers
bothering you?

1892
01:25:38,799 --> 01:25:39,799
No.

1893
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,768
Is there anything I can do?

1894
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,269
No, nothing.

1895
01:25:43,337 --> 01:25:45,772
I'd like to be of
service if I can help.

1896
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,774
My name is Sergeant Wolf,
Sergeant John Wolf.

1897
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,276
Wolf? You mean like
the animal wolf?

1898
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:52,278
Well... Yes.

1899
01:25:52,346 --> 01:25:54,246
You like baseball, sergeant?

1900
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,783
Can't stand it. Bores me.

1901
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:59,519
Well, sit down, Sergeant Wolf.

1902
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,891
Hargrove, on the
strength of this report,

1903
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,559
I could throw you up
to a court-martial.

1904
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:08,528
What have you got to
say for yourself?

1905
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:10,897
It's all true, sir. We didn't
intentionally go into Paris,

1906
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,499
but it's all true otherwise.

1907
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,400
And that's enough, no matter
how you got into Paris.

1908
01:26:14,468 --> 01:26:15,869
What do you think, sergeant?

1909
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:18,237
Well, sir, we could
use him and Mulvehill

1910
01:26:18,305 --> 01:26:20,239
if we're moving
up again tonight.

1911
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:22,742
Why don't you leave
them to me, captain?

1912
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,244
I'll see they work
off this rap.

1913
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:26,980
All right.

1914
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:31,918
Aw, thanks, sarge.

1915
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:36,022
Shut up. You think I'd lift a
finger for you 2 chiselers

1916
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:38,090
if I'd have had time
to replace you?

1917
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:40,092
You haven't cleaned
this up, not by a mile.

1918
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,861
You got a long way to go,

1919
01:26:41,929 --> 01:26:45,765
so get out of here and
report to your section.

1920
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,634
Wait a minute.

1921
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:50,136
Where is Mulvehill?

1922
01:26:50,203 --> 01:26:52,805
I don't know, and
I don't care.

1923
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,248
Hargrove, how did you come
to go off without Mulvehill?

1924
01:27:02,315 --> 01:27:04,717
Don't even mention his name.

1925
01:27:04,785 --> 01:27:07,486
I'm through with
that chiseler.

1926
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,888
But he ain't back yet.

1927
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:10,389
If we pull out without him,

1928
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:12,258
he'll be grabbed for deserting.
That's a big rap.

1929
01:27:12,325 --> 01:27:15,227
I don't care if they
make it murder, arson,

1930
01:27:15,295 --> 01:27:17,196
or piracy on the high seas.

1931
01:27:17,264 --> 01:27:19,231
Anyway, he's probably
back here now,

1932
01:27:19,299 --> 01:27:21,734
hiding somewhere while we're
getting ready to move out.

1933
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:23,736
That way, he gets out
of doing any work.

1934
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:26,505
I just checked. He isn't
anywhere in the area.

1935
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,975
Well, it's no skin off my arm.

1936
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:32,745
Where are you going?

1937
01:27:32,813 --> 01:27:34,280
Just around.

1938
01:27:34,347 --> 01:27:36,749
Cramp: All right, fellas, let's get
ready so we can move out fast.

1939
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:38,751
You understand it...
what do you want?

1940
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:40,753
Could I talk to you
for a minute, sarge?

1941
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:42,755
Whatever it is,
the answer is no.

1942
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:45,257
Honest, sarge, this is very
important. Could I talk to you?

1943
01:27:45,325 --> 01:27:48,260
All right, fellas, just stand
around so we can move out fast.

1944
01:27:48,328 --> 01:27:49,729
Soldier: Ok.

1945
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:51,263
All right, shoot.

1946
01:27:51,331 --> 01:27:53,291
Well, I'm a little worried
about Mulvehill, sarge.

1947
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,767
He hasn't turned up...

1948
01:27:54,835 --> 01:27:56,769
what do you want
me to do about it?

1949
01:27:56,837 --> 01:27:58,270
Put a candle in my window?

1950
01:27:58,338 --> 01:28:00,106
Something must have
happened to him.

1951
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:01,908
Whatever it is won't compare

1952
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:03,710
to what happens to him
when he gets picked up.

1953
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:05,511
They'll have him
down for a deserter.

1954
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:07,013
Sarge, we ought
to do something.

1955
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:08,648
What are you getting
so worked up about?

1956
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,016
I thought you were
through with him.

1957
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:11,718
Well, I am, only...

1958
01:28:11,785 --> 01:28:12,940
only nothing, and
I don't want you

1959
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:14,386
sneaking out of this
camp looking for him.

1960
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:17,223
That'll only get you
a mess of trouble.

1961
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:19,726
You got that? You stay put.

1962
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:21,494
Yes, sergeant.

1963
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:24,463
All right, get back
to your section.

1964
01:28:43,817 --> 01:28:45,985

[Brakes squeaking]

1966
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:04,303
Hi, sarge.

1967
01:29:04,371 --> 01:29:05,772
I told you to stay put.

1968
01:29:05,839 --> 01:29:07,239
I warned you not to
leave that camp.

1969
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:09,275
Yeah, I know, but
what if he's sick

1970
01:29:09,342 --> 01:29:11,277
or in some terrible
trouble or something?

1971
01:29:11,344 --> 01:29:13,279
Look, what if you
were in the same jam

1972
01:29:13,346 --> 01:29:15,514
or you were sick or you
were wounded or something?

1973
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:17,283
What do you think
I'd do about it?

1974
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,652
You'd give 3 cheers
and go your own way.

1975
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,253
That's right.

1976
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:23,122
Oh, no. No, I wouldn't.

1977
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,692
I wouldn't rest
until I got to you,

no matter what it involved.

That's the spirit of
the field artillery.

One for all, and all for one.

1981

Why, greater love hath no man.

1982

Oh, you're breaking my heart.

1983

I can't set here jawing
with you all night.

Come on. Get in.

1988

Some guys in the club said
they saw him about an hour ago

1989
01:29:53,887 --> 01:29:55,822
in a small restaurant near
here, and he was drinking.

1990

All this and drunk, too.

We ain't got much time.

to that battery.

and to your left.

I don't know.

1998

Yeah, a little bit.

who paid for his dinner
