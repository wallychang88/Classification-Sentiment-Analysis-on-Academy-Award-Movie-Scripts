1
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,764
Whiskey, whiskey.

2
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,143
- You want some whiskey?
- No, champagne.

3
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,562
- Champagne? Yeah.
- Bob.

4
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,528
Liquid MDMA? No.

5
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,992
Tehran is the world capital.

6
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,368
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

7
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,871
You've got a... friend there.

8
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,839
How's the kid?

9
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,009
He's fine.

10
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,136
He's...

11
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,888
He's fine.

12
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,354
Arash, when you wanna do this?

13
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,690
After prayer.

14
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,465
Okay.

15
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,279
- You said they were both for you.
- What do you care?

16
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,728
Okay. Okay.

17
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,151
Okay.

18
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,542
Mr. Whiting, I'm Bennett Holiday.

19
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,547
A very big company, Connex, our client...

20
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,637
loses a huge natural-gas contract
in the Persian Gulf

21
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,265
to the Chinese.
At the same time,

22
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:35,228
a smaller company, Killen,
somehow gets the rights to Kazakhstan,

23
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,481
one of the largest
untapped oil fields in the world.

24
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,943
The big company, our client,
merges with Killen,

25
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,238
Justice wants to know
how Killen got those rights.

26
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,033
You've been scrutinizing
exactly these types of deals,

27
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,286
so if there's something to find,

28
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,205
I expect you to get it before they do.

29
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,499
And come straight to me.

30
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,006
Bennett.

31
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,674
Sir?

32
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,388
At my firm, I have a flock of sheep

33
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,182
who think they're lions.

34
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,646
Maybe you're a lion
everyone thinks is a sheep.

35
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,653
No, I wanna talk about the Gulf,
and how a goddamn emir--

36
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,116
- What is an emir anyway?
- King, it's a king.

37
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:35,121
A king. Well, how some Podunk king
tossed you out on your ass.

38
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,585
Every company in the world
wanted into Kazakhstan,

39
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,838
into the Tengiz, but Killen got it.

40
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,468
And then Connex wanted Killen,
and here we are.

41
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,182
I made investments.

42
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,311
Investments that'll bear fruit
for this company.

43
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,232
Hell, Tommy, we've all got
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

44
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,652
committed to memory.

45
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,864
I got a little copy of it taped
to the wall of my head. Right here.

46
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,700
Thanks, Jimmy.
We appreciate hearing your point of view.

47
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,204
However, a U.S. Attorney

48
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,332
is looking into your relationships
in Kazakhstan,

49
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,835
and the U.S. government is holding off
on approval of our merger.

50
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,671
So Mr. Janus and I
have brought

51
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,006
Connex's Washington counsel,
Sydney Hewitt,

52
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,510
down here to talk about
our strategy for the next 30 days.

53
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,428
Sydney?

54
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,188
In a way, I feel like Switzerland.

55
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,194
I'd like to remind everybody in this room
they've signed confidentiality agreements.

56
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,283
Allow me to introduce my associate,
Bennett Holiday,

57
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,036
who will be — how shall I put it? —

58
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,373
building consensus day-to-day.

59
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,833
Good morning.

60
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,393
You've just visited what
someday soon

61
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,062
could be the most profitable
corporation in America.

62
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,022
Provided the government
approves the merger.

63
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,734
Provided we don't start
running automobiles on water.

64
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,737
And provided there's still chaos
in the Middle East.

65
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,323
Now the job is, find the problem,
fix the problem.

66
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,119
And if you do not find a problem,
then there is no problem.

67
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,038
And when the government
approves this merger,

68
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,583
it's gonna buy a lot of houses
in the Vineyard.

69
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,293
Maybe even yours.

70
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,603
Cheerios again?

71
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,940
- Max!
- Max!

72
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,865
- Hey, man.
- Let's not read at the table, okay?

73
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,284
- Put this hand here. Block me.
- Sweetie, sweetie.

74
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,661
- Mommy? I want bacon.
- Yeah?

75
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,623
- You have bacon.
- I want real bacon.

76
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,460
You have real bacon,
only it's made from soy beans.

77
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,088
I want pig bacon.

78
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,133
I want pig bacon too.

79
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,221
- Don't say it.
- I'll try it if you try it.

80
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
- I don't know if I can bite this.
- It's crunchy.

81
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,021
- How'd you do that?
- It's kind of hard to cut.

82
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,315
- It's pretty bad.
- You be quiet.

83
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,821
<i>A merger between two U.S. oil companies
is taking place in Houston.</i>

84
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,824
<i>The new company,
Connex-Killen Corporation,</i>

85
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>will become the fifth largest
oil and gas company in the world.</i>

86
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,499
<i>The move affects 37,000 workers
in 160 countries,</i>

87
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,170
<i>and, with revenues larger than the
gross domestic product of Pakistan or Denmark,</i>

88
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,049
<i>will create the world's
23rd largest economy.</i>

89
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,303
<i>Mr. Leland Janus, chairman of Connex,
spoke today of synergy</i>

90
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,557
<i>and a desire to pass on savings
to the consumer.</i>

91
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,351
The merged operations
will create economies of scale

92
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,188
to deliver the best products to
the consumer at the lowest possible prices.

93
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,943
<i>It's a merger of necessity
for Connex, Rebecca,</i>

94
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,364
<i>who wants Killen's fields in Kazakhstan,
after gas blocks they pursued in the Gulf</i>

95
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,575
<i>were awarded
to a Chinese consortium.</i>

96
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,953
<i>Producer nations continue to look
toward developing markets in Asia,</i>

97
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,539
<i>which is having a powerful effect
on crude prices.</i>

98
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>There's at least 10 to 12 dollars
of instability premium.</i>

99
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,130
You have protests in Iran,
the threat of more strikes in Venezuela,

100
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,718
and the Turks still making noise about
Russian crude through the Bosphorus.

101
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,596
All right, thanks for having me, Rebecca.

102
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,476
<i>I'm playing. That's my job, playing.</i>

103
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,564
Yeah, well, that's a very,
very good job for you to have.

104
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,775
<i>- Tell Daddy you love him.
- I love you, Daddy.</i>

105
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,236
Hey.

106
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,491
The emir's summer party,
Marbella, this weekend.

107
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,285
Any interest?

108
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,454
Well, I can't. I got, you know...

109
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,998
Guy could be huge
for the company, Bryan.

110
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,418
It's Maxie's birthday this weekend, so--
So we have Saturday--

111
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,672
Hey, Bryan, I just need your help on this--
The emir's party. I'll take that.

112
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,342
Through finagling,
we have an audience with the emir.

113
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,345
He wrote the strategy, and he's not slick.

114
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,348
I didn't say I could go.

115
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,147
Come on. Take the children with you.
The beach, summer, Marbella. Max'll love it.

116
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,608
- Can I do that?
- Sure you can.

117
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,860
Besides, they love children.

118
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,198
John D. Rockefeller.
Founded the University of Chicago.

119
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,616
Come on.

120
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>That's fine. You're a good song leader,
Mr. Rockefeller.</i>

121
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,836
<i>Bob's freaking out
about this other missile.</i>

122
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,630
"Where's the missile? Who has it?"
He wrote a memo.

123
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,468
I just finished convincing
Brit and French Intel

124
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,012
we had nothing to do
with the Amiri job.

125
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,224
What do we say to them now?
"Well, something's missing."

126
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,853
<i>He's gotta stop this.
He's gotta stop with the memos.</i>

127
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>Okay. Here's something.
You put him up for promotion.</i>

128
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,698
He's due. He's a good man.
He saved our ass in Beirut in '85.

129
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,909
That's great. Terry likes him.
We'll get him an audition downtown.

130
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,453
<i>You get him an audition downtown.</i>

131
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>They're going crazy about Iran now.
Bob's an expert.</i>

132
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,833
<i>Speaks Farsi,
for chrissake.</i>

133
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,669
<i>Bob has never had a desk job.</i>

134
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,213
<i>He's never done 9 to 5,
never been on committee.</i>

135
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,009
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's gotta stay on message.

136
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,846
Absolutely.

137
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,682
<i>I'll prep him.</i>

138
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,311
In fact, we just pulled
one of our officers out.

139
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,022
I took the initiative to ask him
to come down here.

140
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:08,694
He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut
in the '80s, won himself some nice medals.

141
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,863
We're thinking about
giving him a station.

142
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,491
Beirut in the '80s,
is that a résumé-builder?

143
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,871
Don't chomp down on any bait.

144
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,331
We're fine.

145
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,374
Iran is fine.

146
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,084
Fine.

147
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,924
And our analysis seems to be on the mark.
We're getting good satellite coverage.

148
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,051
We're reprogramming resources
into Iran--

149
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,221
Thank you for coming.
Welcome back and forgive me if I wade in,

150
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,349
but forgetting for a second
your bureaucratic checklist,

151
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,894
I'm trying to get
undigested information.

152
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,316
- Well, to the best of our ability--
- India is now our ally. Russia is our ally.

153
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
Even China will be an ally.

154
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,488
Everybody between Morocco
and Pakistan is the problem.

155
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:58,160
Failed states and failed economies,
but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S.

156
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,372
Persians do not want to roll back
the clock to the eighth century.

157
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,209
I see students marching in the streets.
I hear Khatami making the right sounds.

158
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:09,296
And what I'd like to know is,
if we keep embargoing them on energy,

159
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,299
then someday soon,
are we gonna have a nice, secular,

160
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,511
pro-Western, pro-business government?

161
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,268
It's possible. It's complicated.

162
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,436
Of course it is. Thank you for your time.

163
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,865
They let young people march in the street.
Next day, they shut down 50 newspapers.

164
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,203
Put a few satellite dishes up on the roofs,
let them have <i>My Two Dads.</i>

165
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,955
That doesn't mean the ayatollahs

166
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,583
are surrendering one iota of control
over that nation.

167
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,794
Mr. Barnes,
the reform movement in Iran

168
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,964
is one of the president's
great hopes for the region

169
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,759
and crucial to the petroleum security
of the United States.

170
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,138
These gentlemen are with the CLI.

171
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,645
The Committee for the Liberation of Iran,
Mr. Barnes.

172
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,950
Maybe you'll get made ambassador
to somewhere cool.

173
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,871
Like France or Italy or Ghana.

174
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,292
It's not beyond the realm
of possibility, is it?

175
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,963
How's your mom?

176
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,091
Great. She's great.

177
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,970
So I know it's still a year away,

178
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,473
but I'll have to have a car,
a decent car.

179
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:48,103
Nothing too fancy, but it has to run
so that I can get into Boston and New York.

180
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,231
They have a great crew.
That's what they told me.

181
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,901
I said, "Crew of what?"
And they said, "Rowing."

182
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,528
- So if I wanna row, it'd be kind of fun.
- Thank you.

183
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,530
Robby, listen.

184
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,408
I live in Maryland,

185
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,872
which means that you have
residency in Maryland.

186
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,291
For the University of Maryland.

187
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,299
I'm sorry, can I steal this from you?
Thank you so much.

188
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,472
I just want a normal senior year, Dad.

189
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,016
I want a normal house.

190
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,061
I want Cinemax and prom.

191
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,231
You know what prom is like in Pakistan?
Prom sucks in Pakistan.

192
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,858
It's complicated, you know.

193
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,444
I may have really screwed up at work.

194
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,029
How?

195
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,657
I was supposed to keep
my mouth shut and I didn't.

196
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:51,083
What does Mom do, again,
that we have to live in Islamabad?

197
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,303
- She's a secretary.
- Secretary.

198
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,519
Robby.

199
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,813
Both of my parents are professional liars.

200
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,440
Hey.

201
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,366
Did you guys just get a party?

202
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,201
I do too.

203
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,289
This is a party not for you.

204
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,800
All right, guys.

205
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,640
- Does somebody live here?
- Yeah, in the summertime.

206
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,397
My father welcomes the Chinese
to our country.

207
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,359
Of course.

208
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,363
Please.

209
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,740
Right there.

210
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,703
Thank you.

211
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,710
Arabs are very family-oriented,
as a people.

212
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,755
Is that racist?

213
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,507
Sure.

214
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,134
- It is?
- A little.

215
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,638
Well, no. I mean, I guess
if what you're saying is positive.

216
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,686
You have to go in.

217
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,939
Don't.

218
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,069
Let him work it out on his own.
It's important for his autonomy.

219
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,203
All right!

220
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,709
Hakim!

221
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,462
<i>Hakim! Hakim! Hakim!</i>

222
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,763
Farooq!

223
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,060
Hakim! Hakim!

224
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,479
Are you here to see the emir?

225
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,189
Yeah.

226
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,691
Me too.

227
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,987
What do you do?

228
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:54,993
I'm a partner in
a derivatives-trading company in Geneva.

229
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,621
- Energy?
- Yeah.

230
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,164
Right.

231
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,791
- Bryan Woodman?
- Yes.

232
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,334
- Good evening.
- Hi.

233
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,586
Hi, Bryan Woodman.

234
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,673
We regret that His Highness
will be unable to see you.

235
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,677
However, we are authorized
to hear your proposition on his behalf.

236
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,929
Oh, okay.

237
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,142
What, here? Now?

238
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,357
Okay. Well...

239
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,529
Okay. Our position is that
the real worry for you guys

240
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,156
is another year of record pricing.

241
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,744
There are no more elephant fields,
not even in natural gas,

242
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,831
and as structural alternatives
become more fully realized,

243
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,419
you'll need new strategies to maximize
every penny of your existing resources,

244
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,588
particularly in a climate
of falling prices.

245
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:53,468
And that's what, you know, our firm is
prepared to help problem-solve with you —

246
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,430
the, you know, foreseeable

247
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,559
and unforeseeable problems
you encounter.

248
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,261
Are you not talking?

249
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,641
Come on, sweetheart.
Just a little bit, okay?

250
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,061
You're the shark, and you try
to tag us as we swim across.

251
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,480
All right? You jump in,
count "one, two, three",

252
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,524
then we try to get to the other side.

253
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,193
- All right? Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

254
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,320
Come on, go. Go.

255
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,033
Yeah. Okay.

256
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,788
- Come on, jump in.
- Come on.

257
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,332
- Come on. Jump in!
- Sissy!

258
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,001
Just jump, come on!

259
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,472
Max?

260
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,474
- Max!
- Oh, my God!

261
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,854
Cut the power! Cut the power!

262
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,398
Max! Max!

263
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,525
- Let go!
- Somebody cut the power!

264
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,699
- Max!
- Come on. Come on.

265
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,951
- That's my son!
- Oh, my God.

266
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,494
- Get out of my way!
- Okay.

267
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,996
- Oh, my God!
- Take him!

268
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,041
Take him! Take him out.
Take him this way. Take him out.

269
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,210
Put him down. Down, down.

270
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,547
- Sweetie?
- Someone get a doctor, doctor, doctor!

271
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,549
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

272
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,801
- Get a doctor!
- Is anybody a doctor?

273
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,679
Do something! Help us!

274
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,981
<i>I hear phrases thrown around like
"the corrupting influence of money",</i>

275
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,944

I wanna look out the window.

312
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,745
You wanna look out the window?
Come on.

00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,086

Right. Well, it's not exactly a secret
that Iran will refuse snap inspections.

317
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,992
Okay, Rebecca. Thank you.

318
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,705
Go home.

319
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,959
It was a stupid fucking question, Henry.

320
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,213
The prince's man called again.

321
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,633
I'm just telling him.

322
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,149
Hey, how bad is it?

323
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,902
When a Volvo dealer says that...

324
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,989
Okay. You're honorable, decent guys.

325
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,532
Right.

326
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,702
My wife and our narrow driveway...

327
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,496
- How the hell are you?
- Well, you know, can't complain.

328
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,916
That's not good, kiddo.
That's suffering quietly.

329
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,127
Married? Kids?

330
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,007
There is no way a company like Killen

331
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,885
pulled off a deal like this
without paying somebody off.

332
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,846
Why don't you tell me what you have
so I can respond.

333
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,683
I used to think there was
something wrong here.

334
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,269
Now I know there's
something wrong here.

335
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,651
Either you don't find anything,
because you don't know how to look,

336
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:40,531
or you do and they carve you out
and light you on fire.

337
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,618
That's gotta be the play here, right?

00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,375
Sydney Hewitt's new boy.

340
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,668
How many of those have I seen?

341
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,213
Six? Seven?

342
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,882
They're all gone.

343
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,593
He's still Sydney-fucking-Hewitt.

344
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,472
Fourteen-11.

345
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,224
Match point.

346
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,394
I think they've got someone
inside the deal.

347
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,812
Someone they can squeeze.

348
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,524
You mean like an informant?

349
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,736
Yes, sir, like an informant. Just my opinion,
based on their overconfidence.

350
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,738
Match point.

351
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,082
Thank you.

352
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,754
You know, if people in oil deals

353
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,508
talked to U.S. Attorneys,
there'd be no oil business. Dean.

354
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,595
Bennett Holiday, you know Dean Whiting,
founding partner of our firm.

355
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,806
- Good to see you, sir.
- How are you?

356
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,600
We've been discussing
the Connex-Killen merger situation.

357
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,895
Will they get approval?
Hell of a large company if they do.

358
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,605
I mean, client.

359
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,692
Well, the Tengiz field,
Killen's largest asset,

360
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,612
is being looked into pretty heavily
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

361
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,781
Well, Bennett,
as they say in the Bible:

362
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,285
"There are many, many ways
to light Europe."

363
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:28,806
<i>Yeah, well, there's an arrow on the ceiling
pointing towards Mecca.</i>

364
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,268
The Binladin Group
air-conditioned Mecca.

365
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,980
It was a huge project.
They made billions and billions.

366
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>All the women are dressed in black
from head to toe,</i>

367
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,156
<i>walking 5 feet behind the men.</i>

368
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,745
<i>It's 125.</i>

369
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,706
<i>Literally, 125 and humid.</i>

370
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,877
<i>When I walked out of the airport,
it was like a wall fell on me.</i>

371
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,923
<i>The men are all wearing white sheets.</i>

372
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,469
<i>And they're spotless white sheets.
I don't really understand that.</i>

373
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,554
<i>They kind of say:</i>

374
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,974
<i>"It's hot and I don't have to work."</i>

375
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,519
<i>I don't understand how
you could do anything in that.</i>

376
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,063
<i>I'd like to see these guys play baseball.</i>

377
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,736
Are you okay?

378
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,781
<i>You sound strange.</i>

379
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,824
No, I'm fine.

380
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,812
This was a birthday and graduation present
a couple years ago.

381
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,150
What happened was,
I was about to graduate from Oxford

382
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,655
and my mother had a horse
in the Royal Ascot race, right?

383
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,032
The horse won

384
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,661
that same day that I was graduating.
And my trust fund matured.

385
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,165
So that tops any birthday present that
any of you have bought for me tonight.

386
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,839
Capitalism cannot exist without waste.

387
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,510
We should write thank-you notes
to Mr. Whiting and the U.S.A,

388
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,346
for producing one-quarter
of the world's garbage

389
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,723
and one-quarter of the demand.

390
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,934
You're certainly welcome.

391
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,852
Our pleasure, really.

392
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,982
Prince...

393
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,779
is there anything
that we can do for you?

394
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,701
Americans are always happy to drill holes
in other people's countries.

395
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:22,039
I've heard of you, Mr. Whiting.
The cat's-paw of the Saudi princes.

396
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,921
I know your brother, the foreign minister.
He's very bright.

397
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,381
I know your father too.

398
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,552
He threw the second creepiest party
I've ever been to in Washington.

399
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,179
And as far as I can see,

400
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,892
you could probably use
a bit of the cat's-paw yourself.

401
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,230
Second-born son,
so beaten down by his family

402
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,192
he can't even tell me what he wants
when he's asked straight-out.

403
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,530
A grown-up baby
who's afraid of his brother...

404
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,909
and maybe wants to be king?

405
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,287
Maybe?

406
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,915
Well, prince...

407
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,918
are you a king?

408
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,172
Can you tell me what you want?

409
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,095
<i>All right, what's next?</i>

410
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,473
<i>The lethal finding on Nasir came through.</i>

411
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,100
<i>That was quick. You have a timetable?</i>

412
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,103
<i>He'll be in Beirut next week.
We could do it there.</i>

413
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,606
<i>That's good. Anybody around?</i>

414
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,484
<i>Actually, yes.
I made contact with Mussawi.</i>

415
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,944
<i>He'd be happy to work
with whoever we send.</i>

416
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,032
I was thinking it would be good for Bob.

417
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,455
I'll let you have him
without going through Terry,

418
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,666
but everything better go exactly right.

419
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,461
And tell him, "Easy on the memos."

420
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,715
This is the prototype
of an oil-rich Arab monarchy.

421
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:59,303
Since prevailing in the tribal conflicts
of the 1920s,

422
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,265
the Al-Subaai family have ruled
their kingdom effectively

423
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,976
and, by most accounts, benignly.

424
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:10,356
However, they face enormous challenges
in the future.

425
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,609
The fact of the matter is that
at current levels of production...

426
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,736
- Welcome, Bob.
- Hi.

427
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,532
Good news. I think we've got something
for you, something you'll like,

428
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,994
that utilizes your specific skill set.

429
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,831
You know this guy?

430
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,460
- Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.
- His money's in a lot of dark corners,

431
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,005
paying for weapons
that could be used against the U.S.A.

432
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,552
Paperwork on polygraphs.

433
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,470
Wire transfers to Qaeda fronts.

434
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,599
Letters instructing his water ministry
to employ Mohammed Sheik Agiza,

435
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,518
the guy who has your missile.

436
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,271
He's traveling to Beirut.
You have experience in Beirut.

437
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,189
It's a great city.

438
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,859
This is a bad guy.

439
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,529
And, who knows, maybe you'll find
your blue-eyed Egyptian.

440
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,283
- I sent you a report on--
- Sorry, I gotta get going.

441
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,577
My daughter's got a soccer game.

442
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,328
Big one.

443
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,374
Did you see my missile report?
I reset the guidance to blow 10 feet--

444
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,792
Bob, you just don't get it.

445
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,380
Nobody wants to hear about
a missing missile, not right now.

446
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,216
This is top of the director's list.

447
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,760
Hit a walk-off home run...

448
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,804
you get any desk you want.

449
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:28,934
Sheik Hamad has not yet made
a decision about who will succeed him.

450
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,479
In our view, Prince Nasir

451
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,400
is likely the more ambitious
of the two brothers.

452
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,277
This, however, does not mean

453
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,990
that he will prevail
in any succession struggle.

454
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,139
My father has ordered
the Marbella estate to be razed.

455
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,645
There'll be a park.

456
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,149
We're so sorry for your loss.

457
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,833
Six more North Field blocks
are being developed.

458
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,169
We'd like to offer your firm the rights.

459
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,673
Six blocks?

460
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,634
- Which phase?
- Third phase.

461
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,139
Okay, so we'd be in the stream for

462
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,766
10 one-hundredths of a cent.

463
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,228
So $75 million.

464
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,188
Seventy-- Great. That's great.

465
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,357
How much for my other kid?

466
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,409
You know, if I were your economic adviser,
I'd tell you that

467
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,412
that's not the stupidest thing,
financially, you've done,

468
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,374
but probably just the dumbest thing
you'll do today. Probably.

469
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,501
But why would you need
an economic adviser?

470
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,837
Years ago, you had
the highest GNP in the world.

471
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,923
Today, you're tied with Albania.
So good work.

472
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,718
Your second biggest export
is secondhand goods,

473
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,221
followed closely by dates,
for which you lose 5 cents a pound.

474
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,557
You know what the business world
thinks of you?

475
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,561
We think 100 years ago, you were living
in tents, chopping each other's heads off

476
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,147
and that's exactly where you'll be
in another 100.

477
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,233
So, yes, on behalf of my firm,
I accept your money. Thank you.

478
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,403
Fine. I'll have the funds
transferred to your firm immediately.

479
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,905
Great.

480
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,407
And I'll give you 100 million
for the other kid.

481
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,705
So now you're my economic adviser,

482
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,334
why don't you tell me something
I don't already know.

483
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,174
All right. You want an idea?
Here's an idea.

484
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,095
There's the Eurasian triangle.

485
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,848
Your kingdom is here. Iran is there.
You've been selling your oil,

486
00:48:55,015 --> 00:49:00,813
sticking it on ships and watching
as it sails away around Africa to there.

487
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,274
Pretend for a second that
this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity.

488
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,611
That's your route. Right there.
Overland, through Iran.

489
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,280
Hook up with these pipes.
Commoditize it, control it,

490
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,866
take it to the doorstep
of every home in Europe.

491
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:16,620
I just doubled your profit.
I think that's a pretty good idea.

492
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,057
My granddaddy was a wildcatter.
Same with my daddy.

493
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,643
That's how I got my start.

494
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,146
Luck and hard work.

495
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,231
Nobody handed me shit.

496
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,358
Now I got

497
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,154
libraries and parks named after me.

498
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,825
And I'll probably ruin my grandkids.

499
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,372
You wearing a wire, Bennett?

500
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,000
No.

501
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,555
Mr. Janus,

502
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,141
chairman of Connex,

503
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:23,103
and Dean Whiting,
founding partner of your firm,

504
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:27,316
are proud members of
the Committee to Liberate Iran.

505
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,027
Danny D. here is too.

506
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,362
D is for "Dalton".

507
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,325
- I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal.
- "The other side"?

508
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,204
<i>El Presidente</i> Nazarbayev's best pal
in the whole world.

509
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,956
She's a beautiful field, the Tengiz.

510
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,419
Goddamn, is she a beautiful field.

511
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,884
What is it? "Irish..."

512
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,680
"The Irish pray on their knees,
the Scots prey on their neighbors."

513
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,268
How's Margaret?

514
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,479
You guys divorced yet?

515
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,774
- We're not getting divorced.
- I don't think, in our line of work,

516
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:13,528
there's two people with your security
clearances who have made a marriage work.

517
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,572
I'm telling you, Bobby, my boy,

518
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,033
number three. That's the charm.

519
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,494
- That's the number, huh?
- Yeah.

520
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,164
I like consulting.

521
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,333
No, I love it.

522
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,752
Love it. And I'll say this for it:

523
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,922
Private business is efficient.

524
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,091
There, I've said it.
Fucking cliché.

525
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:38,053
And the CIA is, like, what,
a 30-billion-a-year business,

526
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,223
so anybody who wants to sell anything —
a pencil, a computer —,

527
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:45,435
they gotta interface through
a security clearance. Don't give me shit.

528
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,731
I got two kids in college,
and we're doing our kitchen.

529
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,610
Stan, I got a chance to go back to Beirut.

530
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,821
I wanna go back.

531
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,115
Is it safe for me?

532
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,288
Are we talking about with your wife
or with the wackos?

533
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,256
Clear it with Hezbollah.

534
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,270
Said Hashimi. Said Hashimi.

535
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,022
Said Hashimi.

536
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,858
I'm Canadian. It's okay. Canadian.

537
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,401
Said Hashimi.

538
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,530
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,616
It's okay.

540
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,806
Rumors of Bob, but never Bob.

541
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,059
It is "Bob", right?

542
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,439
What is it you tell people
you do these days, Bob?

543
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,650
Between State Department and Defense.

544
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,199
It's just me, buddy.

545
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,452
As requested.

546
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,332
I'm gonna get
some information out, Jimmy.

547
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,337
- My name is Mussawi.
- Okay, Jimmy.

548
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,722
He's traveling in Beirut.

549
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,933
It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear.

550
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,442
Take him from his hotel, drug him,
put him in the front of a car

551
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,654
and run a truck into him
at 50 miles an hour.

552
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,204
It's good to have you back in town, Bob.

553
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,859
Beirut.

554
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,405
No, no. He invited me
to come with him.

555
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,866
I think he thinks he's some kind
of reformer or something.

556
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,328
Anyway, he's got a nice private plane.

557
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,541
Hold on, Vincent.

558
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,630
Hey.

559
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,925
Beirut? It's great. It's like the...

560
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,262
It's like the Paris of the Middle East.

561
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,723
Yeah, it's like--
It's like winning the NIT.

562
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,729
It's a bad--
Just never mind, never mind.

563
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,200
American?

564
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,786
Canadian.

565
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,538
Don't see many Occidentals these days.

566
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,636
It's too bad.

567
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,229
Go, go, go.

568
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,110
- This is November, '94.
- Yeah. Excellent, excellent.

569
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,071
- Did you find the others?
- I couldn't. Joe's looking for it.

570
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,824
- He'll bring it out when he does.
- Where is he?

571
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,159
He's back there looking.
He'll bring them out.

572
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,161
Okay. Thank you, Susan.

573
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,547
Hello?

574
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,465
Yeah.

575
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,259
Who's this?

576
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,683
Yeah. Okay.

577
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,773
How you doing, sir?

578
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,067
Somebody called me.

579
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,965
Bob.

580
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,761
What do you know about
torture methods

581
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,555
used by the Chinese
on the Falun Gong?

582
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,809
Method number one.

583
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,312
What's your guess?

584
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,025
Water dungeon.

585
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,570
Did you guess water dungeon?

586
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,742
Number two method?

587
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,121
Number two, twisting arm
and putting face in feces.

588
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,375
Not interested in two.

589
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,463
Number three.

590
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,300
Number three is called...

591
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,929
"pulling nails from fingers."

592
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,641
What do you think, Bob?

593
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,602
Number three sound good to you?

594
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:46,400
The purpose is to get the
monks or whatever...

595
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,112
to recant their beliefs.

596
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,283
What if I had to get you to recant?

597
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,453
That'd be pretty difficult, right?

598
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,581
Because...

599
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:04,794
if you have no beliefs
to recant, then what?

600
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,759
Well, then, you're fucked is what.

601
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,596
Bob.

602
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,850
You're gonna give me the names

603
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,812
of every person
that's taken money from you.

604
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,533
Oh, that is disgusting.

605
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,829
Come on, Jimmy,
you're not a Koran-thumper.

606
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,582
My name is Mussawi.

607
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,683
You fucking fuck, fucking fuck,
stupid fuck!

608
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,519
What the fuck? This is a war.

609
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:08,357
Fuck! You're a PO-fucking-W!
Give me the fucking names!

610
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,527
Fuck it.

611
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,415
I'm gonna cut your head off, Bob.

612
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,571
Jane.

613
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,241
We've just received a dispatch
from Damascus, eight minutes old.

614
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,994
Mussawi's shopping a story
that we sent Bob to Beirut

615
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,330
to assassinate Prince Nasir.

616
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,253
We better go talk to Terry.

617
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:21,467
Can we get this guy?
I mean now, real-time now.

618
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,303
- Mussawi?
- I'll call you back.

619
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:27,890
The practical answer is no.
Not before he goes into another mosque

620
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,601
or a newspaper
and the story gains traction. No.

621
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,203
- He have Bob's name?
- Not his real name.

622
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:35,064
Mussawi's shopping photos
of them doing the deal, long lens.

623
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,775
Photos of Bob being held.
We're lucky this guy is alive.

624
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:41,320
The whole contact was a setup.
Mussawi now apparently works with Iran.

625
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,990
First he tortures our guy,
then he peddles the CIA connection.

626
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,537
Put some space between us and Bob.

627
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,749
Bob has a long history
of entrepreneurial operations.

628
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,085
We haven't really had a handle
on Bob for years.

629
01:10:56,252 --> 01:11:00,089
After 9/11, some people got leeway,
let their emotions get the best of them.

630
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,757
These are complex times.

631
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:06,429
There's already an active investigation
into Bob's activities in-- Help me out here.

632
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,557
Tehran, the Amiri brothers job.

633
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:12,476
We're finding out who hired Bob
for the Amiri brothers job.

634
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,979
Could the same people
be behind the Nasir job?

635
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,982
A lot of people probably want
this Nasir dead...

636
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,693
and Bob knows lots of people.
Fill in the rest.

637
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,278
Send me everything.

638
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,881
<i>You first established contact
with the Amiri brothers in 1998?</i>

639
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,299
<i>Yeah.</i>

640
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,801
<i>- You met them at a party in France?
- Yes.</i>

641
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,845
<i>A party given by Reza Reyhani?</i>

642
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,638
<i>Reza, yes.</i>

643
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,016
<i>Were you aware they were
in illegal arms trade?</i>

644
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,143
<i>Of course I was aware.
That's why I went.</i>

645
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,439
<i>Were you aware these two men
were Iranian intelligence officers?</i>

646
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,818
- What do you think?
- This is a diplomatic incident.

647
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,528
Two men have been murdered.

648
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,989
We've been tasked
with the damage assessment.

649
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,992
We'll need you to turn
your passport over to us.

650
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,368
Passports.

651
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,671
Hey.

652
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,174
Hey, I found this.

653
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,801
Wire transfer.

654
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,680
In Russian. I don't speak Russian.

655
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,099
Get it translated.

656
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,689
Do you speak Russian?

657
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,445
- These are dead.
- Oh, thanks.

658
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,947
What are these?

659
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,451
Orphans. You know,
things that don't make any sense.

660
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,203
That one's pretty interesting.

661
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,373
The Lily School.
It's a boarding school in Switzerland.

662
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,292
Paid for by wire transfer.

663
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,176
The meeting's already started.
You're not on the list.

664
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,555
This is not an open function.
You're not wearing a badge.

665
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,723
You don't have a wristband.

666
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,479
This is a private gathering.

667
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:25,943
Take this to Sydney Hewitt.

668
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,489
<i>They are pushing
for the segregation of universities.</i>

669
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,907
Please.

670
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,411
<i>And the banning of the wearing
of colorful clothing.</i>

671
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:40,165
<i>But two-thirds of Iran's population
is under 30.</i>

672
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:41,584
How you doing?

673
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,211
<i>More than 60 percent
of university students are women.</i>

674
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,256
<i>And those restrictions
are like a small pebble</i>

675
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,592
<i>in front of a massive tidal wave
of reform.</i>

676
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,470
<i>Iranian resources are abundant,</i>

677
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,723
<i>and given the chance,
there is no limit</i>

678
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:59,602
<i>to what the Iranian people can achieve.</i>

679
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,480
<i>Their hopes are the same
as all people in every land —</i>

680
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:07,401
<i>to live lives of dignity
in a nation at peace.</i>

681
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,988
<i>And America will help them.</i>

682
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:14,617
Killen Oil, through Daniel Dalton
and Petroika Energy Consultants,

683
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,619
created assetless shell companies,

684
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,121
owned by the heirs
of Nurzan Detayev,

685
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,999
Republic of Kazakhstan's
minister of Domestic Resources.

686
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,627
This was discussed
at the Upstream Division meeting

687
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,795
in January, 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

688
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,548
I was at the meeting,
but I don't focus on those details.

689
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,885
Wherein it was described
that Killen bore all financial risk,

690
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:38,307
but Minister Detayev's children, while
attending The Lily School in Switzerland,

691
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,518
were entitled to all of the profits.
Seventy million dollars.

692
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:45,314
I attended the meeting, but as I said,
I don't focus on those kind of details.

693
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,651
Further, Daniel Dalton Jr.
and Petroika Energy Consultants colluded--

694
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,737
A firm retained by Killen
prior to Connex's involvement.

695
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:55,115
Oh, for chrissake, Tommy.
We both got letters from the grand jury.

696
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:59,036
- It's not your own private pity party.
- A good faith purchaser is in good faith

697
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,539
only if they didn't know of the problems
at the time of the purchase.

698
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,334
This is the oil business
we're talking about?

699
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,421
Lowliest little shareholder knows we deal
with the most stank places on earth.

700
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,590
And it is illegal to offer gifts, money,

701
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,427
the promise of money, or anything of value
to influence foreign officials.

702
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:16,845
Is it?

703
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,182
I have personally seen a bill
from your law firm

704
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,019
to the government of Saudi Arabia
for $36 million.

705
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,523
A one-line bill for "services rendered".

706
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,735
The business of Whiting Sloan
is not under discussion at this time.

707
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,655
Well, it ought to be.

708
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,617
Danny's a good man.

709
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,704
And he's a friend of mine.

710
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,501
A Mareva injunction?

711
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,755
Some people — cousins of mine, actually —
sued my father in the Commonwealth,

712
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,510
alleging he broke an agreement
to repay funds from the state.

713
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:59,888
It calls them "aggrieved royals".
Aggrieved about what?

714
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:04,059
That he tried to cut their allowances
from 100,000 a month to 80?

715
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:31,962
My cousins aren't bright enough
to be anything but finger puppets...

716
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:38,927
and my brother has faith
only in his own cunning.

717
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,936
What do you suppose they're up to,
my brother and these American lawyers?

718
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:50,898
Tell me...

719
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,609
what are they thinking?

720
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,280
What are they thinking?

721
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,657
What are they thinking?

722
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,619
They're thinking that it's running out.

723
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,788
It's running out.

724
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:09,708
And 90 percent of what's left
is in the Middle East.

725
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,169
Look at the progression.

726
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:18,675
Versailles, Suez, 1973,
Gulf War One, Gulf War Two.

727
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,845
This is a fight to the death.

728
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,972
So, what are they thinking?
"Great."

729
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,059
They're thinking, "Keep playing,
keep buying yourself new toys.

730
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,354
"Keep spending $50,000 a night
on your hotel room.

731
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,523
"But don't invest in your infrastructure.

732
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:34,191
"Don't build a real economy."

733
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:38,821
So that when you finally wake up,
they will have sucked you dry...

734
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:42,741
and you will have squandered
the greatest natural resource in history.

735
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:49,289
Come with me, please.

736
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:57,172
I studied at Oxford.
I have a Ph.D. from Georgetown.

737
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,841
I want to create a parliament.

738
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,843
I want to give women the right to vote.

739
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,011
I want an independent judiciary.

740
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,848
I want to start a petroleum exchange
in the Middle East,

741
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,350
cut the speculators
out of the business.

742
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:12,437
Why are the major oil exchanges
in London and New York anyway?

743
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:15,357
I'll put all of our energy
up for competitive bidding.

744
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,277
I'll run pipe through Iran to Europe,
like you proposed.

745
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,153
I'll ship to China.

746
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,240
Anything that achieves efficiency
and maximizes profit.

747
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:26,743
Profit which I will then use
to rebuild my country.

748
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,705
- Great, that's exactly what you should do.
- Exactly.

749
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:34,376
Except your president
rings my father and says:

750
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:40,799
"I've got unemployment in
Texas, Kansas, Washington state."

751
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,886
A phone call later, we're stealing
out of our social programs

752
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,847
in order to buy overpriced airplanes.

753
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,893
We owed the Americans,
but we've repaid that debt.

754
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,980
I accepted a Chinese bid,
the highest bid,

755
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,318
and suddenly I'm a terrorist.
I'm a godless communist.

756
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,492
Dean Whiting...

757
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,288
who represents not only these
aggrieved royals and my brother,

758
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,915
but also Connex Oil,

759
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:17,336
they've been pressuring my father
to invalidate the Chinese contract.

760
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,254
But they underestimate him.

761
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,091
This is about his legacy to his people.

762
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,928
I know it seems like
people sitting in hotel rooms.

763
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,846
That's how they do business.

764
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,183
But we're--
We're talking world historical stage here.

765
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,853
I mean, with the-- With the delivery deals
we could make in Europe,

766
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,355
transport through Iran.

767
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:40,442
This guy might be able to revolutionize
not just his country, but the whole region.

768
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:45,447
As soon as his father keels over,
this guy could be like Mossadegh in '52

769
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,742
in Iran. The real democracy
rising up organically.

770
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,370
If we can be a part of
any of these countries...

771
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:54,831
getting a parliament,
helping them find efficiency, showing--

772
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:58,293
- You know, showing them how--
- Stop it. Stop it.

773
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,966
Julie, the little company
that I started working for

774
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,677
is now chief economic adviser
to Prince Nasir.

775
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:08,470
Do you understand what that means?

776
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,055
It's like

777
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,475
somebody put a giant ATM
on our front lawn.

778
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,018
Here's a question:

779
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,939
How do you think it looks
to profit off the death of your 6-year-old?

780
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,234
Fuck you.

781
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,403
Fuck you.

782
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,659
I changed the diapers.
I put cream on rashes.

783
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,911
I took him to his checkups.

784
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,998
I cared about every fucking percentile.

785
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,671
I did everything right.
I did everything right.

786
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,596
We're going back to the States.

787
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:53,557
Good.

788
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,242
Riley?

789
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,746
Sweetie, sweetie, be careful.

790
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,999
We're gonna go now, okay?

791
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:21,543
You wanna say goodbye to your dad?

792
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,506
You can see him later, okay?

793
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,553
<i>Some trust-fund prosecutor
got off message at Yale</i>

794
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,847
<i>thinks he's gonna run this
up the flagpole?</i>

795
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,349
<i>Make a name for himself?</i>

796
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,435
<i>Maybe get elected some
two-bit congressman from nowhere,</i>

797
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,604
<i>with the result that China or Russia</i>

798
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,940
<i>can suddenly start having,
at our expense,</i>

799
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,900
<i>all the advantages we enjoy here?</i>

800
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,444
No, I tell you. No, sir.

801
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,823
Corruption charges. Corruption?

802
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,242
Corruption is government intrusion

803
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:38,120
into market efficiencies
in the form of regulation.

804
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:42,040
That's Milton Friedman.
He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.

805
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,502
We have laws against it precisely
so we can get away with it.

806
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,462
Corruption is our protection.

807
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,923
Corruption keeps us safe and warm!

808
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,926
Corruption is why you and I are
prancing around in here...

809
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:56,096
instead of fighting over scraps of meat
out in the street.

810
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:59,474
Corruption is why we win.

811
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:03,812
<i>How'd it go?</i>

812
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,106
Well, he's got kids, a wife.

813
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,650
He broke the law.

814
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,238
Mr. Janus himself wanted me
to extend you an invitation

815
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,490
to Oilman of the Year.

816
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,659
He's being honored,

817
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,120
so it should be a nice weekend.

818
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,374
Relax. Catch yourself a massage.

819
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,668
Congratulations.

820
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,039
- Is Jane in?
- She's in a meeting.

821
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:05,415
How about Fred?

822
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,417
He's in a meeting.

823
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,739
Bennett, hey.

824
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,742
Come on, take a ride with me.

825
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,536
Do I have a choice, Don?

826
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:47,082
Of course you do.
This is just a courtesy call.

827
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:52,712
I know you know about the crime-fraud
exception to attorney-client privilege.

828
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,381
I do, Don. Very well.

829
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:58,009
Then you also know your client
is into some shady stuff...

830
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,845
and it's starting to look like
you could be involved

831
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:04,224
in hiding the true nature
of the transactions.

832
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,978
That's quite a statement, Don.

833
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,317
One word:

834
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,112
Dalton.

835
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,782
Danny Dalton?

836
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,327
Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan
of funds to which it was entitled.

837
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,956
Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan
of the right to the honest services

838
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,292
of their elected and appointed officials.

839
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,961
Seven years.
Does three, maybe two and a half,

840
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,505
- on your recommendation.
- Now, let me guess.

841
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:38,883
This was a solo act, without
the knowledge of Connex or Killen Oil

842
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:42,679
and Mr. Lee Janus or Jimmy Pope.

843
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,597
Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.

844
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:47,475
And he'll have a nice little trust fund
when he gets out.

845
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,811
Not so little, I imagine.

846
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:55,317
Look, Don, we can spend
the next five years in court

847
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,737
to get back to the very place
that we're at right now.

848
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,032
And they will fight tough.

849
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,658
They'll fight dirty.

850
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,160
They'll pressure your boss,

851
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,245
the people who appointed your boss,

852
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,748
the wives of the people
who appointed your boss.

853
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:13,501
And you will never hit them any harder
than this, and you know it.

854
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:19,132
I'm sorry, Bennett.

855
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:22,052
I don't think Dalton's enough.

856
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,864
What are you looking at, man?

857
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:47,035
- I didn't say anything.
- That's because you have nothing to say.

858
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,592
You fucking asshole.

859
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,429
There we go.

860
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,140
Okay, pal.

861
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,435
Come on. Yeah, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

862
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:37,479
- Hey, Fred!
- You've been such a good boy.

863
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:38,897
Fred.

864
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,191
Hey, Bob.

865
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,861
There you go, pal.
I tell you what, Katie, take that in.

866
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,821
Hey, Jack. Your sister.

867
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:48,823
You first.

868
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,122
Take the kids inside.
I'll be right in, okay?

869
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,792
What's going on, Fred?

870
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,046
It's okay. Be in in a sec.

871
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,885
FBI's got it, Bob. That's pretty clear.

872
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,930
Nothing I can do, you know it.
It's a criminal investigation.

873
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,682
- Two men were killed.
- I was almost killed.

874
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:19,354
Now they're asking me questions
about the Amiri brothers, about Tehran.

875
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,691
Understand, this wrecks careers.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

876
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:27,695
I punched in "Prince Nasir Al-Subaai",
and my computer gets seized.

877
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,698
Where'd that job come from?
Where did the Nasir job come from?

878
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,825
I'm advising you to drop it.

879
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,619
Why am I being investigated?

880
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,289
Why am I being investigated, Fred?

881
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,086
Goodbye, Bob.

882
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,467
It's okay. Hey, hey.

883
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,806
<i>They're worried.</i>

884
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,059
<i>About fallout. They're worried...</i>

885
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,187
you might wanna talk about it.

886
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:17,109
But if you're already
under investigation...

887
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:22,323
What about Mussawi?

888
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,992
He's a soldier.

889
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,497
He's just like you.

890
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:39,215
Why are they doing a damage assessment
on the Amiris — and on me — for doing my job?

891
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:44,428
This is about our interests in the region.

892
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:52,019
So if Prince Nasir won't allow
our military bases in his country,

893
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,939
and his little brother will...

894
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,694
well, we'll probably have to
do something about that.

895
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:04,407
Who's worried about the Nasir job?

896
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,161
Who's worried about me talking?

897
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:13,875
Stan.

898
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:19,547
Who's worried?

899
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,062
Hello?

900
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,398
<i>Hello, is this Mr. Whitting?</i>

901
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:40,234
<i>This is Homeseal Security.</i>

902
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,446
Yes, this is Mr. Whiting.

903
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:48,200
<i>Hi, we're showing a motion-sensor failure
in your downstairs study.</i>

904
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:49,577
Yes?

905
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:52,246
<i>Like I said, we're getting
a failure message.</i>

906
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,458
<i>Want me to stay on the phone
while you walk around, or send a car?</i>

907
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,096
I'll walk around.

908
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,826
Everything seems fine.

909
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,919
<i>How are we doing, Mr. Whiting?</i>

910
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,046
Everything's fine.

911
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,813
- The door's unlocked.
<i>- Did you leave it unlocked?</i>

912
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,983
Send a car, you imbecile.

913
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,853
You were in Beirut in '84.

914
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:43,858
I lost friends there,

915
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,694
as I'm sure you did.

916
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:53,034
I got a peek at your file.
You're a good man.

917
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:57,997
One whose experience
is narrow and deep.

918
01:37:58,164 --> 01:38:00,249
Your entire career...

919
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:02,293
you've been used.

920
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:06,922
And probably never even known
what for.

921
01:38:07,089 --> 01:38:09,884
I didn't use to need to know.

922
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,722
In this town, you're innocent
until you're investigated.

923
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:21,103
Innocent until investigated? That's nice.
It's got a nice ring to it.

924
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,108
I bet you've worn some miles
on little sayings like that.

925
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:27,985
Thank you.

926
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:30,071
- Thank you.
- No.

927
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:34,784
Gives the listener the sense of the law
being written as it's spoken.

928
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:43,334
If anything happens to me or my family —

929
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,587
an accident, an accusation, anything —

930
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:50,257
then, first, your son will disappear.

931
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:53,427
His body will never be found.
Then your wife.

932
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,890
Her body will never be found either.
Now, this is guaranteed.

933
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,060
Then whatever is the most
dangerous thing that you do —

934
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,354
it might be flying in a small plane,

935
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:05,940
might be walking to the bank.

936
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,942
You'll be killed.

937
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,113
Do you understand what I'm saying?

938
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:16,158
I want you to acknowledge
that you do understand,

939
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:19,829
so that we're clear
and there won't be any mistakes.

940
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:24,959
Beirut rules, Mr. Barnes?

941
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:32,842
I want my passports back.

942
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,397
Dalton's not enough.

943
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,692
I would be real careful.

944
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:59,196
You dig a 6-foot hole,
you'll find three bodies.

945
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,991
But you dig 12, and maybe you'll find 40.

946
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,454
China's economy ain't growing
as fast as it could

947
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:09,873
because they can't get
all the oil they need.

948
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,459
Now, I'm damn proud of that fact.

949
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,672
We need another body, Mr. Pope.

950
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,971
What if--?

951
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:27,641
What if it involved somebody
at your firm?

952
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,186
Someone way the hell above you.

953
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:38,110
We'd have to have an understanding.

954
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:47,161
Well...

955
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:50,748
if...

956
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:53,917
If he's as big as you say,

957
01:42:54,084 --> 01:42:58,130
then when he goes down,
the merger will be approved.

958
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,216
Just like that?

959
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:08,349
We're looking for the illusion
of due diligence, Mr. Pope.

960
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:11,769
Two criminal acts
successfully prosecuted,

961
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:14,063
it gives us that illusion.

962
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,364
Call me Jimmy.

963
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:20,003
He's a visionary. He's like Faisal or Atatürk.
The people love him. And he's--

964
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,256
The country's gonna be his
by Monday.

965
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:26,301
It's not like you guys have backed
the wrong horse here.

966
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:42,443
No, no. No, look,
he's got nine of 11 generals.

967
01:44:42,901 --> 01:44:46,530
We're on our way to the palace right now.
This is really happening.

968
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:53,454
Silver Range Rover.

969
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,080
<i>With a sunroof.</i>

970
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:58,500
Silver Range Rover, sunroof,
fourth from lead.

971
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,296
- Guys, help me out here.
- It's coming now.

972
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:29,990
His wife will be there. Pat.

973
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,662
This is good.

974
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:38,499
You done good.

975
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:47,174
Lee, you have guests.

976
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:52,804
- Syd.
- Leland.

977
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,057
- Bennett Holiday.
- How are you, sir?

978
01:45:55,224 --> 01:45:57,434
- Lee Janus. How are we doing?
- Well.

979
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:01,772
Those number crunchers can get
a little overzealous, can't they?

980
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:09,446
Christ, when we write the GAAP rules
like some sort of abstract painting...

981
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:12,824
you stare at that liability
hard enough...

982
01:46:12,991 --> 01:46:15,994
and before long, it'll turn into an asset.

983
01:46:16,161 --> 01:46:17,621
No, thank you.

984
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:23,168
- You don't drink?
- No.

985
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:32,553
It is really beautiful out here.

986
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,607
- What is that?
- What?

987
01:46:45,774 --> 01:46:47,442
In front of them.

988
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,810
The Bedouin always have right of way.

989
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,772
Lawyers say, "If you can't trust
a Big Five accounting firm..."

990
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:27,858
The accountants say,
"We're not lawyers."

991
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,777
Legal didn't understand.
Accounting didn't understand.

992
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,364
Nobody understood anything.
Regulatory bodies scratched their heads...

993
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:36,742
that nobody at Connex or Killen
was at fault.

994
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:40,120
But this merger is so balance-positive
for American consumers

995
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,164
that, ultimately, Justice wants it.

996
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,751
Federal courts want it.
Everybody wants it.

997
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:49,963
Our real client, after all,
is us, the American people.

998
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:54,801
And we are increasing American access
to oil in Kazakhstan.

999
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:58,472
So all they ask is that we give them
a little something meaningful,

1000
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,182
which we did.

1001
01:48:00,349 --> 01:48:02,517
And they got out of our way.

1002
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:06,021
Something besides Dalton?

1003
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,357
Unfortunately, yes.

1004
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:11,485
And the best option seemed to be...

1005
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:15,322
a secret deal for excess
Iranian pipeline capacity

1006
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,908
that I uncovered during the diligence.

1007
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:20,327
A little side deal benefiting
the lead lawyer

1008
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:23,163
involved in the Connex-Killen
merger approval process.

1009
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:24,748
What...

1010
01:48:24,915 --> 01:48:26,416
do you think you're doing?

1011
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:29,378
It's illegal for an American
to control these rights.

1012
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,463
Stop right now.

1013
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:36,009
Is there...

1014
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,263
something that
you wanna tell me, Syd?

1015
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:03,620
Good afternoon.

1016
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,373
I wanna thank our host
for a wonderful spread.

1017
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,959
The strawberry juice is delicious.

1018
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:15,048
Let me just say,
on behalf of Connex-Killen,

1019
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:18,427
how pleased we are
