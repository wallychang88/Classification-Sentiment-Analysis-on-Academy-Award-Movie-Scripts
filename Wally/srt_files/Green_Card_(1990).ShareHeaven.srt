1
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,765
- How much?
- $1.50.

2
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,754
Miss? Miss, your change.

3
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,836
<i>If you wish to find
the express train...</i>

4
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,029
<i>try the B.M.T.</i>

5
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,387
Spare a little change?

6
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,104
Anybody, spare a little change?
Lady?

7
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,158
A little change?
I need some lunch.

8
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,293
- Watch where you're going there, man.
- Anybody?

9
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,886
<i>... corrupt society</i>

10
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:06,054
<i>I know the time will be here again</i>

11
00:02:06,222 --> 00:02:11,460
<i>When the taxes are taken
You know it will lead to the end</i>

12
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,204
- Look at you.
- Hi, Anton. Oh.

13
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,986
- I've never seen you
all dressed up like this.
- Well, do I look the part?

14
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,005
Sure. Look at me.

15
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,781
Oh.

16
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,711
- Coffee?
- Oh. No. Yes! Oh, I'm so nervous.

17
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,987
- Well, you're supposed to be nervous
on your wedding day.
- Oh, right, right.

18
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:47,853
- You really look absolutely gorgeous.
- Oh, thanks. I borrowed the dress.

19
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,732
- It's a marvelous thing
you're doing, Brontë. Really.
- Oh, Anton, please, no speeches.

20
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:54,190
- I think you and Georges will...
- No speeches.
- Okay, no speeches.

21
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:55,915
Hey, hey, Georges!

22
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:06,894
Coming?

23
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,326
More! More!

24
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,580
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

25
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,090
- You were very good.
- So were you.

26
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,566
Oh, here's Anton.

27
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,523
That's a copy for you, Brontë.

28
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,928
- I'll never forget Afrika.
- Africa?

29
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,101
Yes, where we met.

30
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,954
Oh, the coffee shop. Right.

31
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,540
Okay, so, uh, good luck with your life.

32
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,597
Et merci, Anton.

33
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,398
- And good luck with your composing.
- With what?

34
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,568
Your music.

35
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:05,516
Oh, yes. Uh, right. Yes. Okay.

36
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,755
- So what happens next?
- That's it.

37
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,439
You don't even have to see him again.

38
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,972
- You should take a look at that.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

39
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,265
That could potentially be a problem.

40
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,951
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

41
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,806
Africa?

42
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,349
Yes. That's where we met.

43
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:44,366
And he's there now again.

44
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,047
Uh, I wish he were here...

45
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,254
but he's not.

46
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,758
He'd love the apartment, though.

47
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,340
He travels a great deal.

48
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,024
But he's the quiet type.
We both are, really.

49
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:00,132
What's he doing there?

50
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,605
He's a composer.

51
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,897
- African music.
- Not drums?

52
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,379
We couldn't have someone
who played the drums here.

53
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:13,675
Oh, no. No. He studies their music.
He's an academic.

54
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,574
- He, himself, is not African?
- He's French.

55
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,385
- Oh, oh, oh, French. Oh.
- Oh.

56
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,683
What is this? "Green Guerillas."

57
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,667
Not some sort of an army, is it?

58
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:28,903
It's a volunteer garden group,
Mrs. Bird.

59
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,894
They do very good work
amongst the poor.

60
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:34,404
And you'll notice that Mrs. Fauré
is also with our city parks department.

61
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,225
Uh, we did have problems
with a recent tenant...

62
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:41,548
a single gentleman, uh, who, uh,
neglected the responsibilities...

63
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,393
associated with 12-F.

64
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,021
Mmm, that's why the board feels...

65
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,158
that a young married couple
would be more suitable.

66
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:53,352
Well, I think it's the fact that
Mrs. Fauré is a horticulturist
that's very much in her favor.

67
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:59,334
- Yes, but it is highly irregular to give
our approval without meeting Mr. Fauré.
- I like the couple from the bank.

68
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:03,081
- Not the one with the dog.
- Look, I'm very aware of the situation.

69
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,156
It's just that...

70
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:09,156
well, I could bring the garden back
to the way the late professor had it.

71
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:12,840
I don't want to get too technical, but
the moracus syconia needs thinning...

72
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:17,350
and the crinums and the zamias
are sadly neglected.

73
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:20,650
The chamaedorea's root bound,
and special care must be taken...

74
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,051
for the poor cyathaceae dicksonia.

75
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,149
Not to mention the cordyline
or the heliconia.

76
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,359
And there's work
nurturing the aspidistra...

77
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,593
begonias, the bromeliads.

78
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,473
Oh!

79
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,890
Yo, baby!

80
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,268
Yo, Brontë!

81
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,667
The city fathers give
their blessing to the project.

82
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,989
- All right!
- Yeah. Talk about the 11th hour, huh?

83
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,354
- I've got some good news.
- Oh, what's that?

84
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,171
How about 3,000 square feet
of quality topsoil?

85
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:54,123
- You're kidding!
- No. Get this.

86
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,166
Burger King does this... this big
press hype over at the Sheraton Center.

87
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,302
- Uh-huh.
- They recreate Texas or something.
- Hey.

88
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,357
A giant burger city
in the middle of Texas.

89
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,723
Anyway, they don't know
what they're gonna do with the soil
when they're all through.

90
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,156
Dave says, "I know just the guy
who'll take it off your hands." Me.

91
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,391
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Harry, how you doin', man?

92
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,316
Look at this.
We're officially approved.

93
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,530
Hey, let's go!

94
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,204
All right!

95
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,278
Burger King!

96
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:31,433
- Burger King!
- Let's hear it for Phil!

97
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:35,690
Who can use a box of periwinkles?
Here you go. Tomatoes.

98
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,195
All right, yea!

99
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:02,085
Italian would be great,
but ask Brontë and Phil.

100
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,346
- Yeah, 'cause I'm starved.
- I am too.

101
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,371
- Hey, Brontë, are you hungry? Wanna
get something to eat? How about you?
- Yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

102
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,706
- Yeah.
- The four of us get something to eat?
- Ten minutes? Let's go.

103
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,300
- The All Nations okay?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:18,350
- Hey. Ah.
- Mmm.

105
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,261
- A little pasta.
- Like maybe we could think of certain
plants that we could put in there.

106
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,278
- Yeah.
- Can we order?
- I'm not your waiter.

107
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:26,788
- Great. So who is our waiter?
- Yeah.
- Well, we'll leave it up to you.

108
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,862
<i>- Hey, man, are you our waiter?
- No, sir. Georges, les cartes.</i>

109
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,028
- Do you want an antipasto?
- Let's get out of here. It's awful.

110
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:37,060
I don't think we'll find anyplace else
open this time of night.

111
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:40,133
Look at this. Look at this time.
We have been sitting here a long time.

112
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:53,295
- You have chosen?
- Uh...
- Somebody else go ahead.

113
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,659
Uh, what are your specials tonight?

114
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,500
Uh, from Switzerland we have, um,
calves' liver with our special sauce...

115
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:02,762
and, uh, from old England,
we have roast beef.

116
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,716
- I don't eat meat.
- Why not?

117
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,524
Pardon me?

118
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,793
If you don't eat meat,
we have, uh, fish.

119
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:12,747
No, I don't eat fish either.
I'm a vegetarian.

120
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,918
- Ah.
- Do you have a vegetarian special?

121
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,844
Of course.
All Nations vegetables.

122
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,355
- Good. I'll have that,
but no oil or salt.
- No salt for you. Okay.

123
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,145
- Uh, I think I'll take the fish.
- Me too.

124
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:26,180
Fish. Two for the fish. Okay.

125
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,555
And, uh...

126
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,109
for mademoiselle?

127
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,926
Or is it madame?

128
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,501
It's, uh, just here on the right.

129
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,518
Just right here.

130
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,404
- Let me come up?
- Mmm, no.

131
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,550
What is it? A girls' dorm?

132
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,858
I've never even seen your apartment.
What's with all the secrecy?

133
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,544
- What secrecy?
- Well, most girls I've known...

134
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:58,053
- have tried to crowd me, except you.
- Mm.

135
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,133
I could do with
a little crowding from you.

136
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,693
You coming or what?

137
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,687
- Okay.
- Okay.

138
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,723
Evening, Mrs. Fauré.

139
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,440
- Hello, Oscar.
- There's some mail here...

140
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,549
mostly addressed to Miss Parrish.

141
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,370
I guess some folks
don't know you're married.

142
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,957
- I still go by the name Parrish.
- Women's lib, huh?

143
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,804
- Yes, I guess so.
- Nothing from Africa.

144
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,423
- Oh.
- I already checked.

145
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:44,552
- I guess he's still on safari, huh?
- Something like that.

146
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,753
- Good night, Mrs. Fauré.
- Good night, Oscar.

147
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,597
<i>- Hello?
- Mrs. Fauré?</i>

148
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:36,524
<i>- Yes?
- My name is Gorsky.</i>

149
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,207
<i>I'm with the investigations
department of the I.N.S.</i>

150
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,960
<i>- The what?
- Immigration.</i>

151
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,884
<i>My partner and I
are down in the lobby.</i>

152
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,560
<i>We wondered if we might have a word
with you, uh, and, uh, your husband.</i>

153
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,071
Oh.

154
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,709
- What is it you want to know?
- I just want to speak
with Georges Fauré.

155
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,333
- He doesn't work here anymore.
- What?

156
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,773
He was rude to a customer.
We don't stand for that.

157
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,204
- Excuse me.
- No, please. I must find him.

158
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:11,369
- Do you know where he lives?
- Georges Fauré is trouble.

159
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,219
You would do best to avoid him.

160
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:18,575
Now, if you'll excuse me, young lady.
I have customers waiting.

161
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,210
You're a friend of Georges?

162
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,633
Yo. Yo! Where are you going?

163
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,709
- I'm to see Mrs. Fauré.
- Oh?

164
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,749
- And who are you?
- Mr. Fauré.

165
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,294
- Mr. Fauré?
- Yes.

166
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,975
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've never seen you before.

167
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:02,250
- Welcome back. How was Africa?
- Africa?

168
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,001
- Yeah. You got any bags?
- No, no. No, just me. Just me.

169
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,023
You know, when I first seen you,
I thought to myself...

170
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:09,038
"This guy just stepped
out of the jungle."

171
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,753
And I was right!
Oh, it's great to see you back.

172
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,953
I hate to see a young couple
like yourselves, you know,
separated like you've been.

173
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,967
- It's bad for the marriage.
Call me old-fashioned if you want.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

174
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:19,884
Oh, but that's what's wrong
with this country, you know?

175
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,935
- The family is going down the toilet.
- The toilet? What...

176
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,813
- The toilet. Yeah. Fifteen years
I'm married to the same woman.
- What, uh...

177
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,831
- See? See my kids there? Huh?
- Oh, yes. Yeah.

178
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:29,861
I call her twice a day.
I don't go for that women's lib stuff.

179
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:32,551
- No, sir. Couples living in sin,
that sort of thing.
- Oh, no.

180
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,989
- Oh, that's no good, no good at all.
- Oh, it's terrible, yeah.

181
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,345
So...

182
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,421
Well, come in.

183
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:12,846
Right. Now, these people
are due here any minute, so, um...

184
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,559
Look, I think we'd better talk
about the situation, don't you?

185
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,844
You got my note? Of course you did,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

186
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,886
Uh, I spoke to my lawyer.

187
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,732
He said not to panic.
It's probably just routine.

188
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,472
- Have you got some coffee?
- Coffee?

189
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,428
Yeah.

190
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,926
Right! Good idea.

191
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:39,246
We'll just have coffee
like any normal married couple.

192
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:44,682
How's the composing? Didn't you
get the big job in California?

193
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,605
No. I don't like them, you know?

194
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:52,042
I prefer to be a waiter
than work for people like that.

195
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,760
But you're not at
the restaurant anymore.

196
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,422
No, I quit.

197
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,846
They said you were fired.

198
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:04,586
Really? Funny.

199
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,956
I hate that captain, you know?

200
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,022
He's really a snob type. Ah.

201
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:16,716
These people are due here any minute,
and you stroll around my apartment
touching my things!

202
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,458
Do you realize the situation
that you've put me in? Do you?

203
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:22,479
I'm sorry, Betty.

204
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,389
It's Brontë.

205
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,967
Oh.

206
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,332
This is hopeless.

207
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:36,458
- The coffee?
- The coffee?

208
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:40,301
- Yes.
- I'm about to go to jail, you're gonna
be deported. But what about the coffee?

209
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,589
Oh, my God, they're here.

210
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:46,824
- Wait. Wait! I'll get it.
- Yeah?

211
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,000
<i>- Uh, may I speak with Mr. Fauré, please?
- Yeah, this is Mr. Fauré.</i>

212
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,988
<i>- This is Immigration.
- Ah, okay. Come on.</i>

213
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,991
What...

214
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:58,764
- What are you doing?
- Better put them in my closet.

215
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,009
Oh.

216
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:09,805
Oh, God!

217
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,556
Ring. Ring.

218
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:34,670
- Oh, we have to talk, for God's sake.
- Talk about what?

219
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,806
Our story. How we met.
They're gonna ask us questions.

220
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,042
No, they just want to see us together,
that's all.

221
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,801
This happened to a guy
at the restaurant.

222
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,301
They see us, they go. Simple.

223
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:47,563
Can you get it, chérie?
Let me do the talking.

224
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,607
No, I'll do the talking.
You don't speak much English.
I'll just tell them... I'll just tell...

225
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:54,281
No! Now, relax. We're together.

226
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,870
Okay? Don't panic.

227
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,591
Now go.

228
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,840
Hello.

229
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,431
Oh, isn't this quaint?

230
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,487
Thank you.

231
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,437
Come on up.

232
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:29,797
Georges?

233
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:36,108
This is Mrs. Sheehan and Mr. Gorsky.

234
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,221
- Hi.
- Hello.

235
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,652
- Hi.
- Hi. Please sit down.

236
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,966
- Mr. Fauré?
- Georges, please.

237
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,103
Yes. Now, you entered the country...

238
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,444
five months ago
according to our records.

239
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,648
Yes, and already I love it. You see?

240
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:19,401
- Yes, well...
- Land of opportunity.

241
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:22,635
- Such a great country.
A-A-Already I feel at home.
- Yes.

242
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:25,004
- Ah.
- So lucky.

243
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,925
Beautiful wife.

244
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,713
- Apartment.
- Yeah.

245
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,799
- Plants.
- Oh.

246
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,052
- So lucky. You see?
- Uh, well, um, your visa... a B-2...

247
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:37,582
a tourist visa...
allowed you only six weeks.

248
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,948
Now, that in itself is an offense...

249
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,349
but more recent events
have overtaken that.

250
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:45,676
Your marriage, of course,
gives you automatic residency status.

251
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,801
- Now, this is your place of residence?
- Of course.
- Yes.

252
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:53,481
- You moved here after the marriage?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,753
We spoke to the chairperson
of the building...

254
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,822
and he said you'd been away,
Mr. Fauré.

255
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:01,413
- In Africa.
- Yes.

256
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:03,592
- Shooting elephants.
- Oh.

257
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,346
- With a camera.
- Ah, a camera.
- Oh!
- Of course.

258
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:10,309
And he brought me back some plants.
Some violets. African violets.

259
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,837
- The violets.
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,717
And, uh, where did you live,
Mr. Fauré, before the marriage?

261
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,677
Oh, all over the place, you see, um...

262
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,085
In the park, one night.

263
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:27,435
- And, uh, where do you work?
- Pardon?

264
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,430
My husband's a composer. He's working
on an important composition right now...

265
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:33,803
based on his African research.

266
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:37,798
A composer?
We don't, uh, have a note of that.

267
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:39,757
And, uh, you write, what?

268
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,441
Uh, rock 'n' roll?

269
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:45,805
Ballet. I write for the ballet.

270
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,270
Ballet.

271
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,361
Your statement
on your passport application
said you had no criminal convictions.

272
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,212
Is that a true and correct statement?

273
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,034
Of course.

274
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,207
You speak French, Mrs. Fauré?

275
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:02,508
Not really. Not exactly.

276
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:05,257
No barrier to love, though, hmm?

277
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,793
Well, that about does it.

278
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,485
We're sorry to have troubled you.

279
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,852
There's been a major clampdown
on illegal aliens...

280
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:20,359
marrying for residency status
and a green card.

281
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,757
It's come down from the top.
The White House.

282
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:28,267
Well, you don't want
to get the wrong type.

283
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:32,141
- Precisely.
- We understand.

284
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:35,620
As a matter of curiosity,
how did you two meet?

285
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,127
I'm sure it was very romantic.

286
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:43,751
- We... You go ahead.
- Well, uh... No, you, please.

287
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:47,150
- We just...
- Please, you... We sort of crashed
into each other. Boom!

288
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:49,035
- Like that.
- Goodness.

289
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,234
- Yes, I was, uh, carrying
a lot of parcels, and...
- Parcels?

290
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,506
- Yes, parcels.
And then l-I picked them up, and...
- A-A-And... And Anton...

291
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,560
- Don't forget about Anton.
- Ah, Anton, yes.

292
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,590
- He was with Georges, and I knew him.
- Anton, yes. Yes, he also helped
pick up the parcels.

293
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Yes, but the point is, darling,
is that he introduced us.

294
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:06,638
Oh, that's right. He did.
He did, yes. Anton.

295
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:10,445
- And?
- Well...
- So, and...

296
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:13,739
- Ah, it was raining. And, uh...
- Oh, yes! We got soaked.

297
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:16,206
I took one of her parcels
when I pick up mine.

298
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:18,725
- Oh, you had parcels too?
- Ah.

299
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,711
Uh, everyone had parcels.
So many parcels.

300
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:25,200
So, uh, l-l-l...
I picked up one of hers.

301
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:28,907
- By mistake.
- Yes, so I had, uh, my parcels...

302
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:31,112
and, uh, her parcel...

303
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,353
and I was, uhh...

304
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,716
staggering around, like this.

305
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,967
And, uh...

306
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,512
Uh... Uh...

307
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:52,202
- Somebody better get the telephone.
- It couldn't be for me.

308
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,597
Well, it could be, dear,
but don't worry. I'll get it.

309
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,852
We don't want to have a husband-and-wife
fight in front of our guests.

310
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,753
Hello? Phil!

311
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,473
You're still upstate, aren't you?

312
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,317
- No, I'm not glad you're still there.
- Do go on, Mr. Fauré.

313
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:12,585
- Phil, I can't talk right now.
- Hmm?

314
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:15,436
The parcels? You were up to
where you had her parcels.

315
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:18,951
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Oh! I'm excited.

316
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,284
- So I found this extra parcel.
- Can I call you back?

317
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,286
I knew I had 9, and now 10.
I say, "What was going on?"

318
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,399
I say to myself.

319
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:32,325
And l-I open it, and it was, um,
uh, ladies' underwears.

320
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,188
Ladies' underwear.

321
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:40,045
- Look, um... Mm-hmm.
- So, I called Anton...

322
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:43,405
and he said, uh,
"It must belong to Betty."

323
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:46,320
You mean Brontë.

324
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:51,436
Yes. Brontë.

325
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:53,641
But I didn't know her name...

326
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:57,191
and, uh, so, now I did.

327
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,400
- So, um... Yeah.
- That's it.

328
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,798
- May I use your bathroom?
- Hmm?

329
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,441
- The bathroom?
- What for?

330
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,608
Uh, well, I need to use it.

331
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,388
- Uh, bathroom.
- Oh!

332
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:16,301
- No, please, go ahead.
- Where is it?

333
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:19,181
- What?
- Uh, the lavatory.

334
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,199
Could you show me where it is?

335
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,598
- Oh, yes. Please follow me.
- Why am I whispering?

336
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,403
Oh, that's great! Just great.

337
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:51,023
Oh! No, that used to be the bathroom...

338
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:53,039
before the renovations.

339
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,721
I keep forgetting.

340
00:26:55,857 --> 00:27:00,199
Voilá. This was the broom closet, but
we made it into the bedroom. You see?

341
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,270
And this door is the bathroom.

342
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:05,296
Voilá.

343
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,758
Let him move into my apartment?
I can't believe you're saying this.

344
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:17,100
Well, don't look so shocked.
Frankly, young lady...

345
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,567
I think you have
your priorities all wrong, you kno...

346
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,216
You married a man you didn't know
in order to get a greenhouse.

347
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,272
That shocked me.

348
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,320
All right, so I'm old-fashioned
when it comes to marriage.

349
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:29,034
I happen to think that falling in love
has something to do with it.

350
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:31,535
You don't? Fine.

351
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:34,828
But if marrying a stranger doesn't
shock you, then letting him move in...

352
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,716
and spend a couple of nights
sleeping on the sofa...

353
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,947
- Well, that shouldn't shock you either.
- Oh, this isn't happening.

354
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:41,968
They want a second interview on Monday.
This is Friday.

355
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,649
- That gives you the weekend
to get your stories straight.
- Two days?

356
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:47,850
Well, I don't see why he has to move in.
Why can't he just meet me
here in the park or something?

357
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,926
Because this interview's
going to be in-depth.

358
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:51,918
They're gonna question you separately.

359
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,447
They're gonna want to know the color
of each other's toothbrush.

360
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,643
Uh, what does he like to eat?
I don't know. Does he snore?

361
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:00,045
You're gonna have to, uh,
study each other's habits.

362
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,479
- It's like you're cramming for an exam.
- Oh, God!

363
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,648
- Do I have no alternative?
- Sure.

364
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,468
You can confess everything now,
he'll be deported...

365
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,502
you could face charges,
and no more greenhouse.

366
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:13,161
- It's like living in a police state.
- No, no.

367
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,216
It's called breaking the law.

368
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:18,126
Now, no matter how trivial
it may have seemed to you at the time...

369
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,176
that's what you've done.

370
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:24,014
Anyway, I think you should,
uh, introduce Georges
to some of your friends.

371
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,405
- My friends?
- Let him get to know them. Say he's
visiting from Paris or something.

372
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,448
No, I couldn't bear that.
He's such a slob.

373
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,674
- I'll do it without anybody knowing.
- Well, that's up to you.

374
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:37,191
But listen, get that story straight.

375
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:39,849
Oh, by Monday evening
this'll all be over...

376
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,122
and we can start planning the divorce.

377
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,077
I can't wait.

378
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,325
For your pond.

379
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,976
Oh. Right. Thank you.

380
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:22,634
Wait and I'll show you around.
Not that there's that much to see.

381
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,710
You do know where the bathroom is.

382
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:42,256
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Come on.

383
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,555
Shoo. Shoo.

384
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:06,405
Do you mind not smoking inside?

385
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,334
- What's this?
- It's coffee.
- No.

386
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:23,793
Yes, it is. It's decaf.

387
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,953
- Don't you have any real coffee?
- I'm afraid not.

388
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,862
I'll make you the best coffee
you ever had.

389
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,367
I only drink decaf.

390
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,016
You'll change when you taste this.

391
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,574
Look, I don't want anyone
to know about this, okay?

392
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,331
So we have to make up a story
in case we run into any of my friends.

393
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:42,919
Something simple.
You're an old friend.

394
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,292
I admire your ballet music.

395
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,367
You're visiting from Paris.

396
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:50,254
You're staying with me
for a couple of nights.

397
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,937
- You're gay.
- Gay? I don't want to be gay.

398
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,080
Okay, you're not gay.
You're just an old friend...

399
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,190
and the hotels are all booked up,
so here you are.

400
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,728
Oh. Not a very good story.

401
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,574
Well, you come up
with a better one then.

402
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,225
Well, I don't know.
Something political?

403
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,658
Terrorist, maybe? Hmm?

404
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:16,015
No, not a terrorist.
But political's good. A refugee.

405
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,243
That's it. That'll work. Yes.

406
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,165
No, we don't say anything.

407
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,532
Just a friend staying
for a couple of nights.

408
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:26,119
- This is New York.
- You're right.

409
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,558
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, you sleep on the couch...

410
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,608
and we split expenses.

411
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:35,472
I'll cook, hmm? Hmm?

412
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:44,421
Oh.

413
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,502
Good.

414
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,989
Mm. It doesn't smell good.
Put it back, please.

415
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:22,634
- For your birds?
- What?
- This is a birdseed, no?

416
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:25,223
- It's muesli.
- Put it back. I'll get some croissants.

417
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,280
But I like birdseed.

418
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,008
- Sure.
- No, okay. No, you...
- No.

419
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,341
- Go ahead. No, please. No, no.
- No, go ahead. Choose, please.

420
00:32:35,473 --> 00:32:37,360
- Come on, honey.
- Coming.

421
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:43,436
B?

422
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:46,863
Brontë? Oh, it is you! Hey!

423
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:49,327
Lauren, what are you doing here?

424
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,068
What am I doing here?
I'm, like, you know, buying food.

425
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:55,241
Well, it's just not
your neighborhood.

426
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,198
Mother's having one of
her little musical soirees.

427
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,688
I told her I'd pick up
a few things for her.
When am I gonna see your new apartment?

428
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:01,896
Hi.

429
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:04,966
Hi.

430
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,800
You're together?

431
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,879
Sort of. This is an old friend.

432
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:14,635
Georges Fauré, this is Lauren Adler.

433
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:18,128
- Hi, Lauren.
- Ooh, that accent! You're French, right?

434
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,762
Ooh. This is so weird. Everything
in my life has been French lately.

435
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:26,639
Monday I buy a jacket. It's French.
Wednesday I go see a French movie.

436
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:30,314
And then, last night, Tony says,
"Let's eat French."

437
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:34,125
It's like CarlJung.
What do you call it?
A coincidence... something.

438
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:37,072
- Coincidence.
- Uh-huh.

439
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,942
So, nice to meet you,
Brontë's French friend.

440
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:42,894
- Uh-huh.
- Well, Lauren...

441
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:46,951
Look, if you want to eat French again,
eh, I'm cooking.

442
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,325
For Brontë. Hmm?

443
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,246
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:56,720
I adore Paris.
I'd go there all the time if I could.

445
00:33:56,881 --> 00:34:00,198
- Oh, yes, yes, I know.
- Oh, thanks.
- Teach me, Daddy. Teach me.

446
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,638
Oh, but the last time
was for six months.

447
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:05,168
- Hi, Mrs...
- Not right now!
- Oh, Mr. Fauré!

448
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,118
Mr. Fauré! Kids, meet Mr. Fauré.

449
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,168
- He's the one that's been in Africa.
- Hi.

450
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,118
Huh? My kids. Huh? Kids.

451
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:13,320
Maybe you two will be thinking
about starting a family soon, huh?

452
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,278
- Shh!
- Oh, shh, shh!
- Georges!

453
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:17,513
- Yes?
- Georges!
- Yes, I'm coming.

454
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:20,431
Hold the elevator!
Wait! Going up!

455
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,591
Hold it! Hold it!

456
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:27,596
Going up! Wait for me!

457
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,224
They should fix those doors.

458
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,782
Somebody'll get killed around here.

459
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:45,680
What did those government people want?

460
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,265
- It's nothing.
- We don't know exactly what they want.

461
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:51,084
- What's this?
- Georges' visa, a minor problem.

462
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:54,697
They said,
does Mr. Fauré do this and that?

463
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:59,143
And about Mrs. Fauré...
Did she go to Africa? And so on.

464
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:01,615
Mrs. Fauré?

465
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,566
Georges' mother.

466
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:06,183
- She died in Africa.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:07,498
- Yes.
- Oh.

468
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:10,089
Killed by the elephants.

469
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:22,310
I could just sit here
and watch you all day, Georges.

470
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:26,093
Some stroke of luck, huh, B,
having a French chef as a guest?

471
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,078
Stop it, Lauren.

472
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:30,413
So what are you doing
in New York, Georges?

473
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:32,912
- I just crashed and...
- Georges is a political...

474
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,528
- You go on.
- No, go on.
- No, you, please.

475
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:37,934
A political what?

476
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:40,682
Political, um, ballet.

477
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,974
I can't imagine
a political ballet.

478
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:48,007
You know, it's sort of a...

479
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:50,730
Georges writes for the ballet.
He's an old friend.

480
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,718
- He's...
- Not gay.
- Of course not.

481
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:55,467
- Good.
- He just couldn't find a hotel.

482
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:58,830
- And he's been in Africa.
- Look, we old friend.

483
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:02,224
- Yeah.
- So I don't fuck her. Hmm?

484
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:12,489
What, did you kill somebody
for this place?

485
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:14,762
You probably cut them up
and used them for mulch.

486
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:16,807
This is amazing!

487
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,312
So is your French friend.
I want details later.

488
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,545
Oh, Lauren, please.

489
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,568
My mother would adore this.

490
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,999
Oh, speaking of my mother,
guess what!

491
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:28,048
She and Daddy are leaving New York.

492
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,927
- No! What about her beautiful gardens?
- They're leaving.

493
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,873
Anyway, I've told Daddy all about
the Green Worms or whatever they are.

494
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,889
- Green Guerillas.
- Yeah, well, anyway...

495
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,912
being this great old liberal,
he says how he'd like to give you
and your group all the plants.

496
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:43,081
No, not those beautiful trees.

497
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:45,071
The trees, the plants, everything.

498
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:48,843
Oh, that's fantastic! Our stocks
are so low. We're desperate for plants.

499
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:51,148
Uh, well, wait a minute.
There's a problem.

500
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:54,183
Mother won't hear of it.
But I don't know.

501
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:57,769
I think if you talked to her,
maybe she'd change her mind.

502
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,082
Georges.

503
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,890
- No.
- Yeah.

504
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,507
Brontë, you didn't eat anything.

505
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:09,609
- It's not my kind of food.
- She likes birdseed.

506
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,566
It's just not healthy,
all that butter.

507
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,631
What's the point of life
if you don't enjoy yourself? Hmm?

508
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:17,290
Do you mind?

509
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:19,432
You're like an old married couple.

510
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,227
Okay.

511
00:37:21,393 --> 00:37:23,303
So how did you two meet?

512
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:27,565
Well, you know, Lauren,
I was, uh, carrying a lot of parcels...

513
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,663
Lauren, it's a long story.
Can I tell you later?

514
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,150
- I've got lots of work I need to do,
cataloging plants.
- I can take a hint.

515
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,039
- No. Oh, finish your wine. It's...
- Oh.

516
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,241
A little bit more. Okay?

517
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,410
- Nice to have met you, Georges.
- Nice to meet you, Lauren.

518
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:44,366
Nice... Eh, I see you again. Huh?

519
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:49,646
- He's gorgeous.
- Lauren, look, I...

520
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,712
I can say this now.
I did not like Phil.

521
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:55,053
Oh, so earnest, my God!

522
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,737
Phil and I are still
very much together.

523
00:37:57,873 --> 00:37:59,881
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

524
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:03,759
I mean, I like Phil. He's very concerned
about the environment and all that.

525
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:07,402
- Yes, he is.
- Oh, typical me, putting my foot in it.

526
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:09,295
- Forget it.
- Well, in that case...

527
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,173
I wouldn't mind
seeing Georges again myself.

528
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:15,119
He's dishy.
Gardeners are so weird.

529
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,703
- Bye, Lauren.
- Ciao.

530
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,523
Why did you ask her
to stay for lunch?

531
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,407
This is my apartment.
This is not gonna work.

532
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,090
No, it won't work if I don't know
everything about you.

533
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,712
That silly story about the parcels!

534
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,907
Your mother, the elephants, lying
to my friends. It's all so horrible.

535
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:40,390
And I know you've got a cigarette,
so you can smoke it outside!

536
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,532
You begin the lie when you married.
I didn't make you lie.

537
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:51,527
- Well, I didn't ask her to lunch.
- You always blame me. You did it too.

538
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:53,454
- Did what?
- Married me!

539
00:38:53,618 --> 00:38:56,007
I did it for the green card.
Why did you do it?

540
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:58,349
- No one made you! No one!
- Outside! Outside!

541
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,644
If you push me to be a beast,
I can be a beast, so take care!

542
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,304
Now look what you've done,
you silly French oaf!

543
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:36,614
Oh.

544
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:55,022
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. I just wanted
to thank you for lunch.</i>

545
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,040
<i>And that greenhouse!
I'm so jealous!</i>

546
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:59,886
Oh, Lauren, I'm so sorry
about lying to you.

547
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,952
<i>- Lying to me?
What are you talking about?
- I mean, not telling you...</i>

548
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,194
y-y-you know,
not having you over here before.

549
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,177
<i>- You're my oldest friend.
- Oh, please, forget it, B.</i>

550
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:12,494
Oh, I haven't been myself lately.
You're right about that.

551
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,599
Things are complicated right now.

552
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:16,877
You know, Mother's having
this dinner party tonight.

553
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,912
Well, I just spoke to her,
and she's invited you.

554
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:22,252
<i>Great chance for you
to work on her about the trees.</i>

555
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,711
You could bring Georges.

556
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,576
What are you doing in here?

557
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:48,561
I went and, uh, I bought
some beautiful tomatoes for you.

558
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,337
Look, that's sweet, but...

559
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:55,247
And outside... Come on.
Come outside.

560
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:59,151
- And look here. We have radishes,
peppers, carrots.
- Oh, no, my plants!

561
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:02,510
- Just weeds. I pull... I pulled them out.
- No, this is my research!

562
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:05,675
- Oh, I'm sorry. I bought this for you.
- Just don't touch anything, okay?

563
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:09,355
- Okay, okay.
- And don't go in the greenhouse
anymore. That's all I ask.

564
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:13,296
It's my special place. Oh.

565
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,360
- You like your plants
better than people.
- Some people.

566
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,503
Oh, God.

567
00:41:57,874 --> 00:41:59,946
Look. Truce, okay?

568
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,686
I don't make the war.

569
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:09,481
You asked me before why I did it...
the marriage.

570
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,952
- Well, it was for the greenhouse.
- Greenhouse?

571
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:14,318
I don't expect you to understand,
but that's why I did it.

572
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,685
Oh, I understand.

573
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:19,949
You want something, you take it. Hmm?

574
00:42:23,538 --> 00:42:27,018
We work tonight?
Study, just like school?

575
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:29,357
- I have to go out.
- Then I'll come too.

576
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:31,082
- No.
- Why?

577
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,454
- Ah, your boyfriend, the vegetarian.
- No, he's away.

578
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:37,448
- So!
- No, it's Lauren's parents' place.

579
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:41,295
- Snob types, you'd call them.
- Oh. I will embarrass you, huh?

580
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,432
- No.
- Yes, too much oaf!
- No.

581
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,595
S... The Adlers are thinking about giving
some trees to a gardening group I'm in.

582
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:50,445
- What's that?
- Oh, it's... it's just a gardening group.

583
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:54,222
We go into poor areas,
like the Lower East Side, and...

584
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:56,208
I came from that life.
You waste your time.

585
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:59,240
- What?
- Yeah. Nothing will change down there.

586
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,198
It will always be that way.

587
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:03,249
- Better to forget about it.
- Forget about it?

588
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,672
Yeah. Look, the trees are very good.
Yes, sure, sure.

589
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:09,998
- But you can't eat the trees.
- Well, nothing changes without hope.

590
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,847
- Oh, you think the gardens make hope?
- Well, it's something.

591
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,206
The trees are very good, yes, but go
to the country if you want trees. Huh?

592
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,639
You try telling that to the children.

593
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:22,631
They live with chaos, despair.

594
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:24,689
You may think it's nothing
to give them a garden to plant...

595
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,468
or trees to climb,
but at least it's doing something.

596
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:32,236
- If it amuses you, then do it.
- Amuses me?

597
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:48,081
Chaos.

598
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,763
Despair.

599
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:10,347
<i>- I'll take the mud slide.
- Mud slide it is. Okay.</i>

600
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,450
<i>- Yeah!
- Oh, Richard!</i>

601
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,473
<i>Now, little fish, swim!</i>

602
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:30,538
- Better down.
- What?

603
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:32,529
Y-Your hair looks better down.

604
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:36,177
I'll be back by 10:00.
We can work then.

605
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:38,727
Please don't answer the phone
or let anyone in.

606
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,719
Don't be late. Huh?

607
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:12,560
- Thanks a lot.
- Grab it!
- Cab! Taxi! Hey!

608
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:21,199
- Into the garden.
- Thank you.

609
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:28,716
I woke up maybe six weeks ago...

610
00:45:28,882 --> 00:45:31,817
and I said, "Saul, this is it.
We're leaving."

611
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:34,288
Brontë, how exquisite you look.

612
00:45:34,419 --> 00:45:36,688
- Thank you for asking me
at the last minute.
- No, not at all. Not at all.

613
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,989
It's just so wonderful to see you.
It's been so long.

614
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:42,318
- And Lauren tells us you've got
a brilliant new apartment.
- Yes. Is she here yet?

615
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:44,871
My point is, it's not a question
of whether or not it's pornographic.

616
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,464
The question is,
whether or not it qualifes as art.
I mean, pornography is...

617
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:50,798
But you... I mean, your own daughter!
Have you seen the stuff she does?

618
00:45:50,994 --> 00:45:53,841
Lafayette was on the horse
and got off the horse...

619
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,679
and saluted my ancestor on both cheeks
with a big kiss.

620
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:59,784
- Did he need to get off the horse?
- Now, it's very stupid...

621
00:45:59,954 --> 00:46:02,475
for these environmentalists
to plant trees...

622
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:05,392
when they don't know
what they're doing.

623
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,561
They don't listen to me,
needless to say.

624
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,837
Of course,
I'm just your average layman...

625
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:14,161
but I have written
the appropriate authorities.

626
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,875
Oh, I'll go, Alberto.
That'll be Lauren.

627
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:20,010
As an artist, our daughter reserves
the right to be late.

628
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,608
Absolutely.

629
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,567
- At last!
- Hi, Mother.

630
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:31,308
This is Georges Fauré from Paris.

631
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:33,165
- Hi.
- Oh?

632
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:37,706
Come on in, Georges.
Georges is Brontë's house guest,
but she was too shy to bring him.

633
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,915
- You don't mind, do you, Mother?
- But of course not.

634
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:44,523
- I went to pick up Brontë
and found him all alone.
- Do come in.

635
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:47,691
- Georges is a very important composer,
Mother, so you two
will have lots to talk about.
- Oh, no, no, no.

636
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,128
- Oh!
- No, no.

637
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:53,551
Mother plays the piano a little.
Get it? A little.

638
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:57,933
Alberto, another place, if you will.

639
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,676
Everybody, I'd like
to present Georges Fauré...

640
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,209
a leading French composer.

641
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:06,673
- Ah!
- Oh, no, no.

642
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:10,351
Good evening.

643
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:13,166
- You see the man
sitting across from you?
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,876
He's very important.
He's on the board of trustees.

645
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,889
Do you live in Paris, Georges?

646
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:23,660
Brontë, he was all by himself.
I really think he wanted to come out.

647
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:25,485
It's okay. It's okay.

648
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,880
Simon and Grace are about to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

649
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:31,082
- Aw!
- Congratulations!

650
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,528
Congratulations!

651
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:40,136
- How long have you been married?
- I've been married 35 years. Sure.

652
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:42,346
Are you married, Georges?

653
00:47:44,242 --> 00:47:47,276
Me? Well, uh...

654
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,970
not usually.

655
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:51,080
Whatever do you mean?

656
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,828
Well, uh, not normally.

657
00:47:54,994 --> 00:47:57,929
- You're getting divorced?
- Yes, definitely.
- Oh.

658
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:02,130
B, you'll never get married.

659
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:05,257
- What makes you say that?
- Oh, you've turned down enough offers.

660
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:09,485
You're gonna wind up
some kind of grand old Kate Hepburn,
surrounded by lots of beautiful plants.

661
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,296
Most men I know
are too boring or too vulgar
to spend the rest of your life with.

662
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,759
- You should change your brand of men.
- Oh, really?

663
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:18,924
Really, B. You're nice. You look for
the same thing in the man...

664
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,130
and you wind up with two nices.

665
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,633
Nice. What an awful word.

666
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:27,853
- Well, Phil's nice, isn't he?
- Phil's different. He's a gardener.

667
00:48:29,267 --> 00:48:31,568
Are you any relation?

668
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:33,128
Relation?

669
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:36,714
- Any relation to the Fauré?
- Who's that?

670
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,268
The Fauré. Gabriel.

671
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,702
I love his chamber music
and his compositions for the harp.

672
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,223
They're so sensual.

673
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:52,498
- We depend on donations, and...
- Yeah.

674
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:56,336
We just don't have any plants.
If you could see how these gardens
change these children's lives...

675
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,648
- They just don't have...
- I hear what you're saying, and I do
hope you'll understand, Brontë, but...

676
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:04,144
to break up that garden
would be a crime.

677
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,511
See, I just can't do it, dear.

678
00:49:06,707 --> 00:49:09,096
The pleasure it's given me
that it'll give to...

679
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:11,373
well, to whoever buys the place.

680
00:49:11,571 --> 00:49:13,643
You do understand?

681
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:10,701
- Thank you.
- And now, Georges Fauré.

682
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:13,234
- Oh, yeah, Georges.
- No. No, no, no, I don't play well.
- Please!

683
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:15,697
- You know, I'm not writing.
- Oh, yes.
- Please, Georges.

684
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:19,120
- Well, uh, one of
your earlier pieces, perhaps?
- We should be going. Uh...

685
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:22,185
Yes, we really must go.
Georges has jet lag.

686
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,494
Oh, why not, Georges?
Just one piece.

687
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,521
Oh, do you mind? It isn't often
we have a Fauré in the house.

688
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,440
- Yes, that's true.
- Please!
- Come on, Georges.

689
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:34,472
Yes.

690
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:36,531
Ah.

691
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:13,964
It's not Mozart.

692
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,335
I know.

693
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:29,229
- Would you translate for me, madame?
- Would I...

694
00:52:36,563 --> 00:52:40,208
"Once I heard the sound
of the wind in the trees."

695
00:52:40,403 --> 00:52:42,192
I think that's it.

696
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:53,229
"Once I heard the sound
of the laughter of children."

697
00:52:56,403 --> 00:53:00,811
"And I wept warm, salty tears
for the lost trees."

698
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:10,578
"Let the little children
come unto the trees...

699
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,073
and I will give them hope," he said.

700
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:21,168
"But there are no trees
for the poor, lost, poor children."

701
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:25,359
"Decay is their toy."

702
00:53:29,203 --> 00:53:31,113
"Despair is their game."

703
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,608
"They have only chaos to climb."

704
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:51,440
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Beautiful!

705
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:54,002
Bravo!

706
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:56,236
Bravo!

707
00:53:57,523 --> 00:53:59,628
I think you just got your trees.

708
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:01,967
No, no, no, no.

709
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:14,698
No. I've got it.

710
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:22,191
Excuse me.

711
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:30,867
Ah. Lauren.

712
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:09,680
Monticello face cream.
"Monticello."

713
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:15,084
Cream face. Okay.

714
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:21,032
Face cream. Okay.

715
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:32,042
- I hope it's okay.
- What?
- The sofa.

716
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:34,349
Oh, sure. Sure.

717
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:39,439
- Thank you.
- What for?
- For tonight. The song, the poem.

718
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:42,321
Oh, that. No, I didn't do it for you.
I just did it for me.

719
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,070
- Oh.
- You were mad when I came with Lauren.

720
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:48,683
- Yes, I was.
- And if you're mad, uh,
we don't study, huh?

721
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,022
And if we don't study,
I don't get a green card.

722
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:58,003
- Are you composing something now?
- Composing?

723
00:55:58,164 --> 00:56:00,400
Well, you're always
humming that little tune.

724
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:06,030
- Me, hum? I don't hum.
- Yes, you do. All the time.

725
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,010
If it bothers you, l-l-I'll stop.

726
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,587
- No, I like it.
- Oh, funny. It's the first thing
you like about me.

727
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:17,388
I don't dislike you, Georges.
I have no opinion of you.

728
00:56:17,556 --> 00:56:21,330
I just want it over and my life
to continue as it was before.

729
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,433
And I am waiting
for my life to begin.

730
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:33,417
Okay. Let's get to work.

731
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:40,723
And this, uh,
was at my grandmother's house.

732
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:42,607
- She had these beautiful,
beautiful rose gardens.
- Roses.

733
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:44,528
Actually,
it was my-my grandfather...

734
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:48,107
who started the rose garden
behind her house.

735
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,185
That's at the beach.

736
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:54,382
We always
bought these little hats.

737
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:56,457
- And this is kindergarten.
- Mm.

738
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,738
- Oh, and, uh,
these are my brothers and sisters.
- Oh.

739
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:04,242
My dad's a writer.
They live in Connecticut.

740
00:57:04,404 --> 00:57:05,964
He named us all
after famous writers.

741
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:10,354
- Kind of puts a curse
on your whole life.
- Mm.

742
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:13,101
I think he wanted me
to be something artistic.

743
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:17,162
It was okay when I was a dancer, but
he doesn't really care for gardening.

744
00:57:17,332 --> 00:57:19,120
- Hmm.
- That's Colette...

745
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:21,225
- Colette. Mm-hmm.
- Austen, Lawrence and Elliot.

746
00:57:21,428 --> 00:57:25,421
- Colette, Austen, Lawrence, Elliot.
- This is my dad, but, uh,
there's a better picture.

747
00:57:25,587 --> 00:57:27,889
- A strong face.
- A strong man.

748
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:32,077
Very strong opinions.
In fact, you and my father...

749
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:35,113
You couldn't
get two people more different.

750
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:38,632
- Yeah, you'd hate each other.
- Why?

751
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:42,032
Well, you're so right-wing
about everything.

752
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:45,098
I'm not wing. You are
the one with the wing.

753
00:57:45,268 --> 00:57:48,399
- All your ideas are
from the same place.
- That's not true.

754
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:51,051
Huh?

755
00:57:51,188 --> 00:57:54,384
These are from college,
different demonstrations.

756
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:56,914
- What for?
- Oh, everything.
- Everything?

757
00:57:57,075 --> 00:57:58,668
- This is Lauren.
- Lauren, yeah?

758
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:00,908
Yes.

759
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:03,628
- And Phil?
- Yes, that's Phil.

760
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:06,184
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:09,170
You are in love with him? Hmm?

762
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:13,041
Yes. Yes, I am.
He's kind and sensitive.

763
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:15,276
Vegetarian?

764
00:58:15,444 --> 00:58:17,451
Yes, he cares about
what he puts in his body.

765
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:20,849
Not like me, huh? Big pig.

766
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:30,547
Oh. I was 12 years old
when I made that.

767
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:35,565
- Didn't the kids at school tease you?
- School? No.

768
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:40,107
I left school at 10 years.
This is the same as my father's, see.

769
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:44,399
He was a mechanic,
but he always dreamed of the gypsies.

770
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,597
He would like to be
a gypsy, traveling.

771
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:56,426
<i>This one given to me by the putain.
You know "putain"? Prostitute?</i>

772
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:59,790
Two girls in our town.

773
00:59:01,364 --> 00:59:04,680
Liane and Michelle.

774
00:59:04,852 --> 00:59:08,048
Michelle had lovely red hair,
long red hair.

775
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:13,033
And this is how the heart is.
Love and hate.

776
00:59:13,203 --> 00:59:16,367
If some people say they love
everything, it's not true, you know?

777
00:59:16,564 --> 00:59:20,241
This is how the heart is.
This is my honesty.

778
00:59:22,484 --> 00:59:25,833
And this one when I was a bad boy
living in the street.

779
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:28,754
This is a knife, for revenge.

780
00:59:28,948 --> 00:59:31,184
When someone
meant something bad to you, you...

781
00:59:31,347 --> 00:59:35,504
you make this tattoo
until you find him and kill him.

782
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:39,978
Then you... you make another one here
with the knife put away.

783
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:43,147
- But you don't have that one.
- I don't find him yet.

784
00:59:46,036 --> 00:59:49,549
- Were you ever in jail?
- Yeah.

785
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:52,683
- What for?
- Just kid stuff.

786
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:55,601
Stealing cars. N-Nothing serious.

787
00:59:55,828 --> 00:59:57,683
Oh.

788
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:04,401
And, uh,
when is your menstruation?

789
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,824
- My...
- Menstruation.

790
01:00:07,988 --> 01:00:10,322
Beginning of the month
or the end of the month? When?

791
01:00:10,484 --> 01:00:13,167
- Oh.
- Huh?

792
01:00:13,331 --> 01:00:16,365
It's at the...
It's the beginning of the month.

793
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:19,182
Beginning. Okay.

794
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:27,793
I didn't really believe
that you were a composer.

795
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:30,987
I mean, we told so many lies,
it's hard to know what the truth is.

796
01:00:34,036 --> 01:00:37,233
You just have to
trust your instinct.

797
01:00:46,036 --> 01:00:47,410
Yeah.

798
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:54,762
- This was my, uh,
first boyfriend from college.
- Hmm.

799
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:58,609
He was a musician too.
He played, uh...

800
01:00:58,803 --> 01:01:02,120
the slide trombone.

801
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,041
And it was he who
first kissed those lips?

802
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:12,393
I don't think
they're gonna ask you that.

803
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:15,922
Good night.

804
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:31,658
Hmm.

805
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:55,151
- Brontë?
- Yes?

806
01:02:55,315 --> 01:02:58,032
What side of the bed
do you sleep on?

807
01:02:58,228 --> 01:03:00,497
The right side.

808
01:03:00,628 --> 01:03:02,537
Okay. I'll take the left side.

809
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,563
Okay.

810
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:46,669
Huh.

811
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,801
Brontë, come on.
We have, uh, work to do.

812
01:04:44,212 --> 01:04:45,673
Work.

813
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:48,530
"Africa, Sunday.

814
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,763
"Chérie...

815
01:04:51,924 --> 01:04:55,088
"it is hot here in Africa...

816
01:04:55,252 --> 01:04:57,194
"and very green.

817
01:04:58,676 --> 01:05:01,905
"The elephants
have been restless again.

818
01:05:03,156 --> 01:05:06,701
"I think it must be the drums.

819
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:11,348
"It makes them crazy.

820
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:14,192
"I miss you every day...

821
01:05:14,356 --> 01:05:17,705
"and I ask the same question:

822
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:20,529
When are you coming, chérie?"

823
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,928
"Dear Georges...

824
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:26,507
"the apartment is looking beautiful.

825
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:29,524
"I only have to look
in the fish pond to think of you.

826
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:33,003
"Hurry home.

827
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:35,594
"You are never
far from my thoughts.

828
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:39,276
Much love, B."

829
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:47,276
- This is ridiculous!
- No, no, no. Look.

830
01:05:47,412 --> 01:05:49,484
For the green card,
I do anything. Look.

831
01:05:49,652 --> 01:05:51,659
Give me camera, huh?

832
01:05:52,884 --> 01:05:56,048
- We need blue sky. Ah!
- Mm-hmm.

833
01:05:56,212 --> 01:05:58,929
We are on honeymoon,
and we have to smile like oafs.

834
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:02,764
Okay, now, do it, yes.

835
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:05,071
- Do on the skis, okay?
- Okay, I'll do one. L-I'll do one.

836
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:09,099
Okay. On the slaloms, you know?
I'm very good on slalom.
Will you remember, hmm?

837
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:18,191
Oh.

838
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:21,232
<i>- Okay. I need some blue sky.
- We're loadin'up our Woody</i>

839
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:24,626
<i>- With our boards inside
and headin'out singin'our song
- Okay.</i>

840
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:27,658
<i>- That's good.
- Come on, baby, wait and see</i>

841
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:31,341
<i>- Okay, that's it.
That-That-That's great!

01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,647
<i>- Come along, baby, surfin'safari

843
01:06:33,844 --> 01:06:36,910
<i>- Yeah, I'm gonna

844
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:40,044
<i>- Let's go surfin'now

- Oh, lovely, lovely.</i>

845
01:06:40,212 --> 01:06:41,903
<i>Come on and safari with me</i>

846
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,978
- Okay.
- Come on. Political ballet.

847
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:46,122
- What?
- I make the oppressed.
You make the victory.

848
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:47,502
- Okay.
- Victory!
- Victory.

849
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:49,359
Yeah.

850
01:06:50,613 --> 01:06:53,068
- Victory.
- Okay?

851
01:06:53,237 --> 01:06:54,830
- Okay. One more.
- Oh!

852
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:56,785
Okay.

853
01:06:56,948 --> 01:07:00,778
The green... Yes.
Put the plant behind you.

854
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:03,467
<i>Uh, faites attention.</i>

855
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:05,742
- Put-Put-Put the green plant...
- Of course. The green plant...

856
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:08,047
There. That's-That's good. Okay.

857
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:13,842
- We feel the elephants?
- I feel them, but, oh,
maybe with the knife, like you could...

858
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:16,937
Yes. Ah, uh... Th... Uh, yes.

859
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:19,923
- This is so silly.
- No, no, no, no. That's all right.

860
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:22,473
- One more. Smile.
- Okay.

861
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:27,277
- Okay. One more.
- What now?

862
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:29,168
- Handyman.
- Handyman?
- Yes.

863
01:07:29,332 --> 01:07:31,601
The good husband
always does handyman things.

864
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:34,130
- Oh! Okay, okay.
- Yes.

865
01:07:37,364 --> 01:07:39,982
How 'bout these?

866
01:07:40,148 --> 01:07:43,279
Oh, great. Great.

867
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:45,233
Oh.

868
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,889
Smile.

869
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,167
- Okay, do some handyman things.
- Yeah?

870
01:08:02,484 --> 01:08:04,273
Stay here.

871
01:08:08,148 --> 01:08:11,312
<i>- Hello?
- Surprise! It's us, darling.
We're in your lobby.</i>

872
01:08:11,476 --> 01:08:13,680
Mother!
Why didn't you call?

873
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:16,714
<i>- Can we come up?
- Of course! I... Look, um...</i>

874
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,430
<i>- You're sure it's all right?
- Of course. Come on up.</i>

875
01:08:23,796 --> 01:08:26,993
Georges!
Georges, it's my parents.

876
01:08:27,188 --> 01:08:29,676
- This is the worst.
You've gotta go. They'll kill me.
- Okay. I'll change.

877
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:32,562
- No, no. There's no time.
- Okay. No time.

878
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:36,368
- Take, uh, the skis.
Put them back in the closet.
- The skis, yes. The skis.

879
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:40,587
Open... Open this, please. Fine.

880
01:08:40,757 --> 01:08:42,612
Okay. Thank you.

881
01:08:43,764 --> 01:08:45,968
- Open!
- Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

882
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:48,270
- It's okay.
- Come on.

883
01:08:52,244 --> 01:08:54,666
Just go.
I'll make something up.

884
01:09:01,877 --> 01:09:04,462
Could I have a chat with you
and your husband, Mrs. Fauré?

885
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:08,687
- He was just leaving, Mrs. Bird.
- Yes.
- But I want to know
about these government people.

886
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,359
- And last night I heard drums,
jungle drums.
- No, no, no.

887
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:18,860
- No, no, no.
- Not now, Mrs. Bird. Please.
- They keep asking all sorts of
questions about you and your husband.

888
01:09:19,028 --> 01:09:21,297
He's not a spy
or something, is he?

889
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,177
Of course not, Mrs. Bird.

890
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:28,269
Georges. Oh, Mom, Dad!

891
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:30,257
- What's going on?
- Hello, darling.

892
01:09:30,421 --> 01:09:32,974
- Hi. I'll speak to you later, Mrs. Bird.
- How about the drums?

893
01:09:33,108 --> 01:09:34,635
- Later.
- What?

894
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:37,588
I'll talk to you later.

895
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:40,269
- If you'd have called,
I would have prepared something.
- I made you something.

896
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:42,858
Since you never come visit these days,
I guess it's up to us.

897
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:47,152
Oh, no, it's not that.
Your father had to see someone.

898
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,513
- Hokey sort of entrance.
- Oh, it's lovely.

899
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:56,462
- This is Georges.
- Hello.

900
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,833
Hi.

901
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,330
A handyman.

902
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:06,194
- Oh.
- Ah.
- If you could just
finish up the work, Georges.

903
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:10,447
- Yeah. Right. I just finish my work.
- Oh, darling, it's beautiful.

904
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:13,612
- I know now why you were so excited.
- It's awfully small.

905
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,461
Did they sign
the big contracts, Dad?

906
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:18,636
- No. We're not gonna talk about that.
- Ah, did they sign the contracts?

907
01:10:18,805 --> 01:10:21,619
No! They backed out. Liars!

908
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,464
- They lied to me.
- Dear, don't upset yourself.

909
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:27,945
- One thing I can't stand is a liar.
- You read your paper, dear.

910
01:10:28,117 --> 01:10:30,506
We're gonna look
at the greenhouse. He's upset.

911
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:36,043
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it is too beautiful to imagine!

912
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,155
- Do you want a hand, there, Georges?
- Oh, no, thanks.

913
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,464
I'm just... just measuring.

914
01:10:40,628 --> 01:10:42,516
Oh. Measuring.

915
01:10:45,364 --> 01:10:48,495
- She's had the baby already. Premature.
- Oh? Premature? What'd they name her?

916
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,628
Tiffany. Now they have a Tiffany
and a Tarquin.

917
01:10:53,204 --> 01:10:55,146
- Thank you.
- Pretentious.

918
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:57,837
- Dear!
- Well, he's a pretentious writer too.
- Ho-ho.

919
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:01,038
Well, he is.
Well, don't you think so?

920
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:02,993
- You are in a bad mood.
- I need a screw.

921
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:08,464
- Pardon?
- I really need a screw.

922
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:12,978
- I thought you were leaving.
- I just fixed the door, but I need a...

923
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:16,719
I heard what you said.
In the cupboard under the sink.

924
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:21,522
I'm gonna help Georges.
He seems a bit lost.

925
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:23,824
Oh, you have to taste this.

926
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,745
Never mind your principles.
Taste this.

927
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:29,810
Let's get those orchids, Mom.
I'm sure you want to be on your way.

928
01:11:30,005 --> 01:11:33,234
Oh, no, dear.
We're not in a hurry, not at all.

929
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,535
You're not really a handyman,
are you Georges?

930
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:50,452
- No. I'm a composer.
- Oh.

931
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,612
I used to be a cleaner
when I first started writing.

932
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,709
Long, long time ago.
We'd just got married...

933
01:11:57,876 --> 01:12:00,015
against the wishes
of my parents, I might add.

934
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:02,734
Didn't have a bean.

935
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:05,234
We fell in love right off.

936
01:12:05,365 --> 01:12:07,372
Oh, it was diffcult,
very diffcult.

937
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:10,671
But, yeah,
when you're in love, you know.

938
01:12:10,837 --> 01:12:13,259
- Shipboard romance is what it was.
- Excuse me.

939
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:16,782
- Oh, I'll get it.
- No. It's okay. It's okay. No.

940
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:26,258
Brontë, come here a minute.
What is this?

941
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:38,061
Thank you.

942
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,099
It was right in the middle
of a lifeboat drill.

943
01:12:41,268 --> 01:12:45,775
We suddenly found ourselves
in the same boat.

944
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:50,731
- Shouldn't you be going, Georges?
- Now, you go on outside
with your mother. Outside.

945
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:52,657
- But?
- Georges and I have everything
under control.

946
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:54,893
Go on. Out you go.

947
01:12:55,061 --> 01:12:59,534
We've been talking about music
and love and skiing...

948
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:01,676
and all manner of things,
haven't we, Georges?

949
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,179
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Sit down.

950
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:08,876
Oh, I like your Georges, Brontë.

951
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:11,892
- A charming man.
- He's not my Georges, Mother.

952
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:14,802
- He should have left by now.
- Well, he's keeping your father happy.

953
01:13:14,997 --> 01:13:16,458
And you know how restless
he gets in the city.

954
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:18,866
So let's be grateful.

955
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:28,788
Height, five feet seven.

956
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:31,469
- Five eight.
- Five eight.

957
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:34,866
- Weight, 140 pounds.
- No!

958
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:36,817
- Huh?
- No, 125.

959
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:39,698
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

960
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:42,097
Eyes?

961
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:44,749
- Brown.
- Brown, yeah.

962
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:47,852
- Small scar on your ankle.
- How did you know?

963
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:50,060
I know. I saw it.

964
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:53,525
Birthday, 24th August, 1959.

965
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:56,140
Correct. Okay, my turn.

966
01:13:56,309 --> 01:13:58,414
Uh, eyes, green.

967
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,239
- Height...
- Nose, big!

968
01:14:00,405 --> 01:14:03,339
- Oh, no!
- Yes, sure it is.

969
01:14:03,509 --> 01:14:06,543
- Height, uh, five eleven.
- Yeah.

970
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,716
Um, weight?

971
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:12,300
Oof! Weight!
You worry too much about weight.

972
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:15,021
- Um, at 17, you met Helene.
- Yeah.

973
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:17,328
She was at the University of Paris.

974
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:20,362
- She taught you to read and write music.
- Mm-hmm.

975
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:25,553
- And you lived together
for seven years, until she died.
- S-Seven. Seven years, yeah.

976
01:14:25,717 --> 01:14:29,678
And then you gave up your music
for many years, right?

977
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:31,634
Yes, but I don't write any music.

978
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:33,901
I just play piano,
always in the bars.

979
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,695
Yes!

980
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:39,121
- And Anton heard you
one night in Paris...
- Yeah.

981
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:42,319
And said that he would help you
start over in America.

982
01:14:42,485 --> 01:14:46,162
Yes! And I wake up in America.
Beautiful country, land of opportunity.

983
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,332
Uh-huh, ha, ha, ha.

984
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:52,176
Okay, back to work.

985
01:14:52,341 --> 01:14:55,821
Um, you live with two men.

986
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:58,706
First Peter, then Stephen.

987
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,560
- Both nice guy.
- Nice?

988
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:03,791
Yes, that's what you said. Yes.

989
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:07,338
And Stephen wanted to "marriage" you,
but, uh, you think that marriage
is boring.

990
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:10,511
- Ah! Except for ours.
- Oh, yeah.

991
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:12,749
Then you met, uh, Phil.

992
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,628
Phil.

993
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:20,303
- Him you really love, huh?
- But you can't tell them that.

994
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:27,467
- And I left Phil.
- And married me, because...

995
01:15:27,605 --> 01:15:30,354
You're different and funny.

996
01:15:30,549 --> 01:15:33,549
And don't forget a...
a good handyman.

997
01:15:33,717 --> 01:15:35,626
Right.

998
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:39,437
You've had lots of women,
but you haven't really loved anyone...

999
01:15:39,605 --> 01:15:41,678
since Helene, except for me.

1000
01:15:41,845 --> 01:15:45,261
- And you fell in love with me because...
- Ah!

1001
01:15:47,157 --> 01:15:50,735
What's a good reason?
I just can't think.

1002
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:54,698
It can't be that hard
to think of a reason.

1003
01:15:54,869 --> 01:15:58,098
Uh, let me see. Ahh!

1004
01:15:59,669 --> 01:16:01,742
There must be a reason.

1005
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:08,880
Oh, yes! Yes.

1006
01:16:09,045 --> 01:16:11,466
Because I begin
to hear music again.

1007
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:17,877
- It's like when I was a little girl.
- Yeah?

1008
01:16:18,037 --> 01:16:19,825
The same thing.

1009
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,876
- The pot.
- Sure.

1010
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:28,202
No, I gave you a five, right?
Yeah, okay.

1011
01:16:29,749 --> 01:16:31,342
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1012
01:16:31,509 --> 01:16:34,509
- What? What?
- Don't wait up for me.

1013
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:39,020
- Phil? Phil!
- Hey-hey!

1014
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:45,554
Hey! Oh, ho!

1015
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:48,651
You look beautiful.

1016
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,350
- Let's go around to your place.
- Wait.

1017
01:16:50,549 --> 01:16:52,459
- Or we can go around to Angelo's.
- No.

1018
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:55,564
- Oh, God. I'm hungry. Let's go.
- No, no, no, no, no. Let's go this way.

1019
01:16:55,701 --> 01:16:59,149
No, no. It's all arranged. Come on.
I made a reservation. Come here.

1020
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,488
- Let's go have dinner around...
just around the corner here.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1021
01:17:01,589 --> 01:17:03,661
- I have it all planned.
Let's go this way.
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

1022
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:06,730
- Oh, come on.
- So tell me everything you
did while I was away.

1023
01:17:06,901 --> 01:17:09,651
- Not much.
- Not much? So you missed me?

1024
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:11,471
- Oh, yes.
- Yes?

1025
01:17:11,637 --> 01:17:14,670
- Yes.
- I missed you a lot.
You sure you missed me?

1026
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:16,593
- Of course.
- You sure?
- Yes.

1027
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:20,980
You don't look like you did.
No. Looks to me like I missed you more
than you missed me.

1028
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,593
That's not true.

1029
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:31,506
- You should have been there.
It was beautiful.
- Three tofus and a brown rice.

1030
01:17:31,638 --> 01:17:35,118
I saw us there. Out in the middle
of nowhere, grow our own food.

1031
01:17:35,253 --> 01:17:37,522
One night there was
this incredible moon.

1032
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:40,467
- You should've seen it. Wow!
- We had the same moon.

1033
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:43,629
Well, yeah, but you should have seen it
without all the crap in the sky.

1034
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:46,547
It was glorious.
It was a cloudy night.

1035
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:51,117
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
this giant shaft of moonlight
breaks through the clouds.

1036
01:17:51,286 --> 01:17:53,620
It was all of a sudden like daytime...

1037
01:17:53,814 --> 01:17:56,748
with giant shadows being
cast from the trees.

1038
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:15,669
Ohh.

1039
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:21,269
Oh, what a beauty.

1040
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:26,226
- Now go!
- No.

1041
01:19:26,389 --> 01:19:29,356
- Phil!
- The guard isn't here.

1042
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:32,787
Ohh. Look, we'll get together
tomorrow, okay? Please.

1043
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,859
Just to the door, Brontë.

1044
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:39,120
There might be some intruder
lurking about.

1045
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,946
- Hey, this is nice!
- Okay.

1046
01:19:49,141 --> 01:19:51,313
- You've seen me to the door. Now go.
- No.

1047
01:19:51,477 --> 01:19:53,517
No. I can't go until
I've seen the greenhouse.

1048
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:56,173
- Oh, Phil, you've had too much to drink.
- Yeah.

1049
01:19:56,342 --> 01:20:00,750
- Come here. Mmm!
- Mmm.

1050
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:05,041
- Oh, you feel so good.
- Oh, Phil, no. Please.

1051
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:06,994
- Mmm.
- Oh.

1052
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:09,329
Oh, Brontë. Oh, oh!

1053
01:20:09,493 --> 01:20:12,243
- Phil.
- Mmm, mmm.

1054
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:16,147
- Oh.
- Phil, no, no!

1055
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:18,578
You heard what she said!

1056
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,507
<i>Oh, merde!</i>

1057
01:20:29,782 --> 01:20:33,360
- She said go. Okay?
- Who's this?

1058
01:20:33,526 --> 01:20:35,282
- Go or I'll throw you out.
- Georges, how dare you?

1059
01:20:35,446 --> 01:20:37,420
- Brontë, talk to me. Who is this?
- Get out, vegetarian!

1060
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:42,477
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Georges, no!
- I'm the husband, that's who.

1061
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:48,620
- What'd you say?
- That's my wife you've been grabbing.
Now get out.

1062
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:53,422
Brontë? Brontë? Is this true?

1063
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:56,437
Yes, but it's not the way
you think. Oh, God.

1064
01:20:56,597 --> 01:20:58,964
- What?
- Oh, God!
- Out.

1065
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,914
- Now wait a minute.
- Out, out, out, out.

1066
01:21:01,077 --> 01:21:03,925
Hey! You're the waiter
from that restaurant.

1067
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:07,915
- Get out! Out.
- I don't know what's going on,
but I'm gonna find out, pal.

1068
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:10,475
Go on, get out!
Carrot! Cucumber!

1069
01:21:19,477 --> 01:21:21,714
- No!
- Now you go.

1070
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:24,627
- The interview! We're going tomorrow.
- Out! Now!

1071
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:26,677
- Are you upset?
- Upset? Upset!

1072
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:29,588
- Out, out!
- No, no. But the interview!

1073
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,171
- I don't care.
I don't care what happens.
- Brontë, please.

1074
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:34,481
Now go or I'll call the police.
I'll call Immigration.

1075
01:21:34,646 --> 01:21:37,133
Jail would be better than this.
At least I'd have a cell to myself!

1076
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:41,327
Oh. Come on.
D-Don't be childish.

1077
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,070
- Brontë?
- Ohh!

1078
01:21:45,237 --> 01:21:47,725
Brontë? Open, Brontë.

1079
01:21:49,526 --> 01:21:53,236
Brontë? Brontë? Brontë?

1080
01:21:53,429 --> 01:21:54,956
Brontë?

1081
01:22:21,973 --> 01:22:24,723
Get up. Go on. Get up.

1082
01:22:24,918 --> 01:22:27,471
Up! Out! Out!

1083
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:29,393
Oh, no.

1084
01:22:29,557 --> 01:22:32,656
Up! Out!
Back to the subway.

1085
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:35,572
- It's you!
- Uh, good morning, Mrs. Bird.

1086
01:22:35,798 --> 01:22:37,937
Ever since you people moved in,
there's been nothing but trouble.

1087
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,110
I didn't want
to wake you, chérie.

1088
01:22:40,278 --> 01:22:43,539
- You forgot your key again.
- Yes. Al-Always forgetting the key.

1089
01:22:43,701 --> 01:22:46,157
You should have gone to a hotel, dear!

1090
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:50,035
But the board wouldn't approve of
such a thing! Sleeping in the hallways.

1091
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,659
- Excuse me.
- This isn't Africa, you know.

1092
01:22:51,798 --> 01:22:54,481
I realize that, Mrs. Bird.
It won't happen again.

1093
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:57,483
Mrs. Bird!

1094
01:22:57,654 --> 01:23:00,043
- Why did you do that last night?
- I just don't like vegetarians.

1095
01:23:00,246 --> 01:23:03,061
- Don't be ridiculous!
- The way he was bothering you,
I lost control.

1096
01:23:03,222 --> 01:23:05,840
- Is that supposed to be an apology?
- He's not right for you.

1097
01:23:06,006 --> 01:23:08,340
Oh, really? He knows more about
people's feelings than you'll ever know.

1098
01:23:08,502 --> 01:23:11,055
- Feelings?
You don't have feelings at all.
- You snore, and your manners
are atrocious.

1099
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:14,603
- Ah, if you think
that's important, you're a snob.
- Well, you're a slob,
you're overweight, you're disgusting!

1100
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:17,393
You say you are a rebel,
but you are afraid of your father.

1101
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:21,234
- My father's made something of his life.
- But you live your life like
you got it from a book.

1102
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:23,437
- Well, you're 40,
and you sleep in the park.
- And Phil?

1103
01:23:23,606 --> 01:23:26,989
Oh, yes, you make-a nice love with Phil,
like-a vegetables. You need a fuck.

1104
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:28,783
That's the language of the gutter, where
you came from and where you'll end up.

1105
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:32,496
I am... I am the gutter, yes.
But you... You are like a plant.

1106
01:23:32,661 --> 01:23:35,028
A ca-ca... cactus!

1107
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:36,945
I once said I had no opinion of you,
and now I do.

1108
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:41,387
- I hate you. I really hate you!
- Good, good. Your first feeling. Good.

1109
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,110
- Oh, God. The interview!
- Oh, my God!

1110
01:23:46,742 --> 01:23:48,979
- Oh, oh! Oh!
- Do you have... Do you have a...

1111
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:50,899
Yeah. I'll do it. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1112
01:23:51,062 --> 01:23:54,706
- Move it, you stupid moron!
- I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

1113
01:23:54,902 --> 01:23:58,415
- Come on. We'll take the subway.
- Well, you can take the subway, lady,
but you ain't goin' nowhere.

1114
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:01,452
- The subway? Where?
- The water main broke.
- The park. The park. Come on!

1115
01:24:01,622 --> 01:24:03,694
The whole city's falling apart!

1116
01:24:03,829 --> 01:24:05,618
Come on. We'll get a cab
on the other side.

1117
01:24:05,846 --> 01:24:10,353
But the park is too far, Brontë.
Brontë, it's too far!

1118
01:24:16,246 --> 01:24:18,734
Come on. Up there.

1119
01:24:21,782 --> 01:24:23,570
- This way.
- You're sure? You're sure, huh?

1120
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:26,188
- Yes.
- Because we can't get lost.

1121
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:28,015
I'm sure. Of course I'm sure.

1122
01:24:29,302 --> 01:24:31,276
- To the right. Right.
- Where?

1123
01:24:38,518 --> 01:24:41,365
Come on. Come on.
Run for it. Take care.

1124
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:47,028
Oh.

1125
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,914
Oh. We're nearly there.

1126
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:57,649
- This way?
- We're not far. Oh.

1127
01:24:57,814 --> 01:24:59,669
Come on!

1128
01:25:03,286 --> 01:25:05,741
- Children!
- Taxi?

1129
01:25:05,942 --> 01:25:10,317
- Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
- Taxi! Taxi!

1130
01:25:11,702 --> 01:25:14,517
Number 75.

1131
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,965
We're the next.

1132
01:25:31,478 --> 01:25:34,348
Father, Sydney.

1133
01:25:34,486 --> 01:25:36,177
Face cream, Monticello.

1134
01:25:36,342 --> 01:25:39,855
Monticello. Monticello.

1135
01:25:40,022 --> 01:25:42,510
Your father's name,
was it Bertrand or Bernard?

1136
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:47,179
- Rene.
- Oh.

1137
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:50,318
Seventy-six? Seventy-six.

1138
01:26:14,966 --> 01:26:16,722
You wait in here, Mr. Fauré.

1139
01:26:16,886 --> 01:26:18,893
And Mrs. Fauré,
if you'll follow me.

1140
01:26:53,846 --> 01:26:55,701
No.

1141
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,219
Mr. Fauré, as you know,
we have doubts...

1142
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:02,546
that your marriage is bona fide.

1143
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:04,685
I have here a number
of detailed questions.

1144
01:27:04,822 --> 01:27:06,862
Your answers will help us
make a determination.

1145
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:10,827
I want you to be brief
and to the point.

1146
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:13,715
I ask you
to raise your right hand.

1147
01:27:15,638 --> 01:27:17,231
Do you hereby swear that the evidence
you're about to give...

1148
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,747
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1149
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:23,537
- I do.
- I do.

1150
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,801
Your name is
Brontë Mitchell Fauré?

1151
01:27:26,966 --> 01:27:28,755
Her father is a writer.

1152
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:31,219
- His name?
- Sydney. Sydney Parrish.

1153
01:27:31,414 --> 01:27:34,131
He didn't
have a formal education.

1154
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:36,083
He ran away from home
when he was 12.

1155
01:27:36,278 --> 01:27:40,621
Plants. She loves all flowers
and weeds. That's her research.

1156
01:27:40,758 --> 01:27:42,481
He knows I love salads.

1157
01:27:42,646 --> 01:27:45,778
He likes all fatty foods,
you know, being French.

1158
01:27:45,943 --> 01:27:48,877
She likes to eat such a thing
as birdseed.

1159
01:27:49,046 --> 01:27:50,388
- Birdseed?
- Yes.

1160
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:53,998
Muesli and decaf.
Horrible coffee!

1161
01:27:56,118 --> 01:27:58,125
He hums all the time.

1162
01:27:58,262 --> 01:28:01,426
- Hums?
- He's composing.

1163
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:05,365
He hasn't written
in a long time.

1164
01:28:05,526 --> 01:28:09,749
He says he's not sensitive,
but that's not true.

1165
01:28:09,943 --> 01:28:12,048
He's a very sensitive man.

1166
01:28:14,358 --> 01:28:16,780
<i>He makes me laugh.</i>

1167
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:20,082
She's very kind to people.

1168
01:28:20,278 --> 01:28:22,417
Me, I don't think that way.

1169
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,805
I don't trust people.

1170
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,885
He's had a hard life.

1171
01:28:29,046 --> 01:28:33,269
In a way, he hasn't learned to give,
but he's got so much to give.

1172
01:28:33,462 --> 01:28:35,317
She has peace.

1173
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:39,373
I don't have peace.

1174
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:42,412
He has passion. He eats life.

1175
01:28:45,526 --> 01:28:49,421
I'm sure that just about does it.
Just a few more details.

1176
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,111
- Five, uh, feet eight.
- Five eleven.

1177
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:55,659
- Hundred and twenty-five.
- He won't tell me how much he weighs.

1178
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,513
- She sleeps
on the right side of the bed.
- He's on the left.

1179
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:01,362
- Her toothbrush? Green.
- Mine's green.

1180
01:29:01,527 --> 01:29:03,315
Her face cream?

1181
01:29:06,358 --> 01:29:08,300
Monticello.

1182
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:13,617
Monaco. No.

1183
01:29:13,814 --> 01:29:16,181
Monte Carlo.

1184
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:19,345
That's the only answer
I keep forgetting.

1185
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:30,547
You remember all
the other answers?

1186
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:41,332
Is not her fault.
So, please, don't touch her.

1187
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:23,122
- I was good, I think.
- Me too.

1188
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:27,700
I think you're
gonna get what you want.

1189
01:30:28,983 --> 01:30:31,798
- Your green card.
- Oh, yes.

1190
01:30:34,903 --> 01:30:37,903
I'll see you again? I mean,
I have to get my things.

1191
01:30:38,102 --> 01:30:40,274
- Well, I can leave them with Oscar.
- Oscar? Uh, good idea.

1192
01:30:40,407 --> 01:30:43,374
Yes, right.
You're right. Oscar. Yeah.

1193
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:45,932
As soon as we hear something,
we can start...

1194
01:30:46,134 --> 01:30:47,661
you know, the divorce.

1195
01:30:47,831 --> 01:30:51,180
Oh. As soon as possible.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1196
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:55,952
Good luck with your music.

1197
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:59,021
I hope you
get your big trees, huh?

1198
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:06,510
- Good-bye, Georges.
- Good-bye, Brontë.

1199
01:31:09,078 --> 01:31:11,631
Oh! The ring.

1200
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:20,245
No, thank you.

1201
01:33:41,463 --> 01:33:43,535
- I...
- Good morning, Mrs. Fauré.

1202
01:33:43,703 --> 01:33:46,550
Mr. Fauré just stopped by.
He... He said to give you this.

1203
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:49,394
L-I guess
his-his flight was delayed.

1204
01:33:49,559 --> 01:33:51,119
Yes. Well, thank you, Oscar.

1205
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,783
"Africa, Tuesday.

1206
01:34:26,422 --> 01:34:28,146
"Chérie...

1207
01:34:28,311 --> 01:34:31,180
"the elephants
have been restless again.

1208
01:34:31,351 --> 01:34:33,871
"So restless,
I just can't sleep.

1209
01:34:36,599 --> 01:34:38,028
"I would love
to say a last good-bye...

1210
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:40,468
before this next safari."

1211
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:20,594
Oh!

1212
01:36:49,047 --> 01:36:51,949
- It's okay.
- What?

1213
01:36:52,151 --> 01:36:57,301
Monticello.
I think I tried too hard. I blew it.

1214
01:36:57,463 --> 01:36:59,765
Oh. Why didn't you tell me?

1215
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:05,845
It's all right.

1216
01:37:06,007 --> 01:37:08,341
We made a deal.
If I leave quickly...

1217
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:11,983
then you keep
your beautiful greenhouse.

1218
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,783
I don't care
about the greenhouse.

1219
01:37:18,679 --> 01:37:21,101
It's time to go, Mr. Fauré.

1220
01:37:23,575 --> 01:37:25,363
No, no!

1221
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:29,518
- I write.
- Let's go!

1222
01:37:29,687 --> 01:37:32,305
- I write every day.
- Now, Mr. Fauré.

1223
01:37:32,504 --> 01:37:35,187
And the letters will
always say the same thing:

1224
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:38,220
"When are you coming, chérie?"

1225
01:37:42,679 --> 01:37:44,654
<i>Last night</i>

1226
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:48,598
<i>- I had a dream
- Ooh</i>

1227
01:37:48,759 --> 01:37:50,832
<i>- About a home
- No!</i>

1228
01:37:50,999 --> 01:37:54,893
<i>- No!
- That was so bright</i>

1229
01:37:55,063 --> 01:37:58,030
<i>I don't know why
it has to be a dream</i>

1230
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:00,403
Oh, chérie.

1231
01:38:00,567 --> 01:38:04,244
<i>- Why can't I, when will I
Lord help me
- Do you still have them?</i>

1232
01:38:04,407 --> 01:38:08,182
<i>- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Help me find a home</i>

1233
01:38:08,343 --> 01:38:11,442
<i>Keep your eyes</i>

1234
01:38:11,608 --> 01:38:13,396
<i>On the prize</i>

1235
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:16,907
<i>- Oh.
- Don't be dismayed</i>

1236
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:20,079
<i>Don't be dismayed</i>

1237
01:38:20,215 --> 01:38:22,932
<i>- I do.
- Deep in your heart</i>

1238
01:38:23,095 --> 01:38:26,990
<i>You must believe</i>

1239
01:38:27,191 --> 01:38:31,828
<i>Everything is gonna
be all right</i>

1240
01:38:32,024 --> 01:38:35,537
<i>- So do I.
- Everything is gonna</i>

1241
01:38:35,735 --> 01:38:39,084
<i>Be all right</i>

1242
01:38:39,223 --> 01:38:44,493
<i>Everything is gonna
be all right</i>

1243
01:38:44,695 --> 01:38:46,605
<i>Someday</i>

1244
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,709
<i>Sometimes hot</i>

1245
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:55,953
<i>And sometimes cold</i>

1246
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:02,865
<i>Sometimes I'm in
Sometimes I'm out</i>

1247
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:06,163
<i>No, I haven't
had much to eat</i>

1248
01:39:07,703 --> 01:39:09,590
<i>Lord knows</i>

1249
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:13,264
<i>I haven't had much sleep
you know</i>

1250
01:39:13,431 --> 01:39:18,898
<i>Keep your eyes on the prize</i>

1251
01:39:19,095 --> 01:39:21,910
<i>Don't be dismayed</i>

1252
01:39:22,071 --> 01:39:25,071
<i>Don't be dismayed</i>

<i>Someday</i>
