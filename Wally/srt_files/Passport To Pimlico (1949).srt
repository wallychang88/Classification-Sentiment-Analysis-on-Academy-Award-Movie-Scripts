5
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,553
'You've been listening
to a programme of lunchtime music

6
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:35,539
'by Les Norman
and his Bethnal Green Bambinos.'

7
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,961
- You gonna be at that meeting tonight?
- Afraid so.

8
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,390
- Try and keep it short, Dad.
- Hm.

9
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:13,255
<i>I</i> I don't want to set the world on fire

10
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,049
<i>J</i> I just want to start...

11
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,886
- Pair of kippers to wait for Mrs White.
- Okey-doke.

12
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:21,076
See any difference?

13
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,707
- What's the matter? Gone off?
- No, in me.

14
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:27,496
- What's all that oily muck?
- The shiny look, they call it.

15
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:29,816
- Do you like it?
- Not much.

16
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,935
- No wonder we're short of fat.
-  Frank!

17
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,157
Frank, Mum wants to know
if you've got any cod fillets.

18
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:39,638
I've got something better. Fancy a
nice bit of bream for your supper?

19
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:42,940
- Mm, yes.
- Ah, it's a treat to see it again.

20
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:46,699
My old dad used to say that this one
was the most human fish of 'em all.

21
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,576
If I was a bream, I'd resent that.

22
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,887
Oh, I'll tell you a most
remarkable thing about the bream.

23
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,673
When he's courting,
he grows a little white wart just here.

24
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,153
Just like you, or I might buy a new hat.

25
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,632
Well, I must be going now.
I'm ten minutes late already.

26
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,626
I'll fetch it over
with a nice big piece of ice.

27
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,174
All right.

28
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,572
Some people get jam on it-.

29
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,049
Wrap this up and put it in the fridge.

30
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,305
- Hello, Benny.
- Hello.

31
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:30,829
Phew! 94 degrees on Air Ministry roof.

32
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:32,551
Right, I'll keep off it.

33
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:35,542
- Any more about us there?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:40,496
"It is now believed that Pamela, the
last unexploded bomb in the London area,

35
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:44,726
"will be removed from Miramont Place,
Pimlico, on Tuesday next."

36
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,753
- We hope.
- Oh, it's gotta be, mate.

37
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,595
They want it for the exhibition
on local arts and culture.

38
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:52,550
You can pack it up, boys.

39
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,775
Art and culture's had it.
We're not defusing after all.

40
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,536
- Not, sir?
- We've got to blow her up.

41
00:04:57,646 --> 00:05:00,491
- What, in her state of health?
- We've got to.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,036
They've discovered another last bomb
so Pamela goes up tomorrow.

43
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,866
The police are sending a chap
round now to warn the population.

44
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,543
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:15,932
Two bob to win on Silver Street
at 13 to 8. That's 5 and 3.

46
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:18,170
Any to Come Equator, you had.

47
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,763
Heard about the bomb, Fred?
Setting her off tomorrow.

48
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:23,750
- Oh, they're setting her off, are they?
- Have to change your pitch.

49
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,230
Bit of bad, Gold Cup Day.

50
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,808
This one's me, all right.

51
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:37,197
Think it'll go with my taffeta?
That check skirt I got up west?

52
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,592
Lovely. Three guineas, dear.

53
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,390
- Oh.
- Make it pounds. I'm easy.

54
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,748
Ta, Edie.
I've got three coupons somewhere.

55
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:48,290
- Four, dear. Same as Bond Street.
- Oh, go on, be a pal.

56
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,414
I want it for Miss Pimlico night
at the Palais.

57
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,641
Oh, that. Proper old fiddle. Always was.

58
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,915
OK, I'll put it by.

59
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,634
Oh, no.

60
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,828
Look, I tell you what.

61
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:03,066
Oh, all right.

62
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:07,250
- Well, and what have I been up to?
- Huh! Make me blush to guess.

63
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,278
Well, it's no good you settling down
for a mike. It's time I had a wet.

64
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,116
I've come here to save your life.
They're blowing up that bomb tomorrow.

65
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,870
- They're blowing it up?
- You'll have to take a walk.

66
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:19,141
I suppose they couldn't make it
early closing day.

67
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:22,778
- Wouldn't upset trade enough.
- You can't pick and choose with bombs.

68
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:32,312
- Governor in, Bert?
- If it's about the bomb, he knows.

69
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:37,221
- Bert! You going to be all night?
- Coming, Governor.

70
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:51,190
A trifling matter like that, sir, I...
I didn't want to bother Head Office.

71
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,502
Trifling?

72
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,266
We regard it as a serious matter

73
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:57,492
that a man in your position should make
these decisions without our authority.

74
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,610
Excuse me, sir.

75
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,724
Sorry, sir.

76
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,115
A sense of responsibility
is a very excellent thing, Wix.

77
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,149
We quite appreciate that.

78
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,261
But if we start giving a free hand
to the manager of a minor branch,

79
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,576
we'd find ourselves in Queer Street.

80
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,526
Head Office don't consider you a second
Montagu Norman yet, you know,

81
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,158
and they like to have some idea
of what's happening here.

82
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,501
Then Head Office had better know

83
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:43,627
that I and my staff intend knocking off
at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

84
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,013
Seems funny, Arthur, having
to come and tell you about a bomb.

85
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:51,292
You're telling me. Took a warden
to nose 'em out in the old days.

86
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,962
They aren't half making
a mess-up of this one.

87
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,281
He really misses
that old white helmet of his.

88
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,580
Good evening, ladies.
Now, what can I do for you?

89
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:04,060
Mum wants a mop.

90
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,332
What, another? She had one last week.

91
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,610
What did she do with that, eh?
Fetch your dad one over the ear with it?

92
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,642
Don't tease the child, Arthur.
Give her a mop.

93
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,030
- Hello! That's a new one, isn't it?
- Yes, he finished it last night.

94
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,984
Spent half the morning
getting the mess off the carpet.

95
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:25,765
It's an idea for that dump out there.
Give those kids somewhere decent to play.

96
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,673
They seem to be
doing pretty well <i>as</i> it is.

97
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,711
I'd have something to say
if I was their mother.

98
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:37,008
- Nice job you've got there.
- Something to pass the time.

99
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,497
Pass the time indeed!

100
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:41,928
Stayed up till two o'clock
to get it ready for the Council meeting.

101
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:47,084
It'll be quite simple to turn
the old water tank into a swimming pool.

102
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:51,195
I, er... l think we've discussed
this matter long enough, gentlemen.

103
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:55,065
Those in favour
of Mr Pemberton's, er... project.

104
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:04,036
Those in favour of selling
this piece of ground.

105
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,192
Well, that seems to settle it.

106
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:13,418
We've got to face economic facts,
Mr Pemberton.

107
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:16,531
This borough is in no position just now
to finance daydreams.

108
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,804
That's just plain ridiculous.

109
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,242
Don't you ever think of anything
besides pounds, shillings and pence?

110
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,080
Withdraw that remark!

111
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,791
If everybody is quite settled now,

112
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,298
I should like to read
the proposed advertisement.

113
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:36,092
"For sale, freehold. Valuable building
land in much sought-after position.

114
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,558
"Eminently suitable for business
premises or factory site.

115
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,954
"Heart of busy trading centre.
Unlimited prospects.

00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,983
"Full transport facilities to hand.

"Special appeal to purchaser of vision.

"No obstruction to future development.

119
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,729
"Thoroughly safe investment."

120
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,758
What have you been up to, you little devil?
Little devil, that's what you are.

121
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:11,840
Wasn't me. It was him.

122
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,879
I reckon it was about six to four
on him coming home in a sack.

123
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:22,215
- Came down on my funny bone.
- Went right up in the air, I did.

124
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,415
So will your father
when he hears about this.

125
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,955
All I can say is
some people are born lucky.

126
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,794
- Oh!
- Arthur!

127
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:37,866
- Dad, where are you?
- Where is he gone?

128
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,653
- Somebody do something!
- Hold on!

129
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,687
- Here's a rope!
- Mr Pemberton!

130
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,483
Mr Pemberton! Are you all right?

131
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,562
Are you all right, Mr Pemberton?

132
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,877
Oh, I'm having a grand time.

133
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,738
Arthur!

134
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,687
Don't worry, we're getting him up.

135
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,161
Right!

136
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,164
Heave!

137
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,921
Take it easy!

138
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,992
Stick to it, Dad! You'll make it!

139
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:11,232
Hold tight, dear.

140
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,183
You all right?

141
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,901
- Hey, what happened?
- Thank you, boys.

142
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,734
I'm all right. Don't worry, don't fuss.
I'm all right, I tell you.

143
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,044
- You have hurt yourself.
- No, I haven't.

144
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,643
- Just like old times, eh?
- Hello, Ted. Yeah, just like.

145
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:27,272
You turn up when it's all over.

146
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:30,020
Now, come on. Which of you was it?

147
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,860
Come on. Who was it?

148
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:36,846
- Which of you was it?
- Don't lie!

149
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:40,438
- It's always that kid of yours.
- He never touched that wheel.

150
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,197
- Steady, steady.
- Well, sit still, then.

151
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:44,909
" - Shirley!

152
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,584
OK, I'll go.

153
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:50,181
- That'll do, that'll do.
- No, it won't. Stay where you are.

154
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,936
Playing about like a schoolboy.

155
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,964
I don't know why you ever wanted
to go down the blessed hole.

156
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,599
I didn't want to go down the hole.
I fell down.

157
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,080
Well, you shouldn't have gone so close.

158
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,751
- Who was it?
- Frank with the ice.

159
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,746
- You didn't go to the door like that?
- Yes, of course.

160
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,579
It's the only sensible kind of thing
to wear in this kind of weather.

161
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:12,763
Downright indecent, I call it.
Whatever must that man have thought?

162
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,602
Exactly the same <i>as</i> all the other men
thought last year at Bournemouth.

163
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,348
- I thought I was seeing things again.
- Seeing things?

164
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:23,097
Yes, when all that stuff fell on my
head, I fancied I saw a kind of cave

165
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,980
with a load of treasure in it.

166
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,449
- Treasure?
- Yes, goblets, jewels, gold coins and...

167
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,284
Look out, look out.
It's all getting down my neck.

168
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:39,108
Did you say gold coins?

169
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:43,577
Oh, that's one of those kids
worked off a dud on you.

170
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,768
It is gold, isn't it?

171
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Come on. I'll fetch a ladder.
You grab a couple of torches.

172
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,182
Arthur, don't be daft. Come back. Shirley!
Arthur, your supper's just on ready!

173
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,209
Now, I wonder where that was.

174
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,544
Oi.

175
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,738
All right, all right. Come on, come on.

176
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,691
Shine the light here, will you?

177
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,314
Keep your light there.

178
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,612
There.

179
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:47,150
Cor! Someone's been
saving up for a rainy day.

180
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,298
Look at all this stuff.

181
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,095
- Look, there's a coat of arms.
- Look at this.

182
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,928
Must be hundreds of years old.

183
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:07,814
What's that?

184
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,364
Hm. They even had to fill up forms
in those days.

185
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,445
- Hell t
- Yes? o here!

186
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,836
What on earth are you playing at?

187
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,829
We've found some buried treasure
down here.

188
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,864
- What?
- Loads of it, worth a million!

189
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,823
Nip round to the police
and give them the wire!

190
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:26,490
We're going to find out all about
an old picture! Meet you in the library!

191
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,732
Yes, it's his
crest, right enough.

192
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:35,159
Yes, a shield of pretense
or a lion rampant gules.

193
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:36,434
Yes, just as I said.

194
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:40,301
Except that you called it a mangy
old poodle up on its hind legs.

195
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,054
- Well, if you want to split hairs.
-  I've told 'em!

196
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,603
Proper sensation! They've put two men
on guard over it. Found anything?

197
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:48,923
Plenty.
Do you know whose crest this is?

198
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,595
- No.
- The Duke of Burgundy.

199
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,317
- Who's he? Frenchman?
- This chap here.

200
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,112
Burgundy was a country on its own
in his day.

201
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:57,826
Well, what was he doing leaving his
stuff lying around in Miramont Place?

202
00:14:57,936 --> 00:15:01,968
Well, that's what we're trying to ferret out.
You can help. Here, take this.

203
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,767
Look up "Burgundy, Grand Duke of".

204
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,395
Miramont House.

205
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,307
- This sounds promising.
-  Mm.

206
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:16,983
"Destroyed by fire in 1490,
the property of Maurice de Charolais."

207
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,216
- He's got the right sort of name.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:22,563
Do you hear that, Frank?
If you find any mention of Maurice de...

209
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:25,761
Frank.

210
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,867
Really, Frank.

211
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,869
Oh, I'm sorry.

212
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,298
Butjust think of it.

213
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,371
A saltwater fish that can blow itself up
to three times its own size.

214
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:39,647
Don't you realise what this means?
It's history.

215
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,124
History, my foot. It's money!

216
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:52,658
Over this way a bit.

217
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,663
And what are your plans for the future,
Mr Pemberton'?

218
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,422
Oh, I don't know, maybe I'll retire,

219
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,769
sail around the world in my own yacht
with a cargo of beautiful girls.

220
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:15,481
Oh, hark at him!
Seasick on the Serpentine!

221
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,833
I suppose I'll get something out of it.
I'm not counting my chickens yet, though.

222
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,793
- Oh, well, thanks for the story.
- You're welcome.

223
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,863
Gosh. Smashing.

224
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,938
Yeah, it is. 17 and 9.

225
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,484
That's all right. Have you heard
the inquest is fixed for tomorrow?

226
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:30,846
Inquest? Who's dead?

227
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,486
There's always an inquest
on treasure trove.

228
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,514
The coroner has to sort out
the different claims.

229
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:37,477
Oh, that shouldn't take him long.
After all, I found the stuff.

230
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,582
But there was certain others
instrumental, wasn't there?

231
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,139
- You've got to take that into account.
- How do you mean?

232
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,088
Well, er... if Benny here
hadn't set that wheel rolling...

233
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:54,513
Now, don't you try and come it over me.
You set it off. I saw you.

234
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,787
- You weren't there.
- Call your own father a liar, would you?

235
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:01,734
- OK, OK, I did it.
- Good boy.

236
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,646
Come on, Charlie boy.

237
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:07,120
You can tell me.
Mum won't be cross.

238
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,550
- Don't want a sweet.
- You'll have a sweet and like it!

239
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,973
So, you admit quite frankly
that the explosion of the bomb

240
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,805
was solely due to this thoughtless
action of yours and yours alone?

241
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,001
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:26,553
Well, well!

243
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,677
After nine years
as coroner of this district,

244
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:32,022
I find this a new
and most refreshing experience.

245
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,980
I congratulate the parents of Pimlico

246
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,655
on such a fine crop
of exceptionally honest youngsters.

247
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:43,797
That seems to dispose of the evidence
as to the finding of this treasure.

248
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:47,431
There remains one further important duty
before the court.

249
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,583
We must now establish
to whom it belongs.

250
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,412
I understand that the old parchments
provide valuable evidence on this point.

251
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:57,207
We will now hear
the translation of that document

252
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,197
from Professor Hatton-Jones
of London University.

253
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:06,344
Oh, I'm so sorry.

254
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:12,209
I understand
that Professor Hatton-Jones

255
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:15,279
has successfully established
the original ownership of this treasure.

256
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,521
Yes, indeed.

257
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:19,077
It belongs to the Duchy of Burgundy,

258
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:22,186
being vested in the person
of the Duke Charles...

259
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,623
Who, I believe, died in 1477?

260
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:29,369
If we are to believe Basin,
Reiffenburg, Gollut and Schmel.

261
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,883
In fact, according
to all the major historians,

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,364
he was killed at the Battle of Nancy.

263
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,831
But with the aid
of this most exciting document,

264
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,508
I am now able to change
the course of history.

265
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,940
Would you mind explaining
your point more fully?

266
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,966
Picture a battlefield.

267
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,465
9,481 frozen corpses are all that
remains of Burgundy's pride.

268
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,861
The Duke himself lies slain among them.

269
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:04,252
This poor naked body,
robbed by harpies, bitten by wolves,

270
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:06,523
the visage battered beyond recognition,

271
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,879
this they accept as the last
earthly remains of Charles VII,

272
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,542
Duke of Burgundy,
last of the line of Charolais.

273
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:17,617
Do they judge correctly?

274
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,927
Is this indeed the cadaver
of Charles the Rash?

275
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,365
Ha-ha!

276
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:25,916
If so, then I am Joan of Arc.

277
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,353
I see.

278
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:33,504
Then it is your contention
that the historians were wrong,

279
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,418
that the Duke of Burgundy
escaped with his life?

280
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:39,045
Yes! Charles the Rash lives on.

281
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:42,357
With the missing portion
of the Burgundian treasure,

282
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,994
he has fled to an unknown refuge.

283
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:50,189
Unknown for 500 years,
but known at last today!

284
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,422
Miramont House, Pimlico!

285
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:02,836
Now, it has always been known

286
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,870
that Miramont House was occupied
by a Burgundian nobleman

287
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:07,987
styling himself
the Count Maurice de Charolais.

288
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:12,250
With the help of this document,
I now intend to prove

289
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,449
that Maurice de Charolais
and the Duke of Burgundy

290
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:15,805
were one and the same person.

291
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,910
For it is a Royal Charter
signed by King Edward IV,

292
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:23,469
making the Duke
not only a grant of Miramont House,

293
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:27,733
but decreeing that the entire estate
shall be recognised henceforth

294
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,290
as Burgundian soil.

295
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,653
Now, Edward IV
would never have made such a grant...

296
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,247
Er... excuse me, Professor.

297
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,601
Are you implying that this treasure
does not belong to the crown?

298
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:41,190
Oh, no, it belongs to the people
in the area covered by the old estate,

299
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,495
since this charter specifically
makes them natives of Burgundy.

300
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,334
Do you mean that these Londoners
are technically Burgundians?

301
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:52,803
Indubitably. This Royal Charter
has never been repealed.

302
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:54,798
It is as valid today

303
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,222
as on the day it was signed
by the founder of the House of York.

304
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:02,177
Blimey. I'm a foreigner.

305
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,973
It would be difficult to exaggerate

306
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:08,922
the enormous importance
of this document...

307
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,727
- Looks like a fine weekend.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,228
You'll be back.

309
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:41,601
Miramont Place. Now, come on,
step lively, all you aliens.

310
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:45,197
- Belgrave Road?
- No, lady, we're going to England.

311
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,812
I'm sorry, sir, I wasn't expecting you.

312
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:01,720
Wix, it seems that my last visit here
failed to make any impression on you.

313
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,796
Or am I mistaken?

314
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,746
Perhaps you did receive
Head Office sanction

315
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,347
to admit the press
to one of our strongrooms.

316
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:12,573
No, sir, but it...
it all happened so quickly, I...

317
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:15,173
You've answered my question.
That's enough.

318
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:17,887
I don't wish to pursue the matter.

319
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,958
I shall have to advise Head Office
to arrange for your transfer

320
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,390
to one of our country branches.

321
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,753
Transfer? Oh, no, sir.

322
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:26,304
L...l could never settle down
anywhere else.

323
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,334
This is my home.
I... I've lived here all my life.

324
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:30,413
I was born here.

325
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,287
In Burgundy.

326
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,362
You can't throw me out
of my own country.

327
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,909
Don't be absurd, man. If you seriously
think that an obscure part of the law...

328
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:41,752
Obscure or not, legally,
this is Burgundy.

329
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,542
Head Office no longer has
any jurisdiction over this bank.

330
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,088
This is my bank.

331
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:17,189
I reckon two pounds will cover this.

332
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,251
Hey, how many in your litter?
You need 40 ration books for that lot.

333
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,130
Ration books'? This is Burgundy.

334
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,765
Burgundy!

335
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,711
You still got that blouse?

336
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,865
- Fiddling coupons, then?
- Coupons? This is Burgundy.

337
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:42,004
Ah!

338
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,684
What do you want to queue for?
This is Burgundy!

339
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,380
Now, then, now then!
Five to two, Full Moon.

340
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,374
Now, come on. Who wants a bet? The oldest
firm in Burgundy. What's that, sir?

341
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:58,645
Yes, your export department.
This is Burgundy.

342
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,964
Burgundy! Burgundy!

343
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:04,312
Drink up, Mr Wix.
Where's your patriotism?

344
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,743
Sorry, but I've just been making
a rough estimate of our national assets.

345
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:11,578
Crowns and ducats
to the value of£18,200.

346
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,774
Pitchers, goblets and ewers
to the value of...

347
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:17,049
- What's ewers?
- Mine's a pint.

348
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,882
That's very good.

349
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:20,282
Anyway, I estimate the total

350
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,637
to be somewhere
in the neighbourhood of£100,000.

351
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,993
Cor, that's about 1,000 nicker apiece,
ain't it?

352
00:24:25,102 --> 00:24:27,979
- I'll send Charlie to Eton.
- I'm gonna have a saltwater aquarium.

353
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:29,217
Just a minute.

354
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:32,449
I doubt whether individual claims can be
made to treasure vested in a community.

355
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:34,047
Oh, I knew there'd be a catch in it.

356
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,318
Whatever happens to the treasure,
that piece of land is ours.

357
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,874
I think I know what's coming.

358
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:40,433
Well, why not?
It's part of Burgundy now.

359
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:43,063
About time we gave the kids a break.
We can have a go tomorrow.

360
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,025
Let's turn the old static water tank
into a swimming pool, for a start.

361
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,452
Hear, hear!

362
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,841
- Here's to the Burgundy Lido!
- Hear, hear!

363
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,118
All very laudable, no doubt,
but where are your returns?

364
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,837
The real benefit to the community

365
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,347
would be some scheme
for stimulating local trade

366
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,665
- and launching new enterprises.
- That's what I say.

367
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,261
Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.

368
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,689
Here, what do you mean, time?
Where do you think we are, in England?

369
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:09,885
No licensing laws here, my lad.
Isn't that so, Mr Garland?

370
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,602
Yeah, that's right.
We close when I say.

371
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,433
Not even a music license?

372
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:17,671
You heard what the gentleman said.

373
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:35,026
- He's better than Hutch.
- Much.

374
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,987
Oh, Mr Hu...

375
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:16,565
- How about a breath of fresh air?
- I think it's a bit too hot for walking.

376
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>I</i> I don't want to set the world

00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:47,695
Not bad, that boy of yours.
He'd be worth 20 quid a week to you.

382
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:49,937
- Yeah, I'll put him up a dollar.
- Hark at him.

383
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:53,762
A dollar rise for the poor little perisher.
Skin a maggot, you would.

384
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:56,917
- You keep a civil tongue in your head!
- Now, then! Now, then, now, then!

385
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,070
- What's going on here?
- Nothing you can do about it, cock!

386
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,548
That's right. You've said it right.

387
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,818
You're in a foreign country now, Ted.
Drink when you like.

388
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,842
Right. Mine's a pint.

389
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:18,829
Spiller!

390
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,576
Clear this place.
Go home, all you people.

391
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,931
You're suspended from duty.

392
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,157
Right, I'll have another pint.

393
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:33,556
I'm going to take proceedings
against you, Mr Garland.

394
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,986
Your identity card, please.

395
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:43,812
Passing of betting slips
strictly prohibited.

396
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,071
Come to think of it,
I shan't need this any more either.

397
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,543
That's the stuff. Scrap 'em all.

398
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,295
Stop it! Stop it, you idiots!

399
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:58,418
Mr Wix, you're a responsible man.
Can't you do something?

400
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:00,249
Certainly.

401
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:04,435
- This is a job for Scotland Yard.
- Whitehall 1212.

 'The Minister's out of town.'

405
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:15,533
'Hello?'
 'Pimlico.'

406
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:17,869
'Put this call through
to the Home Office, please.'

407
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:19,045
'Yes, Pimlico.'
 'No, Burgundy.'

408
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,361
'Pimlico.'
 'Clear the line. Priority call.'

409
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,590
Back again, sir?

410
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,200
Mr Straker of the Foreign Office.

411
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:44,185
- Have you been here all night?
- Hm.

412
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,743
- What's this Pimlico stuff?
- Top priority.

413
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:50,016
- The old man wants immediate action.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

414
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,448
Well, I thought that as the treasure
was originally spoils of battle,

415
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:55,515
- I'd pass it on to the War Office.
- Oh, they wouldn't touch it.

416
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:59,909
You see, technically,
these Burgundians are aliens.

417
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,467
Aliens? Well, then, it's your pigeon.

418
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:05,183
No, no, they're undesirable aliens
so it's your pigeon.

419
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,091
I suppose you'll have to boot them
out of the country.

420
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,573
Yes, but it's their own country.

421
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,780
- There's your ten, Dad.
- All right.

422
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:36,232
Black market eggs!
Black market butter!

423
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,258
Lovely black market butter!

424
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:43,170
Come on, ladies!
Give the old man a treat! It's lovely!

425
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:46,401
All the grub you want
for a pre-war breakfast!

426
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:50,475
Nylons! Genuine stolen nylons!

427
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,224
Guinea a pair! Fully fashioned!

428
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:56,218
Get these lovely nylons!

429
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,772
Come on, ladies!

430
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,152
Turn it up! I'm coming!

431
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:13,256
- Good morning, Mrs Randall.
- You gone barmy? It's Sunday.

432
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,731
Special delivery.
Two dozen boxes export silks.

433
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,569
That's right. Come on, let's have 'em.

434
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:28,624
Black market bacon!
Off the ration!

435
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,338
Hey, off the ration! Black market bacon!
Come and get your bacon!

436
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,734
- Mind your back, Ma.
- Hey, no parking here!

437
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:54,489
Who says so?

438
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,561
- Hi, you, get moving.
- Get out of it.

439
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,116
- Oh, it's like that, is it?
- Go on, you silly old slob.

440
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:02,149
- Hawker's license.
- You want to make something of it?

441
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:04,300
- Go on, sock him one, Harry.
- We'll see about that.

442
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,182
It's no use, Ted.
They've all read the papers.

443
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:07,851
Here comes Mr Pemberton.

444
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:14,359
Go on, get out of it!
We're gonna start digging here.

445
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,495
What's going on?

446
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:29,362
Looks to me like the annual outing
from Dartmoor.

447
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:31,854
Ah, don't worry. I'm seeing to it.
Just going to ring the nick.

448
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,254
- Ah, the Chief Constable of Burgundy.
- Sir, about last night...

449
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:42,138
You'd better get yourself a new uniform.

450
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:44,407
This area is out of bounds
to the Metropolitan Police.

451
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:46,649
- What?
- Yes, Mr Pemberton.

452
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,594
Home Office has just confirmed what
you were all shouting about last night.

453
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:51,430
It was a bit of nonsense.
We'd all had a few.

454
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:53,389
Yes, and Whitehall's got the headache.

455
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:55,465
And until they can decide
which department is responsible,

456
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:57,223
our orders are to keep out of Burgundy.

457
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,819
And in the meantime, I suppose, nobody
cares if we all get our throats cut?

458
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,410
I'm sorry,
I'm just telling you the position.

459
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,963
Oh, we're not having that.

460
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:06,078
We've all paid our rates.
We're entitled to police protection.

461
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,385
Gregg. Who?

462
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,580
Pemberton of Pimlico.

463
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:17,975
No, sir, no. Nobody can help you
unless you have delegatory powers.

464
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,331
Delegatory powers? H m -

465
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:24,157
All right. But in plain English, I'm
speaking for all of us who live here.

466
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:27,029
But, my dear sir,
from the Home Office point of view,

467
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,184
you remain an anomalous
collection of individuals

468
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,145
unless you form
a representative committee.

469
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,259
What? Oh, yes.

470
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:38,727
Oh, certainly. Oh, then... then
it's a matter for the Foreign Office.

471
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:45,148
They won't talk to us till we form
a representative committee.

472
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,859
All right, let's call a general meeting
and elect one right away.

473
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,414
<i>Ho“.!</i>

474
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:17,032
45 shillings. I'll take two pounds
if you can do with it.

475
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:20,102
Over there. Two pounds for
the eiderdown. Ladies and gentlemen.

476
00:33:20,222 --> 00:33:23,502
Mr Wix. We're having a meeting.

477
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:48,126
Shut up.

478
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,122
Me on the committee?

479
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,434
I said they might want to elect you.
Who knows?

480
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,271
Edie Randall, MP for Burgundy.

481
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,774
They're all jelly!
All jelly! Jellied eels!

482
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:02,969
Two bob and pick where you like!
Lovely lot of jellied eels!

483
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,567
Jellied eels, they're champion!

484
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,683
Thank you, sir.

485
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,276
- Oi, manners, you!
- These ain't Danish eels.

486
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:13,143
- What, do you think I'd cheat the public?
- I know an Irish eel when I see it.

487
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,700
OK, have me arrested.

488
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:18,853
All right, laugh while you can. We'll
soon have you twisters out of here.

489
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:20,764
Yeah? What with? Your air force?

490
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,436
Fancy! Start a new country
when they don't know how to protect it.

491
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:47,500
'Reports that

497
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,536
10, 11...
Hey, one's enough there, Pop.

498
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,654
12,13,14,

499
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:13,606
15,16,17...

500
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,792
- I think you're in, Lady Astor!
- ...18, 19, 20,

501
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:19,429
<i>21, 22, 23, 24,</i>

502
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:22,619
- 25,26-
- Right.

503
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:25,299
That settles it.

504
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:28,093
Mrs Randall, Mr Spiller and yours truly.

505
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,552
Now I'd better ring up Whitehall
right away.

506
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,828
What's that? What's going on?

507
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:39,669
They're gonna sell out,
gonna give the place back to England.

508
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,264
Mr Pemberton, just a minute.

509
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,814
If you hand Burgundy back,
they'll claim our treasure with it.

510
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:46,453
Oh, we can come to terms about that.

511
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,525
The important thing
is to get law and order here.

512
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,235
Can't have the place turned into a spiv's paradise.
Hello, Mr Straker, please.

513
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,347
What about us business people?
This is our big chance, ain't it?

514
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:57,904
- Hear, hear!
- I'm in business too, aren't I?

515
00:35:58,016 --> 00:36:00,653
That doesn't mean I want
to be murdered in my bed.

516
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:04,527
Shh. Shh, quiet!

517
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:08,913
Hello? Er... Mr Straker?
My name is Arthur Pemberton.

518
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,153
L...I'd like to report that

519
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,069
we have now a formed a representative
committee of the people of Burgundy.

520
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,383
I see.

521
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:18,340
Yes. Oh, yes, yes,
I am in touch with Mr Gregg.

522
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,806
But a rather abstruse
constitutional issue has now arisen,

523
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:24,722
and I'm afraid we shall have to pass
it on to the Law Offices Department.

524
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:29,553
Now, see here, sir. For all we know, that
might take weeks. All right, months.

525
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:32,028
Hello? Hello?

526
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:34,218
Ah, can you beat that?

527
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,174
First of all, they say
we must have a committee.

528
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:38,206
Now they say it can only be
officially recognised

529
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:41,800
if appointed in accordance with
the electoral laws of ancient Burgundy.

530
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,953
Well, that seems to settle things.

531
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,315
Unless, of course, somebody present
happens to be familiar

532
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:48,342
with the electoral laws
of ancient Burgundy.

533
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,217
But certainly.

534
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,817
It was the custom
for the Duke of Burgundy himself

535
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:56,247
to elect a council of two sheriffs,
one burgess,

536
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,127
and one hoof man
or captain of the guard.

537
00:36:58,237 --> 00:36:59,479
Who might you be?

538
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,599
My name is Sebastien de Charolais,

539
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,986
and I come from Dijon,
capital of ancient Burgundy.

540
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,459
Mm. Only the Duke himself
can appoint a council,

541
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,101
and <i>as</i> there is no such person...

542
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:13,887
Oh, but you're wrong. There is
such person. I am the Duke of Burgundy.

543
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,439
No!

544
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:19,077
I am the direct descendant of Maurice
de Charolais, who came here in 1477.

545
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:23,667
Therefore I am the heir to the title.
I hope you don't mind.

546
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:28,094
Oh, no, no. I mean, well... l mean,
well, it's a bit of a turn-up, isn't it?

547
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:32,643
Here is my evidence. These documents
have been in my family for centuries.

548
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:37,268
I have always thought they were
of no value, just an amusing curiosity.

549
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:40,426
But when I read about your discovery,
I said to myself...

550
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:44,376
Yes, I bet you did.

551
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:48,251
Hm. Of course,
you want them to be examined.

552
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:50,126
Oh, indubitably.

553
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:57,825
Hello, Pemberton's?

554
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,901
Oh, yes.

555
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:04,405
What, can't he eat anything? Oh, poor
little fellow. Must be this heat.

556
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:07,008
Yes, all right.
I'll have something for him.

557
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:10,234
Send him round the back door, will you?
Thank you. Goodbye.

558
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,995
Mrs Wilson.

559
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:13,863
Sorry, folks.

560
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,584
Well, there seems
nothing more to be done

561
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,461
until this gentleman's claims
are investigated.

562
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:19,618
So, all we can do
is to adjourn the meeting.

563
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:21,974
- Hear, hear!
-  Hear, hear!

564
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:29,071
- I am afraid I am a great nuisance.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

565
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:32,543
- You may be the very man we want.
- I hope so.

566
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,697
<i>Au revoir, madame.</i>

567
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,097
<i>Au revoir.</i>

568
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,401
Mademoiselle, it occurs to me that I ought
to know something about my dukedom.

569
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,277
Would you care to show me
a little of this new Burgundy?

570
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:45,311
Well, I could do
with a breath of fresh air.

571
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:47,630
Alors, we go.

572
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,509
So gay and exciting.

573
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,464
So different
from our dreary French towns.

574
00:38:53,290 --> 00:39:00,439
J I just want to start
a little flame in your heart

575
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:08,306
<i>J</i> In my heart I have but one desire...

576
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,928
Professor Hatton-Jones?

577
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:17,159
Oh. Yes, it is, very urgent.

578
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:19,995
When?

579
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:23,064
Oh.

580
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:25,699
No, all right.
I'll ring again in the morning.

581
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,209
'Today,
after reading in the Sunday papers,

582
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,716
'that the laws of the United Kingdom
cannot be held to operate in Burgundy,

583
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:36,033

00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:40,303

00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:43,658

586

'to apply sterner measures forthwith.'

595
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,238
Talk, talk, talk!

596
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:12,717
Why can't they do something?

597
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:34,141
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you. Pour it in, please.

598
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:36,937
You know, your England
is a most remarkable nation.

599
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,244
Everywhere else, governments
command, scream, shout,

600
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:43,718
but here it just has to ask people
politely to stay away and they do.

601
00:40:57,842 --> 00:40:59,564
Ha-ha-ha!

602
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:02,751
I still say a remarkable nation.

603
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,868
Entrez.

604
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:07,984
Come in!

605
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,213
Good morning, sir.
I hope you'll pardon us for...

606
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:13,767
I am the culprit.

607
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:16,609
This is Professor Hatton-Jones
of the London University.

608
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:21,393
The moment our good friend told me
the news, I was Arion, I was Zephyrus!

609
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:24,188
Nothing could detain me
from instant communion

610
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,862
with the living survivor
of the House of Charolais!

611
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:29,133
Er... you have examined my documents?

612
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:31,255
Oh, a cursory glance.

613
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:35,396
Personally, I have no doubt at all
as to the question of your lineage.

614
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:37,117
Forgive me, are you a bleeder?

615
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:40,827
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you suffer from haemophilia?

616
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:45,540
When you cut yourself,
do you bleed interminably?

617
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,648
- No, I don't think so.
- Ah, a pity.

618
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:51,206
It's in the family.
Definitely in the family.

619
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:53,083
Oh, I am very sorry.

620
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:56,067
- I don't want to hurry you, Professor, but...
- Oh, quite, quite! Ha-ha-ha!

621
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,263
I mustn't embark on family matters
or I'll be here all day.

622
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:01,744
I have to take these off
for a sulphate reaction test.

623
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,859
I'll soon be back, though.
Depend on that.

624
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:08,448
Now that I know you're truly extant,
I go away satisfied.

625
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,955
Ha-ha! What Gollut would give
to be in my shoes!

626
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:14,472
Ha! I could even put
Schmel in the shade!

627
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:22,855
How long is this chemical test
going to take?

628
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:26,441
- That's contingent on certain factors.
- Please hurry it up.

629
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:29,117
If things go on like this much longer...

630
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:32,588
What's happened now?
They're packing up.

631
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:35,426
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

632
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,186
You'll have to take
your place in the queue, madam.

633
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,640
What's the idea holding us up like this?
I got my dinner to cook.

634
00:42:57,684 --> 00:42:59,569
Ah, look at that.

635
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,357
- Action at last.
- Yes.

636
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,437
That'll keep the spivs out.

637
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,348
Oh, er... Mr Pemberton.

638
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,831
- Ah.
- Mr Pemberton.

639
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,185
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

640
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,772
This is Mr Bagshawe of the, er...
Board of Customs & Excise.

641
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:15,420
He'd like to have a
word with you people.

642
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:18,167
There are just a few things
I would like to explain.

643
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,761
- If I might step over your frontier.
- By all means.

644
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,790
I must congratulate you
on the speed with which you have...

645
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:27,064
Oh, excuse me, Professor. This looks
like the solution to all our troubles.

646
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:29,094
This way.

647
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:32,654
In the line, please, madam.

648
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:41,704
Have you anything to declare, madam?

649
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:44,383
Any food stuff, livestock,
linen or cotton goods?

650
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:48,135
I hardly think this is likely to include
the credentials of the Duke of Burgundy.

651
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:51,887
Would you mind
opening that case, madam?

652
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:56,837
This really is a big relief to us, I can tell you.
It's a very very clever bit of...

653
00:43:56,947 --> 00:44:00,619
- No, no, I think you're wrong.
- What's all that in aid of?

654
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:05,751
- But we tore 'em up, I tell you!
- You let him have it, Dad!

655
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:07,492
That's where we live, right there.

656
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:10,163
It's merely part
of the Customs procedure.

657
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:12,554
We naturally have to enforce
the immigration laws.

658
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,676
You can't have the one
without the other.

659
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,703
Yes, but...

660
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,014
Frederick Albert Cowan Esquire. That's
me. Number four, Miramont Gardens.

661
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:21,299
I am sorry, sir.

662
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,091
The order specifies
that identity cards must be produced

663
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,243
by residents who wish
to re-enter the street.

664
00:44:27,356 --> 00:44:29,514
Do you mean to say that
all of us who live in this street

665
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:32,508
have got to go through that rigmarole
every time we want to leave our homes?

666
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:34,509
Oh, for a month or two.

667
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,228
After all,
pending a new Act of Parliament,

668
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,054
this is technically foreign territory.

669
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,730
Ha-ha-ha! Foreign territory!

670
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:40,894
I suppose that means

671
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:42,563
British subjects won't be allowed
to spend any money here.

672
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:43,792
What about all our customers?

673
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:45,118
You can't stop us earning
an honest living.

674
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:46,960
I've never heard
such a lot of rot in my life.

675
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,509
Don't blame me, ladies and gentlemen.

676
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:51,188
Edward lV's the one
who made you foreigners.

677
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:52,379
Here we go again!

678
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,416
- You people make me tired.
- Order, order!

679
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:56,735
Oh, shut up. Did you ever
hear such tripe in your life?

680
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:58,527
- Now look here, sir!
- And you shut up too.

681
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:02,436
All right, if that's the way Whitehall
want it, in future, we'll be foreigners.

682
00:45:02,555 --> 00:45:03,874
That's the stuff, Dad.

683
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,348
We'll fight them in the tramlines,
we'll fight them in the local.

684
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:33,008
Good evening, Professor.

685
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:34,530
Oh, good evening.

686
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:37,714
Your friends in Miramont Place
have got themselves into a nice mess.

687
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:41,266
Poor souls.
The innocent victims of destiny.

688
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:42,704
They started all this nonsense.

689
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,261
Now they've got to put up
with the consequences.

690
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:48,530
Ah, but will they?
The Burgundians are a fighting people.

691
00:45:48,648 --> 00:45:51,090
Consider what they did
against the might of Louis XI.

692
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:54,199
I fail to see what this little mob
can do against the might of Britain.

693
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:59,188
Oh! Get up, please.

694
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:02,104
All passports. Passports ready, please.

695
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,939
All hand luggage open, please.

696
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,297
Time to make
your currency declarations, please.

697
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:07,933
What the devil does this mean?

698
00:46:08,043 --> 00:46:09,961
The train is now
at the Burgundian frontier.

699
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:12,236
A fighting people, Mr Bassett.

700
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,906
Worthy successors
of the Knights of the Golden Fleece.

701
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,627
Have you anything to declare, madam?

702
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,106
Any food stuff, livestock,
linen or cotton goods?

703
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:21,217
No.

704
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:23,055
Any muskrats,
mealworms, motorcycles,

705
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:25,533
hashish, prepared opium
or agricultural machinery?

706
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:27,081
Oh!

707
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,912
Have you any foreign currency?
English pounds? Traveller's cheques?

708
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:37,336
- Suppose I have?
- I just wondered.

709
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:42,255
No passage beyond this point
without passports. All passports.

710
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:44,281
- Here is mine.
- Hm?

711
00:46:46,714 --> 00:46:49,111
What is it you... you... Baratooshe,

712
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:50,906
er... Baratooshe,

713
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:54,260
er... Baratooshe... United Kingdom!

714
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,067
England, United Kingdom!

715
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:16,526
All hand luggage ready for inspection,
please. Anything to declare?

716
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:19,521
Anything to declare, sir? Any livestock,
foodstuff, linen or cotton goods?

717
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,196
Rather!

718
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:33,689
Come along.
Come along, please.

719
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:37,477
All ready with your passports.
Get your passports out.

720
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:40,037
So reminds me of the time
I visited the catacombs.

721
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,188
Mr Pemberton, this is preposterous.

722
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:43,831
Sorry, Mr Bassett.
We're a foreign country now.

723
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:46,382
We can't allow tourists
without the usual formalities.

724
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:47,695
Come along, sir, please.

725
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:49,894
- Pass down the track.
- The Duke!

726
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:53,646
- Oh, madam, is it proved?
- Beyond a title of a doubt.

727
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:56,832
Yes, gentlemen, you see before you
the 18th Duke of Burgundy.

728
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:59,315
Your liege lord, your sovereign!

729
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:09,368
Floreat Burgundia!

730
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:12,643
Stop that train!

731
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:56,416
What are we going to tell the old man?

732
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,015
Well, after this underground business,

733
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:00,886
I doubt if he will give us
a chance to open our mouths.

734
00:49:01,002 --> 00:49:02,767
Soap.

735
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:05,637
Were you issued with this?

736
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:07,474
No, I pinched it
from the French Embassy.

737
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:09,352
Oh. Ha-ha.

738
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:13,060
This situation, though,
it's an absolute deadlock.

739
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:14,777
Oh, no, not quite.

740
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,964
Now that this Duke
has been officially recognised,

741
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,642
we can at least talk to them.

742
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:21,362
- Towel?
- The time for talk's past.

743
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:24,036
Any more talk and we've had it.
We've got to do something.

744
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:25,675
We've got to tell this Duke
where he gets off.

745
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:28,585
Oh, well, I hope the old man
won't put me on to it.

746
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:31,695
After all, this fellow's been made
a sort of king in a way.

747
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:34,928
Yes. Probably having his coronation
at this very moment.

748
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:39,402
Well, why don't you loosen your tie,
Your Grace?

749
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:43,513
- I thought you'd be used to the heat.
- Well, it's never <i>as</i> bad <i>as</i> that in Dijon.

750
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:46,424
All the same, I bet you'd rather
be there than couped up here.

751
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:49,021
Why do you think it
so much nicer than Pimlico?

752
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,689
I imagine it's a little more romantic.

753
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:57,761
Oh, do you? What do you think
we would be doing in Dijon this evening?

754
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:01,233
Well, we... we'd eat in the open

755
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:05,418
and dance in the main square
under the trees.

756
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,416
Then maybe we'd go for a little walk

757
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:13,599
up one of those funny old
cobbled streets to the castle

758
00:50:14,632 --> 00:50:17,945
and when we reach the orange grove...

759
00:50:18,064 --> 00:50:21,258
we'd sit beneath the castle wall

760
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:24,339
and watch the dawn come up.

761
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:28,165
And, er...
in the cool morning breeze,

762
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,757
maybe I would put my coat
around your shoulders

763
00:50:31,872 --> 00:50:33,833
and...

764
00:50:38,616 --> 00:50:40,219
<i>Hm.</i>

765
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,367
Well, anyway,
I'm afraid Dijon is not a bit like that.

766
00:50:44,483 --> 00:50:47,599
We cannot dance in the main square because
of the trams which run all night,

767
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,832
and, er... we cannot grow oranges
because it's too cold,

768
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:54,544
and, er... where the castle was,
well, today there is a cement factory.

769
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,544
Then it's just about <i>as</i> romantic
as Camden Town.

770
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,139
Ah, but the people,
they make it different.

771
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:03,249
You should see us at the vendange,
the, er... the wine harvest,

772
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,364
when all over the country,
the peasants celebrate.

773
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:10,269
And they are gay,
not... not drunk but very, very gay.

774
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:13,980
And, er... well, I suppose
we would walk in the moonlight,

775
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,100
through the sloping vineyards,

776
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:21,168
and we would come to an old Roman
ruin called the Temple d'Amour,

777
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,839
- Hm?
- The Temple of Love.

778
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:28,709
I see. And there the walk ends
and I succumb to your gallant charm.

779
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,373
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Because my
intentions, they are most honourable.

780
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:38,289
I would talk to you about my job
at the hotel, my income, my prospects,

781
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:41,711
- No funny business at all?
- Absolutely none.

782
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:44,586
- No'?
- No.

783
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,605
Let's go in.

784
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:05,575
Hi, you two! Hullo there!

785
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:09,051
- What is it, Dad?
- Gentleman here to see the Duke!

786
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,573
Oh.

787
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:12,847
Well, I'm really glad.

788
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,562
Course, I always knew you people would
have to recognise us sooner or later.

789
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:18,036
- Ah, here is the Duke.
- Ah, Your Excellency.

790
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:20,467
Allow me to present my credentials.

791
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:25,692
But I'm not the ruler now.
No, they've asked me to form a cabinet.

792
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,848
- <i>Oh, long live democracy!</i>
- <i>Vive l'Angleterre!</i>

793
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,565
<i>- Vive la France!
- What next'?</i>

794
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:35,347
Well, you will understand that after
today's incident on the underground,

795
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:38,386
His Majesty's Government
does not feel inclined to negotiate

796
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:39,495
with a pistol at its head.

797
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:42,093
Now that we've come down to <i>brass</i>
tacks, I can guarantee there'll be no...

798
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,927
His Majesty's Government has a traditional
dislike of unilateral guarantees.

799
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,799
It has therefore felt itself compelled,
most reluctantly,

800
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,073
to close the frontier
as from 10AM tomorrow.

801
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,074
- Close the frontier?
- What about us?

802
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:55,985
A church hall has been equipped
for the evacuation of all those who...

803
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:57,297
- Church hall?
- Evacuation?

804
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:58,777
What about our treasure?

805
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:02,127
Well, for the time being, that can be
moved to the Bank of England.

806
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:05,088
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not moving anyway.

807
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:06,200
I beg your pardon?

808
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:08,231
If the Nazis couldn't
drive me out of my home

809
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:10,550
with all their bombs
and rockets and doodlebugs,

810
00:53:10,664 --> 00:53:12,146
you don't catch me packing up now!

811
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,386
Hear, hear!

812
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:17,132
I trust you realise that
the alternative is complete isolation?

813
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:18,295
Power politics, eh?

814
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:20,531
I have merely explained the position.
I cannot do more.

815
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,647
I do hope that moderation will prevail.

816
00:53:22,756 --> 00:53:24,837
Moderation? He's an optimist.

817
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,709
You're barmy, the lot of you.
We've had a good run and this is it.

818
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:30,222
That's OK, Jim. If you want to turn
it in, nobody is going to stop you.

819
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:31,795
But we're not going to stand for that.

820
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:34,133
You can't push English people around
like sacks of potatoes.

821
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:35,536
English?

822
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,141
Don't you come that stuff, Jim Garland.

823
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:39,680
We always were English
and we always will be English.

824
00:53:39,797 --> 00:53:41,039
And it's just because we are English

825
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:43,595
that we're sticking out
for our right to be Burgundians.

826
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,072

You're not going to do your pools now.

- You're drunk. Drunk in charge!

Quite right, officer. I'll come quietly.

969
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:28,781
No, I don't want to be too hard on you.
Be more careful in future.

01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:06,371
Molly tried to wash her hands
when... when there was no water.

turn the water on again.

It's no use crying over spilt milk.

991
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,958
Smith's Crisps!

992
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:50,309
Four tins, that's all that's left.

993
01:07:50,426 --> 01:07:53,184
Everything else has had it.

994
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,861
I reckon we've all had it this time.

995
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:08,067
Well, we can't let them starve to death.

996
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,908
We can't not let them starve to death.

997
01:08:11,018 --> 01:08:13,503
I wish we could pass it on to UNO.

998
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:18,085
Well, why not?

999
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,075
Maudie, can you get me a line
to Lake Success?

1000
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,348
Yes, Success.

1001
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:33,727
Hello?
Yes, sir? What, Burgundy?

1002
01:08:33,845 --> 01:08:35,927
Oh, Burgundy!

1003
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,361
Really'? Yes, of course, sir.

1004
01:08:38,474 --> 01:08:41,591
We can have a coach standing by
for them. Yes, right you are, sir.

1005
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:44,627
I say, they've had enough of it.
They're ready to pack it up.

1006
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,102
- Statement in the press?
- Rather.

1007
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:47,982
Fleet Street should do us proud on this.

1008
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:17,953
Jolly rotten shame, that's what I say.

1009
01:09:18,063 --> 01:09:20,221
Yeah, starving people out.

1010
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:24,054
Oi, come and have a look at this!

1011
01:09:56,933 --> 01:09:59,330
Five minutes to go.

1012
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,161
- How do we go?
- By the same coach as the kids.

1013
01:10:05,273 --> 01:10:07,158
- Oh.
- That's that.

1014
01:10:10,222 --> 01:10:14,101
Now I know
what Napoleon felt like before Waterloo.

1015
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:16,850
- After, Dad.
-  Mum!

1016
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:18,492
- Hey, Dad!
-  Here you are, Mum.

1017
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:20,880
- Dad!
- Here you are, Mum!

1018
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:31,304
Give us another one,
there's a good boy.

1019
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:34,649
Come on, Benny. Come on, my lad.

1020
01:10:34,765 --> 01:10:38,557
- Ah, what do you think of that?
- Been a good boy? Had a nice time?

1021
01:10:38,676 --> 01:10:42,076
Here you are, Mum, catch!
Here you are!

1022
01:10:42,188 --> 01:10:43,866
- I would have fetched more for you.
- Haven't got any more.

1023
01:10:43,984 --> 01:10:46,513
Pity I didn't have more money,
else I would have got you some more.

1024
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,570
- I haven't got no more.
- I'm sorry I haven't got no more, Mum.

1025
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,052
- No more?
- No, I haven't got no more money.

1026
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:54,764
Mummy, here. Guess what'?
I saw you on a newsreel the other day.

1027
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:57,156
You didn't half look good.

1028
01:11:05,134 --> 01:11:07,619
Oh, go on, Dad. Let me feed them too.

1029
01:11:07,729 --> 01:11:10,050
- Oh, go on. Go on, Dad, let me.
- All right, then, go on.

1030
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:12,080
Here, that's our lunch!

1031
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:37,901
<i>Ho“.!</i>

1032
01:11:48,594 --> 01:11:50,555
I'll ring the station.

1033
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:53,470
Oranges! Nice sweet oranges!

1034
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,586
Oranges!

1035
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,694
Come on, give us a chance!

1036
01:12:02,801 --> 01:12:05,438
There they are, Pemberton.

1037
01:12:12,818 --> 01:12:14,496
- Who cares now?
- That's right.

1038
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:17,098
Tell them what they can do
with their hearse.

1039
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,763
- Mr Pemberton.
- Hello, Mr Straker.

1040
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:25,638
- Your party ready?
- Well, I don't know.

1041
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:28,145
Er... things have changed a bit,
haven't they?

1042
01:12:28,262 --> 01:12:29,744
Don't say our journey
is entirely fruitless.

1043
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,813
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
We're always open to talk-.

1044
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,059
But we expected this to be
unconditional surrender.

1045
01:12:34,169 --> 01:12:36,086
We... we have no powers to negotiate.

1046
01:12:36,204 --> 01:12:38,449
Well, sir, I suggest
you come back when you have.

1047
01:12:41,951 --> 01:12:45,863
- This is where we came in.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.

1048
01:12:45,981 --> 01:12:48,782
This bit of food
won't last them more than a day.

1049
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:35,267
I say no appeasement!

1050
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:51,512
Britain can't buy gold.

1051
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:53,035
Well, that's not
Burgundy's fault, is it?

1052
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:54,824
Well, if you're not prepared
to meet us even halfway...

1053
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:57,023
We are, buy half the gold.

1054
01:15:02,185 --> 01:15:04,909
Ah, my old beauty!
Up the Express Dairy!

1055
01:15:05,019 --> 01:15:06,306
Milko! Milko!

1056
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:09,140
There she is, the old cow!
Right on time!

1057
01:15:09,249 --> 01:15:12,202
Bang on time! That's the old girl!

1058
01:15:12,322 --> 01:15:17,237
Come on, my little lady!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

1059
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:19,312
OK?

1060
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:23,245
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I have the solution.

1061
01:16:23,357 --> 01:16:25,678
I propose that we lend
the capital of our treasure

1062
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:27,133
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

1063
01:16:27,188 --> 01:16:30,501
while the interest is used for the
benefit of the Borough of Pimlico.

1064
01:16:30,621 --> 01:16:33,618
- A Burgundian loan to Britain.
- Ah.

1065
01:16:33,734 --> 01:16:35,815
My dear sir! My very dear sir!

1066
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:38,129
A second Montagu Norman!

1067
01:16:54,925 --> 01:16:57,965
Careful, my man!
You will tear it.

1068
01:16:58,077 --> 01:17:00,954
This was the standard
presented to the Duke Charles

1069
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,551
by the 14 burgers of Bruges.

1070
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:07,821
I have assured the museum authorities
it shall be returned undamaged.

1071
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:15,120
Real Burgundy!

1072
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:18,877
You see this vineyard?
It's ten minutes from where we live.

1073
01:17:20,186 --> 01:17:22,583
When you come to Dijon,
I'll take you there.

1074
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:32,678
Mr Huggins! It's sort of nice
being back at the old shop, isn't it?

1075
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:37,592
- Is it?
- Yes.

1076
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:41,027
I'd almost forgotten what it feels like,
handling a lobster.

1077
01:17:41,138 --> 01:17:43,099
Remember one day you said
you'd like to go to Billingsgate?

1078
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:45,054
Yes?

1079
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:47,533
Take you there tomorrow.

1080
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:49,407
Oh, Mr Huggins.

1081
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:09,957
I never thought anybody would be
pleased to see these things again.

1082
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:13,264
You never know when you're well off
till you aren't.

1083
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,976
Are you nearly ready?

1084
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,531
Yes, shan't be long! Just about!

1085
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:27,915
They're here!

1086
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:34,816
Do you think we shall get
more than two main dishes?

1087
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:39,324
I hope so. Haven't had a decent feed
since that last deadlock in Moscow.

1088
01:18:39,443 --> 01:18:42,995
And in these last few seconds
before your welcome return,

1089
01:18:43,114 --> 01:18:46,470
I am to express His Majesty's
Government's sincere appreciation

1090
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:49,027
for your splendid conduct
of internal affairs

1091
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,017
during your temporary absence
from the Kingdom.

1092
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:57,926
Ladies and gentlemen!

1093
01:18:59,556 --> 01:19:01,398
We're back in England!
