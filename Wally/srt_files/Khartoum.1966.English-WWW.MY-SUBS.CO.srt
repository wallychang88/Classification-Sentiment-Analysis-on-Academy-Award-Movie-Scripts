1
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:53,940
The Nile was always there.

2
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:57,914
Long before Cairo, long before
the tombs of kings...

3
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:02,078
it was the reason
for everything.

4
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:06,613
It's a little hard to grasp how
far this river's been flowing.

5
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,182
This is the rain
that fell on Abyssinia.

6
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:12,787
These are the waters drained
from central African lakes...

7
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,200
that have flowed 4,000 miles
to make Egypt green.

8
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,636
The Nile has its memories.

9
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:26,666
The story of Khartoum
is a recent one...

10
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,439
less than a century old.

11
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,937
That's yesterday
in this part of the world.

12
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,314
But however far back
you may go...

13
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:39,084
all the Nile's recollections
have several things in common.

14
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,819
There's always God,
for instance.

15
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:45,090
Or, if you prefer, the gods.

16
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,063
It seems to have been
quite impossible...

17
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:48,655
to live beside this river...

18
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,362
and not to have visions
of eternity.

19
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:55,201
And there's always mystery.

20
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:58,140
You never quite know.

21
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:02,441
You wind up with a few questions
that no one can answer.

22
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,051
One more thing.

23
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:11,680
Why is it that everything
was always so big...

24
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,247
outsized, larger-than-life?

25
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,226
Vanity? Perhaps.

26
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:19,855
Or visions.

27
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:22,627
Vanity was always mixed up
with vision.

28
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,032
And that's
part of this story, too.

29
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,434
But it's the Nile
that remains the original fact.

30
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:35,912
The Nile and, of course,
the desert.

31
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,980
Move up, up the Nile.

32
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,645
Leave Egypt behind
and the green land.

33
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,381
Enter the Sudan.

34
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:49,085
A million square miles
of desert and scrub.

35
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:54,325
It was here out of the vast,
hot African nowhere...

36
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:57,198
that a man of the Nile,
a man of vision...

37
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:01,364
and mystery and vanity
rose up in the 1880s...

38
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,806
to challenge first Egypt,
and then the world.

39
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:09,142
He called himself the Mahdi,
the Expected One...

40
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,013
and he gathered about him
his desert tribesmen...

41
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,579
and he cried out for holy war.

42
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:21,557
Egypt hired an army
of 10,000 men...

43
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:24,083
and a professional English
soldier to command them...

44
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:28,121
and sent them 1,600 miles
up the Nile to Khartoum...

45
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:33,159
and on into the desert
to destroy this man, the Mahdi.

46
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:37,799
Our history might have taken
a quite different turn...

47
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:42,744
had Colonel William Hicks not
forgotten, if he ever knew...

48
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,806
the Sudan's great fact--

49
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:49,216
its immensity.

50
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:53,883
The Mahdi led him on and on...
and on.

51
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:08,060
- Keep those men back!
- Right you are! Keep order!

52
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,827
Back!

53
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,890
Bugler!

54
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,676
Deploy!

55
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:55,561
Get those rifles
to the high ground!

56
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:28,531
Mahdi!

57
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,295
Beloveds,
you're men of the desert.

58
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,564
My Lord Mohammed, blessings
and peace be upon him...

59
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:41,002
commands me to speak...

60
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:45,702
for I am the Mahdi,
the Expected One...

61
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:48,575
and I am sprung from
the forehead of the family...

62
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,172
of my Lord Mohammed,
blessings be upon him.

63
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:56,015
My beloveds,
did I not promise thee...

64
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,511
a miracle would fall from heaven
from the Prophet Mohammed?

65
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:02,616
And was not this so?

66
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:11,063
We fight a holy war against
the fat and the corrupt...

67
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,001
and the sinful
and the unbelieving.

68
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:17,871
We fight a war to restore to a
disobedient, forgetful world...

69
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:21,469
the laws and commands
of the Prophet Mohammed...

70
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:24,105
blessings and peace
be upon him...

71
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:28,948
whose instrument on Earth I am.

72
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:34,856
Exalt ye not that men are dead,
since more must die tomorrow.

73
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:39,521
My beloveds, in a vision...

74
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,225
the Prophet Mohammed
has instructed me.

75
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:46,634
Let mountain and desert tremble.

76
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,299
Let cities shudder,
and let the fat and the rich...

77
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,969
and the corrupt in far places
mark this moment...

78
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:59,540
and turn in fear
of all those miracles to come!

79
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:04,543
And let none in all Islam,
from this victorious hour...

80
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:10,117
believe I am other
than the Expected One--

81
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,355
the true Mahdi.

82
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:17,626
Beloveds,
it is the hour of prayer.

83
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:36,279
Explain to me, somebody, where
in heaven's name is Wolseley?

84
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,879
Explain to me
how a rabble of tribesmen...

85
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:40,856
armed only
with spears and swords...

86
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,984
can destroy a modern army?

87
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,254
Not a British army,
Prime Minister.

88
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:45,761
- To the last man.
- An Egyptian army.

89
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,423
I don't care whose army.

90
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:51,594
10,000 men--
a British officer commanding.

91
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:55,230
Why did Egypt have to hire
an Englishman?

92
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,899
Colonel Hicks was a fool.

93
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,805
Clearly. A fool.

94
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,606
That's not the question.
Why did he have to be English?

95
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,442
"Avenge Hicks."

96
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,142
"Uphold Britain's Honor."

97
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:09,983
Wolseley, I have the press
at my throat.

98
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,784
I was summoned to Scotland
to explain to Her Majesty.

99
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:13,983
Will you explain to me--

100
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,390
Mr. Gladstone,
Colonel Stewart...

101
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,951
recently attached
to military intelligence.

102
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,360
The colonel's just back
from Khartoum.

103
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:22,592
He will be able to explain
better than I.

104
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:26,090
Colonel Stewart, sit down.

105
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,628
Are these bulletins
from Khartoum true?

106
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,971
It's over a month's travel
from the Sudan, sir...

107
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:34,272
so, obviously, I left before
these events took place...

108
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,471
but I assume they're true.

109
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:36,706
Why?

110
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,271
I was sent to Khartoum to
assess the Egyptian capacity...

111
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:40,783
to deal with the uprising.

112
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,284
I assessed it as nil.

113
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,219
Military intelligence?

114
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:45,915
There's intelligence for you.

115
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,390
After the event,
they knew all about it.

116
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,290
My reports were delivered
to Sir Evelyn Baring...

117
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,726
in Cairo before the event.

118
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:55,561
I was aware of the reports.
I just didn't believe them.

119
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,964
- I'm Granville.
- My Lord.

120
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,831
The reports still don't
explain to me, however...

121
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,996
how a modern army
could be slaughtered...

122
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:02,664
virtually to the last man.

123
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,869
Colonel Hicks and his men, sir,
were fighting for wages.

124
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,377
The Mahdi and his men
were fighting a holy war.

125
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,641
Also, Hicks made
a very bad mistake.

126
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,114
He thought he was fighting an
ignorant savage, and he wasn't.

127
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,981
The Mahdi is
the most extraordinary man...

128
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,610
the Sudan's ever seen.

129
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,086
And he knows his people.

130
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,521
He promised them a miracle.
He had to deliver it.

131
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:24,254
Even so, Colonel Stewart,
the extent of the disaster...

132
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:28,230
The disaster, sir, has little to
do with the loss of 10,000 men.

133
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,664
It's their arms.

134
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,532
Egypt was unequal to a horde
of desert tribesmen...

135
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,730
when they'd scarcely a pistol
to call their own.

136
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,033
What does he do now...

137
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:38,905
now that they've captured
10,000 Remington rifles...

138
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,375
five batteries of artillery...

139
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,641
and very nearly five million
rounds of ammunition?

140
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,444
And I must add
what will become of Egypt...

141
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,044
if the Mahdi occupies Khartoum
and the Khartoum arsenal?

142
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,782
What a jolly day you'll have
with Her Majesty tomorrow.

143
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:54,915
Gentlemen,
let me make one thing clear.

144
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,518
I'm sending no armies
up the Nile.

145
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,461
You, Hartington,
your imperialist friends--

146
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:03,432
you're looking for any excuse
to move into central Africa.

147
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:04,763
We are discussing Egypt.

148
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,065
We have a moral responsibility
to Egypt.

149
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:08,968
A moral responsibility.

150
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,633
We have the Suez Canal.
Say it.

151
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,610
Egypt protects Suez.
We protect Egypt.

152
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,477
Why in heaven's name
can't Egypt protect herself?

153
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:19,482
We've just heard
from Colonel Stewart.

154
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:20,710
She's not up to it.

155
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,240
Colonel Stewart?

156
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,344
I've no doubt
he's like the rest of you.

157
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,218
He can see himself
leading a British army...

158
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:30,420
1,600 miles up the Nile,
flags flying, glory for all.

159
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,825
I beg your pardon, sir.

160
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,419
Before I'd accept
such a command...

161
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:34,930
I'd resign my commission.

162
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,330
I wouldn't spend
one British life...

163
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,958
to oppose the Mahdi,
not in the Sudan.

164
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,265
I assumed you were
for intervention.

165
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,828
You didn't ask my opinion, sir.

166
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,273
Well, I want it, by heaven,
if it agrees with mine.

167
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,571
Gentlemen, I shall suggest...

168
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,203
to Her Majesty
in Scotland tomorrow...

169
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,578
that we shall discharge
our obligations to Egypt...

170
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:55,346
by evacuating all
the Egyptians from Khartoum.

171
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,114
How, without either
a British army...

172
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:58,780
or loss of British honor?

173
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:03,259
I shall entertain suggestions
as to just how.

174
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,594
Gordon.

175
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,702
Chinese Gordon.

176
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,073
What's Gordon doing now?

177
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,941
He's made a contract with
the king of the Belgians...

178
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,969
to take over the Congo
from Mr. Stanley.

179
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:25,675
We can arrange that
with Brussels.

180
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,808
Send Gordon to Khartoum.

181
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,342
The man who led
the Chinese Emperor's armies...

182
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:32,617
to victory after victory
carrying only a cane--

183
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:33,884
send him to Khartoum.

184
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:36,255
- Without an army?
- Gordon doesn't need an army.

185
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,318
Yes, remember, without
a single British soldier...

186
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:39,988
he ended slavery in the Sudan.

187
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,260
He's a hero...
to the Sudanese...

188
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,063
to the English,
to the anti-slavery people...

189
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,194
to the churchmen.

190
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:49,967
Send him to Khartoum,
and you'll be applauded...

191
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:53,407
from Land's End to Inverness...

192
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,570
and Her Majesty.

193
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:56,943
Granville,
you're wasting my time.

194
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,005
The man's a mystic.
He's an idealist...

195
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,641
with ideals strictly his own.

196
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:03,915
Give him an instruction,
he treats a military order...

197
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,750
as if it were
a birthday greeting.

198
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,690
Besides, I trust no man
who consults God...

199
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:11,353
before he consults me.

200
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,622
May I speak, sir?

201
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:15,495
In my opinion,
General Gordon would refuse.

202
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:18,126
After all,
when he went to the Sudan...

203
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:20,102
as Governor General
and put down the slave trade...

204
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:21,831
with nothing
but his own audacity...

205
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,099
and a few loyal lieutenants...

206
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,437
sir, he didn't face the Mahdi.

207
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:26,806
He didn't face a holy war...

208
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:28,936
and he didn't face
10,000 Remington rifles.

209
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:32,812
If you send him to Khartoum
on his own now...

210
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,477
he'll simply fail.

211
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,213
What a pity.

212
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,624
Sir, if General Gordon
accepted your proposal...

213
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,095
and the conditions of today,
my respect for him would end.

214
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,824
He'd be the vainest man alive.

215
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,661
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.

216
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,792
Now, would you leave us
to our deliberations?

217
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:55,327
My congratulations on
the excellence of your report.

218
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,174
Good day, sir.

219
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,646
I like that man.

220
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,980
Did I understand you correctly?

221
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:10,144
If we send Gordon to Khartoum--

222
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,950
Gordon, a national hero--
and he fails...

223
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:16,220
then the blame will fall on him,
not on the government?

224
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,227
It could happen that way.

225
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,025
It's the most
abominable proposal...

226
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,828
I have ever entertained.

227
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:26,734
Granville,
the colonel had a point.

228
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,330
Just why would Gordon do it?

229
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:32,603
Because he's a patriot
and a man of conscience...

230
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:36,169
or perhaps
the vainest man alive.

231
00:23:36,212 --> 00:23:40,114
I dislike everything about this.

232
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,482
Worse, I distrust it.

233
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,955
I know nothing
about this conversation.

234
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,958
But let me know in Balmoral
what Gordon says.

235
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,553
Her Majesty
would be so pleased.

236
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,916
Apologize for the secrecy,
Gordon.

237
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:16,612
Politics.

238
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:18,951
Let's not waste time
with formalities.

239
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:21,320
Sit down, please.

240
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,723
I can't keep the train
for Scotland waiting forever...

241
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,988
or there'd be curiosity.

242
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:27,428
We need few words.

243
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:30,831
Granville
will see you tomorrow...

244
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:34,098
with a proposal
so disreputable...

245
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,072
that I can have nothing
to do with it publicly.

246
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:39,267
Privately,
I ask you to accept it.

247
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:40,469
Why?

248
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,308
Because it will provide me
with political comfort.

249
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:46,509
I can conceive
of no commodity, sir...

250
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:48,210
that could interest me less.

251
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,684
I'm not a free agent, you know.

252
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,880
I leave for the Belgian Congo
within weeks.

253
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,219
Granville could arrange that.

254
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:57,158
Gordon,
the Sudan was your child.

255
00:24:57,193 --> 00:25:00,685
I don't need to inform you
it's in the gravest danger.

256
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,254
You don't need to inform me.

257
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:03,765
Gordon, I cannot and will not...

258
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,734
send military forces
up the Nile...

259
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:08,532
but I admit Khartoum
cannot be left to its fate...

260
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,266
without some gesture.

261
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,773
Am I the gesture?

262
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:13,435
The whole country
knows your capacities.

263
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:17,344
You've done before alone what
an army of blunderers can't do.

264
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,177
What's the proposal?

265
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,580
That you go to the Sudan...

266
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,847
supervise the evacuation
of Khartoum...

267
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,787
do what you can to leave
peace and order behind.

268
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:28,848
- With what powers?
- None.

269
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:31,861
Egypt will give you
some ribbon or other.

270
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,762
Politicians.

271
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:37,493
And when the Mahdi
floats me down the Nile...

272
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,934
the government will assume
a pained expression...

273
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,164
and say to Her Majesty
and the churchmen...

274
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:44,901
and the anti-slavery people,
"We sent Gordon.

275
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,602
"We did the best we could."

276
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:47,803
Precisely.

277
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:52,713
That'll be the end of Gordon,
but not of Gladstone.

278
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:54,478
In a nutshell.

279
00:25:56,686 --> 00:26:00,087
I must say, Mr. Gladstone,
you're hardly a bore.

280
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,489
You don't bore me either,
Gordon.

281
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,857
You're illogical
and insubordinate.

282
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,452
I know if I send you
to Khartoum...

283
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:08,487
you'll play tricks,
you'll exceed your orders...

284
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:11,091
and in the name of some
mystical necessity...

285
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,567
apparent only to yourself...

286
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:16,094
you'll do your ingenious best
to involve this government...

287
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,333
up to the hatband.

288
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:18,931
But you're
in a very poor patch...

289
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:21,102
and you have no one
to turn to but me.

290
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:22,771
Again, in a nutshell.

291
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,280
I'll take a chance on your
tricks. That's all I can say.

292
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:28,284
I'll see Sir Evelyn Baring
in Cairo...

293
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:29,945
brings pressure
on the Khedive...

294
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:32,955
to appoint you Governor General
of the Sudan...

295
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,457
but I cannot
and will not back you up.

296
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:36,924
This must be understood.

297
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,190
No British troops
will come up the Nile.

298
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:43,130
I will not assume a British
obligation to police the world.

299
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,964
If you can help the Sudan,
your country will be grateful.

300
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,162
If you can't--

301
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:49,637
My country will understand.

302
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,346
I'll go.

303
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:03,712
You'll come back safe.

304
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:08,452
Gordon, first, last,
and above all...

305
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:10,118
you'll come back safe.

306
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,024
Do you hear me?

307
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,824
I hear you.

308
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,295
You'll need an aide.

309
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:20,097
I have a good man in mind.

310
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:21,933
Isn't such a choice
my prerogative?

311
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:24,439
Not in this case.
He'll be useful to you.

312
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:25,634
And to you.

313
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,142
Naturally.

314
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,076
Well, Gordon...

315
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,973
God go with you,
and I don't envy God.

316
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,710
Put my luggage aboard, please.

317
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,944
Very good, sir.

318
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,360
Yes?

319
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:31,234
Your second-in-command, sir,
Colonel J.D.H. Stewart.

320
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,139
So.

321
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:39,876
This is for you, General.

322
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,942
You'll find my report in here.
It'll bring you up to date.

323
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:45,920
Am I to understand
that Gladstone has cursed me...

324
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,150
not only with a spy,
but with a subordinate...

325
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:49,852
who thinks he knows
more than I do?

326
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:51,325
I was brought here
in chains, sir.

327
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,759
I don't know what to think.

328
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:54,023
Brandy and soda, sir.

329
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:56,258
B & S? It sounds as though
you'll need one.

330
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,234
- Thank you, sir.
- Right. Sit down.

331
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:01,759
You are Gladstone's spy,
aren't you?

332
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:03,203
Yes, sir.

333
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,230
Would it be indiscreet
of your commanding officer...

334
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:06,764
to inquire
as to your instructions?

335
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:07,969
Not at all, sir.

336
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,910
I am to report
to Mr. Gladstone...

337
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,972
any actions you may take
which, in my opinion...

338
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,609
conflict with your instructions.

339
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,348
I am to inform you and
the government if necessary...

340
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:22,619
of any situation
which, in my opinion...

341
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:24,353
places you in physical danger.

342
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:26,088
And if anybody in
the course of this mission...

343
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:30,429
must risk his life,
then I'm to do it, not you.

344
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:34,926
Apart from that, sir,
I'm yours to command.

345
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:38,236
Tell me what, in your opinion,
Colonel Stewart...

346
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,538
are the chances
of my sacking you?

347
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:42,043
If they existed, sir...

348
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,478
I'd be the first
to point them out to you.

349
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,106
Drink your brandy.

350
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,278
Thank you.

351
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,049
We seem to have sailed.

352
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:54,920
Farewell, England.

353
00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:58,723
So you and I are definitely
stuck with each other.

354
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,058
Yes, sir.

355
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:03,031
For heaven's sake, man,
sit down.

356
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,200
May I ask a question?

357
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:11,138
If it's impertinent,
I withdraw it.

358
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:13,699
Why did you let them
talk you into this mission?

359
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:23,048
As is well known, I regard
myself as a religious man...

360
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:25,519
yet, I belong to no church.

361
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:28,319
I'm an able soldier,
but I abhor armies.

362
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,848
I could even add
that I've been introduced...

363
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:33,453
to hundreds of women,
yet I've never married.

364
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:36,158
In other words, no one's
ever talked me into anything.

365
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,723
Does that answer your question?

366
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,496
No, sir.

367
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:44,099
Then let me suggest that
my life is not an open book...

368
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,702
to you, to any man,
least of all to myself.

369
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,244
With your permission, General,
I think I need a turn on deck.

370
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:04,592
Send a telegram
as soon as we reach Calais.

371
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:06,720
Sir Evelyn Baring, Cairo.

372
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:09,287
Locate immediately
whereabouts Zobeir Pasha.

373
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:10,697
Signed, Gordon.

374
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:16,628
That's spelt Z-O-B-E-l-R.

375
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,535
Yes, sir.

376
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,675
I expected outrageous nonsense
from you, Gordon.

377
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:02,946
I expected the worst,
but Zobeir Pasha.

378
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:05,317
Even the Khedive was appalled.

379
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,049
I see nothing outrageous,
Sir Evelyn.

380
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,556
Zobeir's a Sudanese.

381
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:10,456
He used to be the most
important man down there.

382
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:13,360
He's able, wise,
still has a powerful influence.

383
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:15,091
You'd like to take Zobeir
with you to Khartoum...

384
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,792
to give him control
over the Sudan.

385
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:18,527
Gordon,
the man is a slave trader.

386
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:19,761
Was a slave trader.

387
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:22,532
My instructions
are to evacuate Khartoum...

388
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,630
and leave
some sort of order behind.

389
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,801
How?
Well, most of the chiefs...

390
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:29,242
Ioyal to the Mahdi today
used to be loyal to Zobeir.

391
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,506
I think
they'd come back to him.

392
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:34,539
Sir Evelyn, I cannot go
to Khartoum without a plan.

393
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:41,723
- I insist on seeing Zobeir.
- Why would he see you?

394
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,918
You not only put him
out of the slave trade...

395
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,154
you killed his son
in the process.

396
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:48,163
I must take the chance.
One must always take chances.

397
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:54,867
Why is Towfik making us wait?

398
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:56,735
Well, Sir Evelyn,
it's been my experience...

399
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:58,763
that when you're giving
orders to sovereign princes...

400
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,003
you have to expect
a little humiliation.

401
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,840
It makes them feel better.

402
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,501
Humbly, Highness,
I accept this command...

403
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:36,010
as Governor General
of the Sudan...

404
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:38,036
and I swear to you
my devoted service.

405
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,877
Do you understand,
Gordon Pasha...

406
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:42,349
that your wages
will only be L6,000 a year?

407
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:44,148
It is all I can afford.

408
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:47,952
I'll take 2,000.
It's all I need.

409
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,086
What about a B & S?

410
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,492
Sir.

411
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:39,972
God be with us.

412
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:47,514
Zobeir Pasha, you are well?

413
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,916
General Gordon
goes to Khartoum...

414
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:54,616
as Governor General
for the Khedive.

415
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,421
He pays you his compliments,
and he would speak with you.

416
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,156
This is my aide,
Colonel Stewart.

417
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,897
We come from London, Zobeir.

418
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,869
My government is determined
to lend Egypt no support...

419
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,303
in the face of the uprising
and to prevail on the Khedive...

420
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:13,365
to relinquish control
over the Sudan.

421
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:15,343
Sir Evelyn
will confirm what I say.

422
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:17,937
This is unwise.
There will be ruin...

423
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,175
and death, and tears,
and little else.

424
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,843
It is my government's policy.

425
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:24,580
I have no authority
beyond evacuating...

426
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,850
all Egyptians from Khartoum.

427
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,151
I could wish otherwise.

428
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,556
But you have the power
and the influence...

429
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:32,788
and the ability
to oppose the Mahdi.

430
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:35,823
Will you come with me
to Khartoum...

431
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:38,197
and accept the Sudan
from my hands?

432
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,493
Do I receive this offer...

433
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:44,233
from the British government,
Sir Evelyn?

434
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:48,141
No, my government renounces all
influence over Sudanese affairs.

435
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:50,304
This is a matter
between you and General Gordon.

436
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:53,941
If I give you my word that
there will be no slavery...

437
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,577
I regard the institution
as ended...

438
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:59,520
does my attitude
influence your government?

439
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,455
I understand.
My reputation.

440
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:07,860
But what would
your Christian world say...

441
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:12,095
if the slaver Zobeir
received ten million Sudanese...

442
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:14,568
from the hands
of the great Gordon Pasha?

443
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:18,198
My government
would oppose you... publicly.

444
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,903
I would defend you.
Publicly.

445
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,249
The general will defend me.

446
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:38,355
The great Christian hero
will defend Zobeir the slaver.

447
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,956
Before I receive my country
from your bloody hands...

448
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,058
I shall see it die.

449
00:36:48,404 --> 00:36:50,395
You killed my son.

450
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,466
I executed him.

451
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:58,810
Do you have sons, Gordon Pasha?

452
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:00,781
Do you have sons?

453
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,909
No.

454
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,613
You killed mine.

455
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:07,281
God forgive me, Zobeir.

456
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:11,121
But let the dead
bury their dead.

457
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,287
You killed my flesh!

458
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:15,058
My blood!

459
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,463
My suleman.

460
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:26,940
Get thee from my house, and may
ye die in the desert untended.

461
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:31,970
May vultures consume thy flesh,
sands thy blood.

462
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,421
Go back. Go back to London.

463
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,026
There's too much danger,
too little hope.

464
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,263
I'll report
my news to Gladstone.

465
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:58,171
I'll stand by you.

466
00:37:58,207 --> 00:37:59,970
Thank you.

467
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,170
You said you had to have a plan.

468
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:05,112
What can you do now?

469
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:08,480
Get up the Nile to Khartoum.

470
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:38,140
Stewart, just how far into
the Sudan would you say we are?

471
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:42,639
We'll reach Berber
in an hour or so.

472
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,983
In your report you said
that the Mahdi's people...

473
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,581
wore jibbers
covered with patches.

474
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:50,956
That's correct, sir.

475
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:53,723
And his main force
is still beyond Khartoum?

476
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:55,024
Yes, sir.

477
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:59,329
Look there.
We haven't even reached Berber.

478
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,257
Gordon Pasha!

479
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,589
Ali lbrahim!

480
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:30,029
Gordon Pasha!

481
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:32,226
No, Ali. No!

482
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,633
Sheikh Ali lbrahim
of the Manasir.

483
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,228
My friend before God.

484
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:37,568
Ali, please.

485
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:41,007
I weep for joy.
We are saved! We are delivered!

486
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,807
- Delivered?
- Berber is surrounded.

487
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:47,782
I am cut off from my people,
except by the river.

488
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:51,183
To the east, to the south,
to the north.

489
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,485
Mohammed al Khalia, the villain,
he has gone over to the Mahdi...

490
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:56,821
taking all the tribes
along this shore.

491
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:58,622
We saw a band downriver.

492
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,252
Did they get their guns
from the Mahdi?

493
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:03,594
Since the terrible disaster
of Hicks Pasha...

494
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:06,192
it seems all have guns.

495
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:09,204
But you return,
and we are saved.

496
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:12,230
- We are delivered.
- How? I bring no army.

497
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,572
You will find a way,
Gordon Pasha.

498
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,669
You have always found a way.

499
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:22,617
My friends, we must drink coffee
and speak of the old days.

500
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,698
Sir, I've prepared
a telegram for London.

501
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,704
I request that you read it.

502
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:44,467
I have an official
responsibility...

503
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,633
to advise you
to turn back to Cairo.

504
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,199
The situation has changed.

505
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:50,643
Situations always change.

506
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,271
Sir, Berber is surrounded.

507
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:55,078
The uprising spread this far
while we traveled.

508
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,017
You could be caught in a trap.

509
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:59,282
Give me a camel,
I can get out of anything.

510
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:01,255
You're a responsible spy.

511
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,121
Send your telegram.

512
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,683
You're bringing these people
nothing but false hopes...

513
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:07,319
and false expectations.

514
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:11,196
There are still 13,000 Egyptians
to be got out of Khartoum.

515
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,962
If the government
had known that by now...

516
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,526
there'd be armed Mahdis tribes
on both sides of the Nile...

517
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,766
400 miles north of Khartoum--

518
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,535
They wouldn't have sent me.

519
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:21,634
Then you cannot proceed further.

520
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:23,577
If Her Majesty's government...

521
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:25,739
at this moment wants
to run out publicly...

522
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:29,273
on the Egyptians,
send your telegram.

523
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:30,910
Get them to recall me.

524
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:33,217
But you have to make
the decision. They won't.

525
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:35,883
I've made my decision,
Colonel Stewart.

526
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:37,585
But what is your decision?

527
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:44,898
General, when you left London,
your only hope was Zobeir.

528
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:46,833
So, if you have
any further plan...

529
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,067
beyond vague self-confidence,
you haven't confided it to me.

530
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,269
Was I instructed
to confide in you?

531
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:55,537
I don't recall.

532
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:57,636
Are you willing
to delude the Sudanese...

533
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,772
gull the Egyptians,
and compromise your country...

534
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,680
just to satisfy
your own vanity?

535
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,012
Next time I'll shoot you.

536
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:13,193
I've shot men before.

537
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:14,991
Now send your telegram.

538
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,070
The boat is coming!

539
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:43,992
Look at that!
Isn't that marvelous?

540
00:42:44,026 --> 00:42:45,823
How exciting!

541
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,728
Everyone in Khartoum
must be on the coast.

542
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,945
Gordon Pasha!

543
00:44:11,346 --> 00:44:13,746
Welcome back, Gordon Pasha.

544
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:14,976
Thank you.

545
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,786
It's good to be home.

546
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:37,757
You can't see anything
from down there.

547
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:24,173
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

548
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:26,203
Sheikh Abdul Rahim.

549
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:28,739
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

550
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:32,986
Mr. Frank Power, Her Majesty's
consul in Khartoum.

551
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:34,784
Also the "Times" correspondent.

552
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:36,085
Where is he?

553
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:38,217
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

554
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:41,693
Monsieur Herbin,
French counsel.

555
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,755
Gordon Pasha
will be with us shortly.

556
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:48,064
- Khaleel, B & S.
- Yes, master.

557
00:46:57,879 --> 00:46:59,437
B & S.

558
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,675
Thank you.

559
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:06,984
Now, master,
it has been a very long time.

560
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:09,513
So you cannot expect me
to remember all things...

561
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:10,923
without confusion.

562
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:12,950
For if you had
left me this Bible...

563
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:14,621
then it would be different.

564
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:16,824
I could not have read it,
but even so--

565
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:19,026
- Khaleel.
- I'm here, master.

566
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:21,092
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do for me.

567
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:22,296
And I shall do it, master.

568
00:47:22,337 --> 00:47:24,931
Now, this great Jesus Christ,
sometime, master...

569
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:26,531
I do not understand this man.

570
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:29,066
For He announced, and He
was very clear about it...

571
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,407
for once He was very clear...

572
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:32,072
almost like
the great Lord Mohammed...

573
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:33,444
bless him and peace be upon him.

574
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:36,109
But I do not understand
this Jesus Christ.

575
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:39,279
For as I remember, you told me,
He announced most clearly...

576
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:40,618
as I have said--

577
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:43,453
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do.

578
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:44,981
You have only to speak master.

579
00:47:45,026 --> 00:47:48,826
Now, He say when a man
is struck upon one cheek...

580
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:50,024
he must turn the other.

581
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:52,295
Do you? No.

582
00:47:58,673 --> 00:48:00,140
You don't.

583
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:04,475
I must inform you, Khaleel,
as delicately as possible...

584
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:06,878
that I am not Jesus Christ.

585
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,412
Wait! Will you first
find out for me...

586
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,717
where the Mahdi's camp
is at present?

587
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,275
Khaleel.

588
00:49:14,649 --> 00:49:15,877
Peace be with you.

589
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,384
Peace be with you.

590
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:19,683
Send a messenger
to Mohammed Ahmed...

591
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:21,279
who is called the Mahdi...

592
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:22,984
and tell him
that Gordon Pasha...

593
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:25,993
Governor General of the Sudan,
has entered his camp.

594
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:28,791
It is a lie before God!
He is not Gordon Pasha!

595
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:56,885
Abdullah! Gordon Pasha is here!

596
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,790
How does he appear?

597
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:01,557
The skin is pink.
The beard is only here.

598
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:02,961
It is gray.

599
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,625
Khartoum.

600
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:07,294
Holy person, we saw him
yesterday in Khartoum.

601
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:09,030
It is Gordon Pasha.

602
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,435
How many are his soldiers?

603
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:12,667
He is alone
with one black slave.

604
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:15,141
I fear it. He makes magic.

605
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,269
We saw it yesterday
in the streets.

606
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:18,540
Kill him.

607
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:22,810
You're all so innocent.

608
00:50:22,851 --> 00:50:24,819
Who makes the magic
that brings him...

609
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:28,448
to my camp alone
with one black slave?

610
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,424
He...

611
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:33,086
or I?

612
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:34,993
Bring the great one to me.

613
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:36,921
Is it because you are
an infidel, Gordon Pasha...

614
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:41,017
that I feel myself
in the presence of evil?

615
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,257
I doubt it, Mohammed Ahmed,
for you are not an infidel...

616
00:51:44,296 --> 00:51:45,854
and I smell evil.

617
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:52,131
I have 30,000 soldiers
in my camp.

618
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:54,139
Is it because
you are so brave...

619
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:56,403
or so foolish,
that you come here alone...

620
00:51:56,442 --> 00:52:00,071
unarmed, with only
a black slave to hold your robe?

621
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:03,808
Khaleel is not a slave.
He is a free man.

622
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,283
He comes with me out of love.

623
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,981
And he does not hold my robe,
but a gift for you.

624
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,683
Years ago, Mohammed Ahmed...

625
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:14,158
I led the armies
of the Emperor of China...

626
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:15,751
at a time of great trial.

627
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:18,855
And when his enemies
were crushed and confounded...

628
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:22,800
and his throne was again secure,
he made me this gift.

629
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,894
I have brought it
from London for you.

630
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:30,398
It is most exquisite.

631
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:34,243
When the Emperor of China
ceases to be a non-believer...

632
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,840
and accepts me,
the Expected One...

633
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:38,850
as the true Mahdi...

634
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:42,320
then I shall be happy
to receive such a gift.

635
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:47,449
Khaleel?

636
00:52:47,493 --> 00:52:49,188
You will wait just outside.

637
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:56,261
Abria. Real abria.

638
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:58,270
I've had none in five years.

639
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:04,608
Your meeting with Zobeir Pasha
was less than happy, I believe.

640
00:53:06,345 --> 00:53:08,108
Your intelligence service...

641
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:10,775
has an excellence
beyond my expectations.

642
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:13,444
How much you must regret
having killed his son.

643
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:19,123
I executed his son.
I have no regrets.

644
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:20,921
It was a necessary
object lesson...

645
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,258
in my campaign
against the slave trade.

646
00:53:23,295 --> 00:53:25,490
And it was successful.

647
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,499
I brought peace to the Sudan.

648
00:53:29,135 --> 00:53:31,365
But since
you have come back now...

649
00:53:31,403 --> 00:53:34,201
with instructions
to evacuate Khartoum...

650
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,868
most happily,
the peace of the Sudan...

651
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,342
no longer concerns you.

652
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,077
What a pleasure it is
to negotiate with a man...

653
00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:44,048
who knows even my instructions.

654
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:47,348
We need waste so little time
on preliminaries.

655
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:52,414
What are your instructions
concerning Khartoum?

656
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,761
I have been instructed
by the Prophet...

657
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:06,772
blessings and peace
be upon him...

658
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:09,798
to worship
in the Khartoum mosque.

659
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:17,476
There are those among the
Sudanese who will oppose you.

660
00:54:17,516 --> 00:54:20,076
I welcome in peace
all those who worship with me.

661
00:54:22,288 --> 00:54:23,482
And the others?

662
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:33,663
Mohammed Ahmed,
may I suggest...

663
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,691
that when first
I came to the Sudan...

664
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:42,765
its body was sick, stricken
with hunger and abused by war.

665
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:47,211
I cured it... and this land...

666
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:51,814
I'm not a loving man,
Mohammed Ahmed...

667
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:57,255
but this land became the only
thing that I've ever loved.

668
00:54:58,824 --> 00:55:02,624
I cannot, under my God--
do you understand?

669
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,891
I cannot leave it
to the sickness...

670
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,558
and the misery
in which I once found it.

671
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:11,729
I respect you, Gordon Pasha.

672
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,204
I make no war on you.

673
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,470
Make no war on your own people.

674
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:18,305
I'll take the Egyptians
back to Egypt.

675
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:20,278
I'll leave the Sudan
to the Sudanese...

676
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:23,440
and be happy and contented,
but if I'm to leave Khartoum...

677
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:27,077
to sickness and misery,
to death...

678
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:31,717
The Egyptians
must remain in Khartoum.

679
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:40,393
I am a poor man of the desert.

680
00:55:40,432 --> 00:55:44,027
But I am the Mahdi,
the Expected One.

681
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:47,664
On my cheek is the mole.

682
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:49,298
Between my teeth...

683
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,610
the space.

684
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:57,377
And so that all men may know
that I am the true Mahdi...

685
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:01,284
the Prophet Mohammed, blessings
and peace be upon him...

686
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,880
makes miracles.

687
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:06,016
Do you understand?

688
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:10,922
I begin to.

689
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:17,499
Gordon Pasha, do you believe
that the Prophet...

690
00:56:17,536 --> 00:56:19,766
blessings be upon him,
has instructed me...

691
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:24,139
to pray only in
the mosque at Khartoum?

692
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:28,510
No. I am to pray
in the mosque at Cairo...

693
00:56:28,547 --> 00:56:30,708
and at Mecca, and at Baghdad...

694
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:33,684
and in the mosque
at Constantinople.

695
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,021
He has commanded me to make
holy war until all of Islam...

696
00:56:39,058 --> 00:56:41,390
acknowledges the purity
of his biddings...

697
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:46,592
and all the world
trembles before me.

698
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:50,329
But all Islam
must know who I am.

699
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:53,334
And believe.

700
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,339
Gordon Pasha,
for tasks of such greatness...

701
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:02,108
great deeds are needed.

702
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:04,479
Egypt opposes me...

703
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:08,680
and so the Egyptians
must remain in Khartoum.

704
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:11,019
For I shall take it in blood...

705
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,990
and the streets
will run in blood...

706
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:16,392
and the Nile will taste
of blood for a hundred miles...

707
00:57:16,428 --> 00:57:22,389
and every Egyptian will die--
every child, woman, man.

708
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:27,201
Sudanese, too, who opposes
the will of my Lord Mohammed...

709
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,673
will die.

710
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:33,804
This is how it must be
in Khartoum.

711
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:36,542
Great and terrible thing.

712
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:39,813
Or I shall not pray
in the mosques of Cairo...

713
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:41,649
and Mecca,
and Constantinople...

714
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:46,021
nor will the world
ever tremble before me.

715
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:55,732
I had thought in my lifetime
that I had witnessed all things.

716
00:57:55,768 --> 00:57:58,032
And you have.

717
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,598
You have described to me
how it was an object lesson...

718
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:06,202
when you slaughtered
the sons of the slavers...

719
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:09,476
and brought peace to the Sudan.

720
00:58:09,515 --> 00:58:12,780
You have no regrets.

721
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:15,719
What is the difference,
Gordon Pasha?

722
00:58:15,754 --> 00:58:22,159
An infidel object lesson,
or a holy miracle?

723
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,059
If Khartoum is sacrificed...

724
00:58:24,096 --> 00:58:26,496
then all Islam
will tremble and bow...

725
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:29,524
and in peace I shall proceed...

726
00:58:29,568 --> 00:58:32,230
to all the mosques
where I must pray...

727
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:36,765
and the lives of millions
will be spared.

728
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:40,267
Whisper to me, Gordon Pasha...

729
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:44,138
is there a difference?

730
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,581
This is how it will be.

731
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,521
This is how it will be.

732
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,453
Stewart Pasha.

733
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:33,762
He's back, sir.

734
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:49,204
Excellency,
he has had no sleep.

735
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:50,738
General!

736
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:07,326
You have... been to the Mahdi.

737
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:17,769
He plans to lay siege
to Khartoum...

738
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:20,505
take it by force.

739
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:23,572
To slaughter all the Egyptians

740
01:00:23,615 --> 01:00:26,846
and those Sudanese
who haven't accepted him.

741
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:30,912
But there are 35,000 people
in Khartoum.

742
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:36,451
Those are his purposes,
and I believe him.

743
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:41,694
The man is sincere.

744
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:45,464
He believes utterly
in the divine necessity...

745
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:47,335
for what he's doing.

746
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:49,897
How could I have been
such a stumbling fool?

747
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,876
I'm a man
who will question anything...

748
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,310
except my own
religious convictions.

749
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,246
The Mahdi's no different.

750
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:59,648
There's vanity for you.

751
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,017
I seem to have suffered
from the illusion...

752
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:05,455
that I have a monopoly on God.

753
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:08,459
It's the failure.

754
01:01:08,493 --> 01:01:10,552
There are so many things
I'm not afraid of...

755
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:15,226
but... to fail...

756
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:17,599
You haven't failed, sir.

757
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:22,039
Who else could have found out
the Mahdi's intentions?

758
01:01:23,609 --> 01:01:25,042
If I'd known
about this in London...

759
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:28,205
would I have recommended
against sending an army?

760
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:31,614
How could any British government
survive a massacre like this...

761
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:35,017
without making
some attempt to forestall it?

762
01:01:35,053 --> 01:01:39,547
Yes. Get off a telegram
to Cairo, immediately.

763
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:42,253
If the government
moves on this, they can--

764
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:43,488
Sir.

765
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:46,956
The telegraph's been cut.

766
01:01:52,237 --> 01:01:54,865
- Where?
- Below Metemmah.

767
01:01:57,075 --> 01:02:00,340
- When?
- Today.

768
01:02:00,379 --> 01:02:05,442
Sir, Mohammed al Khalia
attacked Berber at dawn.

769
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:07,008
Your friend
Sheikh Ali lbrahim...

770
01:02:07,052 --> 01:02:08,952
escaped downriver
at 10:00 this morning...

771
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:10,716
and since then
there's been no message.

772
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:12,815
We presume the city's fallen.

773
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:17,090
If so, the Nile is closed.

774
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:19,859
The evacuation.
We must get these people--

775
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:22,230
Sir, there isn't going
to be any evacuation.

776
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:25,759
If they hold Berber,
they've closed the Nile.

777
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:33,040
Sweet Jesus.

778
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,880
There is no alternative.

779
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:43,410
Gladstone must send an army.

780
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:47,625
If they've closed the Nile
at Berber...

781
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:50,822
we can get messengers across
the desert as far as Debba.

782
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:52,352
The telegraph
must be working there.

783
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:54,228
Yes. They can't
have got that far.

784
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:56,097
Call your staff together,
Stewart.

785
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:58,125
We must check the food supplies.

786
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,003
We'll manage till help comes.

787
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,735
I've been an engineer
all my days.

788
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:07,302
If I can't fortify a city with
rivers on two sides of it...

789
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:08,813
I should be broken to the ranks.

790
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:11,077
- Go on.
- Sir.

791
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:39,136
Save Gordon.

792
01:03:53,759 --> 01:03:56,557
Prime Minister, how many more
of these debates...

793
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:59,325
can we survive?
We must do something.

794
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:01,229
If Gordon can get messengers
out of Khartoum...

795
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:02,597
he can get himself out.

796
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:03,794
Prime Minister, please.

797
01:04:03,835 --> 01:04:05,894
Who is the government,
Gordon or I?

798
01:04:05,937 --> 01:04:07,097
I've been talking to Wolseley.

799
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,664
He can send a small detachment
into the Sudan.

800
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,198
He promises
no further than Debba.

801
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:13,871
I'll make no compromises
with this man, Granville.

802
01:04:13,912 --> 01:04:15,971
I've distrusted him always,
I distrust him now.

803
01:04:16,014 --> 01:04:19,745
A small detachment, for
communication purposes only.

804
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:21,616
A gesture.

805
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:25,350
We are in trouble!

806
01:04:27,692 --> 01:04:30,957
Well, a small detachment.

807
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:32,964
But I will not
turn this government...

808
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:34,795
to overseas adventure.

809
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,324
Not for all the Gordons,
the sentimentalists...

810
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,997
the plots, the intrigues.

811
01:04:40,038 --> 01:04:42,029
Save Gordon.

812
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:52,114
Now then, we are here.

813
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,584
You see, here's the city wall
right there...

814
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,450
with your guns
emplaced all along.

815
01:04:56,488 --> 01:04:58,456
And this is the ditch
we're digging...

816
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:00,890
connecting the white Nile
to the blue Nile.

817
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:04,657
Now, when it's flooded, the city
will become an island...

818
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,220
and if the Mahdi
crosses the river...

819
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:09,825
and attacks from out here,
the ditch will stop any charge.

820
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:11,699
But you must have
your guns emplaced...

821
01:05:11,736 --> 01:05:13,966
so that their fields
of fire overlap...

822
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,472
then if one gun
is knocked out...

823
01:05:15,507 --> 01:05:18,340
the next will still cover
the same field.

824
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:21,345
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Gordon Pasha.

825
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:23,506
I sincerely hope so, Major.

826
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:25,880
Off you go.

827
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,689
I've been wondering, sir.

828
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:08,386
The Nile's aflood at the moment.

829
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,792
What happens when it falls
and our ditch goes dry?

830
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:12,228
That won't be till next winter.

831
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:13,822
If they haven't
sent an army by then...

832
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:16,663
we'll all be dead of old age.

833
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:19,727
I don't think the Mahdi's
waiting for that.

834
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:23,366
I just saw them putting up his
personal tents over the river.

835
01:06:23,408 --> 01:06:25,171
He's moving up.

836
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,701
Well, I could have the ditch
flooded in a few days.

837
01:06:27,746 --> 01:06:30,306
Good. I don't think
he'll attack for a while.

838
01:06:30,348 --> 01:06:34,546
He'll try to tighten
the siege first, weaken us.

839
01:06:34,586 --> 01:06:39,319
I want you to help me plan
a giant-sized raiding party.

840
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:41,154
I want to take it upcountry
between the rivers...

841
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:42,921
and bring back
every head of cattle...

842
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:45,191
every measure of wheat
for a hundred miles.

843
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,027
It might have to last us
quite a while.

844
01:06:47,065 --> 01:06:50,125
Sounds like a dangerous job,
so I better do it.

845
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:51,658
It's in the orders.

846
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,864
Forget the orders.
Finish your ditch.

847
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:55,202
Flood it when you're ready.

848
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,640
Meanwhile,
let me have a little fun.

849
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:33,394
Stewart Pasha.

850
01:08:33,438 --> 01:08:35,736
Gordon Pasha
is ten miles from the city...

851
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:37,833
with a great convoy
of grain and cattle.

852
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:40,970
A spy brings news the Mahdi
is attacking him at dawn.

853
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:25,654
They're out there somewhere.

854
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:50,144
We'll make a stand
and hold them...

855
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:52,775
while you take all the cattle
and grain into Khartoum.

856
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:54,842
If we divide,
they'll have to divide.

857
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:56,114
You take all the cavalry
with you...

858
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:57,587
but don't let them turn you.

859
01:09:57,622 --> 01:10:00,113
You must get the convoy
into Khartoum.

860
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,991
- Good luck to you.
- Sir!

861
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:16,431
Hurry!

862
01:10:25,316 --> 01:10:27,716
You, up the pace. Come on!

863
01:10:45,603 --> 01:10:48,470
Now then, we can hold them here
while the convoy gets away.

864
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:50,906
But keep your men low.
Don't give them a target.

865
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:53,410
Dismount yourselves.
Get your horses down, too.

866
01:10:53,444 --> 01:10:54,911
Let them charge through us.

867
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:57,244
Once they've passed us, we'll
have them against the light.

868
01:10:57,282 --> 01:10:59,546
Well, good luck then.

869
01:10:59,584 --> 01:11:01,916
Be quick.

870
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:15,222
Re-form!

871
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,228
Re-form and prepare to fire!

872
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,787
They're coming out
of the light this time.

873
01:12:24,269 --> 01:12:25,896
Stand fast.

874
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:28,132
Prepare to fire.

875
01:12:28,172 --> 01:12:29,730
Fire!

876
01:13:07,745 --> 01:13:11,044
Move forward!

877
01:13:24,595 --> 01:13:27,996
Ready... charge!

878
01:13:46,517 --> 01:13:48,644
They'll come at us again
from the dark now.

879
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:50,347
Take cover!

880
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:27,051
Re-form!

881
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:24,477
Nearly three hundred dead.

882
01:15:24,515 --> 01:15:27,075
How much of the convoy
did we lose?

883
01:15:27,118 --> 01:15:31,054
None. You must have brought in
all the loose grain and beef...

884
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:34,081
this side of Abyssinia.

885
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,889
It'll have to last us
till relief comes.

886
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:43,693
This came yesterday
via Cairo and Kitchener.

887
01:15:43,734 --> 01:15:45,827
- I've read it.
- Who's Kitchener?

888
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:48,964
He's a major who's arrived
at Debba with an army.

889
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:51,907
Precisely twenty men.

890
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:04,380
"You exaggerate
the danger, sir.

891
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:06,151
"Suspicion still exists, sir...

892
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:07,885
"that you've created
a situation...

893
01:16:07,925 --> 01:16:10,655
"to fit your own personal
inclinations.

894
01:16:10,695 --> 01:16:13,095
"Leave Khartoum at once, sir.

895
01:16:13,131 --> 01:16:17,363
"This is your last,
final, ultimate order."

896
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:21,064
Obey the order, General.

897
01:16:21,105 --> 01:16:26,566
Go to London. Explain to them.
You'll come back with an army.

898
01:16:26,611 --> 01:16:29,102
I'll come back with an army.

899
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:31,945
They wouldn't listen to me.

900
01:16:31,983 --> 01:16:34,417
If they did,
they wouldn't believe me.

901
01:16:34,452 --> 01:16:37,353
If they believed me,
they'd keep me in England...

902
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:41,256
if they had to lock me up
in the tower of London.

903
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:45,989
You're the one to go.

904
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,521
They'd believe you
if I stayed here as a hostage.

905
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:50,693
They'd believe you
because they must!

906
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:52,202
I'll give you Khaleel.

907
01:16:52,236 --> 01:16:54,864
He knows the route through
the desert and the wells.

908
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:57,033
We've enough food here now
to hold out for months.

909
01:16:57,074 --> 01:16:59,941
The Nile's too high
for the Mahdi to attack.

910
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:01,239
You must do it.

911
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:03,406
Yes, sir.

912
01:17:03,447 --> 01:17:05,381
Let's get back.

913
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:02,233
Kitchener.

914
01:18:07,144 --> 01:18:10,079
I'll take cholera, dysentery,
sunstroke, fleas in my bed...

915
01:18:10,114 --> 01:18:12,708
Arabs in my hair,
but I cannot take politicians.

916
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,048
I wish you well, by heaven...

917
01:18:15,086 --> 01:18:17,611
but I don't envy you
what you're up against.

918
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:20,852
Your man better stay with us
until you get back.

919
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,891
Colonel Stewart, sir.

920
01:18:32,103 --> 01:18:34,071
Get out of the way!

921
01:18:34,105 --> 01:18:36,869
Say nothing, sir.
Your carriage is there, sir.

922
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:39,375
Clear the way, please.
Say nothing.

923
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,243
Sir.

924
01:18:50,288 --> 01:18:53,451
I wasn't prepared
for all this excitement.

925
01:18:58,663 --> 01:19:01,393
The prime minister's
waiting for you.

926
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:02,694
I want you to know
before you see him...

927
01:19:02,733 --> 01:19:03,927
that he missed
a vote of censure...

928
01:19:03,968 --> 01:19:06,903
in the House of Commons
yesterday by only a few votes.

929
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:10,270
I want you to know also that
I'm on General Gordon's side.

930
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:12,469
You mean there's hope, sir?

931
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,977
I mean nothing of the sort.

932
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:15,171
Let's put all that aside.

933
01:19:15,212 --> 01:19:16,873
There's just one thing
that matters.

934
01:19:16,914 --> 01:19:20,748
Did Gordon or did he not receive
a direct order to return?

935
01:19:20,785 --> 01:19:21,945
He did.

936
01:19:21,986 --> 01:19:24,216
Could Gordon or could he not be
standing there in front of me?

937
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:25,415
He could.

938
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,185
Then, Colonel Stewart...

939
01:19:27,224 --> 01:19:29,886
does your presence here
confirm or deny...

940
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:31,861
Gordon's total disobedience?

941
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:35,593
- It confirms it.
- It's blackmail!

942
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:38,693
A man--one man--
in the middle of Africa...

943
01:19:38,736 --> 01:19:41,034
is blackmailing
the British government...

944
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:42,505
into a course of action...

945
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,440
it wouldn't otherwise
choose to take.

946
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,102
I don't agree, sir.

947
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:49,271
You don't agree?

948
01:19:49,313 --> 01:19:53,511
Is it really blackmail
when one man...

949
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:56,042
a long way off
in a besieged desert town...

950
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,918
calls to you and says...

951
01:19:57,955 --> 01:20:00,014
"Allow these tens of thousands
of human beings...

952
01:20:00,057 --> 01:20:02,025
"to be slaughtered,
if you will.

953
01:20:02,059 --> 01:20:04,459
"It's your decision.
But allow me the privilege...

954
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:06,087
"of being slaughtered
with them"?

955
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:10,760
You see, sir, if Khartoum
is allowed to die...

956
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:13,361
then Gordon will die with it.

957
01:20:14,805 --> 01:20:17,137
It may be blackmail...

958
01:20:17,174 --> 01:20:21,110
and if it is,
then I'm for blackmail.

959
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,050
Send in Lord Wolseley.

960
01:20:32,089 --> 01:20:35,855
When I think how history
will record someday...

961
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:38,726
that the decisions
of an empire were made only...

962
01:20:38,763 --> 01:20:41,755
by greedy businessmen,
scheming generals...

963
01:20:41,799 --> 01:20:45,701
and conniving politicians...

964
01:20:45,736 --> 01:20:48,261
It's up the Nile for you,
Wolseley.

965
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:52,765
Up the Nile to save
one stubborn madman.

966
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:57,406
But let me tell you,
if you do a Billy Hicks on me--

967
01:20:57,448 --> 01:21:00,542
if you take a British army
into central Africa...

968
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:03,485
and present me with
any portion of a disaster...

969
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:06,251
then don't come back.

970
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,689
Am I clear?

971
01:21:07,725 --> 01:21:09,249
You are clear.

972
01:21:09,293 --> 01:21:11,261
Colonel Stewart,
inform your General Gordon...

973
01:21:11,295 --> 01:21:12,956
that a British army
will be sailing...

974
01:21:12,997 --> 01:21:16,091
as quickly as possible
for Cairo.

975
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:18,067
Thank you, sir.

976
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:19,296
Sir.

977
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,008
Khaleel.

978
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:54,208
Get me Colonel Stewart's man,
Khaleel.

979
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,444
Sir.

980
01:25:01,657 --> 01:25:03,249
We didn't want
to come to the palace.

981
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:05,886
This is informal,
but it's serious.

982
01:25:05,928 --> 01:25:07,862
General, people are afraid.

983
01:25:07,897 --> 01:25:10,263
They have a right to be.

984
01:25:10,299 --> 01:25:12,290
What about this relief army?

985
01:25:12,334 --> 01:25:16,065
Why the hysteria?
There's still enough food.

986
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:20,166
What we're short of isn't food.
It's hope.

987
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:22,074
Power, you're English.
You know the government...

988
01:25:22,111 --> 01:25:24,079
how long they take
to make decisions.

989
01:25:24,113 --> 01:25:26,581
You all know how many weeks
it is to London...

990
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:27,775
how many weeks back.

991
01:25:27,817 --> 01:25:30,149
It could be another month
before we have word.

992
01:25:30,186 --> 01:25:32,211
I'm an old friend,
you believe me.

993
01:25:32,254 --> 01:25:35,587
I tell you, in the bazaars,
I hear things.

994
01:25:35,624 --> 01:25:36,921
It isn't good.

995
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:41,692
What am I supposed to give them,
promises I can't keep?

996
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,925
Tell them lies
to keep up morale?

997
01:25:43,966 --> 01:25:46,594
Maybe small lies. Just a few.

998
01:25:46,635 --> 01:25:48,262
Little ones?

999
01:25:53,075 --> 01:25:54,736
Khaleel!

1000
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:56,267
Yes, master? Good morning.

1001
01:25:56,312 --> 01:25:57,540
It is such a pleasant thing to--

1002
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,514
Khaleel,
what are you doing here?

1003
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:01,015
Where is Colonel Stewart?

1004
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:02,608
Yes, master, I do not know.

1005
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:04,346
But as I was saying,
that little place, Debba...

1006
01:26:04,386 --> 01:26:05,819
by the river,
is the most boring place--

1007
01:26:05,855 --> 01:26:07,618
- Khaleel!
- I'm to be home.

1008
01:26:07,656 --> 01:26:10,523
Yes, the Major Kitchener
sends his greetings.

1009
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:13,027
Most interesting man,
the Major Kitchener.

1010
01:26:23,505 --> 01:26:25,564
It's Stewart.
He's sailed from England...

1011
01:26:25,608 --> 01:26:27,803
with Wolseley and 7,000 men!

1012
01:26:29,311 --> 01:26:30,835
They're coming!

1013
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,905
The British are coming!

1014
01:26:58,107 --> 01:27:01,975
I do not have the ingredient
here, Gordon Pasha...

1015
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,603
but if you will come back
to the palace...

1016
01:27:03,646 --> 01:27:06,137
I will make you a B & S.

1017
01:27:15,357 --> 01:27:17,985
Squad, attention!

1018
01:27:18,027 --> 01:27:20,257
Stand the camels.

1019
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:24,265
Mount!

1020
01:27:59,234 --> 01:28:01,566
You--did you come here
on holiday?

1021
01:28:01,603 --> 01:28:03,901
You think you've come
to Egypt on leave?

1022
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:05,429
Look at those buttons--filthy.

1023
01:28:05,474 --> 01:28:07,135
Look at this. Disgraceful.

1024
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:08,575
What would Her Majesty say?

1025
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:10,305
You there, stand up.

1026
01:28:10,346 --> 01:28:13,315
I don't say
it isn't necessary, sir...

1027
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:15,283
but we've been in Egypt
for six weeks now...

1028
01:28:15,317 --> 01:28:18,047
and the Nile is falling.

1029
01:28:18,087 --> 01:28:20,385
What I feel I must point out...

1030
01:28:20,422 --> 01:28:22,822
is that the fall of the Nile
in Khartoum...

1031
01:28:22,858 --> 01:28:25,759
comes two months earlier
than here in Cairo.

1032
01:28:25,794 --> 01:28:28,058
And that when the Nile
has fallen sufficiently...

1033
01:28:28,097 --> 01:28:30,031
Khartoum will be defenseless.

1034
01:28:30,065 --> 01:28:32,966
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.

1035
01:28:33,002 --> 01:28:35,470
But you know as well as I do...

1036
01:28:35,504 --> 01:28:37,802
that men who have not been
fully conditioned...

1037
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,967
to the tropical climate
simply cannot fight.

1038
01:28:40,009 --> 01:28:43,172
They'll die... by the platoons,
by the company.

1039
01:28:43,212 --> 01:28:46,147
I agree, sir,
but couldn't you send ahead...

1040
01:28:46,181 --> 01:28:50,447
a detachment
of your best-conditioned men?

1041
01:28:50,486 --> 01:28:52,750
No, Stewart.

1042
01:28:52,788 --> 01:28:54,380
I'm sorry.

1043
01:28:55,657 --> 01:28:57,887
Excuse me.

1044
01:29:00,562 --> 01:29:03,030
Don't be too hard on Wolseley.

1045
01:29:03,065 --> 01:29:04,657
You haven't seen
his instructions yet.

1046
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,565
I was there.
He's to relieve Khartoum.

1047
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:08,502
Colonel, I've seen the orders.

1048
01:29:08,537 --> 01:29:12,132
He's to bring out Gordon.
There's no mention of Khartoum.

1049
01:29:12,174 --> 01:29:13,766
Wolseley knows.

1050
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:17,677
He's to proceed up the Nile
as slowly as possible.

1051
01:29:17,713 --> 01:29:21,308
He'll move up to Wadi Halfa
shortly, yes, but he knows.

1052
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,285
He's to give Gordon every
chance at the last minute...

1053
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:26,583
to come out by his own choice.

1054
01:29:26,622 --> 01:29:28,385
But Gordon won't come out.

1055
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:30,153
You know it.
I now know it.

1056
01:29:30,192 --> 01:29:31,682
I'm sure
that Wolseley knows it.

1057
01:29:31,727 --> 01:29:33,786
They've been friends always.
That's why I say...

1058
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:35,319
don't be too hard on him.

1059
01:29:35,364 --> 01:29:37,958
It's the government
that's unconvinced.

1060
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:43,768
I can well understand why you
haven't told me this before.

1061
01:29:43,806 --> 01:29:45,740
Why do you tell me now?

1062
01:29:45,774 --> 01:29:47,298
Because it's on the cards,
Colonel...

1063
01:29:47,342 --> 01:29:50,140
that this expedition
will be too late.

1064
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:52,010
Gordon should come out.

1065
01:29:52,047 --> 01:29:54,948
There's no one to tell him
but you.

1066
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,472
Didn't he say where
they're mounting them?

1067
01:30:20,509 --> 01:30:21,942
He does not know, Excellency.

1068
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:24,741
He saw the guns arriving,
that is all.

1069
01:30:33,122 --> 01:30:35,920
You were Gladstone's gesture
last year.

1070
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,892
This year, it's Wolseley.

1071
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:41,460
Sir, I failed.

1072
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:44,330
I thought
I'd made it clear to them...

1073
01:30:44,366 --> 01:30:46,334
that you'd never come out.

1074
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:49,098
- I didn't.
- You probably did.

1075
01:30:49,138 --> 01:30:51,766
Gladstone's a gambler.
He's gambling.

1076
01:30:51,807 --> 01:30:53,900
No, they all think
you should come out.

1077
01:30:53,942 --> 01:30:55,807
So do I.

1078
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:02,580
Sir...

1079
01:31:02,618 --> 01:31:06,145
what's the absolute limit
of time we can hold out here?

1080
01:31:06,188 --> 01:31:07,883
I don't know.

1081
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:12,656
The Mahdi's brought up the guns
he captured from Hicks.

1082
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:15,185
That means he'll start
a bombardment.

1083
01:31:16,732 --> 01:31:19,064
- How low is the ditch?
- It's low.

1084
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:21,331
And the news'll be
all over town by morning--

1085
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:24,066
the steamer arrived and no army.

1086
01:31:24,106 --> 01:31:26,700
There'll be a panic.

1087
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:29,336
Sir, you haven't got a chance.

1088
01:31:29,378 --> 01:31:31,608
I haven't got a choice.

1089
01:31:31,647 --> 01:31:34,673
If Wolseley's orders are to save
only me and not Khartoum...

1090
01:31:34,716 --> 01:31:36,206
I'm left with no choice.

1091
01:31:36,251 --> 01:31:38,242
How could I leave? Tell me.

1092
01:31:39,888 --> 01:31:44,018
What purpose is served
if Wolseley's too late...

1093
01:31:44,059 --> 01:31:46,084
and Mahdi attacks?

1094
01:31:46,128 --> 01:31:49,791
There are worse ways to die.
Many.

1095
01:31:49,831 --> 01:31:52,026
That's the essence of it,
I suppose.

1096
01:31:52,067 --> 01:31:54,627
Every man has a final weapon--

1097
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:58,436
his life--and if he's
afraid of losing it...

1098
01:31:58,473 --> 01:32:00,998
he throws that weapon away.

1099
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:03,671
That's what they
can't quite grasp...

1100
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:07,079
that I'm not really afraid.

1101
01:32:07,115 --> 01:32:10,949
And that's what they must
understand, isn't it?

1102
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:15,989
No one can make them
understand it except me.

1103
01:32:17,893 --> 01:32:20,657
You must be tired.

1104
01:32:20,696 --> 01:32:24,530
Meet me at the dock
tomorrow, early.

1105
01:32:24,566 --> 01:32:25,760
Good night.

1106
01:32:29,938 --> 01:32:31,929
Good night, sir.

1107
01:33:13,682 --> 01:33:15,843
To get her through the blockade,
we'll have to armor the rail...

1108
01:33:15,951 --> 01:33:18,784
set up troop guns here,
another one up forward.

1109
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,755
We'll carry the extra fuel
behind in a couple of luggers.

1110
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:24,281
I want every European
in Khartoum on this boat--

1111
01:33:24,326 --> 01:33:26,521
the wives, children,
counsels, too--

1112
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:28,085
Frank Power and Herbin...

1113
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:30,928
and every Egyptian civilian
you can stack on board.

1114
01:33:30,966 --> 01:33:32,524
You must get them all out.

1115
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:37,004
You mean I go with them,
and you stay here?

1116
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:39,166
Khartoum is my problem.

1117
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,402
Getting these people out
is yours.

1118
01:33:41,443 --> 01:33:45,539
How else can I convince London
that I will not leave?

1119
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,378
But you'll be completely alone.

1120
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:49,941
It's a gesture.

1121
01:33:49,985 --> 01:33:53,477
Come, little lady.

1122
01:33:53,522 --> 01:33:54,955
We'll take you back home.

1123
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:57,322
Mr. Gladstone must understand...

1124
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,556
that I am capable
of gestures, too.

1125
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:03,725
Hassan!

1126
01:34:35,063 --> 01:34:40,296
I don't ask you to be unafraid,
simply to act unafraid.

1127
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:54,877
How are you going
to handle Khartoum...

1128
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:56,679
when the word gets around
that we're gone?

1129
01:34:56,718 --> 01:34:58,276
How are you going
to handle Berber...

1130
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,118
if Mohammed al Khalia
has heavy guns?

1131
01:35:01,156 --> 01:35:02,783
We sink.

1132
01:35:02,824 --> 01:35:05,850
We'll both take our chances.

1133
01:35:05,894 --> 01:35:08,124
There are several letters
in here--

1134
01:35:08,163 --> 01:35:12,759
appeals to Her Majesty
the Queen, the Pope in Rome...

1135
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:14,632
the Sultan in Constantinople.

1136
01:35:14,669 --> 01:35:16,796
They're all for public display.

1137
01:35:16,838 --> 01:35:20,899
There's only one appeal
that matters--Wolseley.

1138
01:35:20,942 --> 01:35:23,342
And through Wolseley,
Gladstone.

1139
01:35:23,378 --> 01:35:27,280
Perhaps now
you can convince him.

1140
01:35:27,315 --> 01:35:28,976
Get through.

1141
01:35:29,017 --> 01:35:30,985
You'll get through.

1142
01:35:34,022 --> 01:35:36,013
Good luck.

1143
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:44,162
Gordon Pasha,
we are ready to sail.

1144
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:46,133
Thank you, Hassan.

1145
01:36:16,064 --> 01:36:18,362
Why didn't we go, Gordon Pasha?

1146
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,698
Why wasn't I on the boat,
Gordon Pasha?

1147
01:36:20,735 --> 01:36:22,396
I should've gone on the boat.

1148
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:48,591
This is Metemmah.
We'll refuel.

1149
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,598
Beyond here,
the shore is held solidly...

1150
01:36:50,632 --> 01:36:52,099
by Mahdi's tribesmen...

1151
01:36:52,133 --> 01:36:54,260
so you better go ashore
and stretch your legs.

1152
01:36:54,302 --> 01:36:55,735
Be your last chance.

1153
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:58,000
Firewood? We have no firewood.

1154
01:36:58,039 --> 01:36:59,301
Well, trees.

1155
01:36:59,341 --> 01:37:00,501
Trees? Do you see trees?

1156
01:37:00,542 --> 01:37:02,601
Yes, a mile or two
from the town...

1157
01:37:02,644 --> 01:37:04,441
and Egyptians
hanging from them--

1158
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:06,276
I need fuel.
Tear out the dock!

1159
01:37:12,721 --> 01:37:14,780
Come on!

1160
01:37:31,106 --> 01:37:33,074
This is all we have left?

1161
01:37:33,108 --> 01:37:34,803
This is all we have left.

1162
01:37:34,843 --> 01:37:38,176
Excellency, do not blame
the superintendent.

1163
01:37:38,213 --> 01:37:40,443
Someone presented
orders for grain...

1164
01:37:40,482 --> 01:37:42,780
with your forged signature
and seal.

1165
01:37:42,817 --> 01:37:44,751
He sold it in the town
for profit.

1166
01:37:44,786 --> 01:37:47,346
Find him.
He will be executed.

1167
01:37:48,823 --> 01:37:50,757
For how long shall we eat?

1168
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:54,785
The garrison will eat
for about two weeks.

1169
01:37:54,829 --> 01:37:56,524
The town...

1170
01:37:56,565 --> 01:37:59,090
Requisition all stocks of grain
in the hands of merchants.

1171
01:37:59,134 --> 01:38:00,431
There is little, Gordon Pasha.

1172
01:38:00,468 --> 01:38:04,598
All privately-owned livestock,
donkeys, goats, camels.

1173
01:38:18,086 --> 01:38:23,114
We ride beneath no more
desert stars, then.

1174
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:26,025
All things must end.

1175
01:38:27,028 --> 01:38:28,859
Take him, too.

1176
01:38:36,304 --> 01:38:38,067
We reach Berber
tomorrow morning.

1177
01:38:38,106 --> 01:38:40,097
This is the main point
of blockade...

1178
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:42,132
so we'll be attacked
from both shores.

1179
01:38:42,177 --> 01:38:43,439
If we get through...

1180
01:38:43,478 --> 01:38:46,447
it'll be luck, discipline,
and surprise.

1181
01:38:46,481 --> 01:38:48,449
Pray for surprise.

1182
01:38:48,483 --> 01:38:51,680
And pray also
that Mohammed al Khalia...

1183
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,211
has no heavy guns.

1184
01:39:01,896 --> 01:39:05,957
Can't we move any further from
the shore than this, Captain?

1185
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:07,229
I'm sorry, Stewart Pasha.

1186
01:39:07,268 --> 01:39:09,668
We're already too close
to the sand bank.

1187
01:39:46,908 --> 01:39:48,307
Full speed.

1188
01:39:52,447 --> 01:39:54,005
Number one, fire!

1189
01:39:56,484 --> 01:39:58,076
Number two, fire!

1190
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:01,415
Fire at will!

1191
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,559
They have no heavy guns.

1192
01:40:47,602 --> 01:40:49,797
We'll make it.

1193
01:40:59,147 --> 01:41:01,342
They're coming.

1194
01:41:14,362 --> 01:41:16,455
Below.

1195
01:42:00,575 --> 01:42:02,065
Salaam Malachim.

1196
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:03,737
Malachim Salaam.

1197
01:42:05,847 --> 01:42:09,214
The Mahdi and l--we look at
each other across the river...

1198
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,047
we assault each other
with assurance.

1199
01:42:11,085 --> 01:42:14,486
Mostly the assurance
that we're still here.

1200
01:42:14,522 --> 01:42:16,888
I'm late. Forgive me.

1201
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:18,483
Where is the army?

1202
01:42:21,129 --> 01:42:23,859
For whom do you speak,
Sheikh Osman?

1203
01:42:23,898 --> 01:42:26,696
For myself,
for the leaders of our people.

1204
01:42:30,538 --> 01:42:32,802
We do not come to you,
Gordon Pasha...

1205
01:42:32,841 --> 01:42:34,274
with cries and wails...

1206
01:42:34,309 --> 01:42:36,072
"Why did you not send us
down the river...

1207
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,270
"beyond the fringe of danger?"

1208
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,075
We are not of Egypt.

1209
01:42:39,113 --> 01:42:40,910
We are Sudanese.

1210
01:42:40,949 --> 01:42:42,712
And this is our country...

1211
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,685
and this is our people
within these walls.

1212
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,745
When does the army come?

1213
01:42:48,857 --> 01:42:52,816
Good sirs, I can only
tell you what I know.

1214
01:42:52,861 --> 01:42:57,264
I sent Stewart Pasha downriver
to urge all possible haste.

1215
01:42:57,298 --> 01:42:58,890
It has been ten days.

1216
01:42:58,933 --> 01:43:02,369
He should have reached
Major Kitchener in five or six.

1217
01:43:02,403 --> 01:43:04,064
It should not be long.

1218
01:43:04,105 --> 01:43:05,504
How long?

1219
01:43:07,175 --> 01:43:09,575
The Nile is low, Gordon Pasha.

1220
01:43:09,677 --> 01:43:13,408
Bellies grow empty.
Men feed on fear.

1221
01:43:13,448 --> 01:43:18,044
You do not have this fear
of death yourself, Excellency?

1222
01:43:18,086 --> 01:43:20,611
It's a luxury
I've put behind me.

1223
01:43:20,655 --> 01:43:24,284
You are exceptional.

1224
01:43:24,325 --> 01:43:27,783
Gordon Pasha, when we accepted
your protection...

1225
01:43:27,829 --> 01:43:29,797
for ourselves
and for our people...

1226
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:33,096
the Mahdi marked our souls
for damnation.

1227
01:43:33,134 --> 01:43:34,328
We were not afraid.

1228
01:43:34,369 --> 01:43:35,859
We trusted you.

1229
01:43:35,904 --> 01:43:38,236
Did we choose correctly?

1230
01:43:38,273 --> 01:43:40,605
You could not choose otherwise.

1231
01:43:40,642 --> 01:43:42,735
It was against
your convictions.

1232
01:43:42,777 --> 01:43:46,611
We now speak of life and death,
not convictions.

1233
01:43:50,785 --> 01:43:53,948
Do you propose going over
to the Mahdi?

1234
01:43:53,988 --> 01:43:55,888
We propose nothing.

1235
01:43:55,924 --> 01:43:58,688
We ask, "Where is the army?"

1236
01:43:58,726 --> 01:44:00,318
I don't know.

1237
01:44:00,361 --> 01:44:03,455
I am wondering,
is there an army?

1238
01:44:03,498 --> 01:44:06,990
Don't call me a liar!

1239
01:44:07,035 --> 01:44:09,003
I beg of you...

1240
01:44:09,037 --> 01:44:12,006
or I shall have
to lock you up.

1241
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,632
We are locked up now.

1242
01:44:13,675 --> 01:44:15,768
Sheikh Osman...

1243
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:18,870
you are Khartoum's
most respected citizen.

1244
01:44:18,913 --> 01:44:20,938
If you leave,
the city's spirit will break.

1245
01:44:20,982 --> 01:44:22,313
It will surely fall.

1246
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:24,716
And you will be responsible
for its massacre.

1247
01:44:24,752 --> 01:44:27,016
I have no choice but to stay.

1248
01:44:27,055 --> 01:44:29,250
I repeat--
you have us locked in.

1249
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:32,157
- Gordon Pasha--
- Wait!

1250
01:44:32,193 --> 01:44:36,630
If you were given the choice,
you still could not do this.

1251
01:44:36,664 --> 01:44:39,155
You could not leave Khartoum.

1252
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,830
When one cannot choose,
one can never know.

1253
01:44:43,871 --> 01:44:46,999
But you will understand,
will you not, Excellency...

1254
01:44:47,041 --> 01:44:48,633
that there are those
among us...

1255
01:44:48,676 --> 01:44:51,144
more afraid of death
than yourself.

1256
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:53,647
We cannot all be exceptional.

1257
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:10,297
Gordon Pasha, the police.

1258
01:45:10,331 --> 01:45:12,993
They have the man
who stole the grain.

1259
01:45:28,616 --> 01:45:32,416
Awaan, is this true?

1260
01:45:40,661 --> 01:45:43,061
Tomorrow morning.

1261
01:45:59,647 --> 01:46:03,811
Firing squad, take aim!

1262
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:05,216
Fire!

1263
01:46:17,065 --> 01:46:19,829
As Governor General
of the Sudan...

1264
01:46:19,867 --> 01:46:22,597
I issue the following
proclamation--

1265
01:46:22,637 --> 01:46:26,403
at dawn tomorrow...

1266
01:46:26,441 --> 01:46:30,901
the city gate to the south
will be opened.

1267
01:46:30,945 --> 01:46:34,676
It will stand open
for three hours.

1268
01:46:34,715 --> 01:46:38,947
All inhabitants of the city who
wish to leave...

1269
01:46:38,986 --> 01:46:42,114
and seek the protection
of Mohammed Ahmed...

1270
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:44,556
known as the Mahdi...

1271
01:46:44,592 --> 01:46:46,685
will be free to do so.

1272
01:46:46,727 --> 01:46:51,528
No hindrance will be
placed in their way.

1273
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,857
I can't believe it.

1274
01:47:51,893 --> 01:47:55,294
When did you say
the others passed through?

1275
01:47:55,329 --> 01:47:57,388
A month ago.

1276
01:48:08,876 --> 01:48:10,844
An armed steamer
called the Abbas...

1277
01:48:10,878 --> 01:48:12,846
passed through Metemmah
downstream a month ago...

1278
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,313
and is since unreported.

1279
01:48:14,348 --> 01:48:16,873
General Gordon had placed
all of Khartoum's Europeans...

1280
01:48:16,918 --> 01:48:18,078
aboard the steamer...

1281
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:20,679
with instructions
to run the blockade.

1282
01:48:20,721 --> 01:48:23,383
Colonel Stewart was in command.

1283
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:25,289
Stewart!

1284
01:48:25,326 --> 01:48:29,558
Are you quite sure that
General Gordon wasn't on board?

1285
01:48:29,597 --> 01:48:31,622
General Gordon
remained in Khartoum.

1286
01:48:31,666 --> 01:48:35,329
Sir, the Nile is falling.

1287
01:48:39,574 --> 01:48:42,065
What he's done is to make
a public announcement, sir...

1288
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:44,907
that cannot be misunderstood.

1289
01:48:44,946 --> 01:48:46,573
He'll never leave.

1290
01:48:46,614 --> 01:48:48,809
Gentlemen...

1291
01:48:48,849 --> 01:48:50,749
if you please.

1292
01:48:50,785 --> 01:48:53,515
We move instantly on Khartoum.

1293
01:48:53,554 --> 01:48:55,579
Only the camel corps is ready.

1294
01:48:55,623 --> 01:48:57,147
You, Sir Herbert,
will take command.

1295
01:48:57,191 --> 01:48:58,522
I will stay here
with the main force...

1296
01:48:58,559 --> 01:49:00,117
moving up as soon as possible.

1297
01:49:00,161 --> 01:49:03,096
But you will go ahead
by water to Debba...

1298
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:04,654
make a formation there...

1299
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:06,826
and then take the desert
crossing to Metemmah...

1300
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:09,301
there to embark for Khartoum.

1301
01:49:09,337 --> 01:49:11,703
Kitchener knows the route
and the wells.

1302
01:49:11,739 --> 01:49:13,730
Move, gentlemen.

1303
01:49:23,718 --> 01:49:24,946
Stand your camels.

1304
01:49:26,387 --> 01:49:27,684
Mount!

1305
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:36,897
Advance in a column of sections
from the right.

1306
01:49:36,931 --> 01:49:38,421
Walk!

1307
01:50:31,352 --> 01:50:33,320
Did you pack the powder tightly?

1308
01:50:33,354 --> 01:50:34,685
Yes, Gordon Pasha.

1309
01:50:34,722 --> 01:50:36,553
All right, then.

1310
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:39,457
No, not too much sand
on the fuse, men.

1311
01:50:39,493 --> 01:50:41,791
Give it plenty of air to burn.

1312
01:50:49,003 --> 01:50:54,407
Now, you see, by firing this
pistol into the tinderbox...

1313
01:50:54,442 --> 01:50:57,900
we can set off as many fuses
as we have running into them.

1314
01:51:03,818 --> 01:51:06,343
Like this.

1315
01:51:18,799 --> 01:51:20,596
Come along.

1316
01:51:21,602 --> 01:51:23,900
- Call your men in.
- Right. Over here.

1317
01:51:24,905 --> 01:51:26,497
Quickly.

1318
01:51:42,857 --> 01:51:46,293
Good. Should be able to set off
about twenty fuses...

1319
01:51:46,327 --> 01:51:47,760
from each tinderbox.

1320
01:51:47,795 --> 01:51:49,456
I'll want at least 400 pots.

1321
01:51:49,497 --> 01:51:51,226
The whole approach to the city
must be mined.

1322
01:51:51,265 --> 01:51:52,857
Yes, Gordon Pasha.

1323
01:52:31,205 --> 01:52:32,604
Halt!

1324
01:52:35,743 --> 01:52:38,871
Form battle square.
Take up action stations.

1325
01:52:38,913 --> 01:52:41,040
Down!

1326
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:52,218
By now the Christian soldiers
are on the river.

1327
01:53:52,253 --> 01:53:54,619
- Attack, beloved one.
- Attack now, holy person.

1328
01:53:54,655 --> 01:53:57,556
There is no more time.
It is the moment.

1329
01:53:57,591 --> 01:54:01,618
Beloved one, give me the word.

1330
01:54:01,662 --> 01:54:04,324
Do I make my preparations?

1331
01:54:10,104 --> 01:54:13,096
Send me the one
who writes English words.

1332
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:55,444
- Wonderful!
- Gentlemen, what is this?

1333
01:54:55,482 --> 01:54:56,642
Excellency!

1334
01:54:56,684 --> 01:54:58,618
From Major Kitchener,
a message at last!

1335
01:54:58,652 --> 01:55:01,450
British soldiers have crossed
the desert at Metemmah.

1336
01:55:01,488 --> 01:55:03,479
They approach Khartoum
on the river!

1337
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,684
And Stewart Pasha?

1338
01:55:07,728 --> 01:55:09,320
He's safe, Excellency.

1339
01:55:09,363 --> 01:55:11,160
Their bus was delayed,
but it is safe.

1340
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:14,190
But the messenger says, so
you'll know the news is true...

1341
01:55:14,234 --> 01:55:16,702
"Stewart Pasha still has
the ring you gave him."

1342
01:55:17,705 --> 01:55:22,074
Give the man money,
something to eat.

1343
01:55:24,745 --> 01:55:27,578
The messenger
from the Major Kitchener...

1344
01:55:27,615 --> 01:55:29,913
eats and says thank you.

1345
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:32,585
He's very brave.

1346
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:35,589
I said to the messenger,
"Is it true that...

1347
01:55:35,623 --> 01:55:37,591
"the Major Kitchener
has big dark eyes...

1348
01:55:37,625 --> 01:55:39,252
"like flies in the night?"

1349
01:55:39,293 --> 01:55:40,920
And he say it's true...

1350
01:55:40,961 --> 01:55:43,930
that his eyes
are like black daggers...

1351
01:55:43,964 --> 01:55:45,955
and before them,
all men tremble.

1352
01:55:47,635 --> 01:55:52,800
The Major Kitchener has eyes
as blue as little flowers.

1353
01:55:53,974 --> 01:55:55,271
The man was bragging.

1354
01:55:55,309 --> 01:55:58,335
He'd never seen Kitchener.
He didn't want to say so.

1355
01:55:58,379 --> 01:56:00,904
That's true, master.

1356
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:04,447
If he was lying...

1357
01:56:04,485 --> 01:56:07,943
how could he know about that
ring I gave Stewart Pasha?

1358
01:56:07,988 --> 01:56:11,219
Anyway, if the Mahdi wanted
to send me a false message...

1359
01:56:11,258 --> 01:56:13,226
why would he say
the soldiers were coming?

1360
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,921
It makes no sense, Khaleel.

1361
01:56:15,929 --> 01:56:17,726
That is right, master.

1362
01:57:02,976 --> 01:57:06,434
Tell Abdullah he may make
his preparations.

1363
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,414
Then he must come to me.

1364
01:58:07,474 --> 01:58:10,034
Where did you get this?

1365
01:58:11,245 --> 01:58:14,703
The Mahdi asks you to come
to his tent in peace.

1366
01:58:14,748 --> 01:58:18,047
A faluka awaits you
at the ivory trader's dock.

1367
01:58:18,085 --> 01:58:23,955
I am his first Khalifa Abdullah,
and I remain here.

1368
01:58:25,092 --> 01:58:27,083
I am your hostage.

1369
01:58:28,595 --> 01:58:31,564
You will not regard it
as a discourtesy, I hope...

1370
01:58:31,598 --> 01:58:33,589
if I lock you in.

1371
01:58:49,616 --> 01:58:52,779
If I'm not back by dawn,
you'll be shot.

1372
01:59:02,696 --> 01:59:05,597
Welcome, Gordon Pasha.

1373
01:59:05,632 --> 01:59:07,224
Come in peace.

1374
01:59:07,267 --> 01:59:10,259
How did this come to you?

1375
01:59:11,572 --> 01:59:14,871
It came to you with
the greetings of your friend...

1376
01:59:14,908 --> 01:59:18,241
far down the river,
Sheikh Ali lbrahim...

1377
01:59:18,278 --> 01:59:20,007
of the Manasir people.

1378
01:59:20,047 --> 01:59:22,709
Sheikh Ali lbrahim
has been induced...

1379
01:59:22,749 --> 01:59:27,550
by my friend and great emir
Mohammed al Khalia...

1380
01:59:27,588 --> 01:59:30,352
to acknowledge me
as the Expected One...

1381
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,483
the true Mahdi.

1382
01:59:34,494 --> 01:59:35,791
He sends you assurance...

1383
01:59:35,829 --> 01:59:38,821
that should you care
to proceed down the Nile...

1384
01:59:38,866 --> 01:59:40,834
he will offer you safe passage.

1385
01:59:40,868 --> 01:59:42,301
You are my guest.

1386
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:45,271
Why do you invite me here now?

1387
01:59:45,305 --> 01:59:49,241
Because the Prophet Mohammed,
blessings be upon him...

1388
01:59:49,276 --> 01:59:51,574
has appeared to me
in a vision...

1389
01:59:51,612 --> 01:59:56,914
and instructed me to attack
Khartoum with fire and sword.

1390
01:59:56,950 --> 02:00:01,410
20,000 angels will proceed
my men into battle.

1391
02:00:01,455 --> 02:00:05,118
And terror will afflict
and subdue my enemies...

1392
02:00:05,158 --> 02:00:09,527
as far as Mecca and Baghdad
and Constantinople...

1393
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:13,031
for all will know
what a truly great miracle...

1394
02:00:13,066 --> 02:00:15,193
has been done
by my Lord Mohammed.

1395
02:00:17,304 --> 02:00:23,539
I should prefer, Gordon Pasha,
that you leave Khartoum now.

1396
02:00:23,577 --> 02:00:26,273
You are not my enemy.

1397
02:00:26,313 --> 02:00:29,680
Why should your blood
sweeten the Nile?

1398
02:00:31,251 --> 02:00:33,378
What you are saying is this--

1399
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:37,220
so long as I am in Khartoum
you dread to attack...

1400
02:00:37,257 --> 02:00:40,124
for a British army is close,
and you know it well.

1401
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:43,129
A British army.

1402
02:00:48,602 --> 02:00:49,899
The message.

1403
02:00:49,937 --> 02:00:51,734
I sent the message.

1404
02:00:52,739 --> 02:00:55,401
There is no British army.

1405
02:00:55,442 --> 02:00:57,069
Your soldiers are in Egypt.

1406
02:00:57,110 --> 02:01:01,740
They play cards,
drink the liquor, pursue women.

1407
02:01:01,782 --> 02:01:05,047
Why would you send me
a false message?

1408
02:01:05,085 --> 02:01:09,112
It is sometimes wise,
Gordon Pasha...

1409
02:01:09,156 --> 02:01:12,182
to provide a man
with a few sunny hours...

1410
02:01:12,225 --> 02:01:16,628
of fraudulent hope
so that when night comes...

1411
02:01:16,663 --> 02:01:19,188
he will have a more
perfect inward vision...

1412
02:01:19,232 --> 02:01:21,894
of the truth
of his hopelessness.

1413
02:01:27,574 --> 02:01:29,542
I sent the message.

1414
02:01:29,576 --> 02:01:32,704
There is no British army.

1415
02:01:32,746 --> 02:01:34,737
You are alone.

1416
02:01:35,749 --> 02:01:37,114
Quite alone.

1417
02:01:47,094 --> 02:01:48,561
If this is true...

1418
02:01:48,595 --> 02:01:51,564
then what difference
can it make to you...

1419
02:01:51,598 --> 02:01:55,056
if one man leaves or stays?

1420
02:01:55,102 --> 02:01:58,037
It is important to me.

1421
02:01:58,071 --> 02:02:01,666
Please explain to me
the importance.

1422
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:03,676
Because I am a man of mercy!

1423
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:05,575
And I tell you go!

1424
02:02:05,612 --> 02:02:08,775
Leave in safety. Now.

1425
02:02:10,117 --> 02:02:12,085
You are not a man of mercy...

1426
02:02:12,119 --> 02:02:16,579
for your visions have not
revealed to you what mercy is...

1427
02:02:16,623 --> 02:02:19,114
and so why do you do this?

1428
02:02:19,159 --> 02:02:21,423
You are not my enemy.

1429
02:02:21,461 --> 02:02:24,555
But I am.

1430
02:02:24,598 --> 02:02:26,725
You should understand,
Mohammed Ahmed...

1431
02:02:26,767 --> 02:02:30,294
we are so alike, you and I.

1432
02:02:32,305 --> 02:02:35,604
You would welcome death,
wouldn't you...

1433
02:02:35,642 --> 02:02:38,110
if death could be
the servant of your life?

1434
02:02:38,145 --> 02:02:40,010
Wouldn't you?

1435
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:44,278
I, too.

1436
02:02:44,317 --> 02:02:47,616
If my life has a single point,
it's this--

1437
02:02:47,654 --> 02:02:50,748
I've learned to be
unafraid of death...

1438
02:02:50,791 --> 02:02:53,589
but never to be unafraid
of failure.

1439
02:02:53,627 --> 02:02:56,460
If by the act
of surrendering my life...

1440
02:02:56,496 --> 02:02:59,158
I can bring down
the world on your head...

1441
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:01,667
then it's an arrangement
I welcome.

1442
02:03:03,003 --> 02:03:04,971
Do you understand?

1443
02:03:05,005 --> 02:03:07,633
I'm sure you do.

1444
02:03:07,674 --> 02:03:11,508
If you,
as a servant of your God...

1445
02:03:11,545 --> 02:03:14,070
must use 100,000 warriors
to destroy me...

1446
02:03:14,114 --> 02:03:17,140
a solitary servant of my God...

1447
02:03:17,184 --> 02:03:21,416
then you whisper to me,
Mohammed Ahmed...

1448
02:03:21,455 --> 02:03:25,084
who will be remembered
from Khartoum--

1449
02:03:25,125 --> 02:03:27,218
your God or mine?

1450
02:03:28,728 --> 02:03:35,759
But Gordon Pasha,
why should you be remembered?

1451
02:03:35,802 --> 02:03:37,326
You are forgotten.

1452
02:03:38,338 --> 02:03:39,600
Already.

1453
02:03:42,642 --> 02:03:46,976
Is it possible
you still do not believe me?

1454
02:03:54,154 --> 02:04:00,457
I do not believe any infidel,
even you, Gordon Pasha...

1455
02:04:00,494 --> 02:04:05,090
can face a lonely death
without terror.

1456
02:04:14,941 --> 02:04:18,274
Is it the Englishman
whose name was Frank Power?

1457
02:04:28,688 --> 02:04:31,248
Is it the Frenchman
whose name was Herbin?

1458
02:04:49,242 --> 02:04:51,472
Is it not your own ring?

1459
02:05:02,222 --> 02:05:04,156
Do you leave Khartoum?

1460
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:08,627
I cannot leave Khartoum...

1461
02:05:08,662 --> 02:05:11,062
Mohammed Ahmed...

1462
02:05:11,097 --> 02:05:14,555
for I, too, perform miracles...

1463
02:05:14,601 --> 02:05:17,263
and you shall witness one.

1464
02:05:20,106 --> 02:05:26,306
While I may die of your miracle,
you will surely die of mine.

1465
02:05:51,972 --> 02:05:55,373
Sir! The river!

1466
02:06:17,964 --> 02:06:19,158
So.

1467
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,192
Here we are.

1468
02:06:31,611 --> 02:06:33,340
All right, then, gentlemen.

1469
02:07:26,633 --> 02:07:28,032
Fire!

1470
02:08:09,743 --> 02:08:11,233
Get back!

1471
02:08:34,667 --> 02:08:35,929
Fire one!

1472
02:11:12,892 --> 02:11:14,086
Well, Khaleel.

1473
02:12:47,687 --> 02:12:49,484
Take it away!

1474
02:12:51,157 --> 02:12:52,954
Where is Abdullah?

1475
02:12:54,661 --> 02:12:56,652
I forbade it.

1476
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,909
The relief came two days late.

1477
02:13:13,946 --> 02:13:15,573
Two days!

1478
02:13:15,615 --> 02:13:19,574
And for fifteen years,
the Sudanese paid the price...

1479
02:13:19,619 --> 02:13:24,420
with pestilence and famine,
the British with shame and war.

1480
02:13:24,457 --> 02:13:28,757
Within months after Gordon died,
the Mahdi died.

1481
02:13:28,795 --> 02:13:31,593
Why, we shall never know.

1482
02:13:31,631 --> 02:13:34,600
Gordon rests
in his beloved Sudan.

1483
02:13:34,634 --> 02:13:38,934
We cannot tell how long
his memory will live...

1484
02:13:38,971 --> 02:13:41,599
but there is this...

1485
02:13:41,641 --> 02:13:45,099
"A world with no room
for the Gordons...

1486
02:13:45,144 --> 02:13:49,137
"is a world that will
return to the sands."
