1
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,677
Fuck her.

2
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,245
- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

3
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,381
- Fuck her.
- This is how business is done, man.

4
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,726
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

5
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,127
You'd think we were
taking clients out

6
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,262
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

7
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,720
Which we can't even do anymore.

8
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,056
Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

9
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,234
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

10
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,693
I think it's because
the golf club

11
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:24,770
doesn't let women play there.

12
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,596
So?

13
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,474
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

14
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:32,502
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

15
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:35,605
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

16
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,273
Jesus.

17
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,342
Hey, would you look at that?

18
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,277
- Good God Almighty.
- Yikes.

19
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,346
Why don't you get
some dignity, sweetheart?

20
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,081
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

21
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,493
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

22
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,285
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

23
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,223
She's kind of hot.

24
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,226
A hot fucking mess.

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,795
Hey. Let's talk to Brian.

26
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,372
I think he might be
amenable to the idea

27
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,674
if we all present a very nice...

28
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,766
I mean, that is just
asking for it.

29
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,870
Look at that.

30
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:08,672
You know, like, you'd think
you'd learn by that age, right?

31
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:10,641
Where even are her friends?

32
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,309
Just kind of ran off somewhere?

33
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:15,379
Leaving her laying around
for anyone to pick up.

34
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,817
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.

35
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,652
Yeah? Maybe.

36
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,455
I'll go over.

37
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:25,523
- Whoa!
- Jerry!

38
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,491
My God, I didn't know

39
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,426
- you had it in you.
- To see if she's okay.

40
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,537
- Yeah, no. Of course.
- Yeah, sure.

41
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,328
- Go for it, big fella.
- Yeah. Why don't you

42
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:33,562
- go see, make sure she's okay.
- We're pulling for you.

43
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,736
- My God...
- Hey.

44
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,103
You okay?

45
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,542
What are you looking for?

46
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:44,843
Phone.

47
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,679
It's not here.

48
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:50,447
It's got to be here.
I just had it.

49
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,687
You think maybe you left it
in the bathroom or something?

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,155
No.

51
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,362
You gonna be okay?

52
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,299
Yeah.

53
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,235
How you gonna get home?

54
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:15,675
Ride... ride app.

55
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,342
Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,244
I think you might need
a phone for that.

57
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:22,314
- No.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:23,715
I know.

59
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:26,318
No.

60
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:29,822
Okay, look, I'm...
I'm headed out anyway,

61
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,723
so I can drop you off.

62
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:32,792
- No.
- It's totally fine.

63
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:33,826
It's not a problem.

64
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:34,860
- Really.
- No.

65
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,896
What are you gonna do?

66
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,297
It's fine. Come on.
It's not a problem.

67
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,334
Let's go.

68
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,370
There you go.

69
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:45,304
You got it?

70
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,640
All right, just hold on
to the railing.

71
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,243
- Yeah? You okay?
- My God.

72
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:02,588
Come on.
I just had my car cleaned.

73
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:03,923
She's fine.

74
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:06,125
No, I'm not.

75
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:08,694
I'm not gonna throw up.

76
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:09,929
I don't think.

77
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,364
No?

78
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:12,898
There you have it, sir. See?

79
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,600
She's not...
she's not gonna throw up.

80
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,380
My apartment is
a few blocks from here.

81
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:31,784
Would you want to have a drink
before hitting the hay?

82
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,521
It's literally right here.

83
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,923
You want to have,
like, one beer?

84
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,058
Yeah.

85
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,261
Could you take us to 242
Raleigh Drive instead, please?

86
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,664
It's a couple blocks.

87
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:46,366
Just put the address in the app.

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,301
Put the address in the app.

89
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,539
<i>Kumquat liqueur.</i>

90
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,708
Here we go, milady.

91
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,880
Hey, sorry about
my friends at the bar.

92
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,683
They're... they're assholes.

93
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,985
It's okay.

94
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,987
There you go.

95
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,321
You got it.

96
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,692
Do you live alone here?

97
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:15,830
No, but, my roommate's
out of town, so don't worry.

98
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:18,231
- Right.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,973
That's disgusting.

100
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,016
You're so beautiful.

101
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,951
You know what?
Do you mind if I just...

102
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:40,353
You've got a little smudge.

103
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,791
There, right there.

104
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,813
Wow.

105
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,485
I need to lie down.

106
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:13,487
Yeah, of course.

107
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:15,689
Right this way.

108
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:21,561
- Don't go to sleep.
- What?

109
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,899
Gosh, you're so pretty.

110
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,501
Wait.

111
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,837
- What are you...
- It's okay.

112
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,373
Hey, you're safe.

113
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,375
What are you...?

114
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,777
Hey, it's okay.

115
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,880
- You're safe.
- What are you doing?

116
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,883
My God, your body.

117
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,851
What are you doing?

118
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,825
What are you doing?

119
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,693
Wait.

120
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:55,863
What are you...?

121
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:11,579
Hey.

122
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:14,149
Hey.

123
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,451
I said, what are you doing?

124
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,411
Walk of shame!

125
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,649
Good time last night,
sweetheart?

126
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,117
There it goes straight up!

127
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,418
There you go!

128
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:26,555
Get yourself some Plan B!

129
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:30,125
- How much, baby? How much?
- Fuck that!

130
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,194
- What's wrong, baby?
- What's up?

131
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,896
Can't take a joke?
Jesus, lady, what's up?

132
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,465
Come on, why don't you give us
a little smile?

133
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,938
- Stop staring.
- What the fuck you staring at?

134
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,640
Stop it.
You can't take a joke?

135
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,441
Okay. Fuck you, then.

136
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,077
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

137
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,079
Everything all right?

138
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,549
I had to work late.

139
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:34,655
I thought the coffee house
closed at 9:00.

140
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,860
We had to do inventory.

141
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,499
You have to do a lot
of inventory at that place.

142
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,868
You should speak to the manager.

143
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,870
I will.

144
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,574
<i>You know, I was talking</i>

145
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:55,978
to Graham earlier,
and he says there's a position

146
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,846
opening up at head office.

147
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,880
And don't freak out,

148
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:01,583
but I want you to know
I recommended you for it.

149
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,219
- Hi. Can...
- Why would you do that?

150
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,254
'Cause you're stinking up
the joint

151
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,621
with your sad little face.

152
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,056
But I like it here.

153
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,591
No, you don't.

154
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,594
No, I don't, but I like you.

155
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,062
And I like...

156
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,266
Hello?

157
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,867
Working in
a customer-facing role.

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,136
- Great. Can I get some...
- No.

159
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,106
- Cassie.
- Don't "Cassie" me.

160
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,741
I'm fine. Gail, really.

161
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:30,713
Johnny said he saw you
at The Fallout last week.

162
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,882
Said you were completely
hammered and on your own.

163
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,718
He was a little worried. I know
it's none of my business...

164
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:38,654
He must have seen someone else.
I've never been there.

165
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,159
Okay.

166
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,564
<i>I like your pigtails.</i>

167
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:49,932
<i>Thank you.</i>

168
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:51,601
<i>Hey, you want another drink?</i>

169
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,770
<i>I don't think...</i>

170
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,671
<i>Hey, let me get you one.
Vodka cranberry</i>

171
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:58,275
<i>for the lady, please.</i>

172
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,910
<i>Hey. How old are you?</i>

173
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:02,312
<i>- Old enough, right?</i>

174
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,979
Can I get a coffee, please?

175
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:49,059
You want milk?

176
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,101
What?

177
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,369
Cassandra?

178
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:01,872
- Yeah.
- Ryan.

179
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:05,109
Cooper. We were in class
together at Forrest Med School.

180
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,377
Second-year neurology,
Dr. Hadid's class.

181
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,846
Yeah.

182
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,248
Ryan. Hi.

183
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:14,151
God. Why are you working here?

184
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,718
Or...

185
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,855
I didn't mean...

186
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,124
That was rude. I didn't...

187
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:22,127
You didn't mean,
what am I doing working

188
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,894
in a shitty coffee shop?

189
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,232
Yeah. No. I just meant,
you know, given...

190
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,743
- There's no getting out of this, is there?
- Nuh.

191
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,703
I'm gonna leave.
Can I leave and then come back?

192
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,705
And I can do it...
I can do it again

193
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:37,308
- and be better next time.
- You want milk?

194
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,775
Pardon?

195
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,811
In your coffee.

196
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,745
No.

197
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:44,415
But, you can spit in it
if you want.

198
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:45,749
I-I deserve that.

199
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,860
Thank you.

200
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,201
Do you want to go out with me?

201
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:03,768
What?

202
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,905
On a... date.

203
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,343
Seriously?
I just spat in your coffee.

204
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,324
And then I like to finish always

205
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,926
with a little dab of gloss

206
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,329
just to give it
a kind of wet texture.

207
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,831
Just dab in the middle...

208
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:36,100
and on the top.

209
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,272
And there you go.

210
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:44,108
Perfect blow job lips.

211
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,777
So,

212
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,845
don't forget to like
and subscribe.

213
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,481
Thank you, guys, for following.

214
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,816
I love you. Bye.

215
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,291
Seriously, you got to read it.

216
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:02,861
<i>Consider the Lobster</i> is
one of the fucking greats, man.

217
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,331
Cracked my head open like a...

218
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,233
like a lobster claw.

219
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,107
You know, I'm actually
writing a novel.

220
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,141
Well, kind of,

221
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,510
'cause I'm such a fucking
perfectionist, you know?

222
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:20,145
It's just taking me forever.

223
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,815
I just keep going over it
and over it and over it

224
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:25,384
in my head,
just picking at it like a scab.

225
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,219
It's about, I guess, like,

226
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,555
what it's like to be a guy
right now, you know?

227
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,991
Like, what it's like to be
a guy in the world.

228
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:35,094
Just this gritty,
low-life, fucked-up love story.

229
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:37,063
And it all takes place
in New York

230
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,332
over the course of one night.

231
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,534
You know what?

232
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,470
I'm gonna stop talking about it.

233
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,472
I don't want to jinx it.

234
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,040
You do coke, right?

235
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:49,542
- Not really.
- Come on.

236
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,512
I got work in the morning.

237
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,547
Whatever. So do I.

238
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,285
Here.

239
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,986
Get right.

240
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:01,655
No.

241
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:04,790
Just put your nose up to this.

242
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,360
No, here. Maybe just...

243
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,197
Okay, that didn't work.

244
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:18,306
Hey. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

245
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,274
There you go.

246
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:30,318
My God, you are so, so pretty.

247
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,586
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

248
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,155
Do you mind me asking?

249
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,524
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

250
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:39,160
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

251
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,928
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

252
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,930
It's just this
soul-sucking system

253
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,434
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

254
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,274
I want to see you.

255
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:55,942
The real you.

256
00:15:55,975 --> 00:16:00,113
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

257
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:07,488
I don't feel good.

258
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:09,557
Could you get me
a glass of water?

259
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,992
Yeah. Sure.

260
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,273
Are you fucking kidding me?

261
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:29,511
Hey.

262
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:31,278
Hey, you.

263
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,915
Hey!

264
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,384
Hey.

265
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,619
There you are.

266
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,153
You fell asleep.

267
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:48,229
Good girl.

268
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:51,499
Feel better?

269
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:54,001
No.

270
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,536
You know, I...

271
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:58,005
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

272
00:16:58,038 --> 00:16:59,674
And I am so glad that I did.

273
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,976
I feel such a connection to you.

274
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:04,012
Could you call me a cab?

275
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,214
You just got here.

276
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,417
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

277
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,352
Don't go.

278
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:12,154
Stay.

279
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,289
My God, you are so...

280
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:15,957
I need to go.

281
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,993
No, you don't want to go home.

282
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,262
I need to go home.

283
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:36,378
- Hey, Neil.
- Yeah?

284
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,049
I said I need to go home.

285
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,051
Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

286
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,219
What is this?

287
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,763
Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

288
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,223
Why do you say that?

289
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,058
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

290
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:50,493
- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

291
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:51,594
Fuck.

292
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:52,695
Yeah.

293
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:54,130
Well, I'm not.

294
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,032
But that's good, isn't it?

295
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,234
I think you should leave.

296
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,470
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

297
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:03,206
I just... I'm really high.

298
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,208
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

299
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,742
I don't know what I'm doing.

300
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,178
I think you should go.

301
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:12,148
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

302
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,183
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

303
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,386
I'm a nice guy.

304
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,288
Are you?

305
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:20,724
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

306
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,226
A connection?

307
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,060
Okay.

308
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:26,996
What do I do for a living?

309
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,666
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

310
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,435
How old am I?

311
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,405
How long have I lived
in the city?

312
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,108
What are my hobbies?

313
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,580
What's my name?

314
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,284
All right.

315
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:50,186
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

316
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,722
What do you want from me?

317
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,590
To say that I'm an asshole?

318
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,527
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

319
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,762
Whoa.

320
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,797
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

321
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,265
You really need to calm down.

322
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:03,468
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

323
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,702
while I was passed out.

324
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,236
You do get points for that.

325
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,706
A few guys, meh...
they don't mind so much.

326
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,410
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

327
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,547
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

328
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,148
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

329
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,417
I don't know. Are you?

330
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,452
I am a nice guy.

331
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:24,087
You keep saying that.

332
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,758
You're not as rare as you think.

333
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,660
You know how I know?

334
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,227
No.

335
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,631
Because every week,
I go to a club,

336
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:37,770
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

337
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,873
And every...

338
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:45,176
fucking week,
a nice guy like you

339
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:48,313
comes over to see if I'm okay.

340
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:54,452
You want to fuck me still?

341
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,621
No, thank you, ma'am.

342
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,625
No one ever does.

343
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:04,596
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

344
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,498
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

345
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,683
Night, Nina.

346
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,428
What's this?

347
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,168
Mom, what's this?

348
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,604
What do you mean?

349
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:48,474
This gift.

350
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,444
It's your birthday, Cassie.

351
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,252
Yeah.

352
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:03,322
What kind of...

353
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:05,357
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

354
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:07,926
Sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

355
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,496
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

356
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,398
It was just a mistake, Mom.

357
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,966
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

358
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,734
It's not a big deal.

359
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,369
Not a big deal?

360
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:19,471
Not a big deal?

361
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:23,275
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

362
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,245
You don't want to have a party?

363
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,247
You don't want to see
your friends?

364
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,982
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

365
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:31,818
Don't joke about it. Don't.

366
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:35,455
Do you know how strange this is?

367
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:39,559
You, you're still living
here at home.

368
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,695
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

369
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:44,497
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

370
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:47,000
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

371
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,702
- Okay.
- And you...

372
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:50,813
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

373
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:53,840
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

374
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:56,609
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

375
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:59,378
- Okay?
- All my friends, they ask about you.

376
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:02,515
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

377
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,885
I-I don't know
what happened here.

378
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,722
I don't...

379
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,660
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

380
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:13,994
Okay?

381
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,796
Go ahead.

382
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,832
Yeah.

383
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:31,178
I hope you like it.

384
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,417
Thank you.

385
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,388
<i>Whoa.</i>

386
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,058
- Yeah.
- That's direct.

387
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,559
A real kick in the cunt.

388
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,929
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:48,963 --> 00:22:50,231
It's definitely the fanciest

390
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:53,033
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

391
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:53,969
So, why don't you?

392
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,904
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

393
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:59,373
Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...

394
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:01,509
<i>Single White Female</i> some girl.

395
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,778
Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

396
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:05,713
I can't afford it, Gail.

397
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:07,314
Not on what you pay me.

398
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,050
Not even a weird guy's basement.

399
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,086
So take this other job, then.

400
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,087
Take any job.

401
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,355
Are you firing me?

402
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:16,357
Maybe I should.

403
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,692
Look, you're making
the assumption

404
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,394
that I want any of it.

405
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:21,562
If I wanted a boyfriend

406
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:23,498
and a yoga class
and a house and kids

407
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,801
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

408
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,937
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

409
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,739
I don't want it.

410
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,375
But you must want something.

411
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,610
Hey.

412
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:38,047
You.

413
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,816
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

414
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,386
She spat in my coffee last time.

415
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,455
I'm back because,

416
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:50,992
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

417
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,961
That doesn't sound like me.

418
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,095
I know.

419
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,132
So I spent a few hours composing

420
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,700
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

421
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:02,972
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

422
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:05,107
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

423
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:08,444
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

424
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,980
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

425
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:14,984
so I thought I'd try you again.

426
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,119
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

427
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,522
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

428
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,424
a phone ring in the back.

429
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:24,861
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

430
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:30,600
Look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

431
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:33,636
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

432
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,638
Right. Yeah.

433
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,839
Me, neither.

434
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:40,743
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

435
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:45,015
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

436
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,151
Dating's horrible.
Everyone's horrible.

437
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,487
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

438
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,764
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

439
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:53,490
You went on a date with my mom?

440
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:54,625
Look,

441
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:57,160
I always liked you
at med school.

442
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:58,528
Okay?

443
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,631
I genuinely like you,

444
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:03,066
and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

445
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,936
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

446
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:08,805
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

447
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,909
and you can leave,
no questions asked.

448
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,677
<i>Not that you mind the killings.</i>

449
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,511
Your book is full of killings.

450
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,651
But there are things
you do hate, Lord.

451
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,920
Perfume-smelling things.

452
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,587
Lacy things.

453
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,056
Things with curly hair.

454
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,459
Hey.

455
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:30,795
You're all dressed up.

456
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,529
Where you going?

457
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:34,665
I'm going out for lunch.

458
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:36,801
With who?

459
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,535
A friend.

460
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,704
Cassie.

461
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,708
You look very pretty, honey.

462
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,012
Thank you, Dad.

463
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,615
<i>Where... where did she get</i>

464
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:52,893
- a skeleton's hand from?
- She got it...

465
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,719
It was her...
it was her grandfather's.

466
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,754
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

467
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,092
but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

468
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,162
pulled it out
and then waved it at me.

469
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,531
And I am done.

470
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,700
And I'm wondering why
I told that story.

471
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,703
Hey. There is nothing more
romantic than a disturbed woman

472
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,505
pulling a skeleton's hand
out of her vagina.

473
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,707
That's true.
That's very true.

474
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,576
No one ever pulls anything
out of anywhere where I work.

475
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:19,978
Right, so you didn't want to...

476
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,081
- What?
- Carry on with med school or...

477
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,514
No.

478
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,117
Really? Why not?

479
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,652
I wanted to do something else.

480
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,887
Why?

481
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,888
I don't know.

482
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,225
You were so good, though.
You knew everything.

483
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,227
- You...
- I didn't know everything.

484
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,595
You did.
You were incredible.

485
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,998
I was... I was awful. I...

486
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,767
Remember I removed the
wrong kidney from my cadaver?

487
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,069
And look at you now...
operating on children.

488
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,771
Yes. I got better.

489
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,275
Thank God. But you, you were
way ahead of everybody.

490
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,910
You-you would have been
a great doctor.

491
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:56,282
Just didn't want it enough,
I guess.

492
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,654
You want to get coffee
or something?

493
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,890
We, we have some time
before the movie.

494
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,260
I can tell you about the guy
who got his dick

495
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,628
trapped in a tambourine.

496
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,230
My God.

497
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:15,602
Do you think people think
you're my daughter from behind?

498
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,903
'Cause of the height.

499
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,671
- The height, I'm saying.
- No.

500
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,707
It's like a fear
I have in public,

501
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,308
if I'm with a woman.

502
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:24,744
My fear is that, like,
if I kiss her,

503
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,781
like, people will be like,
"Stop kissing that child."

504
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,650
- I shouldn't yell this part, but...
- No.

505
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,586
I mean, try not being
so tall, maybe.

506
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,588
- Don't be tall.
- Maybe, yeah.

507
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:37,157
- Yeah.
- It's kind of flashy.

508
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:42,062
Whoa. This is...
this is a weird coincidence.

509
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,297
What?

510
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,032
I think...

511
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,133
No.

512
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,668
Yeah, this is my apartment.

513
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,806
What a weird, weird coincidence.

514
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,941
Yeah. Do you want to...

515
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,342
I mean, we're here.

516
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:58,079
Do you want to go up,
have a drink or...

517
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,214
Sure. Why not?

518
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,650
Too soon. Sorry. I wasn't...

519
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:03,984
No, let's go upstairs.

520
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,954
I don't want to go up
if you don't want to...

521
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:08,698
I-I misread things.
I'll-I'll drive you home.

522
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:10,157
You know what?
You're at your place.

523
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,225
I can call a cab.

524
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,660
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

525
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:14,362
Okay, I feel like
I fucked this up.

526
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:16,865
No, it's not you.

527
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,432
Pediatric
assistant to admitting.

528
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,945
Need a pediatric assistant
to admitting, please.

529
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:57,139
- I'll let you know.
- Okay. Thank you.

530
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,008
Cassie, what...

531
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,177
What are you...
what are you doing here?

532
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:10,152
I just came to pick up
my herpes medication.

533
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:11,719
You have herpes, too.

534
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,055
That saves us
an awkward conversation.

535
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,460
Dr. Dinkins, please dial 3751.

536
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:22,029
Dr. Dinkins, 3751.

537
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:23,831
So, I...

538
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,035
So, I'd like to see you again.

539
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,972
- If that's cool.
- Yeah.

540
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,409
But we'd need to take it slow.
I understand...

541
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:36,778
Of course. Totally. I...

542
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,314
I can take it slow.

543
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:41,783
I can barely move,
if you'd like.

544
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:44,320
Thank you.

545
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:45,720
Yeah. Sorry.

546
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:46,855
I could write a poem.

547
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,089
This is awesome.

548
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,059
What are you doing? You want
to get dinner or something?

549
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:52,461
Are you working?

550
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:53,929
Well, no.

551
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:56,765
He has leukemia, and,

552
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,900
there's really nothing
I can do for him.

553
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:02,905
- My God.
- It's-it's over.

554
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:04,484
- I'm kidding. My shift's over.
- My God.

555
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:06,242
- I'll grab my stuff, okay?
- Okay.

556
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,343
Okay.

557
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,812
Don't leave.

558
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:20,723
- My God.
- What?

559
00:30:22,358 --> 00:30:24,794
Are you seeing that guy?

560
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,863
No.

561
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,768
Aw.

562
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,804
Good for you.

563
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:41,544
<i>So, Ryan...</i>

564
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,212
pediatric surgeon?

565
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:45,147
Yes. Yes.

566
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,251
You ever killed any children?

567
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:49,852
What?

568
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:50,988
While operating on them.

569
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,856
Have you ever killed
any children?

570
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:54,391
No. No.

571
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:55,459
Really?

572
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:56,526
- Gail.
- I...

573
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,464
Well, kids have passed
while I've been operating.

574
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:02,165
So that's a yes. Yes...

575
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,402
Gail, stop asking him
if he's killed children.

576
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:08,905
I will stop asking him
when he stops killing children.

577
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:12,142
That-that seems fair.

578
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:14,378
That seems fair.

579
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,346
I'll leave you two
lovebirds to it.

580
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,850
- Can you lock up for me, honey?
- Of course.

581
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:25,889
Now, if you two decide
to have sex on the counter,

582
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:28,791
the bleach is in the back room.

583
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,130
And I don't want to walk
in here tomorrow morning

584
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:34,132
and see ass prints
in the coffee grinds.

585
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:35,433
Got it?

586
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,035
Got it, lover boy?

587
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,970
Yeah.

588
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:40,837
Have fun, you two.
My God.

589
00:31:48,912 --> 00:31:50,481
She seems nice.

590
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,185
She is. She's a good friend.

591
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:57,455
Are you... are you friends with
anyone from Forrest still or...

592
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:58,922
No.

593
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,225
Really? No one? No one?

594
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,859
Really, no one.

595
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,195
My God, I can't...
I can't...

596
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,264
I can't shake them off.

597
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:10,202
You still hang out
with those guys?

598
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:12,304
They're not that bad.
They aren't, really.

599
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:13,871
My God.

600
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:17,041
Madison McPhee just had twins.

601
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,078
She's completely obsessed.

602
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:22,214
I don't remember Madison.

603
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:25,584
You...
I thought you were close.

604
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:28,620
You guys and that other girl.

605
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:30,322
No.

606
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,125
My God.

607
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:37,496
Al Monroe is marrying
this bikini model.

608
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,666
He got this hideous tattoo
of her name to propose.

609
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,234
Amazingly, she said yes.

610
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:45,371
Classic Al, you know?

611
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:47,238
Landing on his feet.

612
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:48,974
Al Monroe?

613
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,977
You... well,
you must remember Al.

614
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,912
Yeah, I thought
he moved to London.

615
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:55,280
Yeah, he was there for years,

616
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:58,451
but he just moved back
to get married.

617
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:00,185
You see him a lot?

618
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:03,656
We're not close,
but he's in the group.

619
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,525
We actually
see each other at work,

620
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:08,394
'cause he's a...
anesthesiologist.

621
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,329
Good for him.

622
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:11,997
And he's getting married?

623
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,067
I know. God help her.

624
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:01,707
Welcome to
the Hotel Saint Joan, miss.

625
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,208
Thank you.

626
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:06,778
One ginger ale
and one bottle of champagne.

627
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,415
- Don't worry. I can do that.
- But it's...

628
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,305
Cassie.

629
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:36,174
Madison.

630
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,378
My God.

631
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,682
You look amazing.

632
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:44,651
I almost didn't recognize you.

633
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:47,687
You look exactly the same.

634
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,722
- You're sweet. I look so old.
- No.

635
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,524
That's what having twins
will do to you.

636
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:52,592
It's tragic.

637
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,693
Do you have kids?

638
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:55,227
No.

639
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,195
You'll get there.

640
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:01,133
Champagne?
What are we drinking to?

641
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,469
To old friends.

642
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,553
Honestly, I thought I'd be
bored out of my skull

643
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:23,624
watching the kids,
but it's been great, actually.

644
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:26,727
Are we out already?
Can we get another bottle?

645
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,227
Thanks.

646
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,731
I haven't been day drunk
in forever.

647
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:32,766
- So fun.
- So fun.

648
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,473
TBH, I know all guys say
they want wives that work,

649
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,776
but it's not true.

650
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,377
- No?
- No.

651
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,213
I mean, they all want
a feminist in college,

652
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,557
because it's cool
to have a girlfriend

653
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,917
who cares about something.

654
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,384
And, statistically,

655
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,353
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

656
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:54,889
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

657
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,223
Really?

658
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,334
You know, when it
comes down to it,

659
00:36:57,358 --> 00:36:58,893
all guys want the same thing.

660
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,728
And what's that?

661
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,931
A good girl.

662
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:04,465
I don't seem to remember

663
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:07,534
you were that much
of a good girl in med school.

664
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:08,769
Well, Fred... Thanks.

665
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:10,404
Fred didn't know me at school.

666
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,906
He met me when I was
working at L'Oréal.

667
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,508
Poor Fred.

668
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:18,779
What he doesn't know
won't kill him, right?

669
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:20,648
I'm glad everything
has worked out

670
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:21,882
so well for you, Madison.

671
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:22,884
Thanks.

672
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,452
- It really has.
- Yeah.

673
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:28,490
You know, I actually
wanted to meet you today

674
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:30,892
to talk about something
in particular.

675
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:32,427
I did wonder.

676
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,462
No one's heard from you
in, like, forever.

677
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,400
I wanted to talk to you
about why I dropped out.

678
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:42,270
Okay, sure.

679
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,673
You remember
what happened, right?

680
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,411
S-such a long time ago now.

681
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:51,646
I know, but you remember.

682
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,316
I mean, vaguely.

683
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,686
Do you ever think about it?

684
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,922
Why would I?

685
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:03,392
Right. Why would you?

686
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,396
So, if a friend came to you now,

687
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,267
into your house, and told you
that they thought something bad

688
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:13,845
had happened to them
the night before...

689
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:15,971
- Cassie...
- Something bad.

690
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,973
- It was years ago.
- What would you say?

691
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,842
It w...

692
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,278
- What would you say?
- I'm so...

693
00:38:23,946 --> 00:38:25,514
I feel a little weird.

694
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:27,917
Would you roll your eyes
behind her back

695
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,585
and dismiss the whole thing
as drama?

696
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,721
I don't know
why you're mad at me.

697
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:34,423
Okay, I-I'm not the only one
who didn't believe it.

698
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,726
If-if you have a reputation
for sleeping around,

699
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,694
then maybe people
aren't gonna believe you

700
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,764
when you say
something's happened.

701
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:43,033
I mean...

702
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:45,769
it's crying wolf.

703
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:49,305
You thought it was crying wolf?

704
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:51,373
I don't make the rules.

705
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,343
Look, when you get that drunk,
things happen.

706
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:57,047
Don't get blackout drunk
all the time

707
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,348
and then expect people
to be on your side

708
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,618
when you have sex
with someone you don't want to.

709
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,787
I mean...

710
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,758
That's a shame.

711
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,493
I was hoping you'd feel
differently by now.

712
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:11,962
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

713
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:14,363
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

714
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,037
Look... look, don't be mad.

715
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:22,907
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

716
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,876
It's my treat.

717
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,610
Hello?

718
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:29,781
Are you okay, Madison?

719
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,084
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

720
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,052
Shit.

721
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,788
My God.

722
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,555
Sorry.

723
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:44,361
It really is so great
seeing you again.

724
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:47,364
You really haven't
changed at all.

725
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,901
That's great.

726
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,839
So?

727
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,609
She's over there.

728
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:01,946
Room 25.

729
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:04,681
Your money's in the envelope.

730
00:40:04,715 --> 00:40:06,818
You sure about this?

731
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:08,820
I'm sure.

732
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,842
Cassie, hi.

733
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,711
Wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday.

734
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,713
Blast from the past.

735
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:37,081
Hey.

736
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,983
I was pretty drunk.

737
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,885
I can't really...

738
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:44,856
Look, did you see me talking
to a guy, like, our age?

739
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,557
He seemed to know you.

740
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,026
Just trying to piece
some things together.

741
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:52,864
Cassie, sorry.
Please call me back.

742
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,532
I-I'm freaking out a little.

743
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:56,734
I woke up in
one of the hotel rooms.

744
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:58,470
I-I think something
might have happened.

745
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,405
I-I don't know.

746
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,464
Your place, right?

747
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:31,713
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

748
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:33,639
- Excuse me.
- Bye.

749
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:36,041
Excuse me! Hi.

750
00:41:36,074 --> 00:41:37,509
- Me?
- Yeah.

751
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,977
Hi. Sorry.

752
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:40,112
What's up?

753
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:41,914
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

754
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,181
and I'm so late for work.

755
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:45,217
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

756
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,785
I guess. Why?

757
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,187
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

758
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:51,522
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

759
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,202
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

760
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:54,593
- and I...
- Music video?

761
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,071
Yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

762
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:58,698
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

763
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:00,800
- I may as well not...
- My God.

764
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:01,801
My God.

765
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,169
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

766
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:04,603
You didn't see that.

767
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:05,604
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

768
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:06,505
Don't worry about it.

769
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:07,439
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

770
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,076
My God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

771
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:12,178
My God!
Are they there right now?

772
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:14,213
You need to calm down, please.

773
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:15,681
I can direct you. Please.

774
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,583
Sorry. No.

775
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:20,955
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

776
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:22,222
I can't.

777
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,691
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

778
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:26,592
I will never work again.

779
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,128
I swear I won't post anything.

780
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:29,263
I promise.

781
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,631
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

782
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:34,101
God, okay.

783
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,202
Get in. Fine.

784
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:37,171
But you have to be
cool about this.

785
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,106
No. Of course I will.

786
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:42,977
Whoa.

787
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,644
You really are a fan.

788
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:46,747
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

789
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,083
dedicated just to George's dog.

790
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:50,251
What a crazy coincidence.

791
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:51,585
I know.

792
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,520
You know what?

793
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:55,522
This... this is fate.

794
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:59,027
Sure seems like it?

795
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:13,574
Yes?

796
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:18,979
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

797
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:30,758
Daisy.

798
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,793
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

799
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:34,061
Please sit.

800
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:38,233
My assistant says that
you are interested

801
00:43:38,266 --> 00:43:40,200
in resuming med school.

802
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,602
That's right.

803
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:43,339
May I ask what prompted
your desire

804
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:45,106
to get back to your studies?

805
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,309
I guess...

806
00:43:47,343 --> 00:43:49,878
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

807
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,047
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

808
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:54,916
It's an unusual request.

809
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:58,319
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

810
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:02,190
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

811
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,260
Nina Fisher.

812
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:06,895
You don't remember her?

813
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:11,132
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

814
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,867
Yes. Alexander Monroe.

815
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,937
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

816
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,673
He's a...
he's a really nice guy.

817
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:19,808
Really smart.

818
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:21,644
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

819
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:22,878
So, you don't remember

820
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:24,880
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

821
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,382
I don't.

822
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:29,752
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

823
00:44:29,785 --> 00:44:33,756
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

824
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:36,092
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

825
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,359
and in front of his friends

826
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:40,963
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

827
00:44:40,996 --> 00:44:43,332
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

828
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:46,335
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

829
00:44:46,368 --> 00:44:48,304
Was it reported?

830
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,738
Yes.

831
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:51,774
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

832
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,009
You.

833
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,381
But you can't remember, so...

834
00:44:58,415 --> 00:45:00,649
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

835
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:01,952
You said it was too much

836
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:05,055
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

837
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:06,189
Well...

838
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:10,726
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

839
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:12,129
One or two a week.

840
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:14,797
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

841
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:16,399
but I can assure you,
at that time,

842
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,135
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

843
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:22,239
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

844
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:23,739
It's so hard.

845
00:45:23,772 --> 00:45:25,708
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

846
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:28,777
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

847
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,881
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

848
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:33,317
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

849
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:35,386
I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

850
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:37,787
I just want to be clear.

851
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:40,024
None of us want to admit

852
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:41,925
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

853
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,894
When we've made a bad choice.

854
00:45:43,927 --> 00:45:46,030
And those choices,
those mistakes,

855
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:50,034
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

856
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,438
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

857
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:56,440
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

858
00:45:56,474 --> 00:45:58,342
Ruin a young man's life

859
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,011
every time we get
an accusation like this?

860
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:03,880
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

861
00:46:03,914 --> 00:46:06,049
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

862
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:06,884
Of course you do.

863
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:09,720
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

864
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:12,224
No arguing with that.

865
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:14,326
No.

866
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,228
Thank you for your time.

867
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,264
- Is your friend okay?
- No.

868
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,798
She's not.

869
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:22,501
But Al Monroe is.

870
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:24,802
You'll be glad to hear
he's doing really well.

871
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:27,872
He's getting married, actually, so...

872
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:29,284
You know, I guess you did
the right thing.

873
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:33,110
We have to give these boys
the benefit of the doubt.

874
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:35,079
That's why I know
you won't mind that,

875
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:38,049
three hours ago, I picked your
daughter Amber up from school

876
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:40,918
and introduced her to the boys
who live in that room now.

877
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,222
- What?
- She is really pretty?

878
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:45,290
She looks
a lot older than she is.

879
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,527
- I don't believe you.
- I noticed they had a few

880
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,261
bottles of vodka
in their room, too.

881
00:46:49,294 --> 00:46:51,964
But I'm sure they'll take
good care of your daughter.

882
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:53,533
She seemed excited, actually.

883
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,477
Wait.

884
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,378
I have her phone.

885
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:08,814
She'll be wanting that later.

886
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,317
You're crazy.

887
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:13,986
No.

888
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:16,922
Tell me what room
my daughter is in right now.

889
00:47:16,955 --> 00:47:19,791
I told you...
the same room Nina was in.

890
00:47:19,825 --> 00:47:22,261
I told you
I don't remember that.

891
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:23,896
Well, that's a shame.

892
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:26,799
What are you doing?

893
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,334
She is a young girl.

894
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:32,105
I wonder if she looks so young
to those guys.

895
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:34,507
You better tell me
what room she's in.

896
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,810
Tell me what fucking room
she's in!

897
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:40,013
Now, you sociopath!

898
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:42,448
Tell me where she is!

899
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:44,284
Right now!

900
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:46,919
Tell me what room she's in!

901
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:49,789
Please!

902
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:53,960
Please tell me.

903
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:06,306
You're right, okay?

904
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:08,908
Is that what you want to hear?

905
00:48:08,941 --> 00:48:11,010
You're right.

906
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:15,049
You're right.

907
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:21,488
Look how easy it was.

908
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:24,958
I guess you just had to think
about it in the right way.

909
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:27,594
I guess it feels different

910
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:29,997
when it's someone you love.

911
00:48:32,232 --> 00:48:35,202
Tell me where
my daughter is, please.

912
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:46,979
Relax.

913
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:48,482
Dean Walker, do you really think

914
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:50,083
I would do something like that?

915
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:52,985
Luckily, I don't have as much
faith in boys as you do.

916
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:55,121
Amber is sitting in a diner,

917
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:57,558
waiting for her favorite
boy band to show up

918
00:48:57,591 --> 00:48:59,360
for a music video.

919
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:02,229
It's the Castle Diner,
if you want to call and check.

920
00:49:02,262 --> 00:49:04,298
Or you should probably call,
actually,

921
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:06,000
or she may never figure out
they're not coming.

922
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:09,136
She's kind of an idiot?

923
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:11,373
Gorgeous, though.

924
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,073
Who needs brains?

925
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:15,643
They never did a girl any good.

926
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:18,178
Great to see you again,
Dean Walker.

927
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:33,661
Hey! You're blocking the road!

928
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,131
Get out of the fucking road!

929
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:39,266
What the fuck is wrong with you?

930
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:42,002
Hey. Hey!

931
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:44,138
You're sitting in the middle
of the intersection.

932
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,939
How'd you get your license?

933
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:48,275
You blow the entire DMV?

934
00:49:48,308 --> 00:49:49,711
Hello.

935
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:51,412
I'm talking to you.

936
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,281
Look at me, you stupid cunt.

937
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:58,497
You want to have a face...
Okay, yeah.

938
00:49:58,521 --> 00:49:59,688
Come on over. Let's do this.

939
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:00,856
Where are you going?

940
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,525
You're just gonna leave
your car in the intersection?

941
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,326
You coming over here?

942
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,295
Are you angry?

943
00:50:11,332 --> 00:50:12,668
Holy shit!

944
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,737
Is that a fucking tire iron?

945
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,105
You psycho!

946
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:18,707
Just chill out, okay?

947
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:21,309
Why don't you calm down.

948
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:22,577
Okay.

949
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,479
Whoa! Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

950
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:28,150
Crazy fucking bitch.

951
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,755
Excuse me?

952
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:33,722
Fuck you.

953
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:06,121
Fuck.

954
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:18,601
Ryan, what are...?

955
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:19,735
She lives.

956
00:51:19,768 --> 00:51:21,770
I'm just kidding. You weren't
answering your phone,

957
00:51:21,804 --> 00:51:24,073
- so I was...
- Shit. The movie.

958
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:26,442
I-I'm so sorry.
I had to work late.

959
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,144
Yeah, I-I went by
the coffee shop.

960
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:31,747
Gail said you took the day off.

961
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,582
Everything all right?

962
00:51:33,616 --> 00:51:35,117
Yeah.

963
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,152
No, I'm fine. I'm just in
the middle of something.

964
00:51:37,186 --> 00:51:40,054
Totally. Got it.
We can make the movie still

965
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:41,123
if we skip dinner.

966
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:43,226
I'm a little tired.

967
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,737
- Yeah.
- Do you mind if I call you tomorrow?

968
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,795
Sure. Great.

969
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:48,130
- Okay.
- Are you okay, though?

970
00:51:48,163 --> 00:51:50,467
You seem kind of...

971
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,402
What?

972
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:55,705
Off.

973
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:58,542
No, I'm fine.
I'm just...

974
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:00,343
Too-too much... too much coffee.

975
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:02,279
Don't work in a coffee shop.

976
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:03,747
Okay.

977
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,448
All right, night.

978
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:07,417
All right, good night.

979
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,247
Here we go.

980
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,518
- Yeah, but you watch your step here.
- Whoop!

981
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:43,186
Now, when we get to the house,
you got to be quiet,

982
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:45,388
'cause I don't know if
my parents are asleep or not.

983
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,124
- Okay.
- We got to be respectful.

984
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:50,493
This is fucking surge prices.

985
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:52,597
1.2? That's...

986
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:55,365
I mean, it's not that far.

987
00:52:55,398 --> 00:52:57,200
- You can walk, right?
- I don't know.

988
00:52:57,233 --> 00:52:58,603
Let's try. Let's go.

989
00:52:58,636 --> 00:52:59,870
Come on, now.

990
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:01,404
Whoop, there we go.

991
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:03,741
You got it. That was fun.

992
00:53:03,774 --> 00:53:05,743
Yeah.

993
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:08,746
Cassie?

994
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,348
Ryan.

995
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:12,918
What are you doing here?

996
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:15,286
I'm meeting friends

997
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:19,523
'cause my schedule
cleared up last minute.

998
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:20,792
Let me explain.

999
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:22,226
It's fine. It's...

1000
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:23,494
My bad, dude.

1001
00:53:23,527 --> 00:53:25,864
I didn't know
the woman was taken, but...

1002
00:53:25,897 --> 00:53:27,531
- She's...
- She's all yours, man.

1003
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:29,467
All mine?

1004
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:33,704
Do you know her name or...?

1005
00:53:33,738 --> 00:53:35,306
Claire?

1006
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,274
- Wow.
- Pretty close.

1007
00:53:37,308 --> 00:53:38,877
Okay. Have a good night.

1008
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,578
Don't go, Ryan. Wait, please.

1009
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:42,390
Cassie, if you didn't...
if you weren't interested,

1010
00:53:42,414 --> 00:53:44,884
just, you could've just told me.

1011
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,654
That's ice-cold.

1012
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,222
That was humiliating.

1013
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:52,658
Why don't you just
fuck off now, okay?

1014
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,594
Wait, are you sober?

1015
00:53:55,627 --> 00:53:57,329
Shit.

1016
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:59,331
You're that psycho
that Jerry took home.

1017
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:00,708
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1018
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:02,501
You know what?
Not interested, sweetheart.

1019
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,670
Nah. Why don't you take
your crazy somewhere else.

1020
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,272
You're not even that hot.

1021
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:10,609
You're hardly dropping
panties yourself, Paul.

1022
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:14,179
When was the last time
you scored in daylight?

1023
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,782
Careful.

1024
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:19,519
No, you be careful.

1025
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:22,321
I'm not the only one
who does this.

1026
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:25,591
And some of the other girls,
they really are crazy.

1027
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:29,362
I-I don't believe you.

1028
00:54:29,395 --> 00:54:33,332
There's a woman in this city
that carries a pair of scissors.

1029
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:36,969
You're-you're lying.

1030
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:39,572
Try it out next time you go out.

1031
00:54:39,605 --> 00:54:41,674
See what happens.

1032
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:45,278
Why?

1033
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:47,814
Why you guys have to ruin
everything?!

1034
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:11,838
Can I help you?

1035
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,673
I really hope so.

1036
00:55:13,706 --> 00:55:16,609
I'm sorry. I'm no longer
practicing the law,

1037
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:18,878
if that's what you've come for.

1038
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:20,947
It's not about that.

1039
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:23,817
I'm afraid it's
your day of reckoning.

1040
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:28,856
I've been waiting.

1041
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:30,591
Come in.

1042
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:38,999
<i>Your office told me
you're on sabbatical.</i>

1043
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:40,768
It was very easy
to get your address.

1044
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:42,069
They just gave it to me.

1045
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:44,905
I told them to give it
to anyone who asked.

1046
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:46,539
That doesn't seem safe.

1047
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:49,275
No use hiding from the piper.

1048
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:51,845
He has to be paid.

1049
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,981
I guess so.

1050
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:58,018
You seem nervous, Mr. Green.

1051
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:00,419
I came here to talk to you
about something

1052
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:02,055
that happened seven years ago.

1053
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,992
You probably
won't remember a client

1054
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:06,094
named Alexander Monroe.

1055
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:09,496
You helped so many boys
like him.

1056
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,565
And you most certainly
won't remember the girl

1057
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:14,501
who you threatened and bullied
till she dropped her case.

1058
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:18,840
I remember her.

1059
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,643
Nina?

1060
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,778
Was that it?

1061
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:28,549
I'm sorry, I don't remember
her full name, but...

1062
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,786
It was Nina, though, wasn't it?

1063
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:37,025
Yes.

1064
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:39,426
I remember her.

1065
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:47,467
Have you come here to hurt me?

1066
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,472
Do you want me to hurt you?

1067
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:55,609
I think so.

1068
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:02,483
I-I had a... what I think
was a-an epiphany,

1069
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:07,689
but my doctors called it
a psychotic episode.

1070
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:12,594
And it was at work, so...

1071
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:15,864
so now I'm on a sabbatical.

1072
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:21,936
You know, I got a bonus for
every settlement out of court.

1073
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,039
I got another bonus
for every charge dropped.

1074
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:26,941
We all did.
There was a guy...

1075
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:32,580
His only job was to comb through
all their social media accounts

1076
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:35,483
for any compromising
information.

1077
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:38,553
He contacted old friends,
past sexual partners.

1078
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,622
You'd be amazed
how much easier it is now

1079
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:42,624
with the Internet
to dig up dirt.

1080
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:45,894
In the old days, we'd have to
go through a girl's trash.

1081
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:48,897
Now one drunk photo at a party.

1082
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:52,967
You wouldn't believe
how hostile that makes a jury.

1083
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,406
You got to help me.

1084
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,943
I can't sleep.

1085
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:04,546
I can't sleep.

1086
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:07,750
I haven't slept in...

1087
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,789
I'll never forgive myself.

1088
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:17,593
I want you to know that.

1089
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:23,966
I'll never forgive myself
for any of this.

1090
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,541
I forgive you.

1091
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:39,949
I'm so sorry.

1092
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:49,959
Go to sleep.

1093
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:09,979
Do I go in now?

1094
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,582
No.

1095
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:17,752
I'm stilling getting paid,
though, right?

1096
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:20,923
Yeah.

1097
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,578
Cassie?

1098
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,686
Do you remember
Nina's 16th birthday party?

1099
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,956
My gosh.
How could I forget?

1100
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,791
I was such a mess.

1101
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:57,626
Nina threw up on the swing.

1102
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:00,896
Certainly not her finest moment.

1103
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:03,632
And that boy
who stole your vase.

1104
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:06,101
And she made him bring it
back to you and apologize.

1105
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,771
He was so scared of her.

1106
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:09,881
She was holding onto his ear.

1107
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:12,308
"You better say you're sorry
to my mom, you asshole."

1108
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,779
What was his name?

1109
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:20,883
Simon or Steve or something.

1110
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:27,089
Why are you here?

1111
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,062
I just wanted to see you.

1112
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,798
You need to stop this.

1113
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,367
It isn't good for any of us.

1114
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,735
It's no good for Nina.

1115
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,671
It isn't good for you.

1116
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,174
Look, I know you feel bad
that you weren't there,

1117
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,076
but you got to let it go.

1118
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,016
I'm just trying to fix it.

1119
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,819
Come on. You can't.

1120
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,621
Don't be a child, Cassie.

1121
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,960
I'm so sorry
I didn't go with her.

1122
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,329
No.

1123
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,298
I'm sorry, too.

1124
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,049
Cassie.

1125
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,851
Move on.

1126
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,352
Please.

1127
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:31,755
For all of us.

1128
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:43,092
Great, it's you.

1129
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,028
Can I come in?

1130
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,266
Yep.

1131
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,802
Do you want something?
Do you want a coffee?

1132
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,207
Or another dude to go home with?

1133
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,474
Yeah, actually.

1134
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,210
Do you have any douchebags
lying around?

1135
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:02,779
Yeah. There's
a racist on the eighth floor.

1136
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,914
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

1137
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,719
What do you want, Cassie?

1138
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,989
I came to apologize about...

1139
01:03:14,325 --> 01:03:17,361
I've been trying to think
about how to explain.

1140
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:25,134
It's not that
I'm not interested.

1141
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:28,239
I really am.

1142
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,074
I really, really am.

1143
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:31,375
Okay.

1144
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,910
Sorry if I'm confused.

1145
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,245
It...
You...

1146
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,247
Sorry, we...
we've been on a couple dates.

1147
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:41,285
You won't kiss me
or touch me, which is fine.

1148
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:44,822
And then I see you going home

1149
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:48,025
with some random creep
in a fedora.

1150
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,030
I admit, the fedora
was unforgivable.

1151
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:59,336
The other night...

1152
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,207
It's hard to explain it,
but it won't happen again.

1153
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,043
I promise,
it'll never happen again.

1154
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,413
Can we try again?

1155
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,349
Can I, I mean.

1156
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:15,287
I don't...

1157
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,222
I don't know.

1158
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,926
Are you okay?

1159
01:04:27,565 --> 01:04:30,101
It's fine. I'm...

1160
01:04:30,135 --> 01:04:33,338
I guess I'll see you around.

1161
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:16,348
We're closed.

1162
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,350
Good.

1163
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:31,396
Do you want to go to dinner,
you miserable asshole?

1164
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:38,269
Yeah.

1165
01:06:06,364 --> 01:06:09,166
Shit.

1166
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:13,705
First trip to
the pharmacy together.

1167
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:15,540
Yeah.

1168
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,274
Big step.

1169
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,680
I'm sorry.

1170
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:24,948
- Are you singing Paris Hilton?
- What? Yeah.

1171
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,830
It's fine. I'm fine.
It's fine, it's fine.

1172
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:13,164
This is so much less sad
when there's someone else here.

1173
01:07:16,234 --> 01:07:19,103
That's the cute
yogurt-wise move. This way.

1174
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,551
I haven't done this
in a pharmacy in weeks.

1175
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:08,786
- That's weird.
- Literally weeks.

1176
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,455
Thank you.

1177
01:08:10,488 --> 01:08:11,823
Sorry.

1178
01:08:11,856 --> 01:08:13,525
They're okay.

1179
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:18,196
Cheese?

1180
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,330
Would love it.

1181
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:21,399
Yeah. Thank you.

1182
01:08:23,668 --> 01:08:25,537
- Bread?
- Yep.

1183
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,405
Okay.

1184
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,108
Thank you.

1185
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:32,810
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1186
01:08:32,845 --> 01:08:34,680
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1187
01:08:34,713 --> 01:08:35,848
Susan works really hard.

1188
01:08:35,881 --> 01:08:38,082
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1189
01:08:38,116 --> 01:08:40,553
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1190
01:08:40,586 --> 01:08:41,687
This looks delicious.

1191
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,822
Thank you.

1192
01:08:43,856 --> 01:08:45,558
I made the sauce.

1193
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:47,593
The sauce is...

1194
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,465
The sauce is really good.

1195
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,402
Incredible.

1196
01:08:57,603 --> 01:09:00,439
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1197
01:09:00,472 --> 01:09:02,675
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1198
01:09:04,175 --> 01:09:06,679
Not really.
They wanted me to be a DJ.

1199
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,387
He's funny.

1200
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:18,257
Yeah.

1201
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,492
That's funny.

1202
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,861
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1203
01:09:21,895 --> 01:09:24,463
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1204
01:09:24,496 --> 01:09:27,132
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1205
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:29,134
I said you were boring but rich.

1206
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:31,270
I am boring. Not that rich.

1207
01:09:31,303 --> 01:09:32,672
No? Well, in that case,

1208
01:09:32,706 --> 01:09:33,873
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1209
01:09:35,274 --> 01:09:37,476
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1210
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:39,813
Pediatric, so...

1211
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,614
children.

1212
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:43,182
What was your...

1213
01:09:43,215 --> 01:09:45,685
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1214
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,153
- Gary?
- No.

1215
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,290
Dr. Katzen-something.

1216
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:52,525
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1217
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:53,861
Yeah, well...

1218
01:09:53,894 --> 01:09:55,730
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1219
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:56,864
No.

1220
01:09:56,897 --> 01:09:58,365
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1221
01:09:58,398 --> 01:10:02,502
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1222
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:04,805
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1223
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:05,940
You're just...

1224
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:08,208
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1225
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:11,211
It's not brain surgery.

1226
01:10:11,244 --> 01:10:12,612
Well...

1227
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:15,315
I get it. Yeah.

1228
01:10:16,816 --> 01:10:19,252
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1229
01:10:21,287 --> 01:10:22,656
Night, you two.

1230
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,358
Night.

1231
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,599
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1232
01:10:34,002 --> 01:10:35,770
I know it was hard.

1233
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:39,440
You know, your mom, she's...

1234
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:45,312
Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that...

1235
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,448
My God, Dad.

1236
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,949
He's not that nice.

1237
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:51,218
Yeah.

1238
01:10:51,252 --> 01:10:54,255
Yeah, I must be tired.

1239
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:56,457
Okay.

1240
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:03,698
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1241
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,299
You know that.

1242
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:07,535
We really miss her.

1243
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,806
But, God, we have missed you.

1244
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:17,979
See you tomorrow.

1245
01:11:28,023 --> 01:11:30,759
<i>Your mom...
your mom is hot.</i>

1246
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:31,993
Sorry.

1247
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:35,030
Your mom is extremely hot.

1248
01:11:35,063 --> 01:11:37,298
Do you want her number?

1249
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:39,935
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1250
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,270
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1251
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:45,507
Well, I hope that's not true.

1252
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:50,244
Can I...

1253
01:11:51,046 --> 01:11:53,014
Can I tell you something?

1254
01:11:53,048 --> 01:11:54,816
Sure.

1255
01:11:57,351 --> 01:11:59,353
I think you're amazing. I...

1256
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:01,490
- No, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1257
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:02,891
- Please don't.
- I...

1258
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:04,826
Just take this, please.

1259
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:06,996
I think you're incredible. I...

1260
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:09,599
I'm...

1261
01:12:09,632 --> 01:12:13,368
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1262
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:20,676
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1263
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,376
Yes.

1264
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:22,879
- My God.
- Don't make...

1265
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:24,479
- My.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1266
01:12:24,513 --> 01:12:26,381
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1267
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:28,651
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1268
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:30,352
I'm cool.

1269
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:33,089
I'm so cool.

1270
01:12:33,122 --> 01:12:35,490
I'm the coolest.

1271
01:12:41,563 --> 01:12:42,799
Cassie.

1272
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:45,067
Shit.

1273
01:12:45,101 --> 01:12:47,335
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1274
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,872
Sorry. I...

1275
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,473
I tried calling.

1276
01:12:50,506 --> 01:12:53,010
I left messages about, that guy.

1277
01:12:53,043 --> 01:12:54,677
Your friend.

1278
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,580
I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1279
01:12:57,613 --> 01:12:59,615
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1280
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:02,485
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1281
01:13:02,518 --> 01:13:04,520
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1282
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:06,455
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1283
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:09,826
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1284
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:12,595
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1285
01:13:12,628 --> 01:13:15,132
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1286
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:16,799
He didn't touch you.

1287
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:20,436
Thank God.

1288
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,476
I was...
I was so worried that...

1289
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,080
that I... that he and I...

1290
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,881
He just put you in bed.

1291
01:13:30,914 --> 01:13:33,650
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1292
01:13:33,684 --> 01:13:35,986
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1293
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:37,955
It wasn't nice.

1294
01:13:37,988 --> 01:13:39,456
Yeah, well...

1295
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:41,725
God. Look, there...

1296
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,895
I need to show you something.

1297
01:13:44,928 --> 01:13:47,064
Okay.

1298
01:13:47,098 --> 01:13:49,366
Can we go inside?

1299
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,936
Yeah.

1300
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:02,679
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1301
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:04,581
No, thank you.

1302
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:23,533
After we had lunch and...

1303
01:14:23,568 --> 01:14:27,572
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1304
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:30,942
I thought about it.

1305
01:14:30,975 --> 01:14:33,177
About what you said about Nina.

1306
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:36,514
And how we all
just acted like...

1307
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,856
And I remembered something.

1308
01:14:44,889 --> 01:14:46,557
What?

1309
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:51,496
What?

1310
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,899
There was a tape.

1311
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,072
- What?
- A stupid video.

1312
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:03,174
It just got sent around.

1313
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,809
I got sent it.

1314
01:15:04,842 --> 01:15:06,778
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1315
01:15:07,645 --> 01:15:09,781
It was just gossip, you know?

1316
01:15:09,814 --> 01:15:11,581
Gossip?

1317
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:17,722
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1318
01:15:17,756 --> 01:15:19,224
You know what it was like.

1319
01:15:19,258 --> 01:15:21,160
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1320
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:24,063
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1321
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:25,898
But...

1322
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:31,804
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1323
01:15:31,837 --> 01:15:34,006
So...

1324
01:15:35,774 --> 01:15:37,810
Here.

1325
01:15:37,843 --> 01:15:41,512
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and...

1326
01:15:43,882 --> 01:15:45,483
What?

1327
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,553
Thought it was funny.

1328
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:54,193
You can have the phone, okay?

1329
01:15:54,226 --> 01:15:57,662
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1330
01:15:57,695 --> 01:15:59,999
But, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1331
01:16:00,032 --> 01:16:02,767
Just leave me out of it.

1332
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,635
And...

1333
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,973
please, will you do me a favor?

1334
01:16:08,907 --> 01:16:10,076
Yeah.

1335
01:16:12,178 --> 01:16:15,514
Never fucking contact me again.

1336
01:17:11,203 --> 01:17:12,338
Al, get it!

1337
01:17:12,372 --> 01:17:13,339
Come on, stop.

1338
01:17:13,373 --> 01:17:14,873
Go on. Come on, come on.

1339
01:17:14,907 --> 01:17:16,875
Calm down, calm down.

1340
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:19,211
My God.

1341
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:20,646
Whoa. This is insane.

1342
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,956
Ryan, holy shit.
Come look at this.

1343
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,682
Man, you got to check this out.

1344
01:17:23,715 --> 01:17:25,360
Yo, don't film me.
Dude, put the camera away.

1345
01:17:25,384 --> 01:17:27,853
What are you fucking doing?
My God.

1346
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:30,155
Ryan, come on.

1347
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,825
This is fucked up.

1348
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,096
Jesus Christ.

1349
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:37,664
Al, Al.

1350
01:18:43,997 --> 01:18:47,167
Cassie, what...
what are you doing here?

1351
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,468
Are-are you okay or...

1352
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:50,436
Can we go somewhere
to talk privately?

1353
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:52,771
I'm working.

1354
01:18:52,804 --> 01:18:55,441
We need to talk right now.

1355
01:18:55,475 --> 01:18:58,244
Okay.
What's... what's going on?

1356
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:01,247
- Everything all right or...?
- I've been such an asshole.

1357
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:03,016
What happened?

1358
01:19:03,049 --> 01:19:06,119
I really thought for a second
it was all gonna be okay.

1359
01:19:06,152 --> 01:19:07,953
Cassie.

1360
01:19:10,822 --> 01:19:11,924
Look at this.

1361
01:19:13,493 --> 01:19:15,727
What are you showing me?
What is this?

1362
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,964
Is that Al Monroe?

1363
01:19:19,832 --> 01:19:20,934
My God, it...

1364
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:23,102
Wait, is that... I don't...

1365
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:24,804
I don't want to look
at that, Cassie.

1366
01:19:24,837 --> 01:19:25,939
Well, why not?

1367
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:27,217
You were happy to watch
back then.

1368
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:29,008
What are you talking about?
I wasn't...

1369
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,077
My God. Whoa.

1370
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,079
- This is insane.
- Ryan, holy shit.

1371
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:34,757
Come look at this.
Man, you got to check this out.

1372
01:19:34,781 --> 01:19:36,483
Shit.

1373
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:39,320
I don't... I don't remember.
I don't.

1374
01:19:40,354 --> 01:19:42,188
Didn't make an impact?

1375
01:19:42,222 --> 01:19:44,291
I was a kid. I...

1376
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:49,929
I need you to do
something for me,

1377
01:19:49,964 --> 01:19:53,767
and I want you to think
about it very carefully.

1378
01:19:54,868 --> 01:19:57,137
I have this video

1379
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:59,507
ready to send to everyone
in your address book.

1380
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,308
Your parents.

1381
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:02,477
Your colleagues.

1382
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:03,787
All your old buddies
and their wives.

1383
01:20:03,811 --> 01:20:05,312
Cassie, come on.

1384
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,252
So, I can send it out right now,

1385
01:20:11,285 --> 01:20:14,755
or you can tell me where
Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

1386
01:20:16,558 --> 01:20:18,259
What?

1387
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:19,494
Why?

1388
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:20,995
You don't need to know why.

1389
01:20:21,028 --> 01:20:22,497
But what are you gonna do?

1390
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:24,031
Well, that depends.

1391
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,132
On what?

1392
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:26,535
You think they'll fire you here?

1393
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:28,303
- Geez.
- Dr. Ryan Cooper?

1394
01:20:28,336 --> 01:20:29,337
Fuck.

1395
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:30,448
I mean,
you work with kids, right?

1396
01:20:30,472 --> 01:20:32,874
They have to be careful.
Things have changed so much

1397
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:34,151
since we were at school,
haven't they?

1398
01:20:34,175 --> 01:20:35,386
Think about this, please.
Please.

1399
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:40,248
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I've thought about it.

1400
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:50,292
- Okay.
- Okay.

1401
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:00,168
All right. There. Okay?

1402
01:21:00,201 --> 01:21:02,270
They're gonna be there
this weekend... all of them.

1403
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:05,273
You don't... you don't think
I'm a bad person.

1404
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:07,175
Cassie, I-I...

1405
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,177
I love you.

1406
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:12,114
I love you, Cassie.

1407
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:16,319
You got to forgive me.
You got to forgive me.

1408
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:19,422
Tell me you'll forgive me.

1409
01:21:19,455 --> 01:21:21,290
No.

1410
01:21:24,427 --> 01:21:26,195
So, you're perfect, right?

1411
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:28,197
You've never done anything
you're ashamed of?

1412
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,932
You're...

1413
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,569
I can't...

1414
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:35,870
Are you gonna tell everybody?

1415
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:38,374
I don't know.

1416
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:39,584
I don't know if I can live with

1417
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:41,110
the threat of this
hanging over me.

1418
01:21:42,044 --> 01:21:44,480
I didn't even do anything.

1419
01:21:44,513 --> 01:21:46,082
Okay.

1420
01:21:46,115 --> 01:21:49,318
Poor Ryan,
just an innocent bystander.

1421
01:21:50,354 --> 01:21:52,255
Yeah.

1422
01:21:52,289 --> 01:21:55,225
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1423
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:58,061
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

1424
01:21:58,095 --> 01:21:59,663
And then we both
won't be doctors,

1425
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:01,298
you fucking failure.

1426
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:02,532
Nice.

1427
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,867
Bye, Ryan.

1428
01:23:58,347 --> 01:24:00,749
- Shit.
- Holy shit. What?

1429
01:24:00,784 --> 01:24:02,751
Well, the doctor's here.

1430
01:24:13,796 --> 01:24:16,198
Stripper time, baby! Let's go!

1431
01:24:16,232 --> 01:24:19,101
- Let's go!
- Nurse, I'm feeling sick!

1432
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:20,636
Please take my temperature.

1433
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:22,505
I told you guys no strippers.

1434
01:24:22,538 --> 01:24:24,106
Anastasia's gonna lose her shit.

1435
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,243
All right, who ordered her?

1436
01:24:27,277 --> 01:24:28,778
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1437
01:24:28,812 --> 01:24:31,248
No one's owning up?

1438
01:24:31,281 --> 01:24:33,092
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1439
01:24:33,116 --> 01:24:34,460
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1440
01:24:34,484 --> 01:24:36,419
I take it you're the groom?

1441
01:24:36,453 --> 01:24:38,121
Yeah.

1442
01:24:39,356 --> 01:24:41,358
Then sit the fuck down.

1443
01:24:41,391 --> 01:24:42,792
Shit!

1444
01:24:42,826 --> 01:24:44,661
Now.

1445
01:24:44,694 --> 01:24:47,797
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1446
01:24:47,831 --> 01:24:50,100
like the naughty boys you are.

1447
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,801
Come on, come on.

1448
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:55,672
Everybody here?

1449
01:24:55,705 --> 01:24:57,440
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1450
01:24:57,475 --> 01:25:00,411
Yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

1451
01:25:48,492 --> 01:25:49,894
Time to go upstairs.

1452
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:53,831
No, it's okay.
I don't, w-want to.

1453
01:25:53,864 --> 01:25:55,600
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1454
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:56,867
if you don't want me to,

1455
01:25:56,901 --> 01:26:00,236
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1456
01:26:01,237 --> 01:26:04,140
Okay.

1457
01:26:04,174 --> 01:26:06,509
Okay, you guys.

1458
01:26:08,278 --> 01:26:10,881
I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1459
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,850
She better not be able to walk!

1460
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:14,885
Leave some for us, man!

1461
01:26:18,656 --> 01:26:20,658
So what do I...

1462
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:22,592
Get on the bed.

1463
01:26:22,626 --> 01:26:23,828
Okay.

1464
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:25,295
I'm a little scared of you.

1465
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:27,733
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1466
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,902
All right.

1467
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,771
No, no, no. Sorry.

1468
01:26:32,804 --> 01:26:33,844
I-I'm not sure about that.

1469
01:26:33,872 --> 01:26:36,574
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1470
01:26:36,607 --> 01:26:38,709
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1471
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:40,611
Right. Yeah, of course.

1472
01:26:43,514 --> 01:26:46,517
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1473
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,786
I'm a gentleman.

1474
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:49,587
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1475
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,556
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1476
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:53,925
are sometimes the worst.

1477
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,728
Sorry, can you...
can you loosen these a little?

1478
01:26:57,762 --> 01:27:00,665
You'll get used to it.

1479
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:04,735
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1480
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:08,573
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1481
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,810
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1482
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:13,378
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1483
01:27:13,412 --> 01:27:15,380
So I-I don't want any...

1484
01:27:15,414 --> 01:27:17,816
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1485
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:19,951
do something
you don't want to do?

1486
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:22,654
- No.
- Exactly.

1487
01:27:24,456 --> 01:27:26,591
Ay.

1488
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,593
So, what's your name?

1489
01:27:28,627 --> 01:27:29,628
Candy.

1490
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:33,565
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1491
01:27:33,598 --> 01:27:35,200
Nina Fisher.

1492
01:27:36,968 --> 01:27:38,937
What did you say?

1493
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:41,206
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1494
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,909
Can you let me go, please?

1495
01:27:43,943 --> 01:27:45,278
I'm sorry, I can't.

1496
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:46,789
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1497
01:27:46,813 --> 01:27:48,314
Was it Joe?

1498
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,783
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1499
01:27:50,817 --> 01:27:51,951
I don't follow.

1500
01:27:51,984 --> 01:27:53,986
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1501
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,989
Because she's dead, okay?

1502
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,458
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1503
01:27:58,491 --> 01:27:59,425
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1504
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,327
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1505
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,261
This isn't funny.

1506
01:28:02,295 --> 01:28:04,297
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1507
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:07,333
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1508
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,802
But I'm not doing anything.

1509
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:11,270
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1510
01:28:11,305 --> 01:28:12,473
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1511
01:28:12,506 --> 01:28:14,742
Can you get up here, please?

1512
01:28:16,443 --> 01:28:18,412
I don't think they can hear you.

1513
01:28:18,445 --> 01:28:21,882
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1514
01:28:21,915 --> 01:28:25,318
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1515
01:28:25,351 --> 01:28:29,388
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1516
01:28:29,423 --> 01:28:31,859
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1517
01:28:34,327 --> 01:28:35,629
Do I know you?

1518
01:28:35,662 --> 01:28:37,765
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1519
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:40,467
You were so popular.

1520
01:28:45,005 --> 01:28:47,040
You're Nina's friend.

1521
01:28:47,074 --> 01:28:48,407
Fuck!

1522
01:28:48,441 --> 01:28:49,810
You're Nina's friend.

1523
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:51,979
So you did notice me after all.

1524
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:53,514
I'm surprised.

1525
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:55,482
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1526
01:28:55,516 --> 01:28:57,384
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1527
01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:58,920
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...
What do you want?

1528
01:28:58,953 --> 01:29:00,588
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1529
01:29:00,622 --> 01:29:04,291
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1530
01:29:05,526 --> 01:29:08,395
Are y...
are you talking about...

1531
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:09,931
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1532
01:29:09,964 --> 01:29:11,065
I didn't do anything!

1533
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:12,667
W-We were kids.

1534
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,903
If I hear that one more time.

1535
01:29:14,936 --> 01:29:16,403
Look...

1536
01:29:16,436 --> 01:29:17,839
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1537
01:29:17,872 --> 01:29:20,574
- Yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1538
01:29:20,607 --> 01:29:21,810
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1539
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:23,478
Look, I...

1540
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:25,713
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1541
01:29:25,748 --> 01:29:27,649
b-b-but we-we did not...

1542
01:29:30,718 --> 01:29:31,921
What?

1543
01:29:31,954 --> 01:29:33,755
You know.

1544
01:29:35,124 --> 01:29:36,424
No.

1545
01:29:36,457 --> 01:29:38,093
She could barely
hold her head up.

1546
01:29:38,127 --> 01:29:39,929
She had no idea
what was going on.

1547
01:29:39,962 --> 01:29:41,130
It was a fucking party.

1548
01:29:41,163 --> 01:29:43,032
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1549
01:29:43,065 --> 01:29:44,833
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1550
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:48,336
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1551
01:29:49,671 --> 01:29:50,940
What video?

1552
01:29:50,973 --> 01:29:52,774
You don't remember?

1553
01:29:52,808 --> 01:29:54,643
Your friend Joe taped it.

1554
01:29:54,677 --> 01:29:57,413
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1555
01:29:57,446 --> 01:29:59,448
in the cold light of day.

1556
01:30:00,482 --> 01:30:03,987
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1557
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,788
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1558
01:30:05,821 --> 01:30:06,990
Anything.

1559
01:30:07,023 --> 01:30:08,824
Aw. Don't cry.

1560
01:30:08,858 --> 01:30:10,593
Really, don't fucking cry.

1561
01:30:10,626 --> 01:30:12,561
Tell me what you did.

1562
01:30:12,595 --> 01:30:13,996
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1563
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:15,998
She dropped out.

1564
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:18,868
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1565
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:20,736
I did, too, to take care of her.

1566
01:30:20,769 --> 01:30:22,671
The two of us gone.

1567
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:24,907
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1568
01:30:24,941 --> 01:30:26,610
Did you ever feel guilty,

1569
01:30:26,643 --> 01:30:28,478
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1570
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:30,022
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1571
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:31,457
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1572
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:32,549
getting accused like that.

1573
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:36,519
Can you guess what every woman's
worst nightmare is?

1574
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:41,958
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1575
01:30:41,992 --> 01:30:43,627
because everyone had forgotten.

1576
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,129
- Fuck.
- But I haven't.

1577
01:30:46,162 --> 01:30:49,633
You're out of your fucking mind!

1578
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,202
I was so sad to leave, you know?

1579
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:55,472
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1580
01:30:55,505 --> 01:30:58,174
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1581
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,410
I might want to get
back into it.

1582
01:31:01,077 --> 01:31:02,612
Stop.

1583
01:31:02,647 --> 01:31:04,849
- You know...
- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1584
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:06,183
Nina was extraordinary.

1585
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:07,652
So smart.

1586
01:31:07,685 --> 01:31:09,186
Help!

1587
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,521
Weirdly smart.

1588
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:12,723
Help! Help me!

1589
01:31:12,757 --> 01:31:13,658
Fuck!

1590
01:31:13,691 --> 01:31:15,793
Help me!

1591
01:31:15,826 --> 01:31:17,995
I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1592
01:31:18,029 --> 01:31:19,196
Come on.

1593
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:20,665
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1594
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:22,242
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1595
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:25,435
Even when she was
four years old.

1596
01:31:26,837 --> 01:31:30,241
She was fully formed
from day one.

1597
01:31:30,275 --> 01:31:34,112
Same face. Same walk.

1598
01:31:34,146 --> 01:31:36,081
And funny.

1599
01:31:36,114 --> 01:31:37,481
Like a grown-up is funny.

1600
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:39,851
Kind of shrewd.

1601
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,788
I was just in awe of her.

1602
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:45,257
I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1603
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:48,260
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1604
01:31:48,293 --> 01:31:52,130
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1605
01:31:52,164 --> 01:31:54,565
Nina.

1606
01:31:57,035 --> 01:31:59,570
And then she wasn't.

1607
01:32:00,739 --> 01:32:03,275
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1608
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:04,943
She was yours.

1609
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:09,547
It wasn't her name she heard
when she was walking around.

1610
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,549
It was yours.

1611
01:32:11,582 --> 01:32:15,253
Your name all around her.

1612
01:32:15,288 --> 01:32:18,224
All over her all the time.

1613
01:32:18,257 --> 01:32:20,625
And it just...

1614
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:24,864
squeezed her out.

1615
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:30,303
So, when I heard
your name again...

1616
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:34,606
your filthy fucking name...

1617
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:39,312
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1618
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,247
Or thought it, even?

1619
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,282
Apart from me.

1620
01:32:43,316 --> 01:32:47,819
And it made me so sad
because, Al...

1621
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:52,824
you should be the one
with her name all over you.

1622
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:56,029
No. No.

1623
01:32:56,062 --> 01:32:57,929
Don't worry.
I've sterilized everything.

1624
01:32:57,963 --> 01:32:59,898
- No.
- I really would have been a great doctor.

1625
01:32:59,931 --> 01:33:01,566
- You're insane.
- You know what?

1626
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,169
I honestly don't think I am.

1627
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,904
I'll do this
as quick as I can, okay?

1628
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:09,143
Stop. Stop!

1629
01:33:09,176 --> 01:33:10,610
- Get off me!
- No!

1630
01:33:10,643 --> 01:33:12,645
Just stop fucking moving!

1631
01:33:12,678 --> 01:33:15,215
- Just stop, please! Fucking...
- No!

1632
01:33:15,249 --> 01:33:16,616
You...

1633
01:33:28,828 --> 01:33:29,862
No!

1634
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,065
Fuck!

1635
01:33:58,124 --> 01:34:01,160
Stop. Stop.

1636
01:34:01,194 --> 01:34:02,962
Shit. Shit.

1637
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,371
This is your fucking fault!

1638
01:34:21,314 --> 01:34:23,049
Fuck it.

1639
01:34:29,155 --> 01:34:31,390
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1640
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:38,131
Fucking stop fucking moving!

1641
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:40,266
Stop fucking moving!

1642
01:34:52,446 --> 01:34:54,014
Stop.

1643
01:36:43,457 --> 01:36:45,392
Whoa.

1644
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:47,360
What a night.

1645
01:36:48,894 --> 01:36:50,263
The fucking nurse?

1646
01:36:50,296 --> 01:36:52,532
Are you kidding me?

1647
01:36:52,566 --> 01:36:54,468
Nice.

1648
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:56,269
Joe.

1649
01:36:56,302 --> 01:36:58,505
Al, Al, please don't freak out,
all right?

1650
01:36:58,538 --> 01:37:00,139
Anastasia's never
gonna find out.

1651
01:37:00,172 --> 01:37:03,776
What happens on tour
stays on tour.

1652
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:06,279
She's dead, Joe.

1653
01:37:07,313 --> 01:37:08,381
Come on.

1654
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:10,550
I'm not kidding.

1655
01:37:14,086 --> 01:37:17,023
All right, I got...
y-you're being ironic.

1656
01:37:17,057 --> 01:37:18,091
What?

1657
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:20,394
You killed the stripper
at your bachelor party?

1658
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:22,162
What is this, the '90s?

1659
01:37:22,195 --> 01:37:24,064
Al, classic.

1660
01:37:24,097 --> 01:37:26,466
Come on.
You want me to get her

1661
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,268
out of here
so you can get some sleep?

1662
01:37:28,302 --> 01:37:29,569
All right.

1663
01:37:29,603 --> 01:37:32,306
All right, honey,
time for you to go.

1664
01:37:32,339 --> 01:37:34,274
Come on.

1665
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:38,612
What is she doing?

1666
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,314
Hey, honey, come on.

1667
01:37:40,347 --> 01:37:41,948
We got to go.

1668
01:37:42,949 --> 01:37:44,851
Honey, what are we doing...

1669
01:37:44,885 --> 01:37:46,586
Jesus fucking Chr...

1670
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:49,056
Fuck. Is she dead?

1671
01:37:51,959 --> 01:37:53,528
Al, why is
the fucking stripper dead?

1672
01:37:53,561 --> 01:37:55,029
I told you.

1673
01:37:55,063 --> 01:37:56,431
Well, how did this happen?

1674
01:37:56,464 --> 01:37:58,199
I don't know.

1675
01:38:05,273 --> 01:38:06,641
Okay. Hey.

1676
01:38:06,674 --> 01:38:09,911
Al, this is not your fault.

1677
01:38:09,944 --> 01:38:11,488
I don't know.
It kind of seems like it is.

1678
01:38:11,512 --> 01:38:13,581
No, no, no, no.

1679
01:38:13,614 --> 01:38:15,882
It's not. It's not.

1680
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:17,985
Am-am-am I...

1681
01:38:18,019 --> 01:38:20,221
- Am I gonna go to jail?
- What?

1682
01:38:20,254 --> 01:38:23,091
- What about the wedding and-and my job?
- No.

1683
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:26,160
Anastasia's gonna be
so upset with me.

1684
01:38:26,194 --> 01:38:27,128
Well, no, no.

1685
01:38:27,161 --> 01:38:29,530
Al, Al, Al, Al,
it was an accident, right?

1686
01:38:29,565 --> 01:38:31,467
I mean...

1687
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,967
Hey!

1688
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,935
It was an accident.

1689
01:38:33,968 --> 01:38:35,903
I mean, of course it was
a fucking accident.

1690
01:38:35,937 --> 01:38:37,515
Yeah, of course
it was a fucking accident.

1691
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:38,640
No one's gonna go to jail,

1692
01:38:38,674 --> 01:38:40,642
because no one's ever
gonna find out.

1693
01:38:40,676 --> 01:38:43,645
If anybody asks,
we all saw her leave last night.

1694
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:47,048
She stripped, and then she left.

1695
01:38:48,015 --> 01:38:50,652
- She left?
- She left.

1696
01:38:50,686 --> 01:38:52,521
Okay. All right.

1697
01:38:52,554 --> 01:38:55,524
It's gonna be fine, all right?

1698
01:38:55,557 --> 01:38:58,527
We're gonna take care of this.

1699
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,329
We just got to get rid
of the body

1700
01:39:00,363 --> 01:39:01,698
before the others leave.

1701
01:39:01,731 --> 01:39:03,333
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1702
01:39:03,366 --> 01:39:04,601
It's okay. Look at me.

1703
01:39:04,634 --> 01:39:06,302
This is not your fault, Al.

1704
01:39:06,336 --> 01:39:08,438
- Thank you.
- You did nothing wrong.

1705
01:39:08,471 --> 01:39:10,407
All right. All right.

1706
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,642
You did nothing wrong.

1707
01:39:12,675 --> 01:39:14,411
This is not your fault.

1708
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:16,346
Can you uncuff me?

1709
01:39:17,614 --> 01:39:20,282
Okay, come here. Come here.

1710
01:40:28,617 --> 01:40:29,819
<i>Can't you just</i>

1711
01:40:29,853 --> 01:40:33,322
do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

1712
01:40:33,355 --> 01:40:34,623
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1713
01:40:34,656 --> 01:40:37,326
It was turned off
before she left.

1714
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:39,495
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

1715
01:40:39,529 --> 01:40:41,264
to know where she was.

1716
01:40:41,297 --> 01:40:43,199
But it-it's...

1717
01:40:43,233 --> 01:40:45,235
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

1718
01:40:45,268 --> 01:40:47,403
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

1719
01:40:47,437 --> 01:40:49,239
Stanley.

1720
01:40:49,272 --> 01:40:52,809
I... You know, she's...

1721
01:40:52,842 --> 01:40:55,044
she was getting better.

1722
01:40:55,078 --> 01:40:56,579
She was, really.

1723
01:40:56,613 --> 01:40:58,648
- She was getting better.
- Yes, she was.

1724
01:40:58,681 --> 01:41:00,617
She... Of course she was.

1725
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,719
She'll come back.

1726
01:41:02,752 --> 01:41:04,521
You know how she is.

1727
01:41:04,554 --> 01:41:06,155
She always comes back.

1728
01:41:06,189 --> 01:41:07,790
Was she seeing anyone?

1729
01:41:07,824 --> 01:41:10,126
Did she have a boyfriend?

1730
01:41:11,662 --> 01:41:12,796
Yes.

1731
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,832
Are you Dr. Cooper?

1732
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:16,367
Yeah.

1733
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,569
Detective Waller.

1734
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:24,040
Yeah. Come in, please.

1735
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:27,745
Have a seat.

1736
01:41:27,778 --> 01:41:29,547
Pediatric surgeon?

1737
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,781
Yeah.

1738
01:41:30,814 --> 01:41:32,383
That's very commendable.

1739
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:35,452
Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

1740
01:41:35,486 --> 01:41:37,120
Sure. Yeah.

1741
01:41:37,154 --> 01:41:40,089
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

1742
01:41:40,123 --> 01:41:42,626
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

1743
01:41:44,361 --> 01:41:45,763
Yeah. Yes.

1744
01:41:45,796 --> 01:41:47,096
Yes.

1745
01:41:47,131 --> 01:41:49,267
- How do you know her?
- We were...

1746
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:53,170
We were seeing each other.

1747
01:41:53,203 --> 01:41:55,172
Were seeing each other?

1748
01:41:55,205 --> 01:41:57,709
We broke up a few days ago.

1749
01:41:57,742 --> 01:41:59,578
Define "a few days."

1750
01:42:00,612 --> 01:42:01,846
Last Thursday.

1751
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:05,182
Have you had any contact since?

1752
01:42:05,215 --> 01:42:07,485
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

1753
01:42:07,519 --> 01:42:10,822
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

1754
01:42:10,855 --> 01:42:12,591
I'm sorry, what?

1755
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:13,825
Why?

1756
01:42:13,858 --> 01:42:16,561
Because she's missing.

1757
01:42:16,595 --> 01:42:19,129
Since when?

1758
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:20,498
Since Friday.

1759
01:42:20,533 --> 01:42:22,635
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

1760
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:24,904
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

1761
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:27,238
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

1762
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:29,407
going to this weekend?

1763
01:42:31,744 --> 01:42:34,647
She mentioned, the work trip.

1764
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,215
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

1765
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:42,588
N-No. No.

1766
01:42:42,622 --> 01:42:45,256
I'm sorry.

1767
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:46,926
That's all right, Doc.

1768
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:48,894
Between you and me, it,

1769
01:42:48,928 --> 01:42:51,563
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

1770
01:42:51,597 --> 01:42:53,198
Mentally, I mean.

1771
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:56,534
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

1772
01:42:58,269 --> 01:43:00,840
Yeah, she was...

1773
01:43:00,873 --> 01:43:04,342
not in a good place.

1774
01:43:06,345 --> 01:43:10,282
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

1775
01:43:14,453 --> 01:43:15,621
Yeah.

1776
01:43:15,655 --> 01:43:18,257
She could've.

1777
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:20,359
She could've, yeah.

1778
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:23,262
I thought that might
be the case.

1779
01:43:23,295 --> 01:43:25,464
Thank you for your honesty.

1780
01:43:25,498 --> 01:43:27,366
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

1781
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,444
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

1782
01:43:29,468 --> 01:43:30,847
you know,
for an official statement.

1783
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:32,839
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

1784
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,240
Thank you for your time, Doctor.

1785
01:43:34,273 --> 01:43:36,308
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

1786
01:43:36,342 --> 01:43:37,843
That's cute.

1787
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:40,413
Yeah.

1788
01:43:53,726 --> 01:43:57,496
Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

1789
01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:00,600
You are my moral compass
and the love of my life.

1790
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:03,303
Al, you are my best friend

1791
01:44:03,336 --> 01:44:05,472
and my soul mate.

1792
01:44:05,505 --> 01:44:06,940
I love you.

1793
01:44:06,973 --> 01:44:08,475
Al's like a brother to me.

1794
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:09,910
We grew up together. We're...

1795
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:11,244
We're the best of friends.

1796
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,555
We've been through
thick and thin.

1797
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:15,582
And-and I just love him.

1798
01:44:15,615 --> 01:44:18,418
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

1799
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:21,722
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

1800
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,831
That's great.

1801
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,869
- How you doing, man?
- Hey.

1802
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:38,405
See that bridesmaid over there?

1803
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:40,408
Just the type of girl
that makes you

1804
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:42,710
go home to your wife and say...

1805
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:45,346
You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

1806
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:48,015
Come on her ass and her face
at the same time.

1807
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:50,017
- That's nice.
- Unbelievable.

1808
01:44:50,051 --> 01:44:51,395
- Everything just turned out so nice.
- Yeah.

1809
01:44:51,419 --> 01:44:52,420
It's good seeing you.

1810
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,622
Good. Yeah, you, too.

1811
01:44:56,524 --> 01:44:58,359
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Joe. - Hey.

1812
01:44:58,392 --> 01:44:59,870
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good speech.

1813
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:02,497
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Cheers.

1814
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:28,508
- You're Alexander Monroe?
- Yeah.

1815
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:29,910
You're under arrest
for the murder

1816
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,645
- of Cassandra Thomas.
- No, no, no, no.

1817
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:32,646
Officer,
please remove the bride.

1818
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,724
I'm sorry, this is a mistake.

1819
01:47:33,748 --> 01:47:35,816
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Excuse me!

1820
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:38,119
Can you explain
what's going on? Al!

1821
01:47:40,855 --> 01:47:42,123
- Sir...
- Hey, hey!

1822
01:47:43,557 --> 01:47:44,992
You have the right
to an attorney.

1823
01:47:45,026 --> 01:47:47,528
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

1824
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:48,930
- Understand, sir?
- Yes.

1825
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:51,832
Officer, show him to the car.
