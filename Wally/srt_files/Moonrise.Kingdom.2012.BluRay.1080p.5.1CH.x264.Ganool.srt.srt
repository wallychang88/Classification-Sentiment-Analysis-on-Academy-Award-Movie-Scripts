00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:37,119
Resync by Bajingan, Toa Pek Yuna

2
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,626
In order to show you how

3
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,209
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

4
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:32,376
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

5
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,209
which is made up
of smaller pieces

6
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,292
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

7
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,167
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

8
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,751
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

9
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:47,084
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

10
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,292
which is a beautiful melody

11
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,751
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

12
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:56,292
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

13
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:29,501
Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra

14
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,542
playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

15
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:34,417
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

16
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:38,167
The ﬂutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.

17
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,376
Here comes the brass family.

18
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,751
The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.

19
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,251
One to four.

20
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:28,667
Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.

21
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,792
I'm sick of this rain.

22
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:34,292
The violins,
the violas, the cellos and the double basses.

23
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:36,751
And of course, the harp.

24
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,126
And finally
the percussion family,

25
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,501
all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.

26
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,667
After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell

27
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,667
played once more in its original
form by all four families together.

28
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,042
That is, the whole orchestra.

29
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,042
This is
the island of New Penzance.

30
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,292
16 miles long.

31
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,459
Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.

32
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,209
Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.

33
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,709
Chickchaw territory.

34
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,292
There are no
paved roads, but...

35
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,584
Here comes Jed
with the mail.

36
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:05,709
But instead many
miles of intersecting footpaths and dirt trails,

37
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,834
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

38
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,167
The year is 1965.

39
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,209
We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,

40
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,959
famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,

41
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,292
which will
strike from the east on the 5th of September.

42
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:26,542
In three days' time.

43
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:43,959
Morning, Gadge.

44
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,334
Morning, sir.

45
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,334
Deluca,
latrine inspection.

46
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,376
Good.

47
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,709
Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?

48
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,876
Horrible.

49
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,709
Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?

50
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,126
We're building a tree house.

51
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,542
- Where?
- Right here.

52
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,501
That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?

53
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,667
If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.

54
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,876
Well, where would
you have built it?

55
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,126
Lower.

56
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,792
Nickleby?
What are you doing?

57
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,501
Pest control.
Burning some ants.

58
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,251
Spot check.

59
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,001
Your socks are down,
your shirt tails are untucked,

60
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,501
your trousers are
not properly pressed.

61
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:52,042
You are reported for
a uniform violation.

62
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,292
How many rockets
you up to, Panagle?

63
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,417
Sixteen and a half, sir.

64
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,792
Is that enough
for the Hullabaloo?

65
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,459
Izod, go fetch another pint of
gunpowder from the armory shed.

66
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,917
Redford! Halt!
I saw that!

67
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,042
- How fast were you just going?
- Safety test, sir.

68
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,167
Come again?

69
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,501
The vehicle
appears to be in good working order,

70
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:09,667
I'm just checking if...

71
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,167
Reckless cycling.
Second warning.

72
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:13,042
Next time,
I take away the keys.

73
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,751
Morning, Chef.

74
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:27,959
Clear!

75
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,042
Who's missing?

76
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,084
- Who's missing?
- Shakusky.

77
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:47,292
- Shakusky.
- Shakusky.

78
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:48,959
Shakusky! Breakfast!

79
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,584
Shakusky, you in there?

80
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,417
Sam?

81
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,084
It's zipped from the inside.

82
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,209
Jiminy Cricket,
he flew the coop.

83
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:54,626
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp, over.

84
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,209
Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

85
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,334
Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.

86
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:05,001
I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

87
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,126
What does that mean? Over.

88
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,834
One of my boys
seems to have stolen

89
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,834
a miniature canoe and
some fishing tackle,

90
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,876
10 pounds of sundries,
two bedrolls, plus an air riﬂe.

91
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,001
And disappeared. Over.

92
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:18,459
Any idea why? Over.

93
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,709
No. He left me
a letter of resignation. Over.

94
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,001
Dear Scout Master Ward,

95
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,792
I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved

96
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,709
with the Khaki
Scouts of North America.

97
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,001
The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.

98
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,126
It is not your fault.

99
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,792
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.

100
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,959
Well, I guess we better
notify his folks. Over.

101
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,292
Okay. Over and out.

102
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:56,626
Hello, Diane.

103
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,376
Becky, I have your
person-to-person from Chesterfield

104
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,626
Hold the line, please.

105
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,501
Hello?

106
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,334
Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.

107
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:08,751
Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.

108
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,292
In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,

109
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:16,542
because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,

110
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,751
and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

111
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,209
we can't invite him
back at this time.

112
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,376
There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.

113
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,167
We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.

114
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,542
I understand that.
I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.

115
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:39,584
I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?

116
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:43,542
I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.

117
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,334
But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?

118
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,292
He's emotionally disturbed.

119
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,667
Am I speaking
with Sam's father?

120
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,417
No, sir.

121
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,709
Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.

122
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,834
We're Mr. and
Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents.

123
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,042
Sam's been with
us since last June.

124
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,959
Excuse me, sir.
This is Scout Master Ward speaking.

125
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:11,792
Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?

126
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,459
Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.

127
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,667
Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?

128
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:17,834
Excuse my language.

129
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,167
I don't know.
What register?

130
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,876
We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.

131
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,042
Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.

132
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:31,417
We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.

133
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,709
You say you can't
invite him back? You say that he's an orphan?

134
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,042
I don't understand
how that works.

135
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,667
What am I supposed
to do with him?

136
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,376
That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.

137
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,251
They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.

138
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,792
You have your orders.

139
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,834
Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills

140
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,501
that you've been
practicing all summer.

141
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,459
Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.

142
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,751
Remember, this isn't
just a search party,

143
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,959
it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.

144
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,209
Any questions?

145
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,417
Lazy-Eye?

146
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,084
What's your real job, sir?

147
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,959
- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?

148
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,751
- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?

149
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,167
Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,

150
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,792
we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.

151
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:22,001
One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.

152
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,126
Anybody else?
Redford?

153
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,292
What if he resists?

154
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,459
- Who?
- Shakusky.

155
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,584
Are we allowed to
use force on him?

156
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,834
No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.

157
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,292
Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.

158
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,251
Am I making
myself understood?

159
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,126
- Yes.
- Good.

160
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,292
I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.

161
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:45,959
Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.

162
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,792
Be leery out there. Okay?

163
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,292
Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?

164
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:51,709
Right here.

165
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,126
Give him the scent.

166
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,959
I heard he ran away
because his family died.

167
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:02,334
I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

168
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,751
That's probably
why he's crazy.

169
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:04,959
I'll tell you one thing,

170
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,792
if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.

171
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,834
Me, neither.

172
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.

173
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,292
You really think
a 12-year-old boy

174
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,334
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

175
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,459
Most likely not.

176
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,001
It is possible, Counselor.

177
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,292
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

178
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,834
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

179
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,167
- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,

180
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:15,209
- will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
- Yup.

181
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:27,126
Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.

182
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,626
First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky

183
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,292
Morale is extremely low,

184
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,417
in part, I suppose,

185
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:34,792
because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.

186
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,251
By a significant margin.

187
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,626
I'm confused
and I'm worried.

188
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,626
Please let us
find him tomorrow.

189
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,042
Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,

190
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,334
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.

191
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,001
A terrible day
at Camp Ivanhoe.

192
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,876
Let's hope
tomorrow's better.

193
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,126
One Year earlier

194
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,459
What kind of bird are you?

195
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,709
I'm a sparrow,
she's a dove...

196
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,959
No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?

197
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,417
I'm a raven.

198
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:11,959
Boys aren't
allowed in here.

199
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,709
I'll be leaving soon.

200
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,042
What happened to your hand?

201
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,834
I got hit in the mirror.

202
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,667
Really, how did that happen?

203
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,876
I lost my temper at myself.

204
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,459
What's your name?

205
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:33,792
Sam. What's yours?

206
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,626
I'm Suzy.

207
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,709
It's not polite to stare.

208
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,417
Birds, ready?
Who are you?

209
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,042
Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.

210
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,917
He likes you.

211
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,542
Were you followed?

212
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,542
- I doubt it.
- Good.

213
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,334
Is that a cat in there?

214
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,834
- Can you read a map?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,417
I do cartography.

216
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,626
I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow

217
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,126
since you're a less
experienced hiker,

218
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,251
and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.

219
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,376
They're not really
Sunday school shoes.

220
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:55,501
Here.

221
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,626
Oh, thank you.

222
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,667
Here's where
we are right now.

223
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,876
I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,

224
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,792
which means 4:00.
How does that sound?

225
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:06,792
- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?

226
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,292
- Okay.
- Let's go.

227
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:22,501
Are you thirsty?

228
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:23,959
No, thank you.

229
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,126
Well, if your throat
gets parched,

230
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,001
stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.

231
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,959
You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.

232
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:31,542
Mmm-hmm.

233
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,417
Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.

234
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,542
Hmm. That's a good idea.

235
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,959
It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.

236
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,001
Yeah. True.

237
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:45,584
You can go ahead.
Be careful.

238
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,459
Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air

239
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,459
and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.

240
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:06,084
Which Way?

241
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,001
I guess it
doesn't really matter,

242
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,376
just as long as we
cover our tracks.

243
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:24,876
You smell like perfume.

244
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,376
Oh, it's my mother's.

245
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,792
Hmm. Hmm.

246
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,167
I brought water, too.

247
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,167
- You wait here.
- Okay.

248
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,792
Be right back.

249
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,167
Watch your head!

250
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,626
Where the hell is it?

251
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,001
Found it!

252
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,917
It's ready.

253
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:28,376
He knows someone's
watching him.

254
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,042
I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?

255
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,251
Mmm... I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.

256
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,209
Follow me.

257
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,292
How strong of
a swimmer are you?

258
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:15,126
Pretty good.
I broke our school record for the backstroke.

259
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:18,792
Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.

260
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,834
Watch out for turtles.

261
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,417
They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.

262
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,084
Okay.

263
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,876
Let me see if I
can catch this one.

264
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,209
Feel something.

265
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,126
Hmm...

266
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:43,501
Somebody wrote on him.

267
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:46,542
The stick's moving.

268
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,792
You got one!

269
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,792
Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.

270
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,667
Mmm.

271
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:08,501
Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?

272
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:13,459
I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.

273
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:17,959
Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.

274
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:19,709
Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.

275
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,126
Oh.

276
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,542
What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.

277
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,501
Okay.

278
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,084
Go ahead.

279
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:42,126
This is my record player.
It works with batteries.

280
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,584
Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

281
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,126
- I left him a note.
- Okay.

282
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,084
- Do you like music?
- Yeah.

283
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,167
This is my
favorite record album.

284
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,251
My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.

285
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,084
She lives in France.

286
00:25:57,126 --> 00:26:00,501
These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.

287
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:03,042
Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.

288
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:06,251
Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.

289
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,459
I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.

290
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,667
You can borrow any you want.

291
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,792
Thank you.

292
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:15,751
I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,

293
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:20,376
some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,

294
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,542
and my binoculars,
as you know.

295
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:22,667
Yeah.

296
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,959
I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.

297
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:31,376
Huh.

298
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,667
Wait, these are all
library books.

299
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:41,667
In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.

300
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:44,959
Some of these are
going to be overdue.

301
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:48,084
Do you steal?

302
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,376
Why? You're not poor.

303
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:57,251
I might turn some of
them back in one day. I haven't decided yet.

304
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,917
I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.

305
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,667
Anyway,
for some reason,

306
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,417
it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.

307
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,626
Are you depressed?

308
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,626
How come?

309
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,001
Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,

310
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,751
but it doesn't make
me feel very good.

311
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:21,167
Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.

312
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,584
Does that mean you?

313
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,126
I think so.

314
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,709
Are you laughing?

315
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,126
It's not funny.

316
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:42,417
You really know
how to make friends.

317
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:02,626
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,792
Oh. It's okay.

319
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:07,792
I'm on your side.

320
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:10,584
I know.

321
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,042
Thank you.

322
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,584
Which one's the best?

323
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:27,834
"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw

324
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,876
"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows

325
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,584
"and down to its stone floor.

326
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,751
"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast

327
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,042
"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'

328
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:56,001
"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested.

329
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,042
"There would be
another time for war."

330
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:03,542
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.

331
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,334
Where's your sister?

332
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:11,751
I don't know, but she borrowed
my record player for 10 days without asking.

333
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,501
What does that mean?

334
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:17,001
Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.

335
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:20,626
I will give it back
in 10 days or less. Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.

336
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:23,917
I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.

337
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:28,459
Walt! Where the hell are you?

338
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,667
Right here!

339
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,667
Why are you cursing at me?

340
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:34,417
Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?

341
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:38,876
That's a loaded question.

342
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:40,709
Come down and read this.

343
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:44,001
Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.

344
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,126
They're going home for...

345
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:49,292
Who's there?

346
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,084
Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.

347
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,709
What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.

348
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,084
I know. Uh...
I know.

349
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,584
The search party's
not over yet. In other words...

350
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,834
Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.

351
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:12,084
The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week

352
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,001
off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly

353
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,667
and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.

354
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,459
Stay tuned for
further information

355
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:29,376
How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.

356
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,876
It's getting worse.

357
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,167
Whose fault is it?

358
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,376
I don't know.

359
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,876
But just for the record
95 % of all runaways

360
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,834
return home within
the first six hours.

361
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:45,417
That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.

362
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:48,292
But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet

363
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,667
at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers

364
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,084
at this very moment,
as we speak.

365
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:55,376
She doesn't have any friends.

366
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,251
How's Laura?

367
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,834
"How's Laura?"

368
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,459
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

369
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:07,126
I don't understand.

370
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,584
Is she upset?

371
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,376
There's a porcupine.

372
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:38,459
She has a pen pal!
It's very intimate. They planned this together.

373
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:42,751
Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.

374
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,917
His family died.

375
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,001
Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?

376
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:49,417
He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.

377
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:50,542
She sit for this?

378
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:51,667
What's he say?

379
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,459
Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.

380
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,834
You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.

381
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,251
Please find enclosed...

382
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,001
Dear Sam,
thank you very much.

383
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:04,834
I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.

384
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,667
After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...

385
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:09,584
Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.

386
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,042
Maybe they will
grow out of it.

387
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,626
Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...

388
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,459
Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,

389
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,251
especially trees
and telephone poles.

390
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,417
Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...

391
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:24,209
Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.

392
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,417
I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.

393
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:28,542
Unfortunately, it is...

394
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,626
Dear Sam,
I am in trouble again

395
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,209
because I threw a rock
through the window.

396
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,709
My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...

397
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,292
Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,

398
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,834
but I feel people do
not like my personality.

399
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,751
In fact, I can understand
why they might not...

400
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,751
Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended

401
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,334
because I got in
a fight with Molly.

402
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,417
She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...

403
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,834
Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,

404
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,917
but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...

405
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,667
Dear Sam,
I do think you should

406
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:56,917
think of their
faces every day,

407
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,459
even if it makes you sad.

408
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,001
It is too bad they
did not leave you

409
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,001
more pictures of themselves.
Can you...

410
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:04,001
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

411
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,084
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

412
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,584
Dear Suzy, when?

413
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,251
Dear Sam, where?

414
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:12,834
Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house

415
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,459
to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.

416
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:19,417
Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.

417
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,501
Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?

418
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:33,001
I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.

419
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:36,042
She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.

420
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:38,667
Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...

421
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,084
I think he's onto us.

422
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,376
Of course he is.

423
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:43,959
Of course he is?

424
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:45,792
Of course he is.

425
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,834
Then why aren't we
worried about that?

426
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,542
I am.

427
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:53,251
Well, I didn't know.

428
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:56,709
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

429
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:57,834
Did you hit him?

430
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,042
No. He fell in a ditch.

431
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:03,751
Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.

432
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:09,584
That's her.

433
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:12,917
Where's he going?

434
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,167
I don't know.

435
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,376
All right,
we know they're together.

436
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:20,667
We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.

437
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:23,001
I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.

438
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:26,584
Until help arrives,
I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one,

439
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,084
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

440
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,501
to come with me in
the station wagon.

441
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:32,667
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

442
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,001
split up on foot.

443
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:36,167
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

444
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:38,709
this end of the island
and fly low.

445
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,251
Is it them?

446
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,376
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,834
They found the campfire.

448
00:34:55,917 --> 00:35:00,751
Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.

449
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:08,334
Be careful.

450
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,084
What do you creeps want?

451
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,292
We're looking for you.

452
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,376
Why?

453
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,334
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

454
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,667
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

455
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,167
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

456
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,542
We've been deputized.

457
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:56,876
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

458
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,334
Listen to some reason.

459
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,501
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

460
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:06,292
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

461
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:10,167
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

462
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,584
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

463
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,459
Why not?

464
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,334
Because he's crazy.

465
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:19,251
Maybe you just
don't know him.

466
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:22,501
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

467
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,501
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

468
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,292
Nickleby, tie him up.

469
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:35,209
Do not cross this stick.

470
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,542
You're doomed, Shakusky.

471
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,667
Molly's right,
I do go berserk.

472
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,626
It was him or us.

473
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,334
Oh, no.

474
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,334
She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.

475
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,084
Repeat that, please? Over.

476
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:45,334
Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.

477
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:46,959
You're going to be okay.

478
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,001
Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.

479
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,917
I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.

480
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,501
He's got
excellent marksmanship.

481
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:54,792
Shot Deluca in both arms.

482
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,167
I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.

483
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:58,584
Where's Snoopy?

484
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,876
Those sons of bitches.

485
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,542
They got him right
through the neck.

486
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,209
Was he a good dog?

487
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:13,917
Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.

488
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,167
What happened?
Who is that?

489
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,334
Clear the dock, Edgar!

490
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,001
- Why is he bleeding?
- Is Suzy with you?

491
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:35,792
No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.

492
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:36,917
Where am I going?

493
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:39,917
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?

494
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,126
Yup.

495
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,501
Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.

496
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:43,876
Hold it right there!

497
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,042
You're not
leaving this island.

498
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:49,001
Our daughter has been
abducted by one of these beige lunatics.

499
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,459
Walt, it's very clear.

500
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,501
The two of them
conspired in this together.

501
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,917
Don't worry,
Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

502
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,292
Sam's got excellent
wilderness skills.

503
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,417
Why can't you
control your Scouts?

504
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,542
Well, I'm trying.

505
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:06,667
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

506
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:07,834
Stop it! Stop it!

507
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:09,501
- Stop it!
- Stop it.

508
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:14,251
I do blame him.
But I also blame myself and both of you.

509
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:18,834
With all due respect,
you can't let your children stab people.

510
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,459
What are you talking about?

511
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,167
She's violent,
Mrs. Bishop, it's assault.

512
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,376
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not a lawyer.

513
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,584
Well, we are!

514
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,751
Take your hands
off my wife!

515
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,584
Take them off!

516
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:35,417
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Sharp!

517
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,376
As some of you know,
I taught Sam

518
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,751
for the cartography
accomplishment button.

519
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,167
He's a smart boy
and he expressed a keen interest

520
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,792
in the history of the island's
indigenous peoples.

521
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,334
In particular,
I recall his fascination with the idea

522
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:56,709
of retracing the original
path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration.

523
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:04,917
What I'm getting at is this.
I think I know where they're going.

524
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:12,876
Onto the birdhouse,

525
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,042
where every kind
of bird imaginable

526
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,209
is whirling
and wheeling around.

527
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,709
This is our land!

528
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,417
Yes, it is!

529
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,626
Whoo!

530
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,709
Whoo!

531
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,834
Run!

532
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:51,792
Let's jump!

533
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:16,876
On three!

534
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,001
One, two, three!

535
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,542
Any of you who have ever
had to sweat through piano exercises

536
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,792
will sympathize with these...

537
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,001
I like it here,
but I don't like the name.

538
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,501
Me, neither.

539
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:53,417
"Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"
It's got no ring to it.

540
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,417
Let's change it.
What should it be?

541
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:58,376
Let me think
for a minute.

542
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:11,542
I made you some jewelry.

543
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:17,626
Are your ears pierced?

544
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:28,917
It's pretty.

545
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:32,209
Do the other one.

546
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:42,751
Why do you
always use binoculars?

547
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:49,084
It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.

548
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,001
I pretend it's
my magic power.

549
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:53,376
Hmm.

550
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:55,376
That sounds like poetry.

551
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:57,417
Poems don't always
have to rhyme, you know.

552
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:00,126
They're just
supposed to be creative.

553
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:06,959
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

554
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,917
I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.

555
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,834
Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?

556
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,584
Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.

557
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,459
Anyway, we can't
predict the exact future.

558
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:24,417
That's true.

559
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:30,001
It's possible I may
wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.

560
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,334
Okay.

561
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,167
I wish I didn't
have to mention it, but just in case.

562
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:36,751
I don't want to
make you be offended.

563
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,876
Of course I won't.

564
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:43,167
What's that one for?

565
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:44,626
- This?
- Yeah.

566
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,501
It's not
an accomplishment button.

567
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,459
I inherited it
from my mother.

568
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:53,334
It's not actually meant for a male to
wear, but I don't give a damn.

569
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,501
Are your foster parents
still mad at you,

570
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:59,459
for getting in
trouble so much?

571
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:01,876
I don't think so.

572
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,959
We're starting to get to
know each other better.

573
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,042
I feel I'm in
a real family now.

574
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,042
Not like yours,
but similar to one.

575
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:11,667
I always wished
I was an orphan.

576
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:13,917
Most of my
favorite characters are.

577
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,959
I think your lives
are more special.

578
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,959
I love you, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

579
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,084
I love you, too.

580
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,001
- I've got sand in my mouth.
- Oh.

581
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:33,209
Uh... Can you French kiss?

582
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:36,376
I think so.
Is there any secret to it?

583
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,542
The tongues touch each other.

584
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:40,334
Okay, let's try it.

585
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,251
It feels hard.

586
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:56,167
Do you mind?

587
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:57,292
I like it.

588
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:01,417
Tilt your head sideways.

589
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:11,292
You can touch my chest.

590
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:16,209
I... I think they're
going to grow more.

591
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,376
"The flashlight's
beam drew a moon through the black

00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,084
"across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard.

593
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,792

"'Little brothers

601
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:54,126
I'm listening. Read on.

602
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,584
Part two.

603
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:29,459
No!

604
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,084
Dear Sam, it saddens
me to write this letter,

605
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:14,167
but Mrs. Billingsley
and I have decided

606
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:16,251
we cannot permit you
to return to our home.

607
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:20,042
I know you mean well.
Do trust me, this is for the best.

608
00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:22,376
Godspeed,
Herbert Billingsley.

609
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:38,626
Be advised, the two of you will
never see each other again.

610
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:42,584
Those were your last words.
Do you understand?

611
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,626
I'd be careful
if I were you.

612
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:47,042
One of these days,
somebody's going to get pushed too far,

613
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:48,876
and who knows what
they're capable of.

614
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,792
Is that a threat?

615
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,334
It's a warning.

616
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,334
You're a traitor
to our family.

617
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,126
Good. I want to be.

618
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:18,376
I'm sorry about this.
I didn't know your situation.

619
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,501
It wasn't in the register.

620
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,751
How'd you lose your parents?

621
00:49:24,959 --> 00:49:27,876
Never mind, I don't
need to ask about that.

622
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:36,459
I wish we had time
to do an inspection back there. On the beach.

623
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:40,667
I would have given
you a commendable.

624
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,876
That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.

625
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,084
Honestly.

626
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,501
Thank you.

627
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,126
You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?

628
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,001
Hello, Becky?

629
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:08,334
Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.

630
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:09,459
Go ahead, New Penzance.

631
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,584
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp.

632
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:14,042
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

633
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:16,709
I'm calling in
reference to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state.

634
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:17,959
I understand he's
in your custody.

635
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,167
That's correct.

636
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:21,084
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

637
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,417
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

638
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,251
- He's fine.
- Very good.

639
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:26,667
How do I get to you?

640
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,292
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

641
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,959
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

642
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:31,959
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

643
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,834
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

644
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,542
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

645
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,251
Uh-huh.

646
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:38,792
Is that a yes?

647
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,251
Uh-huh.

648
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:44,834
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

649
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,001
Wait a second.

650
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,292
Yes?

651
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:48,542
Social Services?

652
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:49,834
Captain Sharp?

653
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,792
What's going to
happen to him?

654
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,584
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

655
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,792
but that option's no
longer available to us,

656
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:03,084
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

657
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,417
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

658
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:08,334
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

659
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:10,042
Who's speaking?

660
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:12,209
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

661
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,251
Right, an orphanage.

662
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:23,167
But the first step is
the admissions panel

663
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:24,917
requires
a psychological evaluation

664
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:27,417
to determine
whether or not the boy

665
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,459
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

666
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,084
or electroshock therapy.

667
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,167
Excuse me.
Shock therapy?

668
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,417
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

669
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,417
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

670
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,667
That was the girl.

671
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:41,917
That was the girl
that did that.

672
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:47,501
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

673
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:52,334
Okay.

674
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,376
I'll be out back.

675
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:34,417
I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.

676
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,459
I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

677
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:46,501
I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?

678
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:48,042
"Who made this decision?

679
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:52,042
"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?

680
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:54,459
"And why is it
still happening?"

681
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:58,126
We women are
more emotional...

682
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,626
I hate you.

683
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:01,959
Don't say "hate."

684
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:03,501
Why not? I mean it.

685
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:07,542
You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

686
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:08,834
Exactly.

687
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:13,542
I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.

688
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:21,917
He's not dumb.

689
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,167
But I guess
he is kind of sad.

690
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:28,542
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

691
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:30,542
It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge

692
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:33,126
what I already just said.

693
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:44,292
Poor Suzy.

694
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,834
Why is everything
so hard for you?

695
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:55,501
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?

696
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:05,542
Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?

697
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:12,042
I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.

698
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:16,084
We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

699
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,459
But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.

700
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:23,709
When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

701
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:26,667
That's very eloquent.

702
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,584
I can't argue against
anything you're saying.

703
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:33,417
But then again,
I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old.

704
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,626
Look, let's face it.

705
00:54:40,251 --> 00:54:43,834
You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.

706
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:46,876
In fact,
I guarantee it.

707
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:48,792
But even smart kids
stick their finger

708
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:50,459
in electrical
sockets sometimes.

709
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,834
It takes time to
figure things out.

710
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,084
It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.

711
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:02,417
It's our job to
try to protect you

712
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:05,709
from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.

713
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:07,459
You want a slug?

714
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,542
What's your rush?

715
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:23,209
You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.

716
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:24,667
Ahead of you, I mean.

717
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:27,542
Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.

718
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,042
So are you.

719
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,167
That's true.

720
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:35,917
Did you love someone ever?

721
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,292
Yes, I did.

722
00:55:39,376 --> 00:55:40,542
What happened?

723
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:44,126
She didn't love me back.

724
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:45,667
Ah.

725
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:51,667
I'm sorry for your loss.

726
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:53,542
Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.

727
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,376
Scout Master's log.
September 4th.

728
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:41,209
I heard he's going
to reform school.

729
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:43,167
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

730
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:44,751
send him to
an insane asylum.

731
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:45,959
I like his girl.

732
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,126
She's too scruffy for me.

733
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:48,417
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

734
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:50,001
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

735
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:51,126
Over shirt or under shirt?

736
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,292
Damn us.

737
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,126
It's none of our business.

738
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:09,334
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

739
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:12,292
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

740
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:17,667
Why's he so unpopular?

741
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,042
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

742
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:25,626
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

743
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:26,792
Nickleby?

744
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:28,667
Deluca?

745
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:30,417
Lazy-Eye?

746
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:31,959
Gadge?

747
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:35,709
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

748
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:37,542
Are we man enough
to give that

749
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,709
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

750
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,251
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

751
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:51,542
Okay. Okay.
What do you need?

752
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:53,542
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

753
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:55,876
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

754
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,876
In other words, it's over.

755
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:29,751
I guess so.
For the moment.

756
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:32,126
Until further notice.

757
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,334
That's right.

758
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:34,459
I understand.

759
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:39,251
I have to do better,
for everybody.

760
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:40,792
Except me.

761
00:58:40,876 --> 00:58:42,292
Except you.

762
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:47,167
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

763
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:50,459
You're doing
the right thing.

764
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:07,626
Who knows what's
going to happen, Duffy?

765
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:09,459
I'll probably
see you tomorrow.

766
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:53,209
Get out of my chimney.

767
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:54,459
Listen to me.

768
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:57,626
We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

769
00:59:57,709 --> 00:59:58,792
No, thanks.

770
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:01,209
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

771
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:05,251
It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

772
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,209
How'd you get here?

773
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,959
They snuck me down
the laundry chute

774
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,917
and left a papier-mâché
dummy in my bed.

775
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:19,292
Hmm... Diversion tactics.
Good thinking.

776
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:37,751
Where we going?

777
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:38,876
Fort Lebanon.

778
01:00:38,959 --> 01:00:42,042
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and
Resources outpost for the Hullabaloo.

779
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:45,376
He's a Falcon Scout,
Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.

780
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:47,001
Can we trust him?

781
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:48,917
Normally, I'd say no.

782
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,542
Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

783
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:54,709
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

784
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:56,459
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

785
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:57,584
True.

786
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:17,251
This is the island
of St. Jack Wood,

787
01:01:17,334 --> 01:01:19,042
extending far north
from Land's End

788
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:22,459
along the deep water channel
that leads to Broken Rock.

789
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:30,209
A low flood plain
separates the beach from the township above.

790
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:33,792
A small but
prosperous community.

791
01:01:33,876 --> 01:01:36,459
The barometer reads
28 inches and dropping.

792
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:41,084
Strong winds, as you can see,
already at 22 knots.

793
01:01:44,126 --> 01:01:47,334
The time is now 4:35 a.m.

794
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:11,876
Did you file the motion
of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?

795
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:13,209
It was sustained.

796
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:14,542
Good.

797
01:02:16,126 --> 01:02:18,584
Did the judge consider
your application for leniency?

798
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:20,001
Rogers v. Yentob?

799
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:21,959
- He granted it.
- Great.

800
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:27,126
I'm sorry, Walt.

801
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:32,459
It's not your fault.

802
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:38,209
Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

803
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:40,626
Specifically?

804
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:43,042
Whichever ones still hurt.

805
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:46,417
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

806
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:56,709
I hope the roof flies off,
and I get sucked up into space.

807
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,209
You'll be better
off without me.

808
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:03,667
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

809
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:08,501
Why?

810
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,959
We're all
they've got, Walt.

811
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:24,751
That's not enough.

812
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,209
"'But I'm not going,'
said Barnaby Jack.

813
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:36,542
"'I'm running away
tonight for good.

814
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:38,751
"'And this time I
won't get caught.'

815
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:41,167
"Annabelle whispered,
'I'm coming with you.'

816
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,042
"Her yellow hair,
now brown at the roots,

817
01:03:43,126 --> 01:03:44,917
"caught up in
the wind and danced.

818
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,584
"Barnaby Jack
took Annabelle's hand

819
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:49,334
"and pressed something into it
the size of a jellybean.

820
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,417
"'Hide this in your socks,
and be ready at midnight."'

821
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:56,917
Continue.

822
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,042
Keep going.

823
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,584
- Keep going.
- Go on.

824
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:00,792
- We're listening.
- That's good.

825
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:06,459
"He leapt out the window
and landed in the fresh fallen snow."

826
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:14,626
Where's my record player?

827
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,542
You're not going to
believe this one, sir.

828
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:30,626
That Scout Master on
New Penzance has now lost his entire troop.

829
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:37,292
Well, I'll be damned!

830
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:38,542
Who is this bimbo?

831
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:39,792
Couldn't say, sir.

832
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:57,792
Be right back.

833
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:05,834
There's a broken
gumball machine right behind the snack tent.

834
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:09,042
I don't care how they do it
where you come from.

835
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:12,042
You want pop? You want candy?
You want a snake bite kit?

836
01:06:12,126 --> 01:06:13,251
Get some money.

837
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:14,917
Cousin Ben?

838
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:17,042
Come back in five minutes.

839
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:21,584
Is this him?

840
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,667
Field Mate Sam Shakusky,
Troop 55, resigned.

841
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,542
He's hot. Almost too hot.
What's in the can?

842
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:27,042
$76, but it's mostly
in nickels.

843
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:28,209
Give it to me.

844
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:29,917
- Your badge in seamanship?
- Yes, sir.

845
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:32,417
Good. There's a cold water
crabber moored off Broken Rock.

846
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:33,667
The skipper owes me an IOU.

847
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:35,917
We'll see if he
can take you on as a claw cracker.

848
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:37,917
It won't be an easy life,
but it's better than shock therapy.

849
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:39,209
Thank you, sir.

850
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:41,001
By the way,
where's the chapel tent?

851
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,292
Back there,
but the padre's home with the mumps.

852
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:43,542
Why do you ask?

853
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:45,626
I want to bring my wife.

854
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:49,501
But we're not married yet.

855
01:06:49,584 --> 01:06:50,709
You his girl?

856
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:51,834
Yeah.

857
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:54,709
Technically,
I'm a civil law scrivener.

858
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:57,417
I'm authorized
to declare births, deaths, and marriages.

859
01:06:57,501 --> 01:06:59,084
You're kind of young.
You got a license?

860
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:00,459
- No.
- No.

861
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,001
I can't offer you
a legally binding union.

862
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:06,584
It won't hold up in
the state, the county,

863
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,042
or, frankly,
any courtroom in the world

864
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:09,542
due to your age,
lack of a license,

865
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,251
and failure to get
parental consent.

866
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:13,917
But the ritual does
carry a very important

867
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:15,709
moral weight
within yourselves.

868
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:18,751
You can't enter
into this lightly. Look into my eyes.

869
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,542
- Do you love each other?
- Yes, we do.

870
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:21,709
But think about
what I'm saying.

871
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:22,834
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

872
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,542
- Yes, we are.
- They're not listening to me.

873
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:26,417
- Let me rephrase it.
- We're in a hurry.

874
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,626
Are you chewing...

875
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,126
Spit out the gum, sister.
In fact, everybody.

876
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:33,667
I don’t like
the snappy attitude.

877
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:36,042
This is the most
important decision you've made in your lives.

878
01:07:36,126 --> 01:07:37,542
Go over by that trampoline
and talk it through

879
01:07:37,626 --> 01:07:40,417
before you give me
another quick answer.

880
01:07:58,292 --> 01:07:59,376
We're sure.

881
01:07:59,459 --> 01:08:01,459
Okay. Let's do a blood test.

882
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,042
Under the eye of God,

883
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:05,334
and within the boundaries of
this local jurisdiction,

884
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:10,209
which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the 5th of September, 1965.

885
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:11,376
That's the end
of the short form.

886
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:13,417
Do any of the witnesses
have objections or remarks?

887
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:15,876
Usually they don't. Skotak?

888
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:18,167
Can we loan them the nickels?
I'm worried about their future.

889
01:08:18,251 --> 01:08:20,167
That's my fee.

890
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,417
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

891
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:24,917
What'd I just say?
That's my fee. I'm keeping the nickels.

892
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,126
Okay, they can have
the tennis ball can.

893
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:38,542
Sign here,
initial here and here.

894
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:42,251
Take the carbon,
leave the Bible. Let's go.

895
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,042
Where are they going, again?

896
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,709
He's going to
work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.

897
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,709
- I wish them well.
- Me, too.

898
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:19,584
Me, too.

899
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:21,292
I think they're coming back.

900
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:26,126
- Be quick, sailor!
- What happened?

901
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:28,417
She left her
binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.

902
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:30,501
Just leave them.

903
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,417
We can't.
It's her magic power!

904
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:48,251
You killed your dog,
by the way.

905
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:49,792
- Snoopy?
- Mmm-hmm.

906
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:52,626
Well, it couldn't be helped.

907
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,126
Why do you
consider me your enemy?

908
01:10:58,792 --> 01:10:59,959
Because your
girlfriend stabbed me

909
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:01,584
in the back with
lefty scissors.

910
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:03,667
She's my wife now.

911
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,751
Congratulations.

912
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:10,959
Thank you, but I'm saying before
that, six weeks ago, from day one.

913
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:13,959
Why don't you like me?

914
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,959
Why should I?
Nobody else does.

915
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:32,042
My God! He's here!
The fugitive! Stop him!

916
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:33,709
Stop him!

917
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,792
On this spot,
I'll fight no more, forever.

918
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:35,001
Come and get me,
you bastards!

919
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:50,792
I'm okay.

920
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:55,209
Follow me.

921
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,084
Company, let's go!

922
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:14,876
Captain Sharp,
we've located the missing troop.

923
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:17,042
They just fled camp.
We're in pursuit.

924
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,751
They're accompanied
by a 12-year-old girl

925
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:20,376
in knee socks
and Sunday school shoes.

926
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:22,542
Stand by,
Commander Pierce.

927
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,876
Jed, re-route to
St. Jack Wood.

928
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:26,917
Tell Social Services
the boy's at Fort Lebanon.

929
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,042
Roger that.
Will comply.

930
01:13:28,126 --> 01:13:29,709
Notify the Bishops,
Suzy's there.

931
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:30,876
Randy, you monitoring?

932
01:13:30,959 --> 01:13:33,084
Affirmative.
I'm on my way.

933
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:35,334
Hello?

934
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:36,459
Hello, Mr. Bishop?

935
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,459
Oh, dear God.
Get the boys!

936
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:41,626
Let's go! Right now!

937
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,667
Tower control,
this is Jed.

938
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:47,751
Confirm coordinates for new
destination, Alpha two-two-seven-one-fiver.

939
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:49,167
Looking pretty soupy up here.

940
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:52,126
Wouldn't mind setting down
before the pot boils over.

941
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:53,501
Hang on, Social Services.

942
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,459
Once again, storm
waters have just breached

943
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,209
the dam at
Black Beacon Reservoir.

944
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:20,459
A flash flood
alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions

945
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,042
That's coming our way.

946
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,792
Did you find them?

947
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,501
Prepare to mobilize
to higher ground.

948
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:32,876
St. Jack's Church
is the designated storm shelter.

949
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:35,959
Notify all Scouts to
muster outside my tent, on the double.

950
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,042
Attention, company!

951
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:17,751
Prepare for...

952
01:15:18,626 --> 01:15:19,959
Who's that?

953
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:32,292
You call yourself
a Khaki Scout?

954
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:33,834
Sorry, sir?

955
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:36,459
Where's your goddamn troop,
you son of a bitch?

956
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,876
You don't have them?

957
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:40,334
They could get
killed out there!

958
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:43,542
I'm field stripping
you of your command.

959
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,876
Attention, company!

960
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:56,209
Prepare for
emergency evacuation!

961
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:58,626
Sir, do you have
your medicine?

962
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:01,834
I'll be right back.

963
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,209
Hold your positions!

964
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,542
Company secretary,
status report.

965
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,251
All accounted for,
Scout Master!

966
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:15,751
Okay, boys,
we're going to make a run for it! Fall in!

967
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:18,084
Let's move!

968
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,376
Come on, follow me!

969
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,126
Who's in charge here?

970
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:46,709
Randy, what happened?

971
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:47,876
Take the commander off me!

972
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,542
Suzy?

973
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,876
Suzy? Sam?

974
01:17:53,959 --> 01:17:55,042
They ran away again.

975
01:17:57,834 --> 01:17:59,792
We got to go back out there.
I need volunteers.

976
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:02,042
You, and you and you.

977
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:03,959
- You?
- Are you all right?

978
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,292
Of course I am.

979
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:19,126
Where's the boy?

980
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:21,251
We don't know yet.

981
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:22,667
That's not acceptable.

982
01:18:23,417 --> 01:18:25,376
What do you
want me to say, lady?

983
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:26,792
Somebody get
Jed a cup of coffee.

984
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:30,626
- You're Captain Sharp.
- That's correct.

985
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:33,751
I'm Social Services. I remanded the
boy into your personal custody.

986
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,167
You're responsible
for his safety.

987
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:37,667
I'm told that
he's just been struck by lightning.

988
01:18:37,751 --> 01:18:39,084
That's the first
I've heard of it.

989
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:40,209
It's true.

990
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:41,584
Scout Master Ward,
I presume.

991
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:42,709
Yes, ma'am.

992
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:44,167
Your reputation
precedes you.

993
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:46,667
You two are
the most appallingly

994
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:48,251
incompetent
custodial guardians

995
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:50,334
Social Services has
ever had the misfortune

996
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,792
to encounter in
a 27-year career!

997
01:18:53,584 --> 01:18:55,167
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

998
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,751
You can't do this.
They'll eat him alive in there.

999
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:58,876
Where?

1000
01:18:58,959 --> 01:19:00,376
What's the name
of the place again?

1001
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:03,376
Juvenile Refuge.

1002
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:05,084
Sounds like jail.

1003
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:09,959
Just find the boy,
and deliver him to Social Services.

1004
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,834
Nothing else
is in your power.

1005
01:19:11,917 --> 01:19:13,792
I'm sorry.
Can we get back to the rescue now?

1006
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,542
- Suzy is still out there.
- Who are you?

1007
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,751
Walt and Laura Bishop,
their daughter's the missing girl.

1008
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:18,876
The parents of the stabber?

1009
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:21,042
I object to that description.
She was attacked.

1010
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:22,167
Excuse me?

1011
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:24,542
I want the details about that.
Where's the Scout she knifed?

1012
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,001
Right here.

1013
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:28,042
- Field Mate Redford, sir.
- What's his condition?

1014
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:29,667
He may suffer some limited
chronic kidney insufficiency.

1015
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:30,792
Here's the report.

1016
01:19:30,876 --> 01:19:32,334
- We don't have time for that!
- She's right.

1017
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:34,001
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1018
01:19:35,792 --> 01:19:37,459
Nobody's going anywhere.

1019
01:19:39,626 --> 01:19:41,792
He's not getting
shock therapy.

1020
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:46,042
That's it!
I am citing you for gross misconduct.

1021
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:47,376
You are hereby
summoned to appear...

1022
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:48,626
I'm writing you up back!

1023
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:51,167
Be notified that
you stand accused of mistreatment...

1024
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:52,292
What are you talking about?

1025
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:53,417
I won't let you do it!

1026
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:54,542
Look!

1027
01:20:03,126 --> 01:20:04,792
- They're gone.
- Who?

1028
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:06,667
- Suzy?
- Sam!

1029
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:07,792
- They're here?
- Yeah.

1030
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:10,251
Where'd they go?
Answer me!

1031
01:20:30,376 --> 01:20:32,667
Halt! Stop!

1032
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,584
Stay there.

1033
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:42,167
Wait, take these!

1034
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,209
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

1035
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:01,001
Come down!

1036
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:17,084
Social Services,
do you read me? Over.

1037
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:38,417
We might have to
swim for it.

1038
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:42,751
How deep is it?
I didn't bring my life jacket.

1039
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:45,667
I don't know, but if it's too
shallow, we'll break our necks anyway.

1040
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:49,209
Hang on to me.

1041
01:21:50,584 --> 01:21:51,834
Okay.

1042
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:55,501
No, I'm not married, but I'm a police officer.

1043
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:57,376
Application denied.
I'm sorry.

1044
01:21:57,459 --> 01:22:00,001
I cannot
authorize that. Over.

1045
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:02,501
Counselors, what's
the legal perspective? Over.

1046
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,709
In this state,
I would litigate with extreme confidence.

1047
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:07,542
- I concur.
- Open with Article 15

1048
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,042
of the Codes of
Civic Jurisdiction.

1049
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:10,917
No party,
under any circumstances,

1050
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:12,501
shall be denied due
and proper consideration

1051
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,042
without prejudice
in perpetuity.

1052
01:22:14,959 --> 01:22:16,126
On three again.

1053
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:17,376
Wait.

1054
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,584
Just in case
this is a suicide

1055
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,209
or they capture us
and we never see each other again anymore,

1056
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:26,626
I just want to say
thank you for marrying me.

1057
01:22:27,959 --> 01:22:30,334
I'm glad I got
to know you, Suzy.

1058
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,501
I think you've still
got lightning in you.

1059
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:45,959
Let's jump.

1060
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:47,667
No! God damn it!

1061
01:22:50,126 --> 01:22:51,376
Tell him. Over.

1062
01:22:51,459 --> 01:22:53,209
Captain Sharp is
offering to assume

1063
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,959
the responsibility
of foster parenthood.

1064
01:22:55,959 --> 01:22:58,042
He wants you
to live with him.

1065
01:22:58,459 --> 01:23:00,792
Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?

1066
01:23:04,376 --> 01:23:05,626
What do you think, pal?

1067
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:18,001
We're coming down.
Over and out.

1068
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:19,959
They're coming down.
Over and...

1069
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,001
Don't let go.

1070
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:49,042
The Black Beacon
storm was considered

1071
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:50,876
by the US Department
of Inclement Weather

1072
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:53,834
to be the region's
most destructive meteorological event

1073
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:56,792
of the second half
of the 20th century.

1074
01:23:57,501 --> 01:24:01,084
It lingered through six high
tides and inundated the islands

1075
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:04,917
with punishing winds
and extreme high waters.

1076
01:24:05,834 --> 01:24:09,792
On St. Jack Wood,
powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk

1077
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:13,167
and demolished
the village bandstand and casino.

1078
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:16,834
Scout Master's log.
October 10th.

1079
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:19,626
Reconstruction continues
increasingly ahead of schedule,

1080
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,209
which I attribute to
a particularly robust

1081
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:24,126
esprit de corps
among the troop.

1082
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:25,417
The latrine, however,
does continue to present...

1083
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:26,626
Excuse me, sir?

1084
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:28,667
- You've got the new recruit?
- Yes, sir.

1085
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:30,292
- What's his rank?
- He doesn't have one.

1086
01:24:30,376 --> 01:24:32,042
Pigeon Scout.
Let's get him a patch.

1087
01:24:32,126 --> 01:24:34,042
The coastal
areas of New Penzance

1088
01:24:34,126 --> 01:24:36,084
were battered
and changed forever.

1089
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,751
Height.

1090
01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:39,834
63 inches.

1091
01:24:40,417 --> 01:24:43,251
Mile 3.25
Tidal Inlet was erased from the map.

1092
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:47,167
But harvest yields
the following autumn

1093
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:49,959
far exceeded any
previously recorded,

1094
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:54,667
and the quality of the crops
was said to be extraordinary.

1095
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:03,542
So you see,
the composer Benjamin Britten

1096
01:25:03,626 --> 01:25:06,126
has taken the whole
orchestra apart.

1097
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:09,126
Now he puts it
back together again in a fugue.

1098
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:11,042
The instruments come
in one after another

1099
01:25:11,126 --> 01:25:14,376
in the same order as before,
beginning with the piccolo.

1100
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:17,626
And at the end, when all the
instruments have finally come in...

1101
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:20,167
Suzy, Lionel,
Murray, Rudy, dinner!

1102
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:21,667
...melody, while
the other instruments...

1103
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:24,251
Don't make us
ask twice!

1104
01:25:48,084 --> 01:25:49,292
See you tomorrow.

1105
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:57,167
For Juman

1106
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,417
Now we will
demonstrate the orchestration

1107
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:46,209
of Monsieur Desplat's
musical suite.

1108
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:49,042
A little electronic
metronome sets the time.

1109
01:29:50,459 --> 01:29:52,376
First, a harp.

1110
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,376
Next, pizzicato cellos.

1111
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:06,792
Flute and piccolo.

1112
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,001
Electric guitar.

1113
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:24,917
Ukulele.

1114
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:30,792
Classical guitar.

1115
01:30:36,334 --> 01:30:37,876
Banjo.

1116
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:45,917
Thin wood blocks.

1117
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:54,376
And two more harps.

1118
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,459
B-3 organ.

1119
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,251
Celesta.

1120
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:11,959
Bowed vibraphone.

1121
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:18,626
And piano.

1122
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:29,376
Pizzicato violins.

1123
01:31:33,042 --> 01:31:34,876
And double bass.

1124
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:41,542
Tubular bells.

1125
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:45,209
And the glockenspiel.

1126
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,459
The ride cymbal.

1127
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:51,251
Piatti.

1128
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:55,459
Snare drums.

1129
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:58,251
Gran casa.

1130
01:32:01,626 --> 01:32:03,001
Timpani!

1131
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,542
Sixteen baritone bass singers.

1132
01:32:12,292 --> 01:32:13,751
Xylophone.

1133
01:32:17,626 --> 01:32:19,001
Bassoons.

1134
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:23,417
Clarinet.

1135
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,084
French horns.

1136
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:31,167
Tenor sax.

1137
01:32:36,459 --> 01:32:38,042
Trombone.

1138
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:43,001
Tuba!

1139
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:48,876
Trumpets.

1140
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:09,876
Triangle.

1141
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:19,626
Thank you very
much for listening.
