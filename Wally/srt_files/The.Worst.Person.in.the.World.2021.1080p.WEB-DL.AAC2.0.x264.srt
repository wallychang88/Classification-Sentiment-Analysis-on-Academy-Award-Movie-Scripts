1
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,722
THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD

2
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,999
A film in 12 chapters,
a prologue and an epilogue

3
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,374
You've been through the epidermis,
derma and muscles.

4
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,249
PROLOGUE

5
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,749
Julie disappointed herself.
This used to be easy.

6
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,249
She was still among the top students,

7
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:18,916
but there were too many

8
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,082
interruptions, updates,

9
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,624
feeds,

10
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,999
unsolvable global problems.

11
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,916
She sensed

12
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,874
a gnawing unease
she had tried to suppress by cramming

13
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,374
by drowning it in digital interference.

14
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,791
This was wrong.
This wasn't her.

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,624
She'd chosen medicine

16
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,707
because it was
so hard to gain admission.

17
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,082
Where her excellent grades
actually meant something.

18
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,374
But then she had a revelation.

19
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,249
Her passion had always been the soul.

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,332
The mind, not the body.

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,707
Surgery is like, so concrete.

22
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,082
It's almost like being a carpenter.

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,874
But now...

24
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:17,874
My passion has always been what
goes on inside, thoughts and feelings.

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,207
It was like a window had opened.

26
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,374
Not anatomy.

27
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,999
If psychology will make you happy,
then do it.

28
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,416
I think you're really brave.

29
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,666
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,374
She left him.

31
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,332
Though he was devastated,

32
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:40,624
he had to respect
the way she took control of her life.

33
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,999
She observed her fellow students.

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,332
Norway's future spiritual advisers.

35
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,582
Mostly girls with borderline
eating disorders.

36
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,957
Say you're at a party.

37
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,374
She still felt trapped in
the role of model student.

38
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,541
All this cramming.

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,332
When was life supposed to start?

40
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,749
What's your name?

41
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,749
Julie.

42
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,957
The person's name is Julie.

43
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,166
Let's say Julie and I
meet at a party,

44
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,541
and we feel a mutual attraction.

45
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,916
Hypothetically.

46
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,207
Actually, she was a visual person.

47
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:57,041
Now I know.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,624
I want to be a photographer.

49
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,332
A photographer?

50
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:02,749
I see.

51
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:06,374
Julie spent her student loan
on cameras and lenses.

52
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,332
As long as you're serious about it.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,332
No safety net. No holding back.

54
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,582
Need help?

55
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,499
She took a temp job
in a bookstore.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,874
Started a photography course.

57
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:18,707
Super!

58
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,707
She made new friends.

59
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,666
It felt like coming home.

60
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,916
Suddenly Oslo was a different city.

61
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,499
New places. New faces.

62
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,582
Hi. Aksel.

63
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,541
Right...

64
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,624
You're the comic book artist?

65
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,082
She'd heard
he was the creator of Bobcat.

66
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,082
Sorry, I'm a wild animal.

67
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,832
Have you read it?

68
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:49,832
Yeah.

69
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,332
So?

70
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,124
She pretended she'd read it.

71
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,541
She only remembered one strip
she'd found vaguely sexist.

72
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,541
I know what you mean.

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,832
Nothing's ever good enough.

74
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,916
The only thing worse than
all the idiots is yourself.

75
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:21,916
But...

76
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:27,082
If we go on, I'll fall in love with you.
Then it'll be too late.

77
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,249
Maybe we should agree to...

78
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,124
stop seeing each other.

79
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,999
The problem is our age difference.

80
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,624
I'm just afraid we'll fall into
a vicious circle.

81
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,916
You're much younger than I am.

82
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,707
You'll start to question who you are.

83
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,791
I'm past 40.
I've entered a new phase.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,291
Whereas you still need time
to find yourself.

85
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,041
You don't need me waiting.

86
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,082
You need to be completely free.

87
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,082
I'm just afraid we'll hurt each other.

88
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,707
Later she said
that was the precise moment

89
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,041
she fell in love with him.

90
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,166
Shall I put your bag in the bedroom?

91
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,499
Yes, please.

92
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,207
I have two copies of a book!

93
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:56,541
Huh?

94
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:57,666
Yeah.

95
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,832
I'll throw one away.

96
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,624
Can I have two shelves?

97
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,499
How many closets do you need?

98
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,082
How many can I have?

99
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,166
No, that's not how it works.

100
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,541
This is antique glass.
All wavy and stuff.

101
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,166
No, don't do that. Not like that.

102
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,166
No!

103
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,999
Lift this catch here.

104
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,332
I'm terrified it'll break.

105
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,124
I gaze out this window.

106
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,249
- No way!
- I'm not kidding.

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,331
Hey, that's how relationships work.

108
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:36,791
She's a bit frosty towards me.
That's new.

109
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,749
Yeah? Why do you think that is?

110
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,999
It's embarrassing to say.

111
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,291
We've been single together.

112
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,166
Lived that life.

113
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,041
Then suddenly I move in with you.

114
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,957
- And you're happy?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,374
No, no, no...

116
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,832
Did you date this guy?

117
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,624
Yeah, just a fling.

118
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,082
Okay.

119
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,874
Stop!

120
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,249
You're so predictable!

121
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,499
Let's just fuck.

122
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,999
Hello!

123
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,582
Chapter 1
THE OTHERS

124
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,457
- Happy to see you!
- Me too.

125
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,082
- Doing good?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,166
Hi, Martin.

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,457
Welcome.

128
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,041
Thanks for coming.

129
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,832
Dad designed it.

130
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,957
We should renovate,
but don't want to change anything.

131
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,041
It's beautiful.

132
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,291
Yeah, but there's stuff like that. Damp.

133
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,874
We get this room
because we're childless.

134
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,332
Dibs on the top bunk.

135
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,499
I always feel that Tone doesn't like me.

136
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,249
She's just shy.

137
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,999
That's what you say about boring people.

138
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,999
- It's my turn now.
- Okay.

139
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,332
Thank you.

140
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,624
Vin?

141
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,541
Vin de blanc?

142
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,707
Thanks.

143
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:43,874
Do you have any friends with kids yet?

144
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,499
No. Only one.

145
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,916
guess this feels unfamiliar.

146
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,291
- They're very sweet.
- Thanks.

147
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,666
So what are you doing now, Julie?

148
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,291
Aksel says you've started writing?

149
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,957
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it writing.

150
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,332
Being modest?

151
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,332
No.

152
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,749
Seems so.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,249
Is there anything you'd like to do,

154
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,624
as a career?

155
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,666
Questions, questions, Karianne.

156
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,749
That question was vulgar
when we were students.

157
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:21,624
Lucky you!

158
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,041
Yeah, we were.

159
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,499
True, we had a lot of freedom.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
Being young today is different.

161
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,207
The pressure is heart-breaking.

162
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,624
There's no time to think.

163
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,582
Always something on the screen.

164
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,499
Take William.

165
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,749
If we don't set limits,
he spends his life on screens.

166
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,666
Nice try.

167
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,791
Okay.

168
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,791
No, it's not your turn.

169
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,082
It's Martin's turn.

170
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,999
Julie's still the closest.

171
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,874
Bedtime.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,541
- She's exhausted.
- No!

173
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,374
No!

174
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,499
- Yes!
- No!

175
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
I don't want to go to bed!

176
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,249
I don't want to!

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,791
Eva, don't make another scene.
Come here!

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,332
No! I don't want to!

179
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,541
Let go!

180
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,582
- You silly girl!
- I don't want to!

181
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,291
But I want you to!

182
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,916
I don't want to!

183
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,707
Kids can be intense.

184
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,832
Well, it's okay.

185
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,707
- Fun with kids.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,041
Can't we just enjoy it?

187
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,749
Please. No fights.

188
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,749
There are kids here, and it's chaos.

189
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,041
Just try.

190
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,041
Try playing with them
or something, okay?

191
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,124
Please.

192
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,791
Spare me the kid talk.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,124
Sorry, but I wasn't the one who started.

194
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,916
You're with someone who's
younger than you. There's a gap.

195
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,207
You're almost 30.
Not a bad age to have kids.

196
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,874
I'm 44. I want to go to the next level.
With you.

197
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,374
It has nothing to do with my friends.

198
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:36,332
You seem to be waiting for something.
I don't know what.

199
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,416
Hello?

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,666
Jeez.

201
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,957
I didn't want to get into this.

202
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,041
Really not.

203
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,582
Everything's on your terms.

204
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,041
You have time off,
so we're on holiday.

205
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,416
You agreed.

206
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,624
After you publish, you get bored.

207
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,582
And start talking about kids.

208
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,499
The others here have kids,
so it's an issue.

209
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,041
Not true.

210
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,832
It is true.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,124
And then...

212
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,124
you get a new idea at some point,

213
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,999
and disappear into your drawing board.

214
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,749
What are you saying?

215
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,249
Don't start. It's not cool.

216
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,916
Shut up. Please.

217
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,249
Of course I'd be there if we had kids.

218
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,374
You know that.
You know I want children.

219
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,374
Sure, and I'll also want kids
at some point.

220
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,957
But I don't know...

221
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,666
I have no maternal instinct, right?

222
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,207
No, you'd make a great mom.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,749
I'm sure of it.

224
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,707
I want to have children too.

225
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,666
At some point.

226
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,499
So what are we waiting for?
What has to happen first?

227
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,832
I don't know what exactly.

228
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,791
I just want to do more first.

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,082
Okay, like what?

230
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,874
What's the obstacle?

231
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,499
I don't know! Why do you ask?

232
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,832
Your concept is flawed.

233
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:10,624
Most people have kids without
sorting out their life first.

234
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,207
- They figure it out.
- Flawed?

235
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,791
That's how most people do it.

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,499
But I don't want everything
to happen on your terms,

237
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,874
based on what you want.

238
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,749
Fine. I got it.
But what do you want?

239
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,082
Oh, please! We have to stop.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,124
I need sleep
to put up with those people.

241
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:09,457
I know a guy
who has a theory about that.

242
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,082
He says we have
a limited number of sperm.

243
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,624
Say... three trillion in your lifetime.

244
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,874
Jerk off too much

245
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,624
and you run out.
Could be true.

246
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,832
Easy now, Portnoy.

247
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,374
How fascinating.

248
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,666
Personally, I feel like

249
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:30,332
I know everything
about male problems.

250
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,832
Erectile dysfunction,

251
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,999
morning wood,
infatuation with young women...

252
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,166
premature ejaculation...

253
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,332
Nice work, Aksel.

254
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,457
It's in all the books and movies.

255
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,624
Where's the menstrual period?

256
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,207
Female orgasm and desire? Where?

257
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:51,318
Good question. Tell us.
In juicy detail.

258
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,707
No, the point is

259
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,332
it shouldn't be taboo.

260
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:59,249
If men had periods,
that's all we'd hear about.

261
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,916
Can you womansplain it

262
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,457
a bit better?

263
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,082
What do you mean?

264
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,915
Like mansplaining, but womansplaining.

265
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,499
What?

266
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,082
Mansplaining is...

267
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,290
When a 45-year-old man explains

268
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,790
how things really are
to a younger woman.

269
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,582
Nice demonstration!

270
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,040
My pleasure.

271
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,457
Ding! Great!

272
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,165
Whisky, anyone?

273
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,291
How's the senior citizen club doing?

274
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,041
Come on.

275
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,749
Look who's here!

276
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,332
Are you okay?

277
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,749
Not really.

278
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,999
Show me.

279
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,249
No!

280
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,291
Let me see...

281
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,582
We'll laugh about it later.
It's just a scratch.

282
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,916
Karianne's such a drama queen.

283
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,666
It's my fault.

284
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,041
Not at all, Julie.

285
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,541
It is. I always overdo it.

286
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:50,457
I know being here isn't easy for you.

287
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:55,249
I'm not into this whole
"happy family" thing either.

288
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,041
I'm glad it turned into a party tonight.

289
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,541
I hope you had fun!

290
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,916
What the hell's wrong with you?

291
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,291
What's wrong with having a little fun?

292
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,416
I didn't have any fun!

293
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,166
Sorry that happened.

294
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,332
You don't care!

295
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,707
Shut up! Just shut up!

296
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,832
You don't give a shit about me!

297
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,124
Shall we make a baby?

298
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,541
Fuck you.

299
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,457
- Hi.
- Good morning.

300
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,832
There's coffee. And cups.

301
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:23,374
Chapter 2
CHEATING

302
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,541
Sorry, I forgot.

303
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,457
What's your line of work?

304
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,166
I work in a bookstore.

305
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,999
Which one?

306
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,166
Norli, by the university.

307
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,416
Could you excuse me for a moment?

308
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,457
Could you sign?

309
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,749
Sure, I'll just finish this.

310
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,166
Any new Bobcat in the pipeline?

311
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,457
I've moved on.

312
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,332
Do you work full-time there,

313
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,332
or are you just temping on weekends?

314
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,499
- Sorry.
- Bye.

315
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,457
Hey, I think I'll head home.

316
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,916
Okay.

317
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,624
- You good?
- Yeah.

318
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,582
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,416
- I can stay if you like.
- It's okay.

320
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,457
- But I have to stay a bit longer.
- Of course.

321
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,582
Okay. See you at home.

322
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,582
Hi. Can I have a smoke?

323
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,041
Of course.

324
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,874
I had my second child
ten years later.

325
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,999
Now we're supposed
to introduce solids at 4 months.

326
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:02,791
What made the pediatricians
change their minds?

327
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,374
- Do you cuddle your kids?
- Sure, a lot.

328
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,207
They'll be drug addicts.

329
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,749
They'll be addicts
because I cuddle them?

330
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,874
Yeah, according to new research.

331
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,916
New research says
you shouldn't cuddle your kids?

332
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:24,541
I realise it must be counterintuitive
for a mother.

333
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,249
But motherhood upsets
your limbic system.

334
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,874
So my kids are going to be drug addicts?

335
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,541
That's ridiculous.
Do you have children?

336
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:37,082
No, but I'm a doctor.
I have a medical perspective.

337
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:41,416
Babies express themselves by crying.

338
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:46,041
It's normal for a mother or a father
to comfort them.

339
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:22,707
Hi.

340
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,957
Not asking me the usual questions?

341
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,124
- Which ones?
- Who I am, what I do.

342
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,124
Who are you? What do you do?

343
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,707
I hate those questions.

344
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:41,124
They're especially bad
when you're a doctor.

345
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,541
Are you a doctor?

346
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,374
No, you are.

347
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,082
Which questions should I ask?

348
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,499
Ask me who I know here.

349
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,999
- Who do you know here?
- Nobody.

350
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,499
I crashed the party.

351
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,666
You just waltzed in?

352
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,291
Okay.

353
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,957
Nothing's gonna happen.

354
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,207
Of course not.

355
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,957
I'm with someone I love.

356
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,124
Me too.

357
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:50,291
And I can't stand cheating.
I've been there. Never again.

358
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,457
- Right, cheating is...
- No good.

359
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,749
But where do you draw the line?

360
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,416
You can feel it.

361
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,957
If I do this...

362
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,207
Is that cheating?

363
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,374
No.

364
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,332
What about this?

365
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,874
- No, that's permissible.
- Is it?

366
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,624
And hurting someone
who's not your partner?

367
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,207
- You hurt your partner?
- Is that cheating?

368
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,707
Did that hurt?

369
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,249
Did it?

370
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,624
- Feel good?
- Yeah, it did.

371
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,874
Okay.

372
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,291
Let me smell your sweat.

373
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,791
- No.
- Yes.

374
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,957
- Seriously?
- Yes, that's allowed.

375
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,749
- It stinks!
- Yes.

376
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,999
The kind of smell you never forget.

377
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,916
My turn to smell you.

378
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,999
No, please.
I regret it now.

379
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,207
Let me smell.

380
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,666
I think you smell nice.

381
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,332
I don't know if...

382
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,582
this is permissible.

383
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,791
Go ahead.

384
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,666
Okay.

385
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,916
You start, then I'll go next.

386
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,374
I actually think sex is best

387
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,957
when the dick isn't too hard.

388
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,624
Because...

389
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,291
in a way, then I'm the one

390
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:46,332
who makes it hard, you know?

391
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,666
My secret will be dumb now.

392
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,707
I guess I misunderstood.

393
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,999
I was going to say
I like the Barcode Project.

394
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,791
It looks pretty from the bridge
when I go to work.

395
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,791
I expose my darkest secrets,
and you...

396
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,624
You said "secrets", not "darkest".

397
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,041
So why is that a secret?

398
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,124
Because everyone thinks it's ugly.

399
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,166
Sorry, we're....

400
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,332
- Can I whisper it?
- Okay.

401
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,582
What?

402
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:18,291
Sorry, I seem to
be sitting on everything.

403
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,749
My bad.

404
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,374
There's nothing sexual about that.

405
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,082
Not at all.

406
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,124
Although you do like soft dicks.

407
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,541
Yeah.

408
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,332
Okay. Your turn.

409
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,082
I can't pee.

410
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,207
Just relax.

411
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,124
I'm going this way.

412
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:36,999
Okay.

413
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,582
What's your name?

414
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,791
Julie.

415
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,541
- I'm Eivind. Eivind...
- Don't say it.

416
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,082
Why not?

417
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,291
I'll find you on Facebook, and...

418
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,624
Good thinking.

419
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,791
Okay.

420
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:01,791
- Bye.
- Bye.

421
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,999
- We didn't cheat.
- No.

422
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,416
- Not at all.
- No.

423
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,541
Bye.

424
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:40,582
Chapter 3
ORAL SEX IN THE AGE OF #METOO

425
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,249
Aksel?

426
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,832
Aksel, I need to tell you something.

427
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,249
Aksel?

428
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:44,041
"A friend told me she had sex
with a man

429
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:48,207
"who pumped his dick into her mouth
while he held her head."

430
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,207
"She was confused
because she enjoyed it.

431
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,416
"It really turned her on.

432
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:59,374
"Can you be a feminist
and still enjoy being mouth-fucked?

433
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:03,082
"Most women I know are ambivalent
about performing oral sex.

434
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:08,207
"They must act as if they like...
...the pathetic expectation

435
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:11,082
"that it'll turn them on...

436
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,457
"I like it flaccid.

437
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,166
"So I create the stiffness

438
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:18,457
"instead of having it thrust upon me."

439
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,624
This is good.

440
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,124
- Yeah?
- It's over the top.

441
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:51,624
I don't agree with everything,
but it's very well written.

442
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,999
Original. Very good.

443
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,874
What will you do with it?

444
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:57,916
I don't know.

445
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,624
You really think it's good?

446
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,541
Yeah. Absolutely.

447
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,416
You sure?

448
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,249
Yeah, I'm not lying.

449
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,082
No?

450
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,416
Are you sure?

451
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,916
Don't you dare doubt it.

452
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,499
It's pretty cerebral.

453
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:27,416
But it turns me on too.

454
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,124
- Right?
- Kinda.

455
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,166
Is that why you wrote it?

456
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,416
Intellectual Viagra?

457
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,874
- Yeah.
- It works.

458
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,166
Her piece
"Oral Sex in the Age of #MeToo"

459
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,916
was published on jubel.no.

460
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,791
It was widely shared and set off
a lively Facebook debate.

461
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,957
With the strong painkillers I'm on,
I can't drive.

462
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,541
I hoped I could come, but...

463
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,999
I can't spend an hour on a bus
with this back.

464
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,332
Could you come to Hønefoss
next weekend?

465
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,957
So we can celebrate together.

466
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,166
Nathalie says happy birthday too.

467
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,124
Say hello from me.

468
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,166
How nice to see you.

469
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,207
- It's been too long.
- Way too long.

470
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,249
Anyway, have a nice birthday.

471
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,541
Thanks.

472
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:31,749
Okay.

473
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,874
I'm too skinny?

474
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,916
- You work too much.
- True.

475
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,082
We'll talk later.

476
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,666
Happy birthday!

477
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:47,541
- Why do I always have to go see him?
- He's not coming?

478
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,874
Well, he's got a backache.

479
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,124
There's always something wrong with him.

480
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:55,499
Hello!

481
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,374
So, he's not coming.

482
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,332
That's not nice.

483
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,916
He wanted to, but he has a backache.

484
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,791
Does he realise how it makes you feel?

485
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,582
- He's...
- It's a backache, Mom.

486
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,124
Sorry.

487
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,999
Please help yourself.

488
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,207
Thank you. It looks delicious.

489
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,041
I hope you like it.

490
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,832
Hurray and happy birthday today!

491
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,499
It's time to celebrate you!

492
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,332
At 30, Julie's mom, Eva,

493
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,541
had been divorced for two years.
A single mom

494
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,082
and accountant in a publishing house.

495
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,082
Let us dance, hop, jump and turn

496
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:42,999
Wishing you the very happiest returns

497
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,332
For now it's time for celebration!

498
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,124
Congratulations!

499
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,666
Thanks.

500
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,416
Have you read Julie's article?

501
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,384
Of course.

502
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,791
- And?
- It's great.

503
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:03,666
Have you read it, Mom?

504
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:04,999
No.

505
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:08,749
Julie's article. It's excellent.

506
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,374
At 30, Julie's grandmother
had three children.

507
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,916
She played Rebecca West
in Rosmersholm at the National Theatre.

508
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,582
At 30,
Julie's great-grandmother, Astrid,

509
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,207
was a widow, alone with four children.

510
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:28,957
Julie's great-great-grandmother
had seven children.

511
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,582
Two died of tuberculosis.

512
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:35,124
Julie's great-great-great-grandmother,
Herta, was a merchant's wife

513
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,332
with six children

514
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,499
in a loveless marriage.

515
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:44,332
Julie's great-great-great-great-
grandmother never turned 30.

516
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:49,166
The life expectancy for women
at the time was 35 years.

517
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:54,374
I don't want to bother you
with it, but...

518
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:01,249
It's getting harder and harder to pee.

519
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:05,332
I was scared it was prostate cancer,

520
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:06,957
but it wasn't.

521
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,666
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

522
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:11,999
Still...

523
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,624
I go to the toilet all the time.

524
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:16,791
And...

525
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,416
there's leakage.

526
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,707
Thanks for the cool jacket.
Good timing.

527
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,749
I want to get into hiking.

528
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:32,957
Sorry we're late.

529
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,832
You didn't make them coffee?

530
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,499
It's okay.

531
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,457
I'll fix something.

532
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,041
- How'd it go?
- Great.

533
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,291
- How many saves?
- Lots.

534
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,457
Good job.

535
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,291
Happy belated birthday.

536
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,249
30 is pretty major.

537
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:55,166
Too bad we missed it.

538
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,291
The tournament lasted all day.

539
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,957
So we couldn't come.

540
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,999
No problem. That's okay.

541
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:05,332
She's the goalkeeper.
You should see her play.

542
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,124
No, she doesn't have to.

543
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,166
She's awesome.

544
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,124
I'll let you know next time.

545
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:14,916
Yeah, please do.

546
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,291
Cool.

547
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:22,166
Did you get the article I sent you?

548
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,832
Yeah, I was about to ask you.
I couldn't get the link to work.

549
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,457
My PC acts up.

550
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:34,041
Know anything about computers?

551
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,582
I can take a look.

552
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,291
But can't she just resend the email?

553
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,041
Wasn't there a...

554
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,916
Did she send it in an email?

555
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,457
An attachment to an email.

556
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,749
No, I pressed the button on the mouse.

557
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,041
Then I put the arrow on the square.

558
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:57,166
I tried twice, then it vanished.

559
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:00,707
It could be my fault.

560
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,749
Maybe I sent the wrong version.

561
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:06,999
We'll fix it.
You have to read that article.

562
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,291
It's really good.

563
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,791
Very...

564
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:13,832
Very well written, and...

565
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,457
Clever girl.

566
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,791
When are you coming to see us,
Per Harald?

567
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:26,457
We'd love it.
Come see where your daughter lives.

568
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,791
Sure, of course.

569
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,041
But it's hard to park in Central Oslo.

570
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,624
They've got that...

571
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,291
resident...

572
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,957
resident parking there.

573
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,332
Yeah.

574
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,749
It's made it much easier
to find a space.

575
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,666
You just have to pay.

576
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:50,666
And move the car every half hour?

577
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,416
Is that the reason
you don't come to see us?

578
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,541
Because it's hard to drive in town?

579
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:00,666
That's not it.

580
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,041
Then what is it?

581
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:05,124
Well, you know...

582
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:09,041
with my painkillers,
I'm not allowed to drive.

583
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,041
There's that too.

584
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:20,791
The good thing is,
he's open about it.

585
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,166
His pains. His prostate.

586
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:35,166
You have to make your own family.

587
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:52,416
Chapter 5
BAD TIMING

588
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,124
Excuse me?

589
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,374
Hi.

590
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,082
Do you have Green Yoga?

591
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,499
Let me check.

592
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,249
- Which book again?
- Green Yoga.

593
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,374
Published last year.

594
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:50,166
No, I'll have to order it.
It's not in stock.

595
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,082
How long will it take?

596
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,082
Two weeks.

597
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,332
Okay. No thanks.

598
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:00,207
They don't have it either.

599
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,457
Okay.

600
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,416
We can try at Ark.

601
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,166
Thank you.

602
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,041
I told her I forgot my sunglasses.

603
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,916
I just had to say

604
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,166
that I know what we said.

605
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,582
But I think about you a lot.

606
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,707
And...

607
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,666
I don't want to bug you
if you're happy.

608
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:46,832
Are you?

609
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,666
- I don't know what to say.
- Say nothing.

610
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:55,457
I'd like to see you again.
Just to talk.

611
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,416
I mean, I'm not going to...

612
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,166
But I'd like to see you again.
Just to...

613
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:09,291
I'm at Åpent Bakeri in Barcode
nearly every day.

614
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:12,791
I work there, I mean.
If you want to.

615
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,166
So...

616
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,582
- Eivind?
- Yes.

617
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,166
Your glasses.

618
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,457
Oh, right. Fuck.

619
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:43,457
Language opens the door
to the subconscious.

620
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,249
Freud was a great writer.

621
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,457
He could be self-critical.

622
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,707
He never hesitated
to revise his theories.

623
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:56,041
He viewed each individual patient
as a research subject.

624
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,624
Freud didn't distinguish between
therapy and research.

625
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,999
I find that very compelling.

626
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:06,707
Especially these days,

627
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:10,541
when scientific methodology
is applied

628
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,332
even in the humanities.

629
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,332
Enough about Freud.
How's the movie coming along?

630
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,749
Isn't it almost done?

631
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,666
Yeah, I've seen it, but...

632
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,207
- You have?
- Yes.

633
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,499
It's no longer mine at all.

634
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,999
Is it as bad as you feared?

635
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,916
The worst thing is how
they've housetrained Bobcat.

636
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:34,624
It's all very sanitised and safe.

637
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,041
I'll show you something.

638
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:41,666
A mock-up of the movie poster.

639
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,707
I have to admit...

640
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,541
I'm embarrassed my name's on it.

641
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,499
Shit.

642
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,416
No! Seriously?

643
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,749
You must be kidding. No way.

644
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:54,957
That's the poster. For real.

645
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,499
Let's see.

646
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:59,582
Looks like Chip and Dale.

647
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,499
Holy shit.

648
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,916
Should I laugh or cry?

649
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,332
Everything was butchered.
The story. All the details.

650
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,082
They removed the starfish.

651
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,082
Sorry, I'm lost.

652
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,499
What starfish?

653
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,541
It's, you know...

654
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,332
the butthole. The anus.

655
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,624
His butt is smooth in the movie.

656
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,791
This thing is gone.

657
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,124
That's bad in my book.

658
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,541
In underground comics you shit,

659
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,207
you puke, you fuck and all that stuff.

660
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:36,541
Bobcat is a wild cat
in a world of domestic cats.

661
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,041
He's a rebel against the bourgeoisie.

662
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,957
One of the most iconic buttholes ever.

663
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:21,874
Coffee?

664
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:22,916
Yeah.

665
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,249
I don't know what we should do.

666
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:31,957
I have to go.

667
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:48,957
Aksel,

668
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,791
we need to talk.

669
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,207
Yeah, of course.

670
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:56,332
What's wrong?

671
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:59,666
Julie said she'd been thinking.

672
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:03,416
It wasn't his fault.
Nothing he could have changed.

673
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,874
It's not anything you've done.

674
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,082
It's not your fault. But I feel...

675
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,874
It was about
all their old arguments.

676
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:13,957
Things they both knew.

677
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,416
It was bad timing.

678
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,332
They'd met in different phases of life.

679
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,666
They wanted different things.

680
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:23,082
We want different things.

681
00:59:29,917 --> 00:59:31,791
Are you leaving me?

682
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,332
Yeah.

683
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,291
I want it to be over.

684
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:08,582
Are you sure you're yourself right now?

685
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:10,457
What do you mean?

686
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,041
Do you realise...

687
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:16,666
Do you realise what you're doing?

688
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,541
What you're destroying?

689
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,666
Yes, of course.

690
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,499
That's why it's so hard.

691
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,249
Where will you live?

692
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,207
I don't know.

693
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:36,707
You don't know?

694
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:38,457
No. With Mom.

695
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,582
Move home to Mom?

696
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,666
Yeah. Until I find a place.

697
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,041
Okay.

698
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,749
No, come on...

699
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,791
It's over.

700
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,291
I've had it. What else can I say?

701
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:11,374
Is something else bothering you
and you're venting on me?

702
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:12,332
No.

703
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,582
I've thought about it for a long time.

704
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,291
It feels right.

705
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,499
Have you met someone?

706
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,957
No.

707
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:34,416
I'm so sick of all this, Julie.
Dammit.

708
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:35,999
Sick to death of it.

709
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,999
But okay.

710
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,624
Just leave. If that's what you want.

711
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:49,249
I'll take a walk while you pack.

712
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:19,957
Julie said he deserved
a more grounded woman.

713
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:22,416
Ready for children.

714
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:23,999
Who was dependable,

715
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:27,166
didn't flake out every six months.

716
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:32,249
But I like you flaky.

717
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,457
Aksel said he liked her flaky.

718
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:37,874
That he needed someone like that.

719
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:40,791
Who could draw him out
of his drawing board.

720
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,291
And as for having kids...

721
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:49,874
He said
he'd rather be childless with her

722
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,916
than have kids with anyone else.

723
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:54,749
You know that's not the only problem.

724
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,082
So what is the problem?

725
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:03,041
It's a combination of things,
not just that.

726
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:07,207
I can see you're in a crisis right now.

727
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,374
I can understand that.

728
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:12,666
But if you love me,

729
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,291
we'll sort it all out.

730
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,999
Yes, I do love you.

731
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,374
And I don't love you.

732
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,624
Julie felt that this sentence,

733
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,332
the way she said it,

734
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,832
her emphasis on certain words,

735
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:29,124
summed up the impossibility of it all.

736
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,332
I feel like a spectator in my own life.

737
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:37,291
Like I'm playing a supporting role
in my own life.

738
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,457
I get that you feel stuck.

739
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,374
You need a change.

740
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,707
But is this the solution?

741
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,916
This is exactly my point.

742
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,582
I'm trying to tell you how I feel,

743
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:00,041
and you're defining my feelings.

744
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,624
I see what you're doing.

745
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:06,457
What am I doing?
Tell me what I'm doing.

746
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,707
Shut up, and I'll tell you.

747
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:13,499
You're acting out the confrontation
you never dared have with your father.

748
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:17,832
- You're taking it out on me.
- Is that so?

749
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:20,707
What do you know about it?

750
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:24,041
This is the crux of our relationship.

751
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,457
Everything we feel,
we have to put into words.

752
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:30,707
Sometimes, I just want to feel things.

753
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:34,374
You insist on being so damn strong
all the time.

754
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:35,541
For you,

755
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,124
being strong

756
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,249
is about formulating things.

757
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,541
If you analyse things

758
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,082
at every psychological level,

759
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:46,791
you think you're strong.

760
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,832
Because I'm less analytical,
you think I'm weaker.

761
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,166
She said she was terrified
of being alone.

762
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,041
Terrified of living without him.

763
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,082
That when she left,

764
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,707
she'd be like Bambi on the ice.

765
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:09,332
And that was precisely why
she had to do it.

766
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:15,041
Aksel mumbled soothing words
she didn't hear.

767
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:17,082
She was thinking about how,

768
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:20,916
at the age of 30,
she'd just compared herself to Bambi.

769
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:25,374
No.

770
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,832
I'm pathetic.

771
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:30,291
No, you're not.

772
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:45,916
Aksel...

773
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:28,832
Hey...

774
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,874
I didn't mean what I said.

775
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:34,082
It's okay.

776
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:35,916
I said plenty of things too.

777
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:41,749
Stay a little longer.

778
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:48,124
You'll regret it.

779
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:52,207
I'm sure I will.

780
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:55,041
The saddest thing,

781
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:59,332
is one day, you'll want kids.

782
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,582
In any case,
you'll have other relationships.

783
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:07,374
And you'll realise
that what we had was unique.

784
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:08,707
I know.

785
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:12,124
You don't. But I do.
I've had many relationships.

786
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,832
I know how hard it is.

787
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:18,457
Nobody communicates like we do.
Laughs like we do.

788
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:32,707
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get back together someday.

789
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,207
Then and there

790
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:36,916
she meant it.

791
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:39,082
I mean it.

792
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:03,832
Chapter 6
FINNMARK HIGHLANDS

793
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,791
- Are you cold.
- Yeah.

794
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:25,166
- It looked easier on YouTube.
- I told you we should practice.

795
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,291
Wait...

796
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:30,832
This one first.

797
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:33,291
- Are you sure?
- Yes, this goes on top.

798
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,207
Right, but is it first?

799
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,499
Isn't the other one first?

800
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,832
- No, that's the top.
- Okay.

801
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:25,416
Eivind turned it into a funny story
he told everyone.

802
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,207
But it touched
something deeper in her.

803
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,416
Awoke something in her.

804
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,041
She googled her family name.

805
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:37,124
Her grandfather came
from the Far North.

806
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:42,832
The DNA sample
she sent to America confirmed it.

807
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:51,082
Eivind didn't see how
her newfound identity

808
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:53,291
as 3.1% Sami

809
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:57,666
connected to mind-expanding substances
and unrelated exotic rituals,

810
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,749
but tried to be supportive.

811
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:05,124
As she became increasingly militant,

812
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:08,666
she saw how climate change
was hurting indigenous people.

813
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:16,416
Inuit starving as seals vanish.

814
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,749
Melting ice ruining reindeer pastures.

815
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:23,207
Aborigines dying of skin cancer
from the hole in the ozone.

816
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:28,749
Eivind could forget
about flying to New York.

817
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,624
Breathe in. All the way up.

818
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,291
She made them live

819
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:35,582
more sustainably.

820
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,416
He could always do better.

821
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,749
Study the ingredients more closely.

822
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:45,166
Consider the environmental impact
of his purchases.

823
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,041
Plastic is killing the oceans.

824
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:50,416
Norwegian cod
was ferried to China and back.

825
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:53,041
Cobalt mining was destroying the Congo.

826
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,457
Batteries had blood on their hands.

827
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,707
The sum of Western guilt
sat beside him on the couch.

828
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,791
Went to bed with him at night.

829
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:09,041
Everything was weighed against
the greater cause.

830
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,666
He felt he was betraying Sunniva.
Betraying the Sami people.

831
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:38,457
Felt like the world's worst person,
but couldn't resist.

832
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,999
I forgot my sunglasses inside.

833
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:44,541
Right.

834
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,291
Be right back.

835
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,249
Chapter 7
A NEW CHAPTER

836
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,249
Eivind didn't want kids either.

837
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:50,124
Climate researchers foresaw
hard times for future generations.

838
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:53,957
Overpopulation was the reason
everything was falling apart.

839
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,499
Julie liked how this pessimism
added depth

840
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,457
to his cheerful nature.

841
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,707
But she could tell
he had other reasons too.

842
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,999
Eivind's father, like Julie's,

843
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:24,374
tended to forget birthdays.

844
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:25,957
Eivind would often say,

845
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,916
"According to my father's calendar..."

846
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:29,749
I'm 12 years old.

847
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:33,291
They're all hard. No ripe ones.

848
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:34,749
People die of thirst in Chile

849
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:38,332
because avocados need so much water.

850
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,666
Still following Sunniva on Instagram?

851
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:06,207
Yeah, she posts interesting links
about the environment.

852
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,291
We don't message or anything.

853
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,249
She's got over 30,000 followers.

854
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,416
For showing off her ass?

855
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:21,082
She's not showing off her ass,
she's doing yoga.

856
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,707
It's yoga.

857
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:27,166
Okay, she shows it off a bit.

858
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,791
I don't mind you following her.

859
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:32,291
It's not a problem, but...

860
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,374
I don't want to be

861
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:39,916
the sensible choice
while she's the sexy one.

862
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,499
There's nothing sensible about you.

863
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,582
- I mean...
- Yeah.

864
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:58,416
- The angle of her pelvis...
- It's yoga.

865
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,624
That's not yoga.

866
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:01,666
It is yoga.

867
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,499
You liked it!

868
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,291
Oh my god!

869
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:09,707
- That's not cool!
- I had to like it!

870
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,832
That's right.

871
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:24,457
So, that's why...

872
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:28,124
Chapter 8
JULIE'S NARCISSISTIC CIRCUS

873
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:29,499
want people to watch me dance.

874
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,124
It's annoying as hell.

875
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:36,999
You can make a fool of yourself
on the dance floor and still be cool.

876
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:41,874
So true! I've noticed that.
When we dance,

877
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,582
you take up all the space.

878
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,166
Yeah, but it's also like,

879
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,291
"Everyone look at me!"

880
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:02,541
Yeah, that's my point.
You're always so mysterious.

881
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,041
You still have your stash?

882
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:12,999
What's that?

883
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:18,291
Where'd you find it?

884
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,041
What is it?

885
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:22,832
Magic mushrooms.

886
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:32,124
Have you tried it?

887
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,291
Yeah.

888
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:41,749
Right.

889
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:44,791
Why'd you do that?

890
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,207
Yuck.

891
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:48,624
Tastes like dirt.

892
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:50,916
Anyone?

893
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:49,499
I don't feel anything.
They're probably too old.

894
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:51,999
I gotta go.

895
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,332
Are you sure? Could be risky.

896
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,041
Come on, man.

897
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,791
We've done this before.

898
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,082
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Call me.

899
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:10,249
Adil?

900
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,582
Can you speak?

901
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,874
It's kicking in for him.

902
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:37,874
Julie?

903
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,707
Is it starting to kick in?

904
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,916
You need water.

905
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:43,457
It's important.

906
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,207
You have to drink lots of water.

907
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:49,541
Here.

908
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:50,999
Drink it all.

909
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,999
You'll be okay.

910
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:55,124
You know I'm here for you.

911
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,374
Julie?

912
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,249
Drink the water.

913
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,041
It's okay! I'm here!

914
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:28,582
Julie, are you okay?

915
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,999
I thought I'd make it.

916
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:37,666
Are you okay?

917
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,416
Thought we could use some coffee.

918
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,957
We won't be doing that again.

919
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,999
You should take a shower.

920
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,582
Do I smell bad?

921
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:21,707
- Is that...
- Oh my god.

922
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:24,791
Oh my god.
I need to take a shower.

923
01:22:25,042 --> 01:22:27,416
Don't worry, it's not urgent.

924
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,374
Shall I make breakfast?

925
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,124
I feel I can be myself with you.

926
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,166
Completely.

927
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,082
You weren't yourself before?

928
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:53,374
I was, but I felt like

929
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,499
I had to be

930
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,082
a bit...

931
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,749
like I was when we first met.

932
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,249
Thanks for putting up with me.

933
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:17,957
I love you.

934
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:58,124
Chapter 9
BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

935
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:10,166
Bobcat Wrecks Xmas

936
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:35,624
Have you read your old
Bobcat comics since you grew up?

937
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:38,874
Because in our day and age,

938
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:41,582
they seem so inappropriate and murky

939
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:43,999
that we feel almost sick

940
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,166
reading them.

941
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:48,249
It's unpleasant to realize
you created a character

942
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:51,541
who gained popularity
at the expense of women.

943
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:52,791
Okay, I get it.

944
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:55,624
You're saying art should be pleasant?

945
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,666
Do you think it's art?

946
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:03,249
I brought along
some of your early comics.

947
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,582
Bobcat is one thing,
but then there's Dick Wolf Dick,

948
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:08,374
Pedo the Parrot...

949
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:13,291
Right, I don't really think
this is the right medium to

950
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:15,541
explain comic book humour.

951
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:19,791
Have you ever considered that
some of your readers

952
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,624
may have been victims
of incest or rape?

953
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:27,957
Do we stop creating
because some people might feel bad?

954
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:33,249
Artists get killed for drawing things
others find offensive. They're shot.

955
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,291
Are you comparing Mohammed caricatures

956
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,874
with drawings of women with big tits?

957
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,582
Or with incest?

958
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:41,957
What's your point?

959
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,957
Well, yes and no.

960
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,666
It's a bit of a cop-out

961
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:49,124
to claim freedom of speech
when people criticise you.

962
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:51,707
We're discussing your work right now,

963
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:54,707
so nobody's censoring you.

964
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,416
As a woman, I'm upset.

965
01:25:57,625 --> 01:26:01,082
I'm offended,
though we're not supposed to say that.

966
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:05,291
You have a chaise.
You don't have to feel offered.

967
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:06,832
It's not a choice.

968
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,957
This is very generational.

969
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:13,582
One author cannot be held
solely responsible.

970
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:17,957
I think art has to be messy and free.

971
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:20,666
It has to be a bit dangerous
to be fun.

972
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:24,499
I want art to be a form of therapy

973
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,541
where I can express and work through

974
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,582
all my unacceptable thoughts,

975
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,666
all my darkest impulses.

976
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:36,666
But you're using your male privilege

977
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:39,082
to mock people weaker than you.

978
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,666
It's hardly art or even humour.

979
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:44,166
Sorry,
it's not smart enough to be satire.

980
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:45,582
But this isn't about me.

981
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:48,791
Like, when I create something,

982
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:51,041
it's not just-me talking.

983
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,957
- I know that much.
- Do you?

984
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,624
Let's say I draw this interview
as a cartoon.

985
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:01,874
The comic version of me
might call you a whore.

986
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,457
It doesn't mean I think that.

987
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,332
It could be

988
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:10,249
a parody of a certain type
of insecure male...

989
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:12,624
You used the word "whore"?

990
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,291
Yes, I said "whore".

991
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,707
You're not interested in what I mean.

992
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:20,541
Can't you see
that's crass sexualisation?

993
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,624
I think we're on a slippery slope here.

994
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:27,916
All you post-feminists
are so fucking self righteous!

995
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:32,332
Thank you, Marthe Refstad
and Aksel Willmann.

996
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:35,207
The term is sex worker now,
by the way.

997
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:45,124
Chapter 10
FIRST PERSON SINGULAR

998
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:51,416
I'm happy to help!

999
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,166
Long time no see!

1000
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,707
- Yeah.
- How are you?

1001
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,624
Okay. And you?

1002
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:21,332
I'm good.

1003
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,457
Do you ever talk to Aksel?

1004
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:26,874
Is he okay?

1005
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:28,249
Yeah, well...

1006
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:31,541
I heard the radio interview.

1007
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,624
Yeah.

1008
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:34,749
He went a bit far.

1009
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:42,249
He's not doing that well.

1010
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,457
Did you know he's sick?

1011
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:48,124
Aksel?

1012
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:49,541
Haven't you heard?

1013
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:51,041
He has cancer.

1014
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,916
Sorry, I thought you knew.

1015
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,541
It spread quickly.

1016
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,207
They discovered it too late.

1017
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:01,124
Cancer?

1018
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,749
Pancreatic.

1019
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,624
But...

1020
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,082
How is he coping?

1021
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,082
Pretty well, under the circumstances.

1022
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:21,666
But it's hard.

1023
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:23,749
The prognosis

1024
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,832
is not good.

1025
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:28,249
It's incurable.

1026
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,957
Thanks for letting me know.

1027
01:29:43,167 --> 01:29:45,291
I thought you knew.

1028
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,166
No, I hadn't heard anything.

1029
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:50,749
It's just...

1030
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,374
I didn't know.

1031
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,082
When did you write this?

1032
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,166
Have you read it?

1033
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:45,041
I was moving it to paper recycling.

1034
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:47,707
It's very good.

1035
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:50,499
You think?

1036
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,332
Yeah, it sucked me right in.

1037
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,957
It's really, really great.

1038
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,541
I mean...

1039
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,291
It's like...

1040
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:02,957
What?

1041
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,499
Well...

1042
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,957
I have to say,

1043
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,291
it's really nice to read about you.

1044
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,582
But it's not about me.

1045
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:20,166
But the Christmas scene
is your family, right?

1046
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:24,207
Yeah, but it's fiction.
You didn't get that?

1047
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:25,624
I made it up.

1048
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,999
Okay, it's fiction.
In any case...

1049
01:31:31,042 --> 01:31:33,707
- It's good.
- Because it's me?

1050
01:31:33,917 --> 01:31:36,707
No, because it's nice.

1051
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:37,957
"Nice"?

1052
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,666
Yeah, nice. Good.
Well written.

1053
01:31:43,167 --> 01:31:46,791
The way you write
is really great.

1054
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:49,832
Like here:

1055
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:54,749
"Too many memories overlapping,
blending into a blur."

1056
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:59,332
That resonates with me.
It's well written. Truly good.

1057
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:01,666
It's not well written.

1058
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:05,166
What's wrong?

1059
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:08,749
Suddenly you're into literature?

1060
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,582
What was the last book you read?

1061
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,916
- Are you okay? What's up?
- Why?

1062
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:21,457
You criticise
everything I do these days.

1063
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:25,457
Sorry, but going through my trash
is pretty invasive.

1064
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,291
- Can't you see that?
- Relax.

1065
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:30,874
- "Relax?"
- Calm down.

1066
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,082
Relaxing is your specialty!

1067
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:36,166
You don't mind
serving coffee till you're 50.

1068
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:37,499
But I want more!

1069
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:50,082
That's hurtful.
I don't know what to say.

1070
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:20,166
Chapter 11
POSITIVE

1071
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,499
Hello?

1072
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:01,499
Hey...

1073
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:08,166
Have you eaten?

1074
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:11,041
Yeah, but I can make pasta if you like.

1075
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,666
No, I don't need any if you've eaten.

1076
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:58,249
Oops, sorry.

1077
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,291
It started with a backache.

1078
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:19,041
I've had backaches before.
I didn't worry.

1079
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:23,499
Then my skin turned almost golden.

1080
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:26,999
I thought I looked good.

1081
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:30,457
It turned out to be jaundice.

1082
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:37,541
Mom said I was born jaundiced.
They put me in a light box.

1083
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:39,832
Is it painful?

1084
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,082
No, not really.

1085
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,707
It's okay.

1086
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:48,499
They block selected
neural pathways with Botox.

1087
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:50,624
That's good.

1088
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:54,749
Yeah, it keeps me from taking
too many painkillers.

1089
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,249
How's your family doing?

1090
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:04,207
Fine, I guess.

1091
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,541
Mom still follows your every move.

1092
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:10,041
And your dad?

1093
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:14,791
I've basically cut him off.

1094
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,082
Good.

1095
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,457
He can chase me if he likes.

1096
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,707
Does he?

1097
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:22,749
No, not really.

1098
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:24,832
Two coffees.

1099
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:28,291
They thought it was hilarious.

1100
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,791
In some circumstances,

1101
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:33,740
morbid humour can be funny.

1102
01:37:34,042 --> 01:37:36,276
Even anal sex at a bar mitzvah?

1103
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,666
It makes me laugh.
But I'm an old guy now.

1104
01:37:39,917 --> 01:37:40,916
No.

1105
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:42,624
Well, you know...

1106
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,874
I kind of expected this.

1107
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:48,249
I'd given up long before I got sick.

1108
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:54,207
Really. I just watch
my favourite old movies over and over.

1109
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:58,541
Lynch, The Godfather Part II...

1110
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,416
How many times can you watch

1111
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,499
Dog Day Afternoon?

1112
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:03,832
Many times!

1113
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,124
You should.

1114
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:09,874
Absolutely.

1115
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,332
Sometimes I listen to music

1116
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:17,541
I haven't heard before.

1117
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:19,582
But...

1118
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:22,291
It's old as well.

1119
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:27,666
Music I didn't know about,
but from when I grew up.

1120
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:31,374
It felt as though I'd already given up.

1121
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:37,957
I grew up in an age
without Internet and mobile phones.

1122
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,582
No, but honestly...

1123
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:46,291
I sound like an old fart.
But I think about it a lot.

1124
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:50,499
The world that I knew...

1125
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,374
has disappeared.

1126
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:56,791
For me it was all about going to stores.

1127
01:38:57,417 --> 01:39:00,666
Record stores.

1128
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,832
I'd take the tram
to Voices in Grünerløkka.

1129
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,791
Leaf through used comics
at Pretty Price.

1130
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:13,041
I can close my eyes and see
the aisles at Video Nova in Majorstua.

1131
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:17,207
I grew up in a time

1132
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:20,749
when culture was passed along
through objects.

1133
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:25,416
They were interesting because

1134
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:29,499
we could live among them.

1135
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:32,666
We could pick them up.
Hold them in our hands.

1136
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:34,541
Compare them.

1137
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,291
A bit like books?

1138
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:39,166
Yeah, a bit like books.

1139
01:39:42,417 --> 01:39:46,749
That's all I have.
I spent my life doing that.

1140
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:53,541
Collecting all that stuff,
comics, books...

1141
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:56,499
And...

1142
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:02,582
I just continued,
even when it stopped giving me

1143
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:05,666
the powerful emotions

1144
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,874
I felt in my early 20s.

1145
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,332
I continued anyway.

1146
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:14,832
And...

1147
01:40:16,417 --> 01:40:17,707
now it's all I have left.

1148
01:40:17,917 --> 01:40:22,499
Knowledge and memories
of stupid, futile things

1149
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,582
nobody cares about.

1150
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:27,291
Don't say that.

1151
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,666
You've got the comics you created.

1152
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,666
I wish I'd had what you had.

1153
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:35,832
To be able to draw

1154
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:39,999
without doubting that you're doing
what you're supposed to do.

1155
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:44,707
I really wish I had that.

1156
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:46,291
Yeah, but...

1157
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:48,499
I've got cancer. I'm dying.

1158
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:51,207
Of course I'm being retrospective.

1159
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:55,457
You said you've done that for ages.

1160
01:40:55,667 --> 01:40:57,582
Not for that long.

1161
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:03,457
In recent years. I reached
a point in life when suddenly...

1162
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:05,249
It just happened.

1163
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:08,457
When...

1164
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:13,666
I began to worship what had been.

1165
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:20,541
And now I have nothing else.
I have no future.

1166
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:24,916
I can only look back.

1167
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:29,749
And...

1168
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,499
It's not even nostalgia.
It's...

1169
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,666
Fear of death.

1170
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,957
It's because I'm scared.

1171
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:46,582
It has nothing to do with art.

1172
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,249
I'm just trying to process...

1173
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:03,874
I have surgery tomorrow at 9.

1174
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:08,707
I felt I could tell you anything.

1175
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,416
You wouldn't judge me.

1176
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,791
You're the least
judgemental person I know.

1177
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,916
I don't have anyone I can talk to...

1178
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:23,791
the way we used to talk.

1179
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:39,791
Can you tell me
what you used to tell me?

1180
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:43,791
I hated hearing it at the time,
but can you tell me...

1181
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:46,624
I'll be a good mother?

1182
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:50,916
Are you pregnant?

1183
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,291
Congratulations?

1184
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:06,582
How do you feel?
Good or bad?

1185
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,041
I don't know.

1186
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:10,999
I'm not sure.

1187
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:14,957
It was an accident.

1188
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:18,416
I must've been careless.
I mean, clearly I was.

1189
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,082
Were you really sure?

1190
01:43:38,042 --> 01:43:39,791
Sure you wanted kids?

1191
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,166
I was scared too.
I had doubts, of course.

1192
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,624
But I didn't want to show them,
to keep you from...

1193
01:43:57,208 --> 01:44:00,457
I never doubted
you'd make a good mother.

1194
01:44:01,208 --> 01:44:04,666
I saw that you doubted it.

1195
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:09,374
If I regret one thing,
it's that I never managed

1196
01:44:11,792 --> 01:44:16,207
to make you see how wonderful you are.

1197
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,124
What are you thinking?

1198
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,957
This is hard to hear.

1199
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:52,957
But... will you keep it?

1200
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:56,416
I don't know.

1201
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:08,332
I wasted so much time

1202
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:11,207
worrying about what could go wrong.

1203
01:45:11,417 --> 01:45:15,374
But what did go wrong,
was never the things I worried about.

1204
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:21,624
If he's a kind man, then go for it.

1205
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:26,624
With a kind father,
and you as the mother,

1206
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:28,999
everything will be fine.

1207
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:45,041
Your voice has stayed in my head.

1208
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:48,166
We still have great conversations.

1209
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:49,291
No way?

1210
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:52,541
About what?

1211
01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:56,541
Mostly about comics.

1212
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:00,582
Eclectic tastes.

1213
01:46:10,083 --> 01:46:11,457
Same here.

1214
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,124
I have imaginary conversations with you.

1215
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:33,457
I'm sure I remember things about you
that you've forgotten.

1216
01:46:35,542 --> 01:46:36,832
And the other way round.

1217
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:39,666
Yeah, maybe.

1218
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,332
When I'm gone,

1219
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:49,666
all that stuff about you
will go with me.

1220
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,874
May I ask you a question?

1221
01:47:04,792 --> 01:47:08,957
Had you already met him
when you broke up with me?

1222
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:16,082
Yeah.

1223
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:21,124
Why didn't you tell me?

1224
01:47:29,167 --> 01:47:30,457
I don't know.

1225
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:33,166
I didn't dare.

1226
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:42,416
And now you're breaking up with him?

1227
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:44,791
No, why do you say that?

1228
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:50,082
Maybe because you don't seem happy
about the baby.

1229
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:56,666
And that's what you do
when things get tough.

1230
01:48:04,708 --> 01:48:06,374
I'm glad I'm pregnant.

1231
01:48:14,792 --> 01:48:15,957
I'm sorry.

1232
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,291
It's alright.

1233
01:48:48,292 --> 01:48:50,666
You were the most important
relationship in my life.

1234
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,166
You don't have to say anything.

1235
01:48:56,833 --> 01:48:59,916
I know it's not the same for you.

1236
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:04,416
That's normal.
You have many years left to live.

1237
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:08,624
But I know, I feel it.

1238
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,207
And I want you to know.

1239
01:49:17,792 --> 01:49:20,041
You were the love of my life.

1240
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:37,207
You're a damn good person.

1241
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,916
I should've told you before.

1242
01:50:18,667 --> 01:50:19,999
But I couldn't.

1243
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:23,707
I'm pregnant.

1244
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:32,582
How long have you known?

1245
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:36,291
I know we don't want kids.

1246
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:37,957
No...

1247
01:50:38,167 --> 01:50:40,874
I don't know if I do.

1248
01:50:43,167 --> 01:50:46,666
I feel like
never see anything through.

1249
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:50,374
I go from one thing to another.

1250
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,374
I need time

1251
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:03,957
to think about all this.

1252
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,791
About us.

1253
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:28,207
It's okay.

1254
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:43,832
Chapter 12
EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END

1255
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,499
That's where I lived.

1256
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,749
We moved there when I was 8.

1257
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,207
Shall we knock?

1258
01:52:05,792 --> 01:52:07,332
No. I don't think so.

1259
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:36,499
What do you remember from here?

1260
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:47,666
I remember these colours.

1261
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:56,374
They were always my reference

1262
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:58,457
when I drew my comics.

1263
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:00,666
These colours.

1264
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,832
And I remember

1265
01:53:09,792 --> 01:53:12,999
the local drunk,
who was super nice.

1266
01:53:58,167 --> 01:54:01,041
I'm so tired of pretending
everything is okay.

1267
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:15,874
It sucks being in so much pain.
It sucks.

1268
01:54:16,667 --> 01:54:18,374
Everything sucks.

1269
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:21,666
And...

1270
01:54:23,958 --> 01:54:26,791
I don't want to be a memory for you.

1271
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:30,666
I don't want to be a voice in your head.

1272
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:35,166
I don't want to live on through my art.

1273
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,166
I want to live in my flat.

1274
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:47,416
I want to live...

1275
01:54:51,792 --> 01:54:53,999
I want to live in my flat with you.

1276
01:54:54,958 --> 01:54:56,541
I want to be happy together.

1277
01:55:42,375 --> 01:55:43,374
Bye.

1278
01:55:43,917 --> 01:55:45,041
Bye.

1279
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:46,416
Hi, Julie.

1280
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,874
Aksel's condition has suddenly worsened.

1281
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:53,832
He's too ill for his planned treatment.

1282
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:57,207
He may not make it through the night.

1283
01:55:57,875 --> 01:56:01,582
His family is with him,
but I thought you should know.

1284
01:58:48,958 --> 01:58:52,541
EPILOGUE

1285
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:54,541
There's nothing more to say.

1286
01:59:16,042 --> 01:59:16,791
Cut!

1287
01:59:17,292 --> 01:59:18,082
One more.

1288
01:59:18,292 --> 01:59:21,291
One more quick take.
Slight adjustment.

1289
01:59:21,958 --> 01:59:23,124
Be sadder.

1290
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:24,249
Okay.

1291
01:59:24,458 --> 01:59:26,207
But he gets up so quickly.

1292
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:27,749
Hey!

1293
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:31,082
Ok, camera ready.

1294
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:33,791
Action!

1295
01:59:34,042 --> 01:59:34,999
There's nothing more to say.

1296
01:59:54,333 --> 01:59:55,957
Cut! Great.

1297
01:59:56,583 --> 01:59:57,499
Let's move on.

1298
01:59:58,583 --> 01:59:59,791
Right, stills.

1299
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,291
Sorry, I need some shots of you.

1300
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:09,624
- Sure. Here?
- Yeah.

1301
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:17,124
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1302
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,707
But I think I was pretty terrible.

1303
02:00:24,875 --> 02:00:27,624
Then use that.
Hold on to that feeling.

1304
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:30,666
Act like you're looking at him.
