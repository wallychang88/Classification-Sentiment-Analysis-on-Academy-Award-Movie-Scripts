1
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,260
There was no one like Hal.

2
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,054
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

3
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,765
"Blue Moon" was playing.

4
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,475
- You know "Blue Moon?"
- Sure.

5
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,894
I still remember that.

6
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,149
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

7
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:50,195
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

8
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,948
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

9
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,993
Is that a joke?

10
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:00,538
The sex was always great.
Well, he was nine years older than me.

11
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,749
He'd already made and lost a fortune.

12
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,002
But then he made it back, and more.
I mean, much more.

13
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,504
God, he was dynamic.

14
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,423
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking...

15
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,842
...not that I care to get too graphic.

16
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,262
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

17
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,097
Cocktails, they call them.

18
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,892
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,352
I never trusted doctors.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,188
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

21
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,232
I have never been to San Francisco.

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,443
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

23
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,488
I'll be staying with my sister, Ginger.
She's divorced.

24
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:37,909
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. We're both adopted.

25
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,870
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

26
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,039
That's mine. The Vuitton.

27
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:46,125
My plan is to start a new life out here.

28
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,962
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

29
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,383
Go West. Was it Horace Greeley
who said that? "Go West."

30
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,886
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

31
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,681
Oh, I'll call you, maybe for lunch.

32
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,225
I don't have your number.

33
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:07,272
- Who's that woman you were talking to?
- I was sitting next to her on the plane.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,898
She was talking to herself.

35
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,776
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

36
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,988
But she couldn't stop babbling
about her life.

37
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,674
Where--? Where am I exactly?

38
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,094
You said 305 South Van Ness.

39
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,312
- Can you wait, help me with my bags?
- Sure.

40
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,069
I don't know where she is.

41
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,488
She expected me.

42
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,658
The plane was on time.

43
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,625
- Yes, I'm--
- You all right?

44
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,795
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath...

45
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:17,884
...and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

46
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,761
Okay.

47
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,015
- Could I have some privacy?
- Sure, sure.

48
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,975
Hello, Ginger?

49
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,645
Yes, I'm here.
I'm right in front of the place.

50
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,980
It is 305?

51
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,860
Well, how long?

52
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:39,155
What? Where is it?

53
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,867
No, no, I see it. Okay. Oh, okay.

54
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,537
Just-- Would you please hurry?
My sister left the keys in the bar.

55
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:48,706
- Can you wait?
- Sure!

56
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,981
Is that it?

57
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,277
Thank you.

58
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,197
Oh, thank you.

59
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:24,409
Have a great day, all right? Bye-bye.

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,416
- So, what do you think?
- I love it.

61
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,544
The fireplaces work.
I don't like when they're for show.

62
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,547
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

63
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,591
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view...

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,386
- You wanted Fifth Avenue.
- Central Park. Superb.

65
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,304
Oh, this space is perfect.

66
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,223
We hardly have to do a thing.

67
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,767
- You shouldn't spoil me so.
- Well, why not?

68
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,562
Who else am I gonna spoil?
Did I tell you my news?

69
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,897
- What?
- Danny is gonna be living with us.

70
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,150
Oh, honey. Oh, that's great news.

71
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,527
I worked it outwith his mom,
her lawyers.

72
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:03,948
Oh, he'll be so much happier
when he's with us full-time.

73
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,119
Happy birthday, Danny.

74
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:12,540
Kids at school say we're really rich
and that you give money to charity.

75
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,585
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life...

76
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,504
...to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

77
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,424
Not everyone is as lucky as we are.

78
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,759
- Domingo?
- Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,720
- Another bottle of the Margaux.
- Sure.

80
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,180
Excuse me.

81
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,766
- It would look perfect.
- Wouldn't wash me out?

82
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,684
No, not at all. Not the way he--

83
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,562
Oh, isn't he sweet?

84
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,149
This song was playing
when Hal and I first met.

85
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,445
- I fell in love with the name Jasmine.
- Oh, so romantic.

86
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,281
Ichangedit

87
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,826
Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.

88
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,165
This song was playing
when we first met.

89
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:58,419
You know it? Yeah, we met
at a party at Martha's Vineyard.

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,838
"Blue Moon."

91
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,800
Come on, boys.

92
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,096
Okay, let's go, Augie.
I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.

93
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,306
We helped Dad
move the furniture today.

94
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,184
Oh, really? That's your idea
of taking the boys?

95
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,312
Letting them help you
lug somebody's furniture upstairs?

96
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,481
- They loved it. Great exercise.
- Yeah?

97
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,442
- They-- We ate franks and beans.
- Yeah.

98
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,487
- Relax.
- Okay. Let's go, Johnny, come on.

99
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,490
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- What's the rush?

100
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,909
What's the rush, Ginger?
You got a date?

101
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,577
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:35,081
- It happens to be Jeanette, so...
- Jeanefie?

103
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,166
Jasmine? What is she doing in town?

104
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,086
She's living with me
till she gets back on her feet.

105
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,004
She's had a bad time. Yeah.

106
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,966
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

107
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,176
Now that she's broke, she's moving in.

108
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,387
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

109
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,140
And it's none of your damn business.
She's family.

110
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,850
- She stole our money.
- Okay.

111
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,187
Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

112
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:02,483
For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

113
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,819
What the hell did she know
aboutfinance?

114
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,823
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years...

115
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,868
...up to his ass in phony real estate
and bank fraud.

116
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,703
She knew nothing about it?

117
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,498
Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

118
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,710
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in...

119
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,046
...she just looked the other way.
- I don't think so, Augie.

120
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:29,552
You said it. You said to me,
"She's a phony and had to know."

121
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,972
Jasmine, your country house
is so beautiful.

122
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,808
- See?
- I'm sorry, but we need an answer on this.

123
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,686
I told you, you change the name
of the corporation.

124
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,981
- Operate under Global Innovations.
- I don't know if we can.

125
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,524
I think we can, actually.

126
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,360
- Pay out of the accounts in Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam.

127
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:50,364
Whenever I hear them, they're one step
ahead of the Justice Department.

128
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,408
Just hope your house is not bugged.

129
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,453
Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

130
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,663
I have no head for that sort of thing.

131
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:01,250
- We transfer to the old corporation?
- We could. Perfectly legal.

132
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,713
- It would be a mistake under that name.
- Definitely get in trouble for that.

133
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,132
Just don't file a joint tax return.

134
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:12,011
Don't say that. I sign anything.
I'm very trusting.

135
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,554
Famous last words.

136
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:16,140
It's called looking the other way.

137
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,229
Jasmine. Oh, my God.

138
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,397
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

139
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,025
Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.

140
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,444
- Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.
- It's okay.

141
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,947
- No, it's fine.
- Augie's day with the boys.

142
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,907
Well, no wonder you're late.

143
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,825
- Hello. Matthew, is it?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,620
Boys, say hello.
I told you about her, remember?

145
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,289
- Hi, I'm Jasmine.
- Shake hands. Okay, go play.

146
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,916
- They're big.
- I know.

147
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,252
- I'm getting it first.
- Quiet, you two.

148
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,088
- Well, they're loud.
- Stop running around.

149
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,049
Christ, this kid's got--
What the hell is it? ADD?

150
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:54,720
- Yeah. Your place is homey.
- Are you kidding me?

151
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,474
No, I mean, it's got a very--
Well, it's casual charm.

152
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:01,352
God, knock it oh', Jasmine.

153
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,065
I need to stay here for a while. No, I do.

154
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,693
- I'm out of cash.
- Okay.

155
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,612
Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe...

156
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,824
...I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

157
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,119
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

158
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,996
And the lawyers.

159
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,831
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

160
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,625
I really get some bad thoughts
when I'm alone.

161
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,337
Well, you know, all I can say is,
you look great.

162
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,799
- Now who's lying?
- You do.

163
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,844
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious...

164
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,554
...about moving here.
- Yeah?

165
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,474
- I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
- Oh, well...

166
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,562
- Another drink? We're celebrating.
- Of course, yeah.

167
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,023
Oh, the flight was bumpy.

168
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

169
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,405
I mean, you'd think first class, right?

170
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,490
You flew first class?

171
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,410
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

172
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,331
- Isn't first class a fortune?
- Yes, I was quite shocked.

173
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,460
- I thought you were tapped out.
- I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

174
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,879
I've run up some serious debts.

175
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,881
So how did you fly first class?

176
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,926
I don't know, Ginger. I just did.

177
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,889
All I meant was, if you've got no money,
to go first class...

178
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,892
You know me. I splurge from habit.

179
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,146
Would you stop staring
at my luggage?

180
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,523
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

181
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,402
- You told me you had to sell everything.
- Look, look, look.

182
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:37,406
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

183
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,951
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,995
God, I hate to tell you about that.

185
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:47,458
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef...

186
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,669
...until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell...

187
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,464
...and then it seems
you can't give it away.

188
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,885
Kids, stop it, come on!

189
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,846
- Were you adopted?
- Yes.

190
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,890
We were both adopted.

191
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,769
Born to different moms and dads,
but raised by the same mom and dad.

192
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,605
Could you stop doing that gun thing?
Sorry.

193
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,858
- Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.
- Matthew.

194
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,194
Did you like the new mom and dad?

195
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,363
- Yes, of course--
- Aunt Jasmine did.

196
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,741
I ran away from home
as fast as my feet could carry me.

197
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,952
- How come?
- Well--

198
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,621
Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine
and not me.

199
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,915
- Oh, stop.
- How come?

200
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,459
- She had better genes.
- Don't tell them that.

201
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:34,130
- Well, am I lying?
- Dad said you're glad we lived far away.

202
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,965
What?

203
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,718
They're perfect for the dress
that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

204
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,473
What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

205
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:49,645
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I--
I just got a call from my sister, Ginger.

206
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:54,150
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

207
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,818
He is a piece of work.

208
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,612
I just-- I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

209
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,198
- The one in San Francisco, the builder?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:05,077
Oh, no, he's a contractor.
I mean, he's-- No, he's a handyman.

211
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:08,414
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

212
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,542
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,835
Okay, that happens.

214
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,046
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

215
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,717
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

216
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,596
- Hi.
- Oh, you made it.

217
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,848
- How lovely to see you.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

218
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,641
- Welcome.
- Hi. Thank you.

219
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,019
- Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
- Augie.

220
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,396
- This is Jeanette.
- Jasmine. I changed it.

221
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,191
- Jasmine.
- I'm finally getting to meet the sister.

222
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,278
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry
we couldn't make it to the wedding.

223
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,989
Just that Hal had some business
in Saint-Tropez.

224
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,200
- Couldn't get back in time.
- Know what?

225
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,828
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

226
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,539
- He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
- I know. Hey--

227
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,417
Hal! You remember Ginger.

228
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,002
- Oh, my gosh.
- How are you?

229
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,712
- How are you?
- This is Augie.

230
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,589
- Augie. How you doing?
- Awesome.

231
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,716
- Hell of a place you got.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,801
- Why don't you come through?
- Told you.

233
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,887
- Yvette, coffee?
- This is really...

234
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,263
Yeah, she's got taste.

235
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,432
It's like what you see in the movies.

236
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:12,394
We have so much to catch up on.
Can't wait for you to show us New York.

237
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,605
Why don't you take our car and driver?

238
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,067
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

239
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,946
- No, no, I will definitely make some time.
- Oh, good.

240
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,241
Where are you staying?

241
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,953
Oh, well, we-- We thought about asking
if we could stay with you...

242
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,581
...but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

243
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,625
- Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
- Yeah.

244
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,836
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

245
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,256
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, it's not necessary.

246
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,591
Please, you're our guests. I insist.

247
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,220
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

248
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,765
- What? Tonight?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,560
We have dinner plans.

250
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,688
I don't think we can--
Something we can't get out of.

251
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,398
- I'm sorry.
- There'll be time.

252
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,901
We stashed the kids with Augie's sister,
we're here for a week.

253
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,945
- It's gonna be great.
- It is. Okay.

254
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,698
Well, we don't have a lot of free time...

255
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,826
...but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

256
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,452
I mean, or Daniel. I mean--

257
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,455
- They'd get a kick out of that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,918
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

259
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:23,465
- I love how you're doing your hair.
- Oh, thanks.

260
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,928
You'll have to take me shopping.
You always could pick clothes.

261
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,308
And Augie's got
some exciting business news...

262
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,643
...he wants to talk to Hal about.

263
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,688
Don't worry, I don't need
to borrow money. We're flush.

264
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,107
- Yeah,
- What kind of work do you do, Augie?

265
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:43,652
Well, you know,
I do, like, repairs, furniture moving...

266
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,863
...but I got plans to be my own boss.

267
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,741
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

268
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,367
Hey, could we have a tour?

269
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, yeah, of course.
Why don't you start in the kitchen?

270
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,125
- Is there a little girls' room?
- Just down the hall.

271
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,086
Five days.

272
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,006
I'll have to invite them
to my birthday party now.

273
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:08,010
- Where did she come up with him?
- I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

274
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,013
We've got to make sure
we make their stay extra nice.

275
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,224
My God, five days.

276
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,437
Look.

277
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,149
It's so beautiful.

278
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,360
Oh, but where would I wear
a Fendi bag?

279
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,737
Oh, go ahead. It's my treat.

280
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,073
- No.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,991
Really?

282
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,286
Oh, my God. I love it. Look.

283
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,704
Look.

284
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,707
- Take the other one off.
- No, I like this.

285
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,797
Boy, this is some place you got here.

286
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,299
- I mean, this is unreal.
- It is.

287
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,259
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

288
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,886
I used to be a lifeguard.

289
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,722
Start your own construction company?
Great idea.

290
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,392
- We came into some money.
- Tell him how, Augie.

291
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,894
- We've been saving this story.
- What?

292
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:02,648
Well, the first 10-, 12,000,
I really worked for.

293
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,483
Put away a little each week.

294
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,694
But he's not telling you the big news.

295
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,987
- Why we're in New York.
- You tell them.

296
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,240
Okay, I will.

297
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,950
We always play the lottery...

298
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,370
...and we never even get two numbers.
Am I right?

299
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,080
But last week, we hit it.

300
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,165
We got 200,000 bucks.

301
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,751
Oh, that's fantastic.

302
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,003
- I thought I'd drop dead.
- That's great.

303
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:28,257
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

304
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,050
He was shaking when we won.

305
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:34,263
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell her,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

306
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,098
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

307
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,435
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

308
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:44,189
Well, if you like, I think Hal
could probably help you do better.

309
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,441
Yeah?

310
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:50,279
You know-- You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to--

311
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,575
Hey, come on. We don't know
the first thing about money, but he does.

312
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,162
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

313
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,248
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

314
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,625
- There are ways.
- You see, Augie? You see?

315
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,504
Suppose I put you in a venture
that was low-risk, but very high-yield.

316
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,258
I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.
I'm talking about 20 percent.

317
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,135
- Profitable enough?
-20 percent?

318
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,138
He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

319
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,475
You mean,
not starting my own business.

320
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,977
No, we mean investing with Hal.

321
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,314
Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

322
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,941
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

323
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,234
Ginger.

324
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,321
Let them in on one of your--
The hotel deal or something.

325
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,740
It'd be great for them. Make a killing.

326
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,868
- Pay attention, Augie.
- I'm paying attention.

327
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,079
You will make money for them,
won't you?

328
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,081
I make money, they make money.

329
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,083
God, they're hard work.

330
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,336
Tomorrow I'm taking the day off.

331
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,547
I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

332
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,508
I've got that luncheon to plan...

333
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,427
...the fundraiser
for the Central Park Conservancy.

334
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,805
I've rented them a limo and a driver...

335
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,558
...and I've suggested they go
to the South Street Seaport.

336
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,645
Can you imagine if they lived here?

337
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,024
Here, for doing your duty.

338
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,151
Happy birthday.

339
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,031
I'm giving it to you now so you can wear it
to your party tomorrow night.

340
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,035
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.

341
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,705
Not bad taste
for a philistine businessman, huh?

342
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,051
- I know, it's so extravagant.
- Oh, look at that.

343
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,803
He surprised me in the tub,
so to speak.

344
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,807
Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,
but it's nothing like Sardinia.

345
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,353
This year you are coming
to Palm Beach, no excuses.

346
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,148
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

347
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,776
- Who's that woman?
- Which?

348
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,486
- That one.
- Oh, Raylene.

349
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,780
She's a friend. I love Raylene.

350
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,657
We met in a yoga class.

351
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,617
- Isn't she pretty?
- Yeah.

352
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,577
She runs a modeling agency.

353
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,205
- How long have you known her?
- Few years. Why?

354
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,708
- And you trust her?
- Trust her?

355
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,379
Of course I trust her.
What kind of question is that?

356
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,256
She just seems so cozy all night
with your husband.

357
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,885
I wouldn't worry. Hal's not
the roving type, nor is Raylene.

358
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,596
- She's a very close friend.
- I don't know.

359
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,140
If it was my husband,
I'd keep an eye on him.

360
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,269
Goodness, you are a suspicious one.

361
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,188
- I'm just saying.
- Just relax.

362
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,399
I am relaxed.

363
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,694
You shouldn't drink so much, Augie.

364
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,322
Nobody wants to hear
those stupid Polish jokes, you know?

365
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,533
Oh, I had a drink?

366
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,784
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

367
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:10,914
Let me tell you, you were half in the bag
the entire night, okay?

368
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,250
Tell me about my drinking.

369
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,878
- Give me that.
- What's eating you?

370
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,633
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

371
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,635
- What?
- Would you tell your friend?

372
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,096
- I'm talking.
- Tell him what?

373
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,433
Are you listening to me?

374
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:34,104
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

375
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,689
- Would you tell him?
- Yeah.

376
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,984
- Bet your ass I'd tell him.
- But what if it causes trouble?

377
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,610
Or maybe a divorce?

378
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,947
If you don't say anything,
it could've been a passing thing.

379
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,825
He never knows and he lives on
happy with his wife.

380
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:50,746
You know, I would tell him,
because that's what a friend's for.

381
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,915
You gotta have his back.
That's why I'd tell him.

382
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,918
It's a tough call, Augie. I don't know.

383
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,921
- Ginger?
- What?

384
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,591
What are we doing?
Are we playing charades?

385
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,259
I mean, come on.

386
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,928
- Did you see something?
- Yeah.

387
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,639
On the street, by accident.

388
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,852
I saw Hal kissing that brunette
who was at the party.

389
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:18,940
You saw Hal kiss Raylene? Raylene?

390
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,193
You know her name too?

391
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,236
My God, she gets around.

392
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,782
Oh, we were introduced.
Come on, you got nothing to worry about.

393
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,159
- Yeah.
- Nobody could ever take your place.

394
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,205
Yeah, believe me,
I wasn't thinking she'd look at you.

395
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,916
- Nobody would ever look at me, right?
- Right.

396
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:40,003
- You looked at me.
- Yeah, once. It was a mistake.

397
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,799
- All right, listen.
- What?

398
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,343
You think Hal's banging her?

399
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,096
When Jasmine don't wanna
know something...

400
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,265
...she's got a habit
of looking the other way.

401
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,685
Thank you for my present.
I got so many comments.

402
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:59,189
I think everyone enjoyed themselves
and that piano player was--

403
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,900
He was fantastic. I got his card.

404
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:06,154
What were you talking to Raylene
so intensely about?

405
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:10,242
Oh, her husband is thinking about
getting his own plane.

406
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,247
I was just weighing the pros and cons
for her of a Challenger versus a--

407
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,083
- Gulf stream?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,877
- She's so pretty.
- Yeah.

409
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,339
Bill's out of town for a couple weeks
and she'll be all alone.

410
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:28,718
I thought maybe we could take her out
to dinner or have her over here.

411
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,720
- Yeah.
- Great.

412
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,556
Sure.

413
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,688
- This is silly, Ginger.
- Why?

414
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,022
- It's Sunday.
- So?

415
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:44,401
It's his day off.
He wants to spend it alone with you.

416
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,403
He's alone with me plenty.

417
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,073
If I'm gonna marry Chili,
you're gonna meet him sooner than later.

418
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,117
I told him we'd show you the town.

419
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:56,413
- Well, he won't want your sister around.
- Will you stop it?

420
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,292
This city is so beautifully European.

421
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,419
Have you ever been abroad?

422
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,129
- At all?
- No.

423
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,465
We used to sail
from Saint-Tropez to Cannes...

424
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,926
...and up the coast to Monaco.

425
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,555
- It reminds me of the Mediterranean.
- There's Chili.

426
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,599
- Which one?
- There.

427
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,684
- Who's that with him?
- I don't know.

428
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,853
- Chili.
- Hi.

429
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,897
- Hi, hey.
- You look beautiful.

430
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,024
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

431
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,067
- You smell good too.
- You're late.

432
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,279
- Eddie. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Ginger. Hi.

433
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,572
This is Jasmine.

434
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,866
- Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.
- This is Eddie.

435
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,243
- Nice to meet you. Eddie.
- I'm Jasmine.

436
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,120
- Hi.
- Ginger told me about you.

437
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,581
Oh, all good, I hope.

438
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,043
I gotta tell you, I was all set
to move in with your sister.

439
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,922
Then she tells me that we gotta postpone
because her sister's in town.

440
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,008
- He's joking.
- Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

441
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,426
It was an emergency.

442
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,678
- No.
- Things happen. Right, Eddie?

443
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,680
Could've happened to anybody.

444
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,475
Told me you never been here,
don't know anybody...

445
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,603
...so I brought along this sad excuse
for a blind date.

446
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,606
- Best he could do on short notice.
- He works with me.

447
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,107
I gotta get a beer.

448
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,610
- You want a beer?
- Can I buy you a drink?

449
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,988
- I have a drink, but thank you.
- I'm dropping dead of hunger.

450
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,282
This place has the best clams.

451
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,992
You like clams, Jasmine?

452
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,119
No, no, no. I'm not hungry.

453
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,623
What the hell are you drinking?
Let me see. What is this?

454
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,999
- Is it vodka?
- Martini.

455
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,878
- This place has the best clams in the city.
- The best are at Manero's.

456
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,965
- You're nuts. They don't even compare.
- Who cares?

457
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,718
This place is good too. They're fresh.
That's the thing with clams.

458
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,930
You get a bad clam,
you'll wish you were never born.

459
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:40,475
- So, what do you do, Jasmine?
- I told you, she just got here.

460
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,519
- She's looking for a job.
- Yeah?

461
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,313
I know a dentist who's looking for help.

462
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,565
- Oh, yeah?
- No, I'm actually thinking...

463
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,193
...of going back to school.
- School?

464
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,113
To study what?

465
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,575
I don't know. I mean,
the biggest mistake I made...

466
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:01,997
...was leaving college in my last year
and not completing my education.

467
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,498
What would you be?

468
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,292
An anthropologist.

469
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,503
Really? Like digging up old fossils?

470
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,171
That's an archaeologist.

471
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,382
Ginger told me the whole story.

472
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,092
That must be terrible, right?

473
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,845
One minute you're on top of the world,
the next--

474
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,306
- Guy turns out to be a crook.
- Yeah.

475
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,891
Her husband, he owned racehorses.

476
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,727
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

477
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,938
Oh, yes, yes, for a year or two...

478
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,649
...Hal became quite obsessed
with thoroughbreds.

479
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,319
So, what are you gonna study
in college?

480
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,570
Let me guess.

481
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,072
A nurse.

482
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,616
Is that how I impress you?

483
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,870
- A nurse?
- You got something against nurses?

484
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:45,415
- My sister's a nurse.
- Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.

485
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,793
They have extensive knowledge
of how the human body works.

486
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:53,089
- Careful what you accuse my sister of.
- Just saying, I know a few good nurses.

487
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,342
Chili, why don't you
change the subject?

488
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,386
You think you're being charming,
but you're not.

489
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,972
You always stare into space like that?

490
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,850
I had a friend who used to do that...

491
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,187
...but there was something wrong
with him. He was epileptic.

492
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,774
I'm not epileptic.

493
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,903
If you see the waitress,
I'd like another Stoli martini.

494
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,447
- What are you gonna study?
- Leave her alone.

495
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,909
- It's like the third time you asked.
- So? She hasn't answered.

496
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:24,245
I don't know, but I'll be sure
to keep you informed.

497
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:28,833
- Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.

498
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,295
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

499
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,840
- What do you wanna do?
- Why don't we take her to see the sights?

500
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,886
Then back to my place. She likes vodka.
My buddy's just back from Russia.

501
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,555
- Brought me this incredible vodka.
- Great idea.

502
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:46,142
- You're gonna love my place.
- Yeah, let's go.

503
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,758
- Wait till you try this vodka.
- All right, man.

504
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,718
I wish my apartment had a garden.

505
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,555
- We didn't take her inside Alcatraz.
- Thank you.

506
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:27,767
- They got tours in there, Jasmine.
- Ginger said your ex-husband did time?

507
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:31,396
He'd still be doing time
if he didn't hang himself in his cell.

508
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,316
- Really? Like with a belt?
- Well, it had to be a belt. Or a bedsheet.

509
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,985
- Could be a bedsheet.
- No.

510
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,531
He managed to get a piece of rope.

511
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:43,908
Plain rope.

512
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,119
You can get anything if you gotjuice.

513
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,913
That's some way to go.
Strangle yourself to death?

514
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,583
No, it wasn't strangulation.

515
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,461
When you hang yourself,
your neck breaks.

516
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,547
I wouldn't feel sorry for him.
He hurt a lot of people.

517
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,800
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, including me and Augie and her.

518
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,179
A lot of people are under
the misapprehension you strangle...

519
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,223
...but your neck snaps.
- Okay, we got it.

520
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,726
He was a bad guy, you know?

521
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,479
He lived like a big shot
on other people's money.

522
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:16,107
- And he played around behind her back.
- No.

523
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,486
- Jasmine, go and start your cooldown.
- Oh, good.

524
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,907
- Hey, Jas.
- Yeah?

525
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,035
I know you don't wanna go
to the Yankee game tonight.

526
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:31,706
I'd go to any sporting event with you,
you know, but I just never got baseball.

527
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:36,169
- I thought I'd ask Melanie. She's a fan.
- Oh, sure. God, she'll be thrilled.

528
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,629
- Hey, Mel?
- Yeah?

529
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,465
- You like baseball, right?
- I love baseball. Why?

530
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:45,094
I got two season tickets
behind the Yankee dugout for tonight.

531
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,139
I don't have anybody else to go with me.
Are you free?

532
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,975
Absolutely, if you're sure
there's nobody else.

533
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,352
No.

534
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,688
- No, no, you'll do just fine.
- All right, thanks.

535
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,068
- This is where you live? Nice.
- Yeah.

536
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,488
- Hey, can you grab the groceries for me?
- Yeah.

537
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,746
- I can get this one.
- Get them.

538
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,249
- You got it? All right.
- I got it.

539
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,336
- Oh, no.
- That's okay, don't worry.

540
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,089
- No more vodka for you.
- I didn't have any vodka.

541
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,550
- I didn't have no vodka.
- I know about you.

542
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,094
Hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

543
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,554
- Take it upstairs?
- Yes?

544
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,888
- Yeah.
- All right.

545
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,474
Eddie wants your phone number.

546
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,686
- Why?
- I think he wants to call you.

547
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,730
I think he wants to ask you out,
you know, for dinner.

548
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,526
- Look, I'm busy at the moment.
- He's a terrific guy. Look at him.

549
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,945
Well, why doesn't he ask me himself?

550
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,073
Because he's shy, you know?
He thinks he's short.

551
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,078
Look, I'm concentrating
on school, okay?

552
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,122
- And getting a job.
- That's perfect.

553
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,291
Right, he knows this dentist.

554
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:59,377
No, I have no interest
in being a receptionist.

555
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,921
What did you have in mind,
running a bank?

556
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,883
- Is this what you wanted to talk about?
- And how long you're planning...

557
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:09,762
...on staying with Ginger.
- Oh, right. It's just till I find my feet

558
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,389
We have a lot of big plans.

559
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,434
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin
any of your big plans.

560
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,395
No one wants to get out of here
as fast as I do.

561
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,815
I'm sure this is a big comedown
from what you're used to.

562
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,569
It's fine. it's-- I'm grateful for her help.

563
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,696
So you don't want Eddie to call you?

564
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,366
No, I'm not ready to go out
at the moment.

565
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:34,329
Ginger said
you had a nervous breakdown.

566
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,125
She tends to be quite dramatic.

567
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,961
Said you were in the street,
talking to yourself.

568
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:48,676
You know, I don't think
that this is any of your business.

569
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:53,056
No, but since I'm marrying her,
we don't have any secrets between us.

570
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,064
- What did Chili want?
- Oh, nothing.

571
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:05,360
His retarded boyfriend wanted a date,
but he was too shy to ask.

572
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:09,280
- What do you think of Chili?
- He's very anxious to move in with you.

573
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,699
Yeah, I know. He's got the hots for me.

574
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,409
Can I speak frankly?

575
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,370
- You hate him?
- Yeah.

576
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:18,081
I could tell you two didn't hit it off.

577
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,709
He's another version of Augie.
He's a loser.

578
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:25,296
Hey, didn't I hear Eddie say
he knows a dentist looking for help?

579
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:29,133
Oh, forget it! Jesus, it's too menial!

580
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,344
I'd go nuts.

581
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,847
I wanna go back to school.

582
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:40,937
I wanna get my degree and become,
you know, something substantial.

583
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,065
I can't just do some mindless job.

584
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,443
I was forced to take a job selling shoes
on Madison Avenue.

585
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,488
Oh, so humiliating.

586
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:54,409
Friends I'd had at dinner parties
at our apartment came in...

587
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:58,579
...and I waited on them. I mean,
do you have any idea what that's like?

588
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:02,458
You know, one minute,
you're hosting women...

589
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:06,713
...and the next, you're measuring
their shoe size and fitting them.

590
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,424
Erica Bishop came into the store.

591
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:13,594
She saw me
and was so embarrassed for me...

592
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:17,014
...she slipped out
thinking I didn't see her.

593
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,309
I saw you, Erica!

594
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,272
Are you okay?

595
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,942
Hey, you got great taste.

596
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:32,697
Maybe you could do something
in fashion.

597
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,323
Or designing. Yeah?

598
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,785
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

599
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:41,080
Everyone used to say
I'd make a good interior decorator.

600
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,084
There's courses,
but, you know, they cost money.

601
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:49,297
No, Eve Logan
got her decorator's license online.

602
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,507
On a computer?

603
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,092
I guess you could, but--

604
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,679
Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.

605
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,766
But I could take a class in computers.

606
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:04,687
And then when I can handle a computer,
then I can study decorating online.

607
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:09,233
- That sounds too complicated.
- Why is your reaction always negative?

608
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,068
I'm just saying.

609
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,654
You know, first you gotta
learn computers...

610
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,491
...and then go for a decorator's
license online.

611
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,869
You're afraid I'll stay here too long.

612
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,829
No, you know--

613
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:25,333
Just all those courses,
they cost money.

614
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:30,922
You'll work out here. It's mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight.

615
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,217
There's the follow-up cards,
which I explained...

616
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:37,136
...and the notices for cleanings.

617
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,472
Any questions?

618
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,184
Tell Dr. Flicker it's an emergency.

619
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:46,729
- Come on, come on.
- Yes?

620
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,856
What?

621
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,025
Yes, a cancellation.

622
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,861
Oh, you want to cancel.

623
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,530
- When?
- Please.

624
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:59,450
Wait, wait, wait. You said the 24th.

625
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,494
My husband has an abscess.

626
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:05,206
Can you just put someone on
who speaks better English?

627
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:10,002
The software interface
is what provides you, the user...

628
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:13,673
...the ability to control the hardware,
the computer.

629
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,550
Okay, that's the operating.

630
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,679
The operating system
gives you that ability.

631
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,848
I need an appointment in two weeks.

632
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,398
Is the 10th good for you?

633
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,568
The 10th. Yes, fine.

634
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,028
Oh, better make it the 12th.

635
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:39,407
- Oh, we're all booked on the 12th.
- Okay.

636
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,908
Make it the 14th.

637
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,411
- The 14th?
- Oh, no.

638
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,705
Is 3 good on the 9th?

639
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,874
Or noon on the 11th?

640
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:52,128
Can you just settle on a time, please?
Just pick a time.

641
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,631
Remember the yoga class.

642
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,844
Deep breath.

643
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,805
Breathe deeply.

644
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,768
All right, deep breath.

645
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,900
If you take a deep breath,
you can smell the honeysuckle.

646
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,028
- Beautiful. Make a great perfume.
- It would.

647
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,780
- Your polo pony's in great shape.
- Thank you.

648
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,325
- No, I have never seen a polo match.
- Really?

649
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,913
My husband's a fanatic. Not to say
he's good at it, but it keeps him busy.

650
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,664
We got a flight to catch.

651
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,417
Hal's taking Danny to Augusta
for the Masters.

652
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,170
They're golf degenerates.
I'll be home alone.

653
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,048
- We'll be back in three days.
- Did we tell you?

654
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,634
- Danny was first in his class at Harvard.
- No.

655
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,010
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

656
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,720
- Thanks.
- He's a math genius.

657
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,390
He's the genius. Dad did a guest lecture
at the business school...

658
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,976
...and everyone said
it was the best lecture.

659
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,104
Naturally I became an instant
celebrity on campus.

660
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,107
Hey, I need your signature
onthese,baby.

661
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:01,489
Be careful. Don't get hit by a golf ball.
That's how Ray Becker died.

662
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,992
You know, a little blue bruise
on his temple.

663
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,506
What are you always studying
in your spare time?

664
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,300
Well, I'm trying to learn
to use a computer.

665
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:24,804
I wanna study interior design online.

666
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:27,139
Oh, you wanna be a decorator?

667
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,475
Yeah, it's where my strongest gifts are.

668
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:32,520
You know, I have a natural flair
for space and color...

669
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,523
...and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings.

670
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:39,944
It's very commendable, but I can't really
have you studying on work time...

671
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,530
...if it interferes
with the business at hand.

672
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,324
Yes. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

673
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,576
Please, see that it doesn't.

674
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:55,543
- I was gonna ask you a question.
- Yes?

675
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,256
Would you have a drink with me?

676
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,550
A drink?

677
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,970
I'd love it if you could.

678
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,265
Well, it would have to be a quick one...

679
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:13,227
...because, you know,
I'm meeting my boyfriend for dinner.

680
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,190
I was just saying...

681
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:22,028
...you can tell awful lot about people
when you look in their mouths.

682
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:26,407
Are they conscientious?
Are they disciplined? Are they vain?

683
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:29,410
Or careless?
You have to know what to look for.

684
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,413
Do you have the time?
I have to keep an eye on it.

685
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,664
I've got homework.

686
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:38,878
This computer thing is proving
a little more difficult than I imagined.

687
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:43,674
It's funny, really, because I used to be
a straight-A student in college.

688
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:47,887
You know, but they say every year,
millions of brain cells just die off.

689
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,139
You have good teeth.

690
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,143
I'm sure you get
many compliments on them.

691
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,021
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

692
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:00,524
You know,
you're a very beautiful woman.

693
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,444
Are you serious with your boyfriend?

694
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,947
I don't mean to pry.

695
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:13,120
God, life is complicated.

696
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,623
Have you ever had any children?

697
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,918
How do you expect me to react
when my father is unmasked...

698
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:22,213
...as a common thief?
- You can't just drop out of Harvard.

699
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:25,591
No, it's too humiliating.
I wanna die when I see what he's done.

700
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,135
- How he lied, stole, ruined people.
- I know--

701
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,637
He is a sleazy criminal.

702
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,224
But if you drop out, you will be
throwing away your whole future.

703
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,018
You think I could ever face anybody
up at school?

704
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,521
My father, who I bragged
to everyone about?

705
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,690
The financial genius, generous,
the philanthropist?

706
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,151
He's such a phony.
He's a cheap crook.

707
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,821
His charitable contributions
with stolen money.

708
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,282
Well, just think how he feels.
He was arrested in the street.

709
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,077
- It's in all the papers.
- How can you look at him?

710
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,330
Did you not suspect anything
or did you not care?

711
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:59,708
- What does that mean?
- It didn't pay for you to ask questions.

712
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,462
Think I would have allowed him
to set up corporations under my name?

713
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,674
Sign accounts? This is no cake walk.
I could get indicted.

714
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:11,095
He's done nothing but lie over the years.
He is a con man and a hypocrite.

715
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:15,307
This is how you respond, by squandering
your life to get even with him?

716
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,893
Don't try to find me, because you won't.

717
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,564
He's a fucking bum. Let's go.

718
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,150
Let's go, let's go. Get out of the clinch.

719
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,193
- Hey. Hey.
- That's it, pop the jab.

720
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,196
Hey, guys, keep it down.
My sister's trying to study.

721
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,198
When can we stop tiptoeing around?

722
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,992
- Pop the jab.
- She'll hear you.

723
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,495
Well, I don't care.
I work hard all week. I wanna relax.

724
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:42,293
- Let's go, come on.
- Let's go. Work the body.

725
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,211
- The guy's just standing.
- Look.

726
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,756
<i>And Bruno makes it easy,
because he just pushes himself forward.</i>

727
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:51,594
Her sister, she had millions.
Turned out she married a crook.

728
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,013
Look, where was she
when she was loaded...

729
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,724
...and you were tending bar,
waiting tables?

730
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,602
Now family's family?

731
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah, nice. You can see the money.

732
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,273
- I know.
- He's right.

733
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,401
Is it possible,
without ruining any of your fun...

734
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,570
...that you could lower the TV a bit?

735
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:13,282
Hey, Jasmine, why don't you
stop working for a bit? Have a beer.

736
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,826
Believe me, I wish I could.

737
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,245
What kind of work are you doing?

738
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:22,750
I'm trying to work a computer...

739
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,211
...but it seems I have no aptitude for it.

740
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,630
Hey, listen, I just--
I want you to know...

741
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,218
...it's great when a grown-up continues
with their education. Not for nothing.

742
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:38,098
Well, my goal is to
study interior decorating online.

743
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,310
Why don't you just go
to decorator school?

744
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:47,524
Well, I have to use my days to work
and pay my way.

745
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:50,861
As Hal said,
"it's not the money, it's the money."

746
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,823
Yeah, okay, but, you know,
life ain't all work and no play, right?

747
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:57,952
Ginger says between work and school,
you're cracking up.

748
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,246
- Hey, why don't you shut up?
- No, no.

749
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,624
I'll admit, it's been very trying...

750
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,418
...but I'm determined
to make something of myself.

751
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:10,673
- You don't like working with the dentist?
- No, I do not.

752
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,801
Well, Ginger said
you're not used to working a job.

753
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,553
Well, in that respect,
I was very fortunate.

754
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,514
He was a handsome guy with money.

755
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:22,059
He was smooth talker and pampered her.
What's she gonna say, no?

756
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,979
I got it.

757
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,692
Why does it have to be a decorator?
Why can't you pick something else?

758
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,736
What would you want me to do?

759
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:35,656
Do you want me to wait tables?
Bag groceries?

760
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,825
Hey, Ginger bags groceries.

761
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:42,079
Well, Ginger and I
are completely different people.

762
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,914
Yeah, she got the good genes.

763
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:47,835
It's not genetic. You can't always
blame everything on your genes.

764
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,671
If you're prepared to work hard
and not settle--

765
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,132
- What, you mean Augie?
- She means me.

766
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:58,470
Who do I have to sleep with around here
to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?

767
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:06,020
That's what I...

768
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:10,524
What--? What--?
Oh, Christ, I can't remember.

769
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:14,903
So, Chili was telling me that you used
to have a really nice collection of cars.

770
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,613
Oh, yes, my husband did.

771
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:22,453
He used to collect vintage
Bentleys and Mercedes.

772
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,998
- Wow, those are expensive cars.
- Yes, they are.

773
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,793
You know, having wealth
is nothing to be ashamed of.

774
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:33,756
- We were very civic-minded.
- Yeah, with other people's money.

775
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:36,675
This guy lost every penny
of Ginger's money.

776
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:40,137
I tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing.

777
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,806
I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

778
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,560
You'll be very happy to know
that I lost every cent of my own money.

779
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:49,438
You know, every home,
every stick of furniture...

780
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:52,232
...every fur, every ring
and every bank account...

781
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,319
...and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

782
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,364
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week...

783
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:03,243
...I knew he was hitting on her girlfriend.
- I really need to study.

784
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,913
- I need some peace, okay?
- Okay.

785
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,625
I'm not gonna make it
if you turn this place into a nightclub.

786
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,836
- I can't. I just can't.
- All right, all right, all right.

787
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:16,757
- Everybody out. The girl's got homework.
- What? Main event's not on yet.

788
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,467
- Out.
- I'm not leaving now.

789
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,136
You know, she's right about you, Chili.

790
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:24,515
- You drink, you become a jerk.
- What about her? She's drink--

791
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,809
Jerk? Come here.

792
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,770
I'm sorry I don't drive a Bentley.

793
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,815
- Let's go to the bar.
- Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.

794
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:34,650
Good night.

795
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,277
- Jesus, it's a mess.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

796
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:42,282
Ginger, I'm really-- I don't--
I don't know what came over me.

797
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:46,328
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

798
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,956
Yeah, I know these are not
your kind of guys.

799
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,834
I mean, God, don't you wanna meet
some decent man?

800
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,837
You know, someone
who can take you out of this--

801
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,506
What? This hole?

802
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,883
Yeah, I know what you think of it here.

803
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:02,428
I mean, you've got two kids.

804
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:05,722
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

805
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:10,018
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

806
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:13,021
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

807
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,777
Okay, okay. Do you always have to make
those stupid sarcastic digs?

808
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,114
I'm scared, Hal.

809
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:25,701
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global Innovations...

810
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:29,913
...is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

811
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:32,207
- Howard Trask is such a pussy.
- No, no--

812
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:36,253
- What do you think I have lawyers for?
- He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

813
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:40,174
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

814
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:43,677
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

815
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:47,514
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

816
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:51,018
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

817
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,979
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

818
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:55,689
Is there?

819
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,274
No.

820
00:46:57,483 --> 00:47:00,527
So stop worrying and let me spoil you.

821
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:04,031
No, I agree. I mean,
Howard always was a prissy mama's boy.

822
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,493
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

823
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:12,789
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

824
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:15,709
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

825
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:19,421
All right, 2, 3?

826
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,217
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21st?

827
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,261
- We have nothing open on the 21st.
- Good night.

828
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,013
Well, he wants me in a week.

829
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:31,225
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

830
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,143
- Fine. Oh, wait, no.
- Go for 9?

831
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,604
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

832
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,397
That's always very special.

833
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:40,400
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

834
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,534
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback...

835
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,662
...and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

836
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,956
- Sure.
- No, no, no.

837
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,041
When you're done, when you're done.

838
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,253
When you're finished. Thank you.

839
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:05,592
Are you feeling more comfortable
in the job?

840
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:10,430
I hope you're pleased,
because I am determined to make it work.

841
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,851
- It fits in perfectly with my class.
- Are you getting better on the computer?

842
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:20,023
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student there,
but another girl helps me, $0...

843
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:24,111
I'm glad you're relaxing more
into this job.

844
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,865
- I'm trying.
- I must say, I like having you around.

845
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:31,451
- Thank you.
- Since you started working here...

846
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,830
...have you noticed I've been wearing
more colorful neckties?

847
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:39,126
<i>_I__</i>
- Since you-- I'm just-- Just joking.

848
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:42,546
Can I--? Can I make a confession?

849
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,134
I don't know that I should be the one
to hear a confession, doctor.

850
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,844
Well...

851
00:48:50,304 --> 00:48:53,974
The way you dress...

852
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:57,853
...I sometimes find very...

853
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,022
...arousing.

854
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,443
Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

855
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:09,364
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I find you attractive?

856
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:14,328
- Dr. Flicker, where is all this talk leading?
- Well, I'm not the kind of person...

857
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:18,832
...who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

858
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,544
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

859
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:26,423
A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

860
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:29,384
- I shouldn't be hearing this.
- No, don't be upset.

861
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:32,721
- I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
- Don't be upset.

862
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:37,142
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

863
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:38,393
I'm not in a shell.

864
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:40,729
- Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
- No.

865
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:44,107
- It would remove your inhibitions.
- I don't have inhibitions.

866
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,400
- Stop.
- Dr. Flicker.

867
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,986
- Stop being standoffish.
- I'm not standoffish.

868
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:50,739
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

869
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,491
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

870
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,327
This is so embarrassing.

871
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:59,247
I am never coming back here.

872
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:03,210
I don't have to put myself
through this nonsense.

873
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,754
I gotta take a deep breath.

874
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:08,799
Oh, now look what you've done.
I can't breathe.

875
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,176
Oh, God, I can't breathe.

876
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,059
I don't blame you for being shaken up.

877
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:23,146
I'd have that dentist reported.
If I told my boyfriend that story...

878
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:27,025
...he would go to the guy's office
and break every bone in his body.

879
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:29,319
You can sue him. That's harassment.

880
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,072
No, I'm never going
into another courtroom.

881
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,532
I don't blame you.

882
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,327
My boyfriend's a lawyer.
He's got court stories.

883
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:40,956
- Sharon, do you know any men?
- Men?

884
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,376
Men that would be good for me.

885
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:48,463
I just moved here,
so I don't really know anybody.

886
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:52,884
If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,
you can't fall in love anywhere.

887
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,928
Someone substantial.

888
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:58,849
Well, what are you doing
Sunday afternoon?

889
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,142
Not very much.

890
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,602
Tony and I are going to a party.
Come with.

891
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:06,523
Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready
for a big crowd of strangers.

892
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:08,442
Oh, come on.

893
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,696
It's a big bash someone's having.
There'll be all kinds of people.

894
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,073
Make an effort,
otherwise nothing happens

895
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:20,787
- Then you blame everything but yourself.
- No, I want to. It's not that I don't want to.

896
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,874
- Can I bring my sister?
- For moral support? Absolutely.

897
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,709
And Tony and I will be there.

898
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,462
You'll have fun. It's a huge party.

899
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,630
Maybe you'll get lucky.

900
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:34,760
But you have to come,
otherwise I'm not going.

901
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:38,096
- What the hell would I wear?
- Oh, we'll find you something.

902
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:41,516
Oh, God, I haven't shown my face
socially in so long.

903
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:44,686
Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

904
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:48,398
I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

905
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:53,028
- Well, you know what I say to Chili.
- It's hard to meet a man you can trust.

906
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,197
Hal.

907
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,824
Hey, Nat.
What are you doing out here?

908
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:01,661
I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

909
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,331
Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

910
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,582
- Jasmine.
- Hello.

911
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:10,003
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.

912
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:12,798
She's brilliant.
We couldn't have done any better.

913
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,842
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

914
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:18,094
- Free on Tuesday?
- I'll make sure I am.

915
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,387
That's great.

916
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:22,390
Are you having an affair with Amy?

917
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:27,354
- Amy, my lawyer?
- Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

918
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,773
Of course not.
What makes you think that?

919
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,692
- Someone made a remark.
- What remark?

920
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:36,279
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

921
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:39,032
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

922
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:41,952
- That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
- Were you?

923
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,913
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

924
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,249
- Lydia was there.
- Did you take her hand?

925
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:51,545
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

926
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:54,297
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

927
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,757
Maybe you were high.

928
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:59,219
- It's obvious she's got crush on you.
- You're building a case.

929
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,305
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

930
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:05,058
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

931
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:08,436
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

932
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,939
You know, I understand
other women have a--

933
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:15,610
Find you attractive,
but it's their hard luck. I have you.

934
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,363
- Yes, you do.
- No.

935
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,699
So you're not?

936
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,577
No, I'm not.

937
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,747
Good.

938
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:30,083
Let's make love.

939
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:43,138
You know, if you were having an affair,
I'd be pretty upset.

940
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:47,183
Pretty darn angry. I don't wanna be
made a fool of, you know?

941
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:50,645
- You hear me, Hal?
- Excuse me. Are you talking to me?

942
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:52,397
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

943
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,274
Hi.

944
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,611
- How are you? I'm so glad you came.
- You must be Tony.

945
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:00,113
- Yes, this is Tony.
- A pleasure to meet you.

946
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:02,949
- What do you think? Nice party, right?
- Beautiful.

947
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,035
It's kind of a mixed bag.

948
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,620
Did you bring your sister?

949
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:09,247
Oh, yes, she's dancing.

950
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:13,877
- Hey, my name's Al, incidentally.
- Ginger.

951
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,587
- Ginger?
- Yeah.

952
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,048
Ginger, you dance great.

953
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,717
- I never get a chance to, and I love it.
- Yeah?

954
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:22,719
I do,yeah

955
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,971
You know Sally, the host?

956
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,641
- No, my sister brought me.
- Yeah?

957
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:32,312
Wherever the hell she is. I don't--
I don't know where she is.

958
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,773
But you're from San Francisco?

959
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:36,191
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

960
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,360
- What about you?
- Marin.

961
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,111
- Okay.
- Yeah.

962
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,863
Great.

963
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:43,448
What do you do, Al?

964
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:47,327
I'm a sound engineer.
I put in people's systems, you know?

965
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,412
- I did Mr. Lockman's.
- Okay.

966
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:52,666
He's the husband of the host,
in case you were wondering.

967
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:55,585
I do concerts and private...

968
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:58,672
- Great.
- I like slow dancing better, don't you?

969
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,674
- Yeah.
- It's more romantic, right?

970
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,717
- It is, yeah.
- Yeah.

971
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,552
It is.

972
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:07,555
Hey, you're really pretty.

973
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:12,185
- Yeah, you are. You are.
- Really? Really?

974
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:24,572
I'd rather be someplace else too.

975
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,537
- Do I look that uncomfortable?
- Almost.

976
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:34,833
- I'm Dwight Westlake.
- Jasmine French.

977
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,585
Jasmine French,
that's a very exotic name.

978
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:41,923
Well, my parents named me
after my mother's favorite flower.

979
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,426
Night-blooming jasmine.

980
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:47,262
Come to life after it gets dark.

981
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:50,849
That's the best offer I've had today.

982
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,559
I didn't say it was an offer.

983
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,938
I saw you in the other room before,
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

984
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,733
Well, hope I don't shatter your illusion.

985
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,402
- You have great style.
- Do I?

986
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,947
Chanel belt, Hermés bag
and Vivier shoes.

987
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:09,409
Vivier-- Oh, my goodness.
Do you work in the fashion industry?

988
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:13,038
No, but my former wife was.
She worked at a fashion magazine.

989
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:15,373
- Right.
- She passed away last year.

990
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:17,876
Oh, I'm sorry.

991
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:22,047
- I'm so-- And what do you do?
- Nothing as glamorous as fashion.

992
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,717
- I work in the State Department.
- Well, no, that's glamorous.

993
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,218
In the diplomatic corps.

994
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:30,013
- Don't tell me you're an ambassador.
- No, hardly.

995
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,098
But I wouldn't turn it down.

996
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,100
We knew the ambassador to Mexico.

997
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:35,810
My husband did.

998
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,229
Your husband? You have a husband?

999
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:42,859
No, no. Sadly, like your wife,
he passed away.

1000
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:47,781
But, you know, we stayed overnight
in the embassy in Mexico once.

1001
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:49,783
- I work in Europe. Vienna.
- Really?

1002
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,785
- Oh, I love Vienna.
- Oh, yeah?

1003
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,620
We were there once, Hal and I.

1004
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:57,290
I remember it as being two weeks
of young wine and chocolate cake.

1005
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:01,461
Lovely. My ambition is to come back
after a few years and enter politics.

1006
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:04,881
- I'd like to run for office in California.
- Oh, how exciting.

1007
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,928
Yeah, it might just be an inflated ego,
but I think I'd make a good congressman

1008
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:14,057
I grew up in San Francisco.
I know California. I like challenges.

1009
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,308
You from out here?

1010
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,561
New York. Park Avenue.

1011
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,814
You know, when my husband
passed away...

1012
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,149
...I mean, naturally I was very upset...

1013
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,029
...so I decided to come out here
and start a new life for myself.

1014
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:30,490
What did he do?

1015
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:35,453
He was a surgeon.

1016
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:40,834
God, that must be incredibly stressful.

1017
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:45,630
No, I mean, he had a heart attack.
I'm sure that's what gave it to him.

1018
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:47,715
You have children?

1019
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:53,429
No, no. No, there really wasn't time.

1020
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:57,517
And what about you? What do you do?
I guessed you were in the arts.

1021
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:00,353
- Am I right?
- Well, you're close.

1022
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,856
I am an interior designer.

1023
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,024
I really have hit the jackpot.

1024
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:07,360
- Really?
- I meet this exotic creature...

1025
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,321
...not only is she charming
and elegant and single...

1026
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,699
...but I just bought a new house.
- Really?

1027
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,034
One I've been looking at. It's in Marin.

1028
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:17,829
- Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.
- Beautiful.

1029
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:21,374
I meet this woman, and she turns out
to be an interior designer.

1030
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,918
Written in the stars.
You have to look at it.

1031
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,713
- I would love to.
- Maybe you can help me with it.

1032
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,423
Absolutely.

1033
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:32,552
I never slept with anyone
the first night before, you know?

1034
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,430
- Yeah, that--
- But dancing with you...

1035
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:38,349
...got me all hot and bothered,
so, you know...

1036
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:39,851
Well, you were so sexy.

1037
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,563
I mean, I knew right away
that you were gonna be good in bed.

1038
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:44,898
- I knew it.
- Did you?

1039
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:46,900
I said to myself, you know...

1040
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:50,111
You know, I thought for sure
we were gonna get caught.

1041
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,238
I didn't care. I mean, I--

1042
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:56,618
I couldn't wait. There's no way I was--
I had to have you right then and there.

1043
00:58:56,826 --> 00:58:58,328
You know...

1044
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,705
- You know what clinched it for me'?
- What?

1045
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:02,707
Because you were so smooth.

1046
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,793
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1047
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:09,756
- Well, that's-- I just--
- But, you know, I--

1048
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:13,426
I don't want you to think I'm just easy,
because I'm not.

1049
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:16,638
No, I-- You know what I think?
You're a fun-loving person.

1050
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:18,097
- I am.
- That's-- Yeah.

1051
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,807
- Yeah.
- And that's what I am.

1052
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:21,476
- I can see that.
- That's--

1053
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,436
- I'm easygoing by nature.
- Yeah.

1054
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:26,356
That's what I--
I bring music to people's lives.

1055
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:28,650
You're very sweet, you know?

1056
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,778
I never had a sweet guy before.

1057
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,279
- I hope I--
- Never.

1058
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:36,574
I hope I didn't get you in trouble
with your boyfriend.

1059
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:40,119
No. You know, it's not like
we're engaged, so...

1060
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:44,165
- You know, I'm free. I'm free.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1061
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:47,001
Oh, God, I'd better get back.

1062
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,711
My lunch hour's almost over.

1063
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,297
But we-- You know what?
We have time, though.

1064
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:53,800
- For what?
- Let's go in the back seat.

1065
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,426
- Again?
- Yeah, come on.

1066
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,512
- Jesus, what are you?
- It's just...

1067
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,057
- Are you one of those sex addicts?
- I am for you. Come on.

1068
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:03,017
- Are you? I thought so.
- One more.

1069
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:04,978
Nobody's around. Not many people.

1070
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:09,023
- We gotta make this quick.
- I got tinted windows. It's perfect.

1071
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,661
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty.

1072
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,456
- My turn. It's my turn!
- God, he told me he'd call me yesterday.

1073
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:26,833
I wanna play with it!

1074
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:30,169
Can't you two stop fighting
for a second?

1075
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:33,381
- I've got a throbbing headache.
- You gave him both here...

1076
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:36,759
...and your cell number?
- Of course I gave him both numbers.

1077
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:39,345
Unless he's been delayed
in Washington.

1078
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:43,308
- Still, he could have phoned.
- Don't think he figured you were lying...

1079
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:46,811
...and bailed out?
- Look, could you stop saying I was lying?

1080
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,274
God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few
facts, omitted a few unpleasant details...

1081
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:54,652
...but in the main, I mean,
my feelings, my ideas, my humor--

1082
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:57,989
I mean, isn't that who I am? Christ.

1083
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:01,743
People reinvent themselves, don't they?
Do I have your permission?

1084
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:04,495
You better take more of those pills.
You're shot.

1085
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,706
Oh, Jesus. Would you please--?

1086
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:12,503
Matthew, turn off that pounding.
Please, Matthew.

1087
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:15,131
Can't stand it.

1088
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,217
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

1089
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,970
- Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?
- Who says?

1090
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,182
I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.

1091
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,726
- So?
- So you were dancing with a guy.

1092
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:30,355
- So what?
- I asked her to come with me, okay?

1093
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:33,900
I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1094
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,778
Is that so? So the two of you
were in the corner...

1095
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:39,113
...playing kissy-face.
- Give me a break.

1096
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:42,658
We couldn't go to the ballpark
because you weren't feeling good.

1097
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:46,287
Hey, don't treat me like property.
I had a headache when you called.

1098
01:01:46,496 --> 01:01:49,415
And then I decided
to keep my sister company at a party.

1099
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:50,750
I don't buy that.

1100
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,086
Since when am I taking orders
from you?

1101
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,213
Can you please not fight in here?

1102
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:59,175
I don't think I can take it. For some
reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.

1103
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:01,552
Who's this guy
you're fooling around with?

1104
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:05,014
I told you, I didn't like you rushing me
into anything, okay?

1105
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:07,809
- Is seeing other guys her idea?
- No, it's my idea.

1106
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:11,854
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a bum
like your first husband, right?

1107
01:02:12,063 --> 01:02:13,940
- You told me.
- Guys, give me a break.

1108
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:17,235
- By all rights, I should be living here.
- What do you mean?

1109
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,487
Didn't you want a guy here
for the kids?

1110
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:22,615
- So they grow up with a father?
- I need to clear my head.

1111
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:26,577
We're talking about getting married.
Now she's taking you to parties...

1112
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,247
...and telling you
I'm not good enough for you.

1113
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:31,582
- If I catch you...
- Give her some space.

1114
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,459
-...With somebody else--
- Get out!

1115
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:36,921
You keep out of this, okay?
It's got nothing to do with you.

1116
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,758
You beat it, Chili. You've been drinking.
Hey, maybe that's for you.

1117
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,804
Ginger, she's not somebody
you can count on. I am.

1118
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:48,850
Don't pick it up. I don't want him to think
I'm waiting for him to call.

1119
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,893
- What the hell's going on?
- It's Al.

1120
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:53,479
- Hey, give me that.
- That's the guy, Al.

1121
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,816
- Hi. Yeah, but you're calling at a-- Get off!
- Give me that.

1122
01:02:57,024 --> 01:03:00,528
You call here again, I'm gonna bust you
in your fat fucking face!

1123
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:04,740
- Hello. No! No!
- Give me that. Give me that.

1124
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:10,621
Look what you did,
you drunken asshole!

1125
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,291
You were right,
he's no better than Augie!

1126
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,043
- Don't drag her to parties to meet men.
- Get out!

1127
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:19,380
I didn't drag her out to meet men,
but if she has a brain...

1128
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:23,426
...she'll dump you in the garbage
and find someone she deserves for once.

1129
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:25,428
- When are you moving out?
- Get out!

1130
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:29,515
I'm sorry I don't come from Park Avenue,
but I don't steal people's money.

1131
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:33,936
- I am not some lying jailbird.
- Get out or I'll call the cops, okay?

1132
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:36,522
She doesn't care about you.
She's a phony.

1133
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,733
- She didn't care about you...
- Get out!

1134
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,194
-...Until she fucking needed you!
- Get out!

1135
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,250
- That's my cell phone.
- Okay.

1136
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:03,090
Where is it?
Oh, God, the kids were playing with it.

1137
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:06,636
Oh, where is my goddamned
cell phone?

1138
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,765
Hello? Dwight?

1139
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:15,144
Yes, can you just hang on a moment?
I'm just in the middle of something.

1140
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,151
Hello, how are you?

1141
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,613
No, no, no, it's just some business
I had to attend to.

1142
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,952
Oh, no, no. No, that's fine.

1143
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:34,914
I know how hectic things can get
in the nation's capital.

1144
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,127
When?

1145
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:50,096
Well, I'm actually meeting a client
for a drink in the Fairmont...

1146
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,890
...so why don't you pick me up
in the lounge?

1147
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:55,685
Great.

1148
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,187
No, no, no, 3 is perfect.

1149
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,314
Okay, bye-bv@-

1150
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:14,120
- I'd like to make this wall a little higher.
- Oh, well, it's lovely.

1151
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,830
I knew you'd like it.

1152
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,833
Oh, and the garden is so established.

1153
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,043
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's all right.

1154
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:23,963
The porch is so charming.
I can see why you love it.

1155
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:28,342
- I have to get someone to take care of it.
- The orchids, oh.

1156
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:32,597
Oh, this...

1157
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,307
- This is spectacular.
- Right?

1158
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:38,311
- I think it's incredibly cheerful.
- Oh, look at the ﬂow, and the light.

1159
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:40,980
- I mean, it--
- It goes a ways that way as well.

1160
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,649
- I have a million ideas immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1161
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:46,986
Oh, the fireplace. Reminds me
of those places in the Hamptons.

1162
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,780
- So delightful.
- You've done work in the Hamptons?

1163
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,657
- We have friends out there.
- Yes.

1164
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:55,244
- All right.
- Yes, I've done a number of...

1165
01:05:55,453 --> 01:05:56,495
...beach houses.

1166
01:05:56,704 --> 01:05:58,456
Let me show you the view.

1167
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,292
Well, I can see--

1168
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,086
- Oh, my God, it's enormous.
- Right?

1169
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:07,715
I had no I-- You could have
3- or 400 people out here.

1170
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,718
- I don't have that many friends, but sure.
- Look at--

1171
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:13,387
The view, it's just breathtaking.

1172
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:15,973
Andrea and I used to do
a lot of entertaining.

1173
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,975
I bet you did, living in New York.

1174
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:21,187
Well, now you're talking
about my specialty.

1175
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,440
You know, I gave the best
dinner parties in the city.

1176
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:29,904
Come here.

1177
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:36,911
I'm shocked.

1178
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,746
Qh, yeah?

1179
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:42,291
What's your reaction, really?

1180
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,959
Well, my reaction is...

1181
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,629
...you can do it again if you like.
- Oh, yeah?

1182
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,390
I've always wanted a canopy bed.
Look at this.

1183
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,976
- Yeah, that looks interesting.
- It is, right?

1184
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:44,311
Is that mid-19th century?

1185
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,149
- I have no idea.
- Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

1186
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:52,111
I do-- I love the posts,
but these beds, they're just--

1187
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,071
Well, they're not very wide.

1188
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,325
- Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.
- Oh, Dwight.

1189
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:02,913
We could do the top
in a muslin or linen--

1190
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:06,041
- Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.
- Well, it's not--

1191
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,753
You know, last night
when we were making love...

1192
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,172
...I realized how removed
from the world...

1193
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:15,050
...I've been since Andrea died.
- I know, I know. I...

1194
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,637
I think when something's right,
youjustu.

1195
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:22,099
- You know it immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1196
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,080
Do you--? Do you hear that?

1197
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,249
- Can you hear the bass, though?
- Yeah.

1198
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:50,586
Like, the bass
and then the high-end definition.

1199
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:52,963
I'm definitely gonna get one. Yup.

1200
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:55,341
- I'm giving you this one.
- No, you're not.

1201
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,718
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, my God.

1202
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,720
- Come here.
- You're so sweet.

1203
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:02,181
- You're sweet.
- You're sweet.

1204
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,726
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1205
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:06,977
Isn't this dancing?

1206
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,647
Yeah, this is slow dancing,
which is really...

1207
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:13,150
- What?
- Well, it's the key, I always say...

1208
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,527
...to good lovemaking.

1209
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:16,403
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1210
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:21,033
- Where do you think Mom is tonight?
- Oh, she's got a date tonight.

1211
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:23,369
- Oh, that's cool.
- I wonder where she is.

1212
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,330
Well, I don't think
she's at Chuck E. Cheese.

1213
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:29,500
I'm gonna babysit you.
I'm a good babysitter.

1214
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,085
- Yeah.
- You know?

1215
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:34,421
You should babysit.
I used to babysit when I was a teenager.

1216
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,215
It's how you make extra money.

1217
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:39,426
Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

1218
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:44,098
Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

1219
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:48,519
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

1220
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:52,648
"Blue Moon" was the song that was
playing. You know the song "Blue Moon."

1221
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:56,110
Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

1222
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,863
You know, I had energy.

1223
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:02,283
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

1224
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,785
You know, I ran charities
for poor people...

1225
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:08,205
...and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

1226
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:11,500
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

1227
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:16,422
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

1228
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,092
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

1229
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,386
Tip big, boys.

1230
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:27,725
Tip big, because you get good service
and they count on tips.

1231
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:31,145
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth...

1232
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,355
...you must remember to be generous.

1233
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:36,775
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

1234
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:38,986
Yeah, and then you talked to yourself.

1235
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:44,033
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand...

1236
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:47,620
...until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

1237
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:53,292
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself...

1238
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,295
...and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

1239
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,255
Why Edison?

1240
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:02,468
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

1241
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,388
See, everything unraveled so quickly.

1242
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:10,267
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia...

1243
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:12,478
...and this acute fear of death.

1244
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:16,690
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

1245
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:19,985
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

1246
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:23,364
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

1247
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:28,327
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect...

1248
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:32,539
...that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

1249
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:35,125
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot...

1250
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:39,046
...not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true.

1251
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,132
But a cheat is a cheat.

1252
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:46,679
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

1253
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:50,057
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

1254
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,477
But that's all history, boys.

1255
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:56,939
I met someone. I'm a new person.

1256
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,028
- Get everything?
- Yes. These in the kitchen?

1257
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:06,699
- Sure.
- I can't believe how much you paid for it.

1258
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,159
I know it's ridiculous and it's old.

1259
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,286
God knows if it even works.

1260
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:16,375
- We have the terrace for a telescope.
- Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.

1261
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:19,044
And the moon will look incredible
through it.

1262
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:22,006
- Ever seen the moon through that?
- Oh, I can imagine.

1263
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:25,759
Hey, can I ask you something?

1264
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,262
- Sure.
- You ever think...

1265
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,764
...you could see yourself
married to me?

1266
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:33,726
Married?

1267
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:38,981
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

1268
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:42,568
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

1269
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,696
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

1270
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,907
And you can have all the chocolate cake
and wine you want.

1271
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:55,039
And then we come back and I get serious
about my political dream.

1272
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:57,833
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house...

1273
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,545
...that you're gonna do
such a fantastic job making beautiful.

1274
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:06,967
What do you think? Downside for you
is you have to stand next to me...

1275
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,220
...and smile at photo ops when
I throw my hat in the ring.

1276
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:14,016
- So you're saying you love me.
- Can't you tell?

1277
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:18,145
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

1278
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:21,356
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

1279
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:23,942
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

1280
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:28,697
- I'll admit, my heart's beating a little fast.
- Yeah, your hands are shaking.

1281
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,658
I wanted you to want me
and now you do.

1282
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:36,789
Thank you so much.

1283
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:40,793
Have a nice day. You got it'?
Okay, I'll take that.

1284
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:44,046
- What are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.

1285
01:13:44,296 --> 01:13:47,257
- I told you not to bother me.
- You're sleeping with Al.

1286
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:49,468
You're not gonna make a fool
out of me.

1287
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,596
Chili, this is not the place
to discuss this, okay?

1288
01:13:52,805 --> 01:13:54,473
- Sir, is there a problem?
- Sorry.

1289
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:55,891
No, there's no problem.

1290
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,478
- Ginger, Ginger, I love you.
- Ginger, what's going on?

1291
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:00,979
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1292
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:04,650
No, I just need a-- Just need a break
from everything to think.

1293
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:08,987
- All right, look, I blame this on Jasmine.
- No, she's just looking out for me.

1294
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:12,032
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?
I don't like her.

1295
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:14,618
You meant nothing to her
until she needed you.

1296
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:17,788
- I'm working, Chili.
- I'm nuts about you, Ging.

1297
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,875
I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do
all these things together, big things.

1298
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,545
What great things, huh?
You're a grease monkey.

1299
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:29,299
- And I'll be bagging groceries all my life.
- She's cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.

1300
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,677
- You told me that yourself.
- I need space.

1301
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,138
Just give me some space, okay?

1302
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:36,431
I can't sleep.

1303
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:40,269
- I'm a nervous wreck.
- Oh, for chrissake.

1304
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,813
I can't get you off of my head.

1305
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:46,316
Stop it. Will you stop crying?
There's people around.

1306
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:48,735
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

1307
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:50,070
- Oh, my God.
- I don't.

1308
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:52,656
- Stop it. Stop it, please.
- I got this, okay?

1309
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:56,118
- Would you like to sit in my office?
- No. But I appreciate it.

1310
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:58,787
Look, who's this guy, Al?

1311
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:01,456
- What does he do?
- You know what he doesn't do?

1312
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:04,710
He doesn't make scenes
where I work in public.

1313
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,921
Come on, brother.
Would you like a Kleenex?

1314
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:12,009
- I love her so much.
- It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?

1315
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,594
Great.

1316
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:22,769
Hello.

1317
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:30,402
- Hello.
- Hi.

1318
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,030
Hi.

1319
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,407
You seem up.

1320
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:39,661
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

1321
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,872
- How great.
- What's that smell?

1322
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,791
Did you break a bottle of perfume?

1323
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,794
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

1324
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:49,755
That's sweet. But if I may say...

1325
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:53,342
...you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

1326
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,678
God, I'm always nervous
it will wear off.

1327
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:59,431
He's taking me to his favorite jeweler.

1328
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,767
You think Al is a step up from Chili?

1329
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:04,728
Anybody is a step up from Chili.

1330
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:06,480
He's such a gentleman.

1331
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,608
Well, then he's definitely a step up.

1332
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:12,569
But in bed, he's no gentleman.

1333
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:15,656
Wait till he takes a whiff
of my new fragrance.

1334
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,574
It's French.

1335
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:27,084
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Yeah, I'm on my way over right now.

1336
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:30,087
- You're late.
- Oh, God.

1337
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:34,299
- I'm still shaking.
- What's the matter?

1338
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:39,012
I think Hal is having an affair.

1339
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,975
With Lisette Boudreau?

1340
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,728
Who is she?

1341
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:50,524
That French girl. The Jordans' au pair.

1342
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,694
What do you know about this?

1343
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,571
You're the only one who doesn't know.

1344
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,867
I've known about Hal's affairs for years,
but it's not my business.

1345
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:02,786
How did you find out?

1346
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:07,499
The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

1347
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,918
Hal left his Rolex there.

1348
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:13,880
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

1349
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,383
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along...

1350
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:20,846
...and I didn't know what they were talking
about, so I did some checking and...

1351
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,348
I knew this day would come.

1352
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:26,476
I'm surprised it took so long.

1353
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,688
Who else?

1354
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:34,067
Victoria Alter.

1355
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:36,820
Raylene.

1356
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:38,405
This au pair.

1357
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,366
That trainer he used to take
to baseball games.

1358
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,702
- Oh, my God.
- You know how many people...

1359
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:47,539
...have said to me he's doing his lawyer,
the Chinese dragon lady?

1360
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:50,584
- Can we get the waiter? I need a drink.
- Yes. Waiter.

1361
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:52,044
- Yes, ma'am?
- This again.

1362
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:54,212
- Right away. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

1363
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,445
Hello?

1364
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:21,073
Yeah, is Al there?

1365
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,117
Al Munsinger, yeah.

1366
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:29,915
I know he works
in the Audio Department, yeah.

1367
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:32,250
Yeah, I'll hold.

1368
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:36,922
Hello?

1369
01:18:37,464 --> 01:18:40,300
Al Munsinger, yes.

1370
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,762
Al, where the hell are you?

1371
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:45,847
What?

1372
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,684
What? I don't get it.
Why couldn't you come?

1373
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:57,109
Who found out what?

1374
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,946
Who's Ellen?

1375
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,456
Yeah, I--

1376
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:14,251
I didn't understand you had a wife.

1377
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,130
No.

1378
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:20,966
No, you never said.

1379
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,358
My mother was very impressed
with you.

1380
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,777
- Really?
- Yeah. You two had a discussion...

1381
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:43,905
...about her collection of pewter.
- Yes. I love pewter.

1382
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:47,075
Hal used to have his beer
out of a pewter mug.

1383
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:48,660
And your dad?

1384
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:52,873
My dad can be very critical sometimes,
but he was very taken with you.

1385
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:56,626
Well, don't worry,
I won't pick out too big a stone.

1386
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,254
Yeah, nothing larger
than the Hope diamond.

1387
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:01,715
Hey, Jasmine.

1388
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:05,886
What? You don't remember me?

1389
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:09,639
Of course I remember you.
What a surprise.

1390
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:12,809
Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?

1391
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,770
This is Augie. Dwight.

1392
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,814
- Dwight, hi.
- How you doing?

1393
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:19,691
I was married to her sister.

1394
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:22,110
- Okay.
- Years ago. Years.

1395
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,363
Wasn't that many years.
She makes it sound ancient.

1396
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:29,201
Congratulations. Ginger said
you got a new job up in Alaska.

1397
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:33,538
I could've had my own company
if it wasn't for you...

1398
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:37,792
...and that crook you married.
- I don't think it's the time and place.

1399
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:42,714
Oh, really? You think I wanna lay oil pipe
way the hell up there in Alaska?

1400
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:44,299
I got no money.

1401
01:20:44,508 --> 01:20:47,886
Christ, can't you put this behind you
and move on? I've moved on.

1402
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:52,265
- Take it easy. I don't know who you are--
- Right, you don't, so stay out of it.

1403
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,100
I saw your son.

1404
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,687
Yeah, that's right, Danny.
Remember him?

1405
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:02,567
Lives across the bridge in Oakland,
works at a music store. Antonio's.

1406
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:06,112
He's doing pretty good. He's married.

1407
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:09,199
I think he's finally over Hal's suicide.

1408
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:12,077
Danny's in Oakland?

1409
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:16,081
Let me tell you something,
Jeanette, Jasmine...

1410
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:19,251
...whatever it is
you call yourself these days.

1411
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:21,419
Some people...

1412
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:25,131
...they don't put things behind
so easily.

1413
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:34,891
You have a son?

1414
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:40,146
Yes, I have a son. He's not-- Biologically
he's not my son. He's my step--

1415
01:21:40,355 --> 01:21:42,649
- Hal's suicide?
- I can explain it all later.

1416
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:45,694
- Can we just--?
- Not until you tell me what's going on.

1417
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:47,737
- Not in the street.
- I want to know.

1418
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:50,615
- I know. We'll go somewhere quiet.
- Get in the car.

1419
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:53,785
- Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
- Okay.

1420
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:02,377
Of course we can't get married!
You lied to me up and down the line!

1421
01:22:02,586 --> 01:22:05,213
- No, I wanted to tell you.
- Are you delusional?

1422
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:07,340
Didn't you think I'd find out?

1423
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:10,635
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know what I was thinking.

1424
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:13,972
Everything happened in the past.
You and I loved each other.

1425
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,849
What? That it would just vanish?

1426
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:19,811
Didn't you think I would find out,
if not today, eventually?

1427
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:24,566
Like after we were married? Is that what
you wanted, to wait until it was too late?

1428
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,902
For your future plans
where you needed the appropriate wife?

1429
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:31,615
I won't say it wouldn't be an issue,
but that you could stand by...

1430
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:35,368
...deceive me until I married you--
- No, you mean till I trapped you.

1431
01:22:35,577 --> 01:22:39,831
- Your ethical behavior is equal to your ex.
- I wasn't deceiving you. I loved you.

1432
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,793
- I found out by chance, by sheer chance.
- Okay, if it's over, it's over.

1433
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:47,422
I get it. You're not marrying me.
I brought everything on myself.

1434
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:51,843
I've only got myself to blame.
I did it to myself again, as usual.

1435
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:54,679
You and your stupid
little French whore.

1436
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:58,683
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Let me out of the car.

1437
01:22:58,892 --> 01:23:01,603
- Let me out of the car.
- How are you gonna get home?

1438
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,731
I'm not going home. Let me out.
Let me out of the car!

1439
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:29,881
Hey, remember to tell her
when she gets here, okay?

1440
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,925
Believe me, she won't care.

1441
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:34,886
- She is half out the door.
- Yeah, well...

1442
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:37,055
I didn't start out not liking her.

1443
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:40,266
I think she had it in for me
from the moment she met me.

1444
01:23:41,101 --> 01:23:42,310
Well, I like you.

1445
01:23:42,519 --> 01:23:45,438
Now, that's what counts,
not how she feels about you.

1446
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:48,316
You know, I'm sick of her
calling you a loser...

1447
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:51,861
...or always pushing me
to find a better man.

1448
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:55,198
You know, in my book, you're no loser.

1449
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:58,410
You're twice the guy I met at the party
she dragged me to.

1450
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,412
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1451
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,163
- Well, I love you.
- I know.

1452
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:05,917
- I love the boys. I think they love me too.
- They do.

1453
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:10,505
- When I thought I lost you--
- You didn't lose me, baby.

1454
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:12,924
I almost lost you.

1455
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:43,371
Is this what you gave up
everything for?

1456
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,292
To sell secondhand
musical instruments?

1457
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:52,172
I asked Augie not to tell you
where I was.

1458
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:55,842
Why?

1459
01:24:57,343 --> 01:24:59,345
What happened?

1460
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:02,807
Why did you disappear like that
and never contact me?

1461
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:06,519
I couldn't find you when I needed you.

1462
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:11,983
I know the whole story, I found it out,
so don't act so surprised.

1463
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:22,869
Are you having an affair
with Lisette Boudreau?

1464
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,705
Oh, Jasmine,
I can't do this without a drink.

1465
01:25:25,914 --> 01:25:28,833
No, don't tap dance.
You never went to Chicago.

1466
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,377
You took the Jordans' au pair
to Paris.

1467
01:25:31,586 --> 01:25:33,838
I know what's been going on.

1468
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:37,801
- Can we talk about this, please?
- You bet we can talk about it.

1469
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:39,511
Can you do it calmly?

1470
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:43,348
I wanna talk to you about
what's going on, but you're always so--

1471
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:45,141
How do you expect me to react?

1472
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,852
You've been sleeping
with other women for years.

1473
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:52,106
I mean, Raylene,
your secretary, our trainer.

1474
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:54,859
- Amy.
- This is different.

1475
01:25:55,068 --> 01:25:56,945
This is serious.

1476
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:59,322
Lisette and I are in love.

1477
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:02,158
Wha--? What?

1478
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,785
Are you crazy?

1479
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:08,081
I'm sorry, but I need you to hear
what I'm saying. Lisette and I are in love.

1480
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:11,835
What does that mean?
What does that stupidity even mean?

1481
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:15,964
It means that we are making plans
for the future together.

1482
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:18,466
I'm sorry.
I'm having trouble understanding.

1483
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:22,053
I know this comes as a shock,
but I have to be honest with you.

1484
01:26:22,262 --> 01:26:25,640
You wanna be honest.
That's the biggest joke of all.

1485
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:27,976
I've had casual flirtations in the past.

1486
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:31,020
They didn't mean anything until now.
This is different.

1487
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:35,525
Are you out of your mind?
She is a teenager, for chrissake.

1488
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:38,403
She's an au pair.
I mean, are you crazy?

1489
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:43,074
- Christ, this is hard for me to tell you!
- It's hard for you? What about me?

1490
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:45,159
This is so humiliating for me.

1491
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:48,913
I mean, it is bad enough that
everyone knows you've been unfaithful.

1492
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:52,500
But to throw me away for this
stupid-looking little French--

1493
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:55,545
- I will take very good care of you.
- I'm sorry.

1494
01:26:55,753 --> 01:26:59,173
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1495
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:02,093
I don't know what I'm--
What am I doing here?

1496
01:27:02,302 --> 01:27:06,306
Oh, God, this is unacceptable.
This is not gonna happen.

1497
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:09,017
You're not going anywhere.
This is unacceptable.

1498
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,979
- Jasmine, you're having a tantrum.
- Don't you touch me!

1499
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:16,107
- Don't you touch me!
- You are having a tantrum.

1500
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,818
Stop, S'loP-

1501
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:21,738
- What am I doing here?
- Pull yourself together.

1502
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:24,282
- I can't--
- Jasmine.

1503
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:31,122
When you calm down, we can talk
like two civilized adults...

1504
01:27:31,331 --> 01:27:33,917
...about the arrangements
we have to make.

1505
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:49,557
Until then I'm gonna check into a hotel.

1506
01:27:56,981 --> 01:28:01,861
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

1507
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:18,169
Hello.
Yes, I want the number of the FBI.

1508
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,797
Can you connect me?

1509
01:28:22,382 --> 01:28:24,384
The FBI.

1510
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:27,011
- Mr. Francis?
- Yes?

1511
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,846
- Hal Francis?
- Yes.

1512
01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:32,141
I'm sorry, sir,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

1513
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:34,811
- What?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1514
01:28:35,019 --> 01:28:37,480
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No, sir.

1515
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:40,858
- It's best if you come with us now.
- Under arrest for what?

1516
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:43,653
Sir, come with us now.
We'll settle this downtown.

1517
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:46,072
- Do you have a warrant?
- I do.

1518
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:48,616
- Gonna handcuff me?
- We are.

1519
01:28:48,825 --> 01:28:52,161
- I wanna talk to my lawyer.
- You'll be able to call your lawyer.

1520
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,289
But we'll warn you,
you have the right to remain silent.

1521
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:58,292
Anything you say can be held
against you in court.

1522
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:00,378
- Okay, okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

1523
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:04,132
Jesus Christ Almighty.

1524
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:09,679
- What am I being arrested for?
- We can discuss this downtown, sir.

1525
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:17,061
As disillusioned as I was with him,
I hated you more.

1526
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:23,735
The moment I did what I did,
I regretted it.

1527
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:27,572
I don't wanna discuss it.
It's past. It's over.

1528
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,366
You can't take back that phone call.

1529
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:34,454
I need you, Danny.

1530
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:39,584
I don't wanna see you, Jasmine.
I want the past past.

1531
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:43,755
I've become a different person,
thanks to my wife. I'm off drugs.

1532
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:47,633
Just, please, don't spoil everything.

1533
01:29:47,842 --> 01:29:50,678
Just get out of my life
so I can move on.

1534
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,640
Definitely.

1535
01:29:56,684 --> 01:29:57,769
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

1536
01:29:57,977 --> 01:30:00,980
Hey, have some champagne.

1537
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:04,442
Chili brought some over to celebrate.

1538
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,694
We're back together.

1539
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:10,948
I'm sorry,
I'm not in a celebratory mood.

1540
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:14,368
I don't think I'd find that news
anything to celebrate about.

1541
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:17,580
Hey, come on, Jasmine,
let's not dig at each other, okay?

1542
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:20,666
I'm moving in, and she tells me
you found a rich husband.

1543
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:23,377
- Gonna be a big shot in Washington.
- We made up.

1544
01:30:23,586 --> 01:30:27,799
- Yeah, she begged for my forgiveness.
- And he cried like a baby and apologized.

1545
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:32,929
- I didn't cry.
- Bullshit. You cry all the time.

1546
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:35,306
But we're moving in.

1547
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:39,393
It's something we planned for a long time
and maybe if we'd just done it--

1548
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:42,105
Oh, for chrissake.

1549
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:44,774
What's wrong with your self-esteem?

1550
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:48,986
There's men who'd never think
about ripping the phone out of the wall.

1551
01:30:49,195 --> 01:30:52,740
Hey, leave him alone.
You're always picking on him.

1552
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:54,867
No, you choose losers, okay?

1553
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:57,370
Because that's what you think
you deserve.

1554
01:30:57,578 --> 01:31:01,958
That's why you're living like this and
that's why you'll never have a better life.

1555
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,377
I'm-- I'm living--

1556
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:10,341
I'm living like this because
you married the biggest loser of all...

1557
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,844
...and went your own sweet way...

1558
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:18,599
...while he pissed away my
one big chance to make a better life.

1559
01:31:18,808 --> 01:31:21,310
Come on, let's not ruin
our celebration, okay?

1560
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:25,189
Come on, she's happy, we're happy.
Let's let sleeping dogs lie.

1561
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:28,860
He's right. I'm not gonna be drawn
into defending myself...

1562
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:32,905
...when all I wanted to do
was bring you in on a good deal.

1563
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:38,035
I'm moving out of this place today.

1564
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:40,705
I just gotta get myself together.

1565
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:45,418
Dwight asked me to move in with him,
as I expected he would.

1566
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,795
He wants me to finish
decorating his home.

1567
01:31:48,004 --> 01:31:50,548
Then we'll marry
and we'll move in together.

1568
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:53,676
He's one of these men
who's lost without a woman.

1569
01:31:53,885 --> 01:31:56,888
It has to be the right woman,
who's a plus for his career.

1570
01:31:57,096 --> 01:32:01,517
And I have the social skills required
for his future in politics.

1571
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:05,897
For the next few years,
we'll be living in Vienna.

1572
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:09,567
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a shower.

1573
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,611
I'll send for my luggage.

1574
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:19,577
I was pretty angry at some of the things
she said, but I kept it on the inside.

1575
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:25,625
I'm tired of her knocking you.
You know?

1576
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:36,844
Don't even think about taking
that last slice of pizza.

1577
01:32:37,053 --> 01:32:40,640
- What? Why?
- That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.

1578
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:43,226
- Is it really?
- Last slice belongs to the man.

1579
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:46,729
- You're putting too much on the hips.
- Is that so?

1580
01:32:46,938 --> 01:32:49,941
- Yeah, if you wanna keep me around--
- This slice is yours?

1581
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:55,863
- Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.
- Is this yours? Is this yours?

1582
01:32:56,072 --> 01:32:58,324
That slice of pizza is mine.

1583
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:01,244
- That's mine.
- Yeah.

1584
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:03,579
That's mine. That's mine.

1585
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:06,582
Oh, that's mine.
Those are definitely mine.

1586
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:10,378
Is that yours? Yeah?

1587
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:14,507
Yeah, that's yours, okay.

1588
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:35,695
It's fraught with peril.

1589
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,573
They gossip, you know, they talk.

1590
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,536
I saw Danny.

1591
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,122
Yes, did I tell you?

1592
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,583
He's getting married.

1593
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:55,172
A weekend in Palm Beach
means I can wear...

1594
01:33:55,381 --> 01:34:00,344
What could I wear? I can wear
the Dior dress I bought in Paris.

1595
01:34:01,387 --> 01:34:04,390
Yes, my black dress.

1596
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:07,727
Well, Hal always used to surprise me
with jewelry.

1597
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:10,771
Extravagant pieces.

1598
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,150
I think he used to buy them at auction.

1599
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:19,280
It's so obvious what you're doing.

1600
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:22,199
You think I don't know.

1601
01:34:22,742 --> 01:34:25,077
French au pair.

1602
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,960
This was playing on the Vineyard.

1603
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:37,882
"Blue Moon."

1604
01:34:41,385 --> 01:34:43,971
I used to know the words.

1605
01:34:45,931 --> 01:34:48,309
I knew the words.

1606
01:34:50,603 --> 01:34:53,064
Now they're all a jumble.
