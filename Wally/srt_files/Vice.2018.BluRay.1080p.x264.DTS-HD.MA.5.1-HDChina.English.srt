00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,190
or I'm gone.

178
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,691
I know a dozen guys

179
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,443
and a few professors at school
who would date me.

180
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,654
I love you, Lynne.

181
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,822
Then prove it!

182
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,616
Prove it!

183
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,662
I can't...

184
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,332
go to a big Ivy League school,

185
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,168
and I can't run a company
or be mayor.

186
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,587
That's just the way
the world is for a girl.

187
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,630
I need you.

188
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:37,095
And right now you are
a big, fat, piss-soaked zero.

189
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,019
I've... I've seen my mom
waitin' up all night

190
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,271
for my father to get home.

191
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,023
And I've seen my father
drunk in this house

192
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,109
and raising his voice and way worse,

193
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,279
and I am not dancing
that dance anymore. I'm not.

194
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,947
Do you know why I fuck her?

195
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,243
(inaudible dialogue)

196
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,038
I'm not.

197
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,666
So can you change?

198
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,920
Can you change,
or am I wasting my goddamn time?

199
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,555
CHENEY: <i>I won't ever
disappoint you again, Lynne.</i>

200
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,059
(stream flowing gently)

201
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,792
(cattle mooing)

202
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,923
(inaudible dialogue)

203
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,641
(muffled cheering)

204
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,729
(congressman speaking indistinctly)

205
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,649
CONGRESSMAN: You were chosen
because of your hard work,

206
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,651
your diligence,
and dedication.

207
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:02,073
Stated simply, you are
America's best and brightest.

208
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,658
(coughing)

209
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,661
(clears throat)

210
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,415
So let's go forward and learn
and be of service.

211
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,334
God bless you all

212
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,839
and God bless this great nation.

213
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,135
And now, I'd like to introduce some...
a young man from Illinois

214
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,886
who has done quite well for himself

215
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,305
here in the Capitol.

216
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,058
Representative Donald Rumsfeld.

217
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,436
(scattered applause)

218
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,607
(high-pitched feedback)

219
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:42,363
Did Bob tell you that this
internship is a great honor?

220
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,656
Huh?

221
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,409
- Did he?
- (interns murmuring)

222
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,618
Huh? Yeah?

223
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,247
Well, it's not.

224
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,917
It's what we called in the Navy
a "shit detail."

225
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,544
(all laughing)

226
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,212
NARRATOR:
<i>Donald Rumsfeld,</i>

227
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>or "Rummy,"
as they called him,</i>

228
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,427
<i>was the former captain of
the Princeton wrestling team</i>

229
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,180
<i>and an elite navy jet pilot.</i>

230
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,142
<i>Most congressmen
use their power like an axe.</i>

231
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,643
Best and brightest.

232
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,813
NARRATOR: <i>Rumsfeld,
on the other hand, used his...</i>

233
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,898
Where?

234
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,735
NARRATOR: <i>...like a master
of the butterfly knife.</i>

235
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,404
<i>And, like any master,
if you got in his way,</i>

236
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,073
<i>- he would cut you.</i>
- (grunts)

237
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,491
(all laughing)

238
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,910
This can be a great opportunity.

239
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,079
An opportunity to work

240
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,165
in the hallways of decision-making

241
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,126
in the most powerful country
in the goddamn world.

242
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,587
And if that doesn't give you a hard-on,

243
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,214
- I don't know what will.
- (all laughing)

244
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,134
Sorry to the few ladies in the room.

245
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,012
This program didn't used to have girls,
and now it does.

246
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,098
- Anyway, I'm Don.
- (chuckles)

247
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,307
Whatever you do...

248
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,686
don't work for Bob over here.

249
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,481
He is the most boring
son of a bitch in D.C.

250
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,649
Isn't that right, Bob?

251
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,193
All right, that's it.

252
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,445
Go get a congressman
a cup of coffee.

253
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,031
And if his wife calls,
he's always in a meeting.

254
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,409
All right, that's it. Scat.

255
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,494
(applause)

256
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,039
Hey, I'm Alan.

257
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,374
You're the other guy from the University

258
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,042
- of Wisconsin, right?
- Right.

259
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,420
Uh, so one of us is supposed to start

260
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,296
with a Democrat
and the other a Republican.

261
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,590
Do you care
if I go with the Dem?

262
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,135
'Cause I did a lot of work
with the DNC on campus, so...

263
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:32,265
Um, what party is,
uh, the guy we just heard?

264
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,559
Well, there are three penises
walking down the street.

265
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,018
Yeah, you,
and who are the other two?

266
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,021
Rumsfeld is a Republican.

267
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,109
Perfect. 'Cause, uh...

268
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,112
that's what I am.

269
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,830
(knocking on door)

270
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,003
RUMSFELD: Don't lurk.
Come in, damn it.

271
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,842
Um, Dick Cheney,
reporting for work.

272
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,343
You're congressional relations

273
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,387
for my Office of Economic Opportunity,

274
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,347
and you will assist me in my job

275
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,724
as counselor to the president.

276
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,768
Right.

277
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,521
Jesus Christ, you want me

278
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,898
to pin your mittens to your sleeves

279
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,940
so you don't fuckin' lose 'em?

280
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,150
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,237
Oh, and Cheney, your two DUIs
came up on your transcript.

282
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,780
Don't worry.
I vouched for you.

283
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,199
Thank you, sir.

284
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,783
No, thanks are when your neighbor Dottie

285
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,577
pulls your pud for the first time.

286
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,538
You owe me.

287
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,123
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

288
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,795
The first thing our department did

289
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,049
was to conduct a sweeping audit

290
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,969
at the population distribution
across the nation.

291
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,763
You will see that

292
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,098
the Office of Economic
Opportunity benefits...

293
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,267
You're Rumsfeld's lackey, right?

294
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,852
Make sure he sees this.

295
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,729
We gotta get that
on Nixon's desk, huh?

296
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,899
NARRATOR: <i>Roger Ailes,
founder of Fox News.</i>

297
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,610
<i>He first pitched the idea
as Conservative News</i>

298
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,196
<i>when he worked for Nixon
as a media consultant.</i>

299
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,240
CHENEY:
Hey, Don.

300
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,825
Roger wants Nixon to start
a Republican news TV network.

301
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,454
Forget it. Roger knows TV,
but he doesn't know politics.

302
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,998
So I would do this flaming baton trick

303
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,252
And Dick would wait backstage
with a bucket of water.

304
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,586
So I'm at the state finals,

305
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,672
and I throw up the baton, and...

306
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,006
it doesn't come down.

307
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,716
(laughter)

308
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,761
Cheney! Oh.
Where did you find her?

309
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,555
RUMSFELD:
It is doing nothing but damage

310
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,307
to our private health care institutions.

311
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,560
- But I still got second place.
- (Rumsfeld laughs)

312
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,478
RUMSFELD: White families. Males.

313
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,480
Women. Hispanics. Minorities...

314
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,940
You're quiet. I like that.

315
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,944
You don't go blabbing about
what cards you have.

316
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,530
I missed my flush draw
about a month ago,

317
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,325
but everybody still seems
to think I have pocket kings

318
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,868
except maybe fucking Haldeman.

319
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,413
Oh, I mostly play Hearts,
so I'm not...

320
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,248
No, no, no.

321
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,125
NARRATOR:
<i>For a man like Donald Rumsfeld,</i>

322
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,962
<i>he only wanted three things
from his lackey.</i>

323
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,256
<i>He had to keep his mouth shut.</i>

324
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>Do what he was told.</i>

325
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,014
<i>And always, always be loyal.</i>

326
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,724
What it means is Nixon likes me,

327
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,891
but his circle hates me.

328
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,101
No, I'm sure that's not true.

329
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,853
So, what's it gonna be?

330
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,688
Is it a "yes" or a "no"?

331
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,565
It's a "yes."

332
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,358
You don't even know
what the question is, do you?

333
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,945
- I'm assuming it's to...
- No, no, no. It's okay.

334
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,780
That's exactly the kinda "yes"
I was looking for.

335
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,783
NARRATOR: <i>Cheney had always
been a so-so student</i>

336
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,535
<i>and a mediocre athlete.</i>

337
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>But now, finally, he had found
his life's calling.</i>

338
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:49,670
<i>He would be a dedicated
and humble servant to power.</i>

339
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,755
MAN: Here's your new office.

340
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,132
No windows, but all you'd see

341
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,259
are a bunch of hippies
flipping off Nixon.

342
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,054
All right, then.

343
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,060
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, at this point,</i>

344
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,605
<i>you're probably wondering
who exactly I am.</i>

345
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,733
<i>Well, let me introduce myself.</i>

346
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,360
My name is Kurt.

347
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,446
<i>My favorite football team
is the Steelers,</i>

348
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>and me and my son,
we love SpongeBob.</i>

349
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,785
<i>And if you're wondering how I know</i>

350
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,371

we're kind of related.</i>

352
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,751

The Rifleman!

00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,176
(telephone ringing)

356
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,222
- Hello?
- CHENEY: Lynnie,

357
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,015
guess where I'm calling from.

358

<i>(Lynne exhales)</i>

359
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,062
I am so proud of you
right now, Dick Cheney.

360
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,941
<i>I knew I picked the right man.
I knew it even when I didn't.</i>

361
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,778
- We did it.
<i>- (Lynne laughs)</i>

362
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,031
Have you seen Nixon? Hmm?

363
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,409
- (baby coos)
- Hmm? Hmm?

364
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,953
I did. I met him.
I shook his hand.

365
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,164
Oh, my gosh. (stammers)
And he called you

366
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,958
- He gave me that, uh...
<i>- By name, like he actually...</i>

367
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,751
...that impish smile of his.

368
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,546
<i>I gotta pinch myself.</i>

369
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,381
(baby fussing)

370
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,007
Pardon my French.

371
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:21,095
It is the best fucking feeling
in the world.

372
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,348
(gasps) I can only imagine.
I am so proud of you.

373
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,600
- I love you.
<i>- We are proud of you.</i>

374
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,436
Your girls are proud of you.
Are you proud of your daddy?

375
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,062
Yes.

376
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,856
<i>Can you say you're proud
of your daddy?</i>

377
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,274
LIZ: <i>My daddy.</i>

378
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,567
LYNNE:
<i>You're proud of your daddy.</i>

379
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,277

382
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,172
Dick Cheney's office.

383
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,675
So, now that I'm not just flipping cards,

384
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,177
I have a few ideas.

385
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,219
Stop.

386
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,180
See that door?

387
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,308
To Kissinger's office?

388
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,267
That's right.

389
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,103
I happen to know that Nixon
is in there right now.

390
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,813
Now, why would Nixon

391
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,857
not be meeting Kissinger
in the Oval Office?

392
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,066
CHENEY:
He's having a conversation

393
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,359
he doesn't want to go
on the record?

394
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,903
Very good.

395
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,404
What is the conversation?

396
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,907
We're going to bomb Cambodia.

397
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,617
CHENEY:
Well, that's impossible.

398
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,202
That needs approval
by Congress.

399
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,828
I'm over there every day.

400
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,830
Oh, fuck Congress.
Unless you're in it.

401
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,374
Then it's the greatest
deliberative body on earth.

402
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,168
But we're not, so fuck it.

403
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,045
But didn't the president
campaign on ending the...

404
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,963
(shushing)
Listen to me, listen to me.

405
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,966
Because of the discussion

406
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,760
that Nixon and Kissinger
are having right now

407
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,678
behind that door

408
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,472
five feet away from us,

409
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,141
in a couple of days,
10,000 miles away,

410
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,685

415

(woman speaking in foreign language)

417
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,708
That is the kind of power that exists

418
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,669
in this squat little ugly building.

419
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,257
Screw Kissinger.
He's overrated. Let's go.

420
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,717
(woman speaking in foreign language)

421
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,556
CHENEY: <i>So, what are we...</i>

422
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,058
- Um, you know, I mean...
- Spit it out.

423
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,977
- What are you trying to say?
- Are we against spending?

424
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,019
What do we believe?

425
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,438
What do we believe?

(laughing)

429
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,993
"What do we believe?"

430
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,162
Oh. That's very good.

431
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,747
"What do we believe?"

432
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,458
(continues laughing)

433
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,257
Oh, shit!

434
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,766
CHENEY:
Like that, through there.

435
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,476
- You wanna try?
- LIZ: Yeah.

436
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,228
CHENEY: You find out
what the fish want.

437
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,439
In this case, it's a worm.

438
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,442
And then, uh,
we use it to catch him.

439
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,526
Look it. Look it.

440
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,236
Dada. Dada, look.

441
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,613
The family gets to eat.

442
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,324
Is it a good trick
we're playing, for the worms?

443
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,368
It's not good or bad.
It's fishing.

444
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,038
I don't want this one hurt.

445
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,748
KURT:
<i>Dick had taken a job</i>

446

00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,420

448
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>He took the job

I'm out.

They're sending me to Brussels.

CHENEY: What?

453
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,311
Nixon is making me
permanent ambassador to NATO.

KURT:
<i>Or as he called it...</i>

455
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,397
It's a fuck-off assignment.

00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,690
Kissinger and Haldeman won.

<i>Why don't you come with me?</i>

458
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,071
I got a four and a seven-year-old, Don.

00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,822
Tell Don we are not moving

460
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,033
just because everyone
at the White House hates him.

461
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,368
- (thumps table)
- Good boy!

462
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,536
I taught you well these past
couple of years.

463
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,788
I'm sorry, Don.

You'll have to burn the mattress

WOLFOWITZ:
Well, Mr. Vice President,

536
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,377
there's been some chatter
about, uh, uh...

537
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,047
an engineering student
from Berlin...

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,549
NIXON:
<i>I have never been a quitter.</i>

539
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,969
<i>To leave office before
my term is completed</i>

540
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,889

00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,976
<i>But as president...</i>

542
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,313
<i>I must put the interests of America first.</i>

543

<i>America needs a full-time president.</i>

544
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,446
Nixon forgot about
the voice-activated recorders.

545
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,241
He got sloppy.

546
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,034
LIZ: Is the president being punished?

547
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,787
No, no. The president has

Brussels, please.
(clears throat)

549

You remember that.

Donald Rumsfeld, please.

556
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,390
This is a tragedy.

That is our president.

558
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,351
This is ridiculous.

559

very, very good news.

any Republican not touched

00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,536
Nice. Well, Ford called me
before my plane took off,

563
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,662

<i>The GOP is a party in disarray.</i>

700
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>Clearly, Watergate,
the Vietnam War...</i>

701
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,644
REPORTER 3:
<i>President Carter went up</i>

702
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,187
<i>on the roof of the White House today</i>

703
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,356
<i>to show off the new
solar water heaters</i>

704
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,815
<i>installed there.</i>

705
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,525
CARTER:
<i>Today, in directly harnessing</i>

706
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,943
<i>the power of the sun,
we are taking</i>

707
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,279
<i>the energy that God gave us,</i>

708
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,116
<i>the most renewable energy
that we will ever see,</i>

709
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,535
<i>and using it to replace
our dwindling supplies</i>

710
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,037
<i>of fossil fuels.</i>

711
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,873
<i>There is no longer any question</i>

712
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,250
<i>that solar energy</i>

713
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,671
<i>is both feasible and also cost-effective.</i>

714
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,068
CHENEY: <i>...went on to be
Secretary of Defense.</i>

715
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,987
<i>AI Haig, who became Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe,</i>

716
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,199
<i>and, uh, Bob Haldeman,
who is doing time</i>

717
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,576
<i>in a California penitentiary.</i>

718
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,078
Well, not me. Not me, sir.

719
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,623
I... I will become
the gentleman from Wyoming.

720
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,084
Most of all, and hear this,

721
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,420
uh, taxes must go down.

722
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,463
I'll say it again,
taxes must go down.

723
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,507
- Talk. Talk.
- CHENEY: We must ameliorate

724
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,509
the pain of taxes
for the working man

725
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,553
and bring, uh...
(clears throat)

726
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,180
perspicacity to the fore.

727
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:08,059
I'm as much a Wyomingite,
our, uh, demonym...

728
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,103
MAN: Blah, blah, blah.

729
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,313
Thank God for name recognition.

730
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,982
CHENEY: ...as Jedediah Smith.

731
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,067
Well, um, enough
of the horsing around.

732
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,654
Although that is, of course,
what, uh, us cowboys do.

733
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,780
Um...

734
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,326
Uh, vote for Cheney for Congress.

735
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,079
I will not let you down,
you can count on me.

736
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,664
And, uh, thank you.

737
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:34,002
Vote for, uh, Cheney in Congress.

738
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,837
(scattered applause)

739
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,589
Either he drinks next time or I do.

740
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,134
CHENEY: Yeah...

741
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,761
I don't want anyone to panic,

742
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,849
but, uh, I do believe
I have to go to the hospital.

743
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,268
Now.

744
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,608
(EKG beeping)

745
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,490
DOCTOR: It's an inferior wall infarct.

746
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,867
But that... that can be fixed, right?

747
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,994
If it was up to me,

748
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,412
you'd drop out of the election.

749
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,624
But you've both made that clear

750
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,417
that it's not an option,

751
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,796
so you must have a minimum
of two weeks bed rest.

752
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,089
Two weeks off,
we'll lose our lead.

753
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,382
Like hell we will.

754
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,718
MAYOR:
<i>Dick Cheney has an illness,</i>

755
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,970
<i>so he can't be here today.</i>

756
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,599
But we got his wife,
and she's a darn pretty girl.

757
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,185
- Lynne Cheney!
- (applause)

758
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,187
(crowd whistling)

759
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,688
- Hello...
- (feedback)

760
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,857
Hello, how are you today?

761
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,234
Good, good, good to hear.

762
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,321
Uh, it's really nice to be back
in my home state.

763
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,950
See, I grew up in Wyoming,
but it seems that, uh,

764
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,118
somewhere along the line,

765
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,037
Washington, D.C. stopped listening

766
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,956
to real folks like us

767
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,543
and started only listening
to liberal snobs

768
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,503
who want us all to lose our jobs

769
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,171
to affirmative action.

770
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,256
MAN: Mm-hmm.

771
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,842
Okay, Lynne. Let's...

772
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,343
(applause and cheering)

773
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,511
LYNNE:
That's right.

774
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,640
You know,
I went to New York City.

775
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,268
Women in New York City
are burning their bras.

776
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,103
(chuckles)

777
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,313
Well, you know what women
in Wyoming do with our bras?

778
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,524
We wear them.

779
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,735
- (crowd cheering)
- LYNNE: <i>We wear them.</i>

780
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,987
Here in Wyoming,

781
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,905
we believe there is
a right and a wrong...

782
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,742
Because I'm a mom
and a wife from Wyoming

783
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,288
and I know how it feels
to make every penny count.

784
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>And not only do I speak for you,</i>

785
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>but my husband, Dick Cheney...</i>

786
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,043
KURT:
<i>A hard wind of change</i>

787
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,045
<i>had been blowing through America.</i>

788
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,757
<i>Civil rights,</i> Roe v. Wade,
<i>environmentalism,</i>

789
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,176
<i>but there was a part of the country</i>

790
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,262
<i>that was angry about this change.</i>

791
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:54,100
Thanks to my amazing wife.

792
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,897
It's good to be joining you all
here in D.C.

793
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,232
as Wyoming's sole
congressional representative.

794
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,361
KURT:
<i>And then, big money families</i>

795
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,405
<i>like the Kochs and the Coors</i>

796
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,074
<i>that were sick of paying income taxes</i>

797
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,410
<i>rolled right into Washington, D.C.</i>

798
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,163
<i>and started writing fat checks</i>

799
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,748
<i>to fund right-wing think tanks...</i>

800
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,126
<i>that would change the way</i>

801
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,587
<i>many Americans looked at the world.</i>

802
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:29,552
<i>Finally, in 1980,
this unlikely revolution</i>

803
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,430
<i>of the super-rich and white conservatives</i>

804
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,806
<i>found its face.</i>

805
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,892
REAGAN:
<i>For those without skills,</i>

806
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,561
<i>we'll find a way
to help them get new skills.</i>

807
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,730
<i>For those without job opportunities,</i>

808
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,482
<i>we'll stimulate new opportunities,</i>

809
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,693
<i>particularly in the inner cities
where they live.</i>

810
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,112
<i>For those who've abandoned hope,</i>

811
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,073
<i>we'll restore hope
and we'll welcome them</i>

812
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,824
<i>into a great national crusade</i>

813
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,910
<i>to make America great again.</i>

814
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,411
(crowd cheering)

815
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,751
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

816
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,213
<i>God bless America.</i>

817
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,843
KURT: <i>It was the fucking 1980s,</i>

818
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,721
<i>and it was a hell of a time
to be Dick Cheney.</i>

819
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,060
Vote on H.R.4445,

820
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,646
the Undetectable Firearms Act,

821
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,108
to ban plastic guns that can
evade metal detectors.

822
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,693
CHENEY: Nay.

823
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,654
REAGAN: Well, thank you,
Congressmen Cheney.

824
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,739
I hear you've been quite the ally.

825
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,242
CLERK: <i>...establishing
Martin Luther King Jr. Day</i>

826
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,785
<i>as a federal holiday.</i>

827
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:42,208
H.R.36441,
the Endangered Species Act.

828
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,378
Mr. T is here,
right with the First Family.

829
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,631
Vote on H.R.500,
the Water Quality Act.

830
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,924
- Out!
- WOMAN: Woo!

831
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,218
MAN:
Vote on H.R.44...

832
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,347
Someone call an ambulance!

833
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,600
Can you breathe?

834
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,686
CHENEY: I'm having
a heart attack, you idiot.

835
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,692
(indistinct chatter)

836
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,179
CHENEY: <i>Thank you, Alex,
for your very responsible...</i>

837
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,472
WOMAN: <i>Oh, congratulations.</i>

838
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,391
Thank you.
I was very, very excited...

839
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,602
- We are not wolves.
- LYNNE: Thank you.

840
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,270
No, thank you.

841
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,690
Oh, they're both brilliant but broke.

842
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,195
- Hey, George.
- GEORGE BUSH SR.: Hey, Dick.

843
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,280
- Hello, Lynne.
- (kisses)

844
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,740
Congratulations on your appointment.

845
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,909
Oh, well, thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

846
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,619
How is your lovely family?

847
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,038
Well, we think our son Jeb
seems cut out for office.

848
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,876
We may be asking for your
endorsements in a few years.

849
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,378
Well, if he's half as charming
as you are, George,

850
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,838
then you'll have both of our votes.

851
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,006
Ah, can I get that in writing?

852
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,341
Oh, yeah, of course.

853
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,967
Dick, I just want to say thank you

854
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,636
for getting the House not to override

855
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,721
the president's veto
on the fairness doctrine.

856
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,515
No, not a problem.

857
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,725
Happy to get rid of any
big government regulations.

858
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,560
Thank you. Great.

859
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,437
KURT: <i>The fairness doctrine
was a law from the 40s</i>

860
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,690
<i>that required
any broadcast TV or radio news</i>

861
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,610
<i>to present both sides
of an issue equally.</i>

862
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,655
<i>Its repeal would lead
to the rise of opinion news.</i>

863
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,992
Let me tell you something,
you skinny human prophylactic.

864
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,621
Love is the only human emotion
you can't fake.

865
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,706
Except women.
And thank God they can.

866
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,125
(audience laughing)

867
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,086
And eventually to the realization

868
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,754
of Roger Ailes' dream.

869
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,216
Fox News, which would go on to become

870
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,678
the number one news station
in the United States

871
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,972
and swing America
even more to the right.

872
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,517
Thank you. Great.

873
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,561
- (clattering)
- (waitress gasps)

874
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,230
Sorry. Sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

875
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,940
Lighten up, sweetheart.
It's a party.

876
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,275
GEORGE BUSH SR.:
Let me go see if I can see

877
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,526
if everything's okay over there.

878
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,862
Great to see you both.
Love to the girls.

879
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,697
- Love to Barbara.
- Will do.

880
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,116
- That's his son.
- Oh, crap.

881
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,494
George W.,
black sheep of the family.

882
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,746
- Very boring people. Only in America...
- GEORGE BUSH SR.: Let's go.

883
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,040
A little too much
unconditional love there.

884
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,295
Can you feel it, Dick?

885
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,338
Half the room wants to be us.

886
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,716
The other half fears us.

887
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,427
I know George is next in line, but...

888
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,388
after that, who knows?

889
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,184
I respect the hell out of Reagan,

890
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,313
but no one has shown the world
the true power

891
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,315
of the American presidency.

892
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,196
(indistinct chatter)

893
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,549
(sobbing)

894
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,427
Excuse me, Miss Mary!

895
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,931
You cannot leave the grounds
during school hours. Mary!

896
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,230
- (tires screech)
- (horn blares)

897
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,941
LYNNE:
Well, I don't understand.

898
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,652
You just left school? Why?

899
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,570
It doesn't make any sense.

900
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,114
It was Susan.

901
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,951
LYNNE:
Susan, your best friend?

902
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,622
Oh, honey, did you get
in a fight over a boy or...

903
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,963
(sobbing)
She broke up with me.

904
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,799
(sniffling)

905
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,176
Mom, Dad...

906
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,554
I...

907
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,889
I like girls.

908
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,767
I'm gay.

909
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,204
(sighs)

910
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,039
It doesn't matter, sweetheart.

911
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,334
We love you no matter what.

912
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,963
Daddy.

913
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,756
I love you so much.

914
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,386
This is going to make things...

915
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,722
so hard for you.

916
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,646
(man speaking indistinctly)

917
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,316
<i>When George Bush Sr.
was elected president,</i>

918
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:02,111
<i>Dick Cheney was made
Secretary of Defense,</i>

919
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,155
sixth in line to the presidency.

920
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,074
<i>And after a few years,</i>

921
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,077
<i>it was Dick's turn to run for president.</i>

922
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,873
<i>So they decided to do
some early polling numbers.</i>

923
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,458
Uh-huh. Guess that's it.

924
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,628
LYNNE: We can move
those numbers. Just...

925
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,381
go after the welfare state,

926
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,425
- regulations, government waste.
- It'll be war.

927
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,718
LYNNE: No.

928
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,386
I, uh...

929
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,180
I can't put Mary through that.

930
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,392
Every primary opponent
will go after her.

931
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,941
LYNNE:
And we deny.

932
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,488
Shame them for going
after the family and...

933
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,723
(wind gusting)

934
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,901
(indistinct chatter)

935
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,362
LYNNE: You let Grandma go.

936
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,406
PERRY: Come on. Good boy.

937
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,448
All right.

938
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,369
No. Oh, my goodness.

939
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,995
(laughter)

940
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,288
(Lynne exclaims and laughs)

941
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,752
MARY: It's great, Philip.

942
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,046
Uh, Coors has me mapping out strategies

943
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,590
for people living alternative lifestyles.

944
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,426
The Coors are a wonderful family.

945
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,177
They're good people.
(clears throat)

946
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,396
(inaudible dialogue)

947
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,421
(phone ringing)

948
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,763
LYNNE: Who is calling
on a Sunday morning?

949
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,391
CHENEY: I don't know.

950
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,769
Okay. I'm coming.

951
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,355
(ringing continues)

952
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,482
I'm comin'.

953
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,735
(phone beeps)

954
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,861
Hello.

955
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,824
That's right.

956
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,329
Mm-hmm.

957
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,128
Any way I can be of assistance.

958
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,091
Yep, now that should work.
3:00 p.m.

959
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,220
Of course.

960
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,346
Oh, that, uh...

961
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,932
that goes without saying.

962
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,310
Thank you.

963
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,770
No, thank you.

964
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,564
- Who was that?
- (phone beeps)

965
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,692
It was someone from

966
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,612
George Bush's son's, uh, campaign.

967
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,571
Jeb?

968
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,031
No, no, George W.

969
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,200
- Uh, Jeb's Florida.
- Right, right.

970
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,952
Oh, I still can't believe they've got

971
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,037
that poor boy running
for president.

972
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,081
(chuckles softly)
What'd they want?

973
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:47,253
They want to talk to me
about being his running mate.

974
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,964
What?

975
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,800
They didn't say it outright,

976
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,677
but, uh...

977
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,345
I've made that call myself.

978
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,722
That's what they want.

979
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,643
A vice president is a nothing job.

980
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:04,812
Mmm.

981
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,690
Well, I'll just hear 'em out.

982
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,316
I owe that to the father.

983
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,652
The VP just sits around

984
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,404
and waits for the president to die.

985
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,822
You've said so yourself.

986
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,533
Yeah, it's a cruddy job.

987
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,492
Yeah.

988
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,078
It's just a meeting.

989
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,706
Is it just a meeting?

990
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,251
It's just a meeting.

991
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,716
Good.

992
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,805
(bubbling)

993
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,280
THERESA:
Yes, Governor.

994
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,367
Of course.

995
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,077
The governor will see you now,
Secretary Cheney.

996
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,663
(clears throat)

997
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,543
Sure.

998
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,506
GEORGE W. BUSH:
Hey! Hello, Dick.

999
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,799
Hello, George.

1000
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,302
It's been a while.

1001
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,637
Last year.

1002
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,930
Foreign policy sessions.

1003
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,016
That's right.
Yeah, that's right.

1004
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,601
Those meetings were, uh...

1005
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,937
very engaging.

1006
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,690
I do remember we both agreed

1007
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,025
my dad would've been re-elected

1008
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,610
had he taken out Saddam.

1009
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,363
Right. Yeah, wartime presidents.

1010
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,907
Very popular.

1011
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,659
That they are.
That they are.

1012
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,869
So...

1013
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,623
Congratulations

1014
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,126
on a... successful primary.

1015
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,129
I've, uh, been through a few myself,

1016
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,256
and they can be, shall we say...

1017
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,466
Fuckin' exhausting.

1018
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,009
- Right.
- (chuckles)

1019
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,470
Yeah.

1020
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,514
(stutters)
It's a grind.

1021
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,640
It's a grind, I'll tell you.

1022
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,975
<i>Buses, bologna sandwiches.</i>

1023
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,812
Hell, I like people,
but, I mean,

1024
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,689
you know,
enough's enough.

1025
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,068
So...

1026
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,071
that call I received...

1027
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,614
I forgot, you're a brass tacks guy,

1028
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,740
aren't ya? I like that.

1029
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,575
(chuckles)

1030
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,328
You surprised I'm running for president?

1031
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,373
CHENEY (thinking):
<i>He wants to impress his father</i>

1032
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,708
<i>more than anything.</i>

1033
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:34,044
After my, uh,
shall we say, wild years?

1034
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,840
Well, George,
I sowed some oats myself

1035
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,383
back in the day.

1036
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,970
And I still enjoy
a cold beer on occasion.

1037
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,555
- I bet you did.
- Mmm.

1038
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,181
I bet you did, you rascal.

1039
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:49,309
I can't anymore. It got bad.

1040
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,228
Yeah.

1041
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,354
Good times.

1042
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,022
CHENEY:
<i>What does he really want?</i>

1043
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,525
<i>What does he need?</i>

1044
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,193
GEORGE W. BUSH:
It's tough, I'll tell ya.

1045
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,364
I lost my first congressional race,

1046
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,908
and it was not good.

1047
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,954
How 'bout some brisket?

1048
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,164
George, um...

1049
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,544
GEORGE W. BUSH:
Hey, Theresa! Hey, Theresa!

1050
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,379
- Yell up, get some brisket.
- THERESA: All right, we'll find some.

1051
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,381
- GEORGE W. BUSH: Get the burnt ends.
- THERESA: 'Course.

1052
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,632
So listen, I got a...

1053
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,303
"lack of experience" problem
in the polls,

1054
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,472
and you are one of the most
experienced guys around.

1055
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,932
You wanna jump on board,
be my vice?

1056
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,351
I'm honored.

1057
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,730
Don't be honored,
fuckin' say yes, Mr. Brass Tacks.

1058
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,482
Mmm. I have to say, uh, no.

1059
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,526
Dick, come on,
we're gonna have a lot of fun.

1060
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,696
What are you doin' right now?
You're in the private sector?

1061
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,406
CHENEY: Yeah.

1062
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,200
Come on,
I know you love politics.

1063
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,743
George.

1064
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,037
- Let's go.
- Not gonna happen.

1065
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,789
- Come on now.
- (chuckles)

1066
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,793
Well, that's a shame. It is.

1067
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,671
Perhaps I could, uh...

1068
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,926
help you find the right running mate.

1069
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,761
Run my VP search team?

1070
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,013
Mmm. No team. Just me.

1071
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,644
(exhales)

1072
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,064
Yeah, yeah, that could work,
that could...

1073
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,650
I have to run it by Rove,
of course, but, uh...

1074
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,653
If I lose, maybe I could become

1075
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,446
- commissioner of baseball.
- (chuckles)

1076
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,989
You know?

1077
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,408
But the, um, idea...

1078
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,828
is to win.

1079
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,706
I'm gonna keep you
in the back of my mind.

1080
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,836
(brushing teeth)

1081
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,342
So, are you going to tell me
how it went today or not?

1082
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,719
(Cheney sighs)

1083
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,347
It was very interesting.

1084
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,558
He is, uh...

1085
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,519
(inhales sharply)

1086
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,562
...green.

1087
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,857
He's very green.

1088
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,694
And you told him "no"?

1089
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,029
I, uh...

1090
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:09,950
I told him I would help with the, uh...

1091
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,078
with the search.

1092
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,793
(gargling)

1093
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,719
What are you thinking?

1094
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,849
- I can tell you're thinking.
- Mm-hmm.

1095
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,357
KURT:
<i>What was Dick Cheney thinking...</i>

1096
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,028
I'm thinking I've never seen
anything like this.

1097
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,114
KURT: <i>...after his first
meeting with George W.?</i>

1098
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,867
We've had a lot of successes, Dick.

1099
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,832
And the vice president
is a nothing job.

1100
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,710
KURT: <i>How many steps ahead
was he looking?</i>

1101
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,130
<i>How did he feel about the opportunity</i>

1102
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,632
<i>that was in front of him?</i>

1103
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,470
<i>There are certain moments</i>

1104
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,721
<i>so delicate...</i>

1105
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,892
<i>- like a teacup and saucer...</i>
- (girls crying)

1106
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,899
<i>...stacked on a teacup and saucer</i>

1107
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:27,277
<i>on a teacup and saucer...</i>

1108
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,779
Can you change,
or am I wasting...

1109
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,574
KURT:
<i>...and on and on...</i>

1110
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,334
<i>that this moment could fall
in any direction...</i>

1111
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,171
<i>and change everything.</i>

1112
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,759
<i>Sadly, there's no real way</i>

1113
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,678
<i>to know exactly what was going on</i>

1114
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,137
<i>- inside the Cheneys...</i>
- (inaudible dialogue)

1115
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,723
<i>...at this history-changing moment.</i>

1116
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,644
<i>We can't just snap
into a Shakespearean soliloquy</i>

1117
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,855
<i>that dramatizes every feeling
and motivation.</i>

1118
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,275
(chuckles)
<i>That's just not the way the world works.</i>

1119
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,653
(switch clicks)

1120
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,659
My sweet Richard.

1121
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,829
Dance'd nimbly round
the king's hearth thou hath.

1122
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,499
Even whilst clamored I
for more, more!

1123
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,876
- Mm.
- Parched maw craned towards

1124
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,380
the drip, drip of imagined waters.

1125
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:32,551
But I say to you now,
rest, retire.

1126
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,805
Thou hast honored thy vows
to wife and crown.

1127
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,143
Has blindness usurped vision
in you, my wife?

1128
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,104
(thunder rumbling)

1129
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,857
No mere treaty is our union.

1130
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,819
Thou shared thy torch's flame
with mine.

1131
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,988
Revealing halls and spires...

1132
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,197
(inhales deeply)

1133
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,742
...of long faded empires.

1134
00:58:56,825 --> 00:59:00,662
And now, I may hold aloft

1135
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,165
mine own fiery cresset.

1136
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,462
And make flesh our bond of power.

1137
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,048
Dare I?

1138
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,634
Dare I let hope's beak
place gathered bramble

1139
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,887
upon my heart for future's nest?

1140
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:21,308
Many winters past
hath I let this hope die,

1141
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,936
cruel winds silencing
tiny birds' needy cries.

1142
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,898
Now that it hath arrived,
I say yea.

1143
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,441
BOTH: Yea.

1144
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,780
Mine own blood and will are yours

1145
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,031
'til pierced be

1146
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,241
the last soldier's breastplate,

1147
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,827
spilling forth its ruby jelly treasures.

1148
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,747
(thunder rumbling)

1149
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,082
(both moaning)

1150
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,751
(switch clicks)

1151
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:52,756
So?

1152
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,968
So I think we, uh, proceed.

1153
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,763
What about Mary?

1154
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,723
Mmm. It's VP.

1155
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,393
Not the same scrutiny.

1156
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,482
No. He has allies, Dick.
Connections.

1157
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,110
You're new to his world.
You don't know the landscape.

1158
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,196
(Cheney grunts)

1159
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:23,203
Well, I had better conduct
a very thorough search.

1160
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:28,792
Every stone,
hell, every grain of sand...

1161
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,252
needs to be looked under
for this questionnaire.

1162
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,338
Dick, we're asking for all financials,

1163
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,132
all medical, all interviews,

1164
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,050
press, writings, all legal records...

1165
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,178
Sometimes people use LLCs
to hide certain monies.

1166
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:41,304
CHENEY: And?

1167
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,182
Any more comprehensive
and we would need a rubber glove.

1168
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,351
- Sorry, Liz.
- That wasn't offensive.

1169
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,727
Should I be offended?

1170
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,146
Well, I'm offended.

1171
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,772
Dave didn't worry
if I'd be offended.

1172
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,275
LIZ: Oh, a rubber glove,
like a proctology exam.

1173
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,985
- That's disgusting.
- (phone ringing)

1174
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,029
Hello? Oh, hello...

1175
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,783
MARY: Dad, I'm taking
the cheese off your pizza.

1176
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,035
- LYNNE: Honey?
- CHENEY: Mmm?

1177
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,745
LYNNE:
Dave.

1178
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:06,788
David. Thoughts?

1179
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:09,291
One. A big one.

1180
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,295
KURT: <i>David Addington,
Dick's main legal advisor</i>

1181
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,214
<i>and a huge believer in the
unitary executive theory.</i>

1182
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,509
<i>He was known for
telling people to their face</i>

1183
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,553
<i>that they're stupid.</i>

1184
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,139
So the, uh, vice presidency is
part of the executive branch.

1185
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,433
And because the VP casts

1186
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,268
tie-breaking votes in the Senate,

1187
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,188
<i>also part of the legislative branch,
right?</i>

1188
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,024
- Right.
- That means...

1189
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,901
the VP is also

1190
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:39,988
<i>not part of the executive
or the legislative.</i>

1191
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,323
So,

1192
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,491
one could argue that, uh...

1193
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,620
neither branch

1194
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,288
has oversight of the VP.

1195
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,709
Not only could one argue that,
I'm arguing it.

1196
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,128
That's brilliant, David.

1197
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,339
I know. Right?

1198
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,884
GEORGE W. BUSH: Karl Rove
wanted me to buy this ranch,

1199
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,262
distance myself from my years
at Yale and Harvard,

1200
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,848
make me more of a man
of the people for the election.

1201
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,059
Mmm. Smart.

1202
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,023
So we gonna do this thing or what?
I mean, is this happening?

1203
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:20,946
We, uh, have found some
very interesting candidates.

1204
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,948
Um, if we could schedule

1205
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:26,493
a three-hour window
to get through...

1206
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,828
I meant you.
I want you to be my VP.

1207
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,123
- You're the solution to my problems.
- No.

1208
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,626
I'm CEO of a large company.

1209
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:39,130
I have been, uh, Secretary of Defense.

1210
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,342
I have been Chief of Staff.

1211
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:47,555
Uh, the vice presidency
is mostly a symbolic job.

1212
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,224
Right, right.

1213
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,934
I can see how that wouldn't be, uh...

1214
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,396
enticing to you.

1215
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,355
However...

1216
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,071
the vice presidency is also
defined by the president.

1217
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,533
And if we were to come to a, uh...

1218
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,617
(reel whirring)

1219
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,369
different understanding...

1220
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,330
Uh-huh. Go on.

1221
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,958
I'm listenin'.

1222
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:21,089
I sense that, uh, you're a kinetic leader.

1223
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,801
You make decisions based on instinct.

1224
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,553
I am. People always said that.

1225
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,221
Yeah, yeah. Very different.

1226
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,640
Very different from, uh,

1227
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,101
from your father in that regard.

1228
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,438
Now, maybe I can, uh,

1229
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,190
handle some of the more mundane jobs.

1230
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,068
Overseeing bureaucracy,

1231
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,321
managing military,

1232
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:47,532
uh, energy, uh, foreign policy.

1233
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,539
That sounds good.

1234
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,541
(reel whirring)

1235
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,712
GEORGE W. BUSH:
Never wanna be the kind of team owner

1236
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,049
that, uh, pulls the starter
in the fourth inning.

1237
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,384
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the manager's job.

1238
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,347
One more thing.

1239
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,683
My daughter, Mary.

1240
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,228
Right. Rove told me she likes girls.

1241
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,900
Now, I know you have
to, uh, run against, uh,

1242
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,945
gay marriage in the South,
Midwest, and, uh...

1243
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,491
(clears throat)
But it's my daughter,

1244
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,786
and that line is drawn in concrete.

1245
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,996
Don't you say another word.

1246
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,165
So long as you don't mind us
pushing that messaging,

1247
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,125
we're okay with you
sittin' that one out.

1248
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,169
I think it's important for all the...

1249
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,837
all the Marys in the world,
you know?

1250
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,964
(sighs)

1251
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,841
No problemo.
We got a deal?

1252
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,553
Then I believe this could work.

1253
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,640
(chuckles)
Hot damn!

1254
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:58,061
Yeah. Well, good.
Hey, let's celebrate.

1255
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,479
GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>Secretary Cheney visited me and Laura</i>

1256
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,481
<i>at our ranch in Crawford, Texas...</i>

1257
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,024
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1258
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:09,489
<i>I realized the best choice
was standing by my side.</i>

1259
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,241
<i>Please welcome my friend</i>

1260
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,119
<i>and my running mate,
Dick Cheney...</i>

1261
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,788
(audience cheering)

1262
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,793
<i>and his lovely wife Lynne.</i>

1263
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,044
KURT:
<i>Dick never filled out</i>

1264
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,588
<i>his own 83-question questionnaire.</i>

1265
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,508
<i>Full medical records
were never handed over.</i>

1266
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,011
<i>No tax or corporate filings.
Nothing.</i>

1267
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:35,140
AUDIENCE (chanting):
Cheney! Cheney! Cheney!

1268
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,891
Cheney! Cheney!

1269
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,726
KING: <i>To reach more
of his senior aides</i>

1270
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,186
<i>to find out reasons.</i>

1271
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,604
<i>But we were told
when he came over,</i>

1272
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,189
<i>he had already called
Governor Bush,</i>

1273
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,774
<i>he had wished him well,
and that he would deliver</i>

1274
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:45,859
<i>a brief concession speech
here tonight.</i>

1275
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,444
LYNNE: I don't know.

1276
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:48,695
WOODRUFF:
<i>I think we're all sitting around</i>

1277
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,530
<i>wondering what it is that, uh,</i>

1278
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,490
<i>- he may be doing backstage.</i>
- They just keep going on and on.

1279
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,784
Gore rescinded his concession.

1280
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,874
They're claiming Florida
is too close to call.

1281
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,420
He can't fucking rescind
his concession.

1282
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,172
He just did.

1283
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,381
The Russians are loving this.

1284
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,967
There's gonna be a recount, so...

1285
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,051
LYNNE:
I don't know.

1286
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,094
SCOOTER:
What should we do?

1287
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,140
We play it like we've already won.

1288
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,936
Which means we need
to staff the White House.

1289
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,649
All right.
Who's leading the transition team?

1290
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,775
I'll do it.

1291
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,362
That's not something
a vice president really does, is it?

1292
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,615
Well...

1293
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,782
- It is now.
- REPORTER: <i>Vice President Gore</i>

1294
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,826
<i>has called Governor Bush</i>

1295
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,621
<i>and retracted his concession,</i>

1296
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,831
<i>- because he is now...</i>
- (all exclaim)

1297
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,583
- LYNNE: What?
<i>- ...of the mind that things could be</i>

1298
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,043
<i>turning yet again in Florida.</i>

1299
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,878
LYNNE:
You can't do that!

1300
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,755
I mean, that's laughable.

1301
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,217
Uh, Wolfowitz.

1302
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,261
- State?
- Mmm.

1303
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,846
Or Pentagon?

1304
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,224
Depends on who
your Secretary of Defense is.

1305
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,433
- CHENEY: Rummy.
- Hundred percent.

1306
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,227
- Mm-hmm.
- Rumsfeld?

1307
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,521
Uh, doesn't Bush Senior
hate Rummy?

1308
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,772
CHENEY:
Not such a bad thing with W.

1309
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,107
He wants to be his own man.

1310
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,360
Rumsfeld believes in a robust executive.

1311
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,111
That's good for us on war powers.

1312
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,572
Just keep him out of State,
he'll start World War III.

1313
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,658
- (chuckles)
- CHENEY: Look.

1314
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:21,246
Halliburton just gave us
a $26 million exit package.

1315
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,706
Twice what we expected.

1316
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,958
They're no dummies.

1317
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,212
Uh, sorry, gang.

1318
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,173
Yep.

1319
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:35,802
Think, uh, perhaps I should go
to the hospital.

1320
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,889
LYNNE: Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me? Oh, come on.

1321
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:43,393
MARSHAL:
Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!

1322
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,728
All persons having business
with the Honorable,

1323
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,397
the Supreme Court of the United States

1324
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,233
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention,

1325
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,277
for the Court is now sitting.

1326
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,487
God bless the United States and...

1327
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:59,284
KURT: <i>December 12th, 2000.
Antonin Scalia, remember him,</i>

1328
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,911
<i>and the Supreme Court stopped
the state of Florida</i>

1329
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,288
<i>from completing their recount.</i>

1330
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,540
MARSHAL:
God save the United States

1331
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,750
- and this Honorable Court.
- KURT: <i>George W. Bush and Dick Cheney</i>

1332
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,963
<i>were going to the White House
by a margin of537 votes.</i>

1333
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,804
(siren wailing)

1334
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,969
Hey. Hey, little Mary Claire.

1335
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,263
Hey, little Mary, my little Mary.

1336
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,768
<i>Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Hmm?</i>

1337
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,021
(chuckling)

1338
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,274
LYNNE:
<i>Oh, they're both doing really well.</i>

1339
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,151
Except, I'm trying to make this dinner.

1340
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,070
And it's, uh...

1341
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,822
It's this macaroni and cheese

1342
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,574
that you said was easy

1343
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,952
but it keeps just coming out
like a little watery.

1344
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,704
CHENEY: <i>It's the milk.
Remember?</i>

1345
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:28,206
<i>You gotta add more milk.</i>

1346
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,583
Yeah. It'll get thicker.

1347
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,336
No, no, no, no.

1348
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,755
<i>I am. It's much better
when you use the milk.</i>

1349
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:36,756
LYNNE:
<i>There's just so much,</i>

1350
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,633
<i>so much I want to say right now,</i>

1351
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,510
<i>and just, you keep doing
what you're doing.</i>

1352
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,345
<i>You're doing so great.</i>

1353
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,264
(chuckles)

1354
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:48,309
You have earned something
very special from your wife.

1355
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,769
Listen, listen, listen.

1356
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,981
I'm buying wine,
and I'm picking something up.

1357
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:55,316
<i>Chinese?</i>

1358
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,320
LYNNE: <i>Okay, I really love you.</i>

1359
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,407
CHENEY: <i>I love you.</i>

1360
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,867
- LYNNE: <i>Yeah.
- (both laugh)</i>

1361
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,830
(clock ticking)

1362
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,458
(phone ringing)

1363
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,086
RUMSFELD:
Good morning to you, too.

1364
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,045
ADDINGTON:
We've met a few times.

1365
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,296
- It's nice to see you.
- Yes.

1366
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,381
Of course.

1367
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,632
All right. Let's...

1368
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,467
All right.
Let's get this thing underway.

1369
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,511
Scooter, why don't you
let everyone know

1370
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:24,637
the, um, lay of the land?

1371
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,514
SCOOTER: Of course.
As you all know,

1372
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,099
I am Scooter Libby,

1373
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,143
Dick's chief of staff.

1374
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,271
Uh, I'm also his
national security advisor

1375
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,440
and a special advisor
to the president.

1376
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:38,901
Technically, Scooter outranks
any of Bush's people.

1377
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,905
Mary Matalin will serve
as counselor to the VP

1378
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,115
and assistant to Bush.

1379
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,950
David Addington,

1380
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,452
Dick's main legal counsel,

1381
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,579
will play center field on all matters

1382
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,956
relating to executive power.

1383
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,585
The president has Alberto Gonzales,

1384
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,295
Karl Rove,

1385
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,673
Karen Hughes as his team.

1386
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,134
Quite frankly, Gonzales has no clue.

1387
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,470
Um... Rove is a hack.

1388
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,056
Hughes should be in double-A ball.

1389
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,727
So we will have fairly unobstructed access

1390
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,187
to the Oval Office.

1391
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,939
We will be automatically

1392
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,525
Bcc'd on all e-mails

1393
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,319
that the president receives or sends,

1394
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,280
as well as have access to his schedule

1395
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,325
the second that it is set or changed.

1396
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,076
CHENEY:
And we will also be receiving

1397
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,205
the daily intelligence briefing
before the president.

1398
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,707
That gets us inside the decision curve.

1399
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,709
Which we'll actually be reading.

1400
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,337
Bush approved all of this?

1401
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,172
Mmm, we have, uh,

1402
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,466
an understanding.

1403
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:44,842
What about the e-mails?

1404
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,511
Paper shredders don't work for e-mails.

1405
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,513
The entire administration will run off

1406
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,389
the RNC's private server.

1407
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,226
And we've deactivated automatic archiving.

1408
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,185
We're clean.

1409
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,771
Okay.

1410
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,564
So over at the Pentagon,
we got Don,

1411
01:11:58,648 --> 01:11:59,774
- Secretary of Defense.
- RUMSFELD: Mm-hmm.

1412
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,442
SCOOTER:
Paul Wolfowitz,

1413
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,820
who worked with Team B
in the Ford days,

1414
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,822
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

1415
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:09,242
CHENEY: Let's check,
see what plans

1416
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,868
they had to invade Iraq.

1417
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,453
It's already in the works.

1418
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,956
Got Ashcroft over at the DOJ.

1419
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,834
State seems to be
the only tricky department.

1420
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:21,170
That's Colin Powell,
his guy Lawrence Wilkerson.

1421
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,256
Colin Powell, who never met
a camera he didn't like.

1422
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,715
Wilkerson's a true believer.

1423
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,050
WOLFOWITZ:
We've got Bolton over there.

1424
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,844
He's a loose cannon, but he's loyal.

1425
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:30,346
Mmm. I wanna get Liz in there as well.

1426
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,764
Let's make sure that happens.

1427
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,599
- Okay, Dad.
- Consider it done.

1428
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:37,395
And this list of, uh, our people

1429
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,814
does not include about 800 others,

1430
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,650
uh, lobbyists, industry insiders

1431
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,444
that we placed in the regulatory jobs.

1432
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:46,696
What about Bush's friends?

1433
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,239
<i>Ridge? Pataki? Thompson?</i>

1434
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,657
I haven't heard their names.

1435
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,368
They were not, um, offered jobs

1436
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,954
in this administration,
uh, at this time.

1437
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,956
RUMSFELD:
Not offered jobs at this time?

1438
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,959
Are you even more ruthless than
you used to be there, Dick?

1439
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,752
Or are you just not getting laid?

1440
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,676
All right, moving on.

1441
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,428
Um, got Paul O'Neill.

1442
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,102
You haven't been here
in over twenty years.

1443
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,353
Times have changed.

1444
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:21,606
The, uh, softer touch,

1445
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,441
that's the norm now.

1446
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:27,069
We have the conservative
TV and radio

1447
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,280
- doing the yelling for us.
- Mm-hmm.

1448
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,866
RUMSFELD: Is your old friend
embarrassing you?

1449
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:32,950
Is that it, Dick?

1450
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,660
(Cheney chuckles)

1451
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,248
Soft touch. That's all.

1452
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,791
All right,
I have to go to my office

1453
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:41,792
at the House of Representatives.

1454
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,210
You mean the Senate?

1455
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,129
Vice president,
tiebreaker in the Senate.

1456
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,507
Nope, I mean the House.

1457
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,510
KURT: <i>Dick Cheney had used
an old connection</i>

1458
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,054
<i>with former wrestling coach</i>

1459
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,598
<i>and Speaker of the House
Dennis Hastert</i>

1460
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,600
<i>to get an office at the
House of Representatives.</i>

1461
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,102
<i>The House is where
revenue bills originate,</i>

1462
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,563
<i>and he wanted to be
near the money faucet.</i>

1463
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,941
Hey, Dick.
Will this work for you?

1464
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,486
Two more offices in the Senate.

1465
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,948
Hey, Dick,
I found this extra office.

1466
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,282
I hope it works for you.

1467
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,034
And one in the Pentagon.

1468
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,162
Welcome to your new home away from home.

1469
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:21,332
I got you a little housewarming gift.

1470
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,793
KURT: <i>And later, when Cheney
needed intelligence</i>

1471
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,252
<i>to invade Iraq,</i>

1472
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,004
<i>a conference room at the CIA.</i>

1473
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,548
This room is soundproof
and secure.

1474
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,552
KURT:
<i>Cheney was everywhere.</i>

1475
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,596
<i>But the most powerful place
in all of D.C.</i>

1476
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,474
<i>was a nondescript conference room</i>

1477
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,017
<i>at a relatively new think tank</i>

1478
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,812
<i>called Americans for Tax Reform.</i>

1479
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,856
<i>Grover Norquist ran the anti-tax group</i>

1480
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,401
<i>with huge funding from
the Koch brothers network,</i>

1481
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,903
<i>big oil, and big tobacco.</i>

1482
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,489
<i>His "Wednesday meeting,"</i>

1483
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,993
<i>as it was called,
had become the center</i>

1484
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,577
<i>of the Republican world.</i>

1485
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,499
Let's go ahead and start
with the estate tax.

1486
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,627
Now, this has been hard to eliminate,

1487
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,672
because the tax only
affects those estates

1488
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,424
worth over two million.

1489
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,051
But we've made strides,

1490
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:17,138
and marketing guru Frank Luntz
is here to help.

1491
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,474
(applause)

1492
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,520
Hello, all.

1493
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,855
(clicks tongue)

1494
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,691
Getting regular people
to support cutting taxes

1495
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,900
on the very wealthy

1496
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,069
has always been extremely hard.

1497
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:35,072
We've had some success
in the past,

1498
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,825
but the estate tax has
always been very difficult.

1499
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,036
However...

1500
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,997
I think we may have had
a breakthrough.

1501
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:47,543
Now, the estate tax kicks in

1502
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,714
on anyone inheriting
over two million dollars.

1503
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,591
How many of you have
a problem with that?

1504
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,761
Okay. How many
of you would have

1505
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:58,637
a problem with something called

1506
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,389
a death tax?

1507
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,105
Instead of global warming,

1508
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,858
which we all agree sounds very scary...

1509
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,902
(people chuckle)

1510
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,945
we call it...

1511
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,572
climate change.

1512
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,740
RADIO HOST:
<i>Folks, the government</i>

1513
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,992
<i>is taking your money after you die.</i>

1514
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,368
LIMBAUGH (on radio): <i>Now,
we all know the Democrats</i>

1515
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:22,828
<i>despise tax cuts,
especially for the rich.</i>

1516
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,663
GOLDBERG (on TV):
<i>I want somebody to get rid</i>

1517
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,207
<i>of the death tax,
that's what I want.</i>

1518
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,541
<i>I don't want to get taxed
just 'cause I die.</i>

1519
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,418
LIMBAUGH:
I mean, give me a break!

1520
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,003
GOLDBERG: <i>If I give something
to my kid, I already paid the tax.</i>

1521
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,213
<i>Why I gotta pay again 'cause I died?</i>

1522
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,631
<i>It's like being chastised!
I hate it.</i>

1523
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,674
<i>The death tax has to go.</i>

1524
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,010
<i>The elite liberals
in Washington would tax us</i>

1525
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,970
<i>for laughing or crying if they could.</i>

1526
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,515
So, with one of the biggest media

1527
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,810
and political machines
ever created behind him,

1528
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:50,648
Cheney was able to squash
action on global warming,

1529
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,483
cut taxes for the super rich,

1530
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,653
and gut regulations
for massive corporations.

1531
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,029
<i>And then there was Cheney's</i>

1532
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,865
<i>National Energy Policy
Development Group.</i>

1533
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:03,994
<i>His first major test
to expand executive power.</i>

1534
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,163
I don't understand
what the goddamn problem is.

1535
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,832
I want to hear
what the energy CEOs need,

1536
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,208
and I'm not allowed to?

1537
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,168
- ADDINGTON: It's called FACA.
- The hell is FACA?

1538
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,003
ADDINGTON: It's the Federal
Advisory Committees Act.

1539
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,798
Congress got their panties
in a bunch that, you know,

1540
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,759
elected officials would
just let CEOs roll in

1541
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,719
and, you know, write the laws.

1542
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,515
The act demands that, uh,

1543
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:28,769
appropriate government employees
be present.

1544
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,354
Hold on a second.

1545
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,816
What's your name?

1546
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,109
Doug.

1547
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,112
Doug, how long have you
been working reception

1548
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,530
at the Department of Energy?

1549
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,616
Three months.

1550
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,701
Perfect.

1551
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,540
So what am I supposed to do here?

1552
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,917
Just sit there and be quiet.

1553
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,043
Got it.

1554
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,383
- (clears throat) Gentlemen.
- Hello. (clears throat)

1555
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,511
Hello... (bleep)

1556
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,512
(bleep)

1557
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,140
How's your business at... (bleep)

1558
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:09,852
We're good.
Our stock... (bleep)

1559
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,897
And California has been really... (bleep)

1560
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,481
- since deregulation.
- CHENEY: Great to hear.

1561
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,652
Oh. He's with the energy department.

1562
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,696
(indistinct audio on earphones)

1563
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,991
KURT:
<i>The details of Cheney's meetings</i>

1564
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:27,578
<i>with the energy CEOs

1571

we have information

the White House this moment.

1589

We have less than a minute to get
to the secure underground bunker.

1590
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:25,803
Let's go! Move!

1591

Move!

01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,223
Move! It's clear!

Mrs. Cheney, we cannot
go back to the White House,

I am being told no one...

1602

HUGHES: Canada's prime minister
is on the phone.

1610
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,434
That's right,
we got planes in the air

1611
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,185
and nowhere for them to land.

1612
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,938
RICE: Permission for them

unaccounted for

1615
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,526

Sir, Donald Rumsfeld

Yes, sir.

CHENEY: That is correct.

1625
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,501
All orders are UNODIR.

1626
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,837

- HUGHES: Unless otherwise directed.

1627

RICE: Mr. Vice President,
are we sure these are

1628
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,425
the proper rules of engagement?

1629
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,802
The country's under attack,
the ROE is fluid.

1630
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,180

- ADDINGTON: Yes, sir.

01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,478
<i>But it's safe to assume</i>

01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,867
- Mr. Vice President?
- ...authority will he need?

1640

- So, start working on...
- (clears throat)

1641
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,328
Mr. Vice President?

1642
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,164
The congressional members you sent

(sighs)
They're not going anywhere.

1647
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,467
Just, uh, tell them, um,
we have all the helicopters.

1648
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,803
Yes, sir.

1649
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,305
I'm sorry, that is a negative.

1650
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,432
They are to remain where they are.

1651
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,476
There's no helicopters available for evac.

1652
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,478
That is correct.

1653
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,980
If you would be so kind
to relay that information.

1654
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:45,776
LYNNE: Are we at war?

1655
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,570
Yes, we are.

1656
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,030
LYNNE:
With whom?

1657
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,199

from well-known AI-Qaeda operatives

1667
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,233
celebrating today's attack.

We shouldn't rule out Iraq.

1669

RICE:
But what's Al-Qaeda's leader's name?

1670
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,905
His name is Osama bin Laden.

1671
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,490
CLARKE:
But this is clearly AI-Qaeda.

1672
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:35,659
I've been tracking their movements
for years.

1673
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,077
Their fingerprints are all over this.

1674
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,954
Iraq has all the good targets.

1675
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,457
Iraq has nothing to do with this, Don.

1676
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,125
RUMSFELD:
Richard, you don't know that for sure.

1677
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,585

Mr. President, if I may.

(sighs)

1680
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,923
Afghanistan is AI-Qaeda's headquarters.

1681
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,383
- That is where our focus should be.
- CLARKE: Yeah.

1682
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,636
TENET: And the CIA would
be capable of taking out

1683
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,013
the Taliban's power structure.

1684
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,098
RUMSFELD: Yeah.
All due respect, George,

1685
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,558
Mr. President...

1686
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,976
we are the Pentagon,

1687
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,644
and this is what we do.

1688
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,896
Don.

1689
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,077
Okay. We'll, uh, we'll go
with Tenet and the CIA.

1690
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,371
I'll make some calls

(indistinct chatter)

1693
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,796
I think, uh, given the current
situation, Mr. President,

1694
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,467
it is wise that we not be
in the same location

1695
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:37,095
for COG,
Continuity of Government.

1696

GEORGE W. BUSH:
Of course.

1697
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,100
We gonna be all right
on this, aren't we?

1698
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,563
Yes, sir. Yes, we are.

FEMALE OFFICER 1:
<i>A briefcase nuke</i>

<i>being driven into
a major city and detonated.</i>

1743

1744

<i>into the air conditioning units</i>

1745

I'm scared, Dick.

1751
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,129
I'll always take care of you, Lynne.

1752
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:18,674
You know that.

1753
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,470
What are you going to do?

1754
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,896
(stream flowing gently)

1755
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:45,992
(gunshots)

1756
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,913
(gunshots continue)

(gunshots)

1762
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,980
So, while Powell, the CIA,

1763
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,815
and their international coalition

1764
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,317
toppled the Taliban
and took Afghanistan

1765
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,027
in a matter of weeks,

1766
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,864
Cheney had found something
much more powerful

1767
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,575
than missiles or jet planes.

1768
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,870
BYBEE:
<i>Mr. Vice President, this is John Yoo.</i>

1769
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,830
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Vice President.</i>

1770
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,167
BYBEE:
<i>So David told me you're looking</i>

1771
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,502
<i>for executive authority.</i>

1772
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,004
Mm-hmm.

1773
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,088
<i>John here
is definitely your guy.</i>

1774
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,590
(Cheney exhales)

1775
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,301
<i>The war we're now fighting</i>

1776
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,804
<i>will require resources
and abilities that the, uh...</i>

1777
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:53,810
<i>the current interpretation
of the law... impedes.</i>

1778
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,020
The vice president believes

1779
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,938
it is the duty
of the commander-in-chief

1780
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,064
to protect the nation

1781
01:27:58,148 --> 01:27:59,274
and that no other obligation,

1782
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,901
whether to Congress or existing treaty

1783
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,152
<i>supersedes that duty.</i>

1784
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:04,905
<i>How do you feel
about that statement?</i>

1785
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,282
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

1786
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,453
KURT:
<i>John Yoo's first legal opinion</i>

1787
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,622
<i>allowed the US government</i>

1788
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,792
<i>to monitor every citizens' phone calls,</i>

1789
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,085
<i>texts, and e-mails
without a warrant.</i>

1790

(man screams)

1791
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:24,049
KURT:
<i>It was a giant legal leap</i>

1792
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,259
<i>based on sketchy law at best.</i>

1793
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,763
<i>But John Yoo's masterpiece,</i>

1794
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:32,390
<i>his</i> Moby-Dick, <i>if you will,</i>

1795
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,560
<i>was the torture memo.</i>

1796
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,479
...your fucking contact is!

1797
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:40,148
Where're your fucking hands?

1798
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,275
What about the Geneva Convention?

1799
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,320
The Geneva Convention
is open to interpretation.

1800
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,197
What exactly does that mean?

1801
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,950
- (man shouting, indistinct)
- ADDINGTON: Stress positions,

1802
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,493
waterboarding, confined spaces, dogs...

1803
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,245
We're calling it "enhanced interrogation."

1804
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,831
Are we sure none of this fits

1805
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:57,499
in the definition of "torture"?

1806
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,917
The US doesn't torture.

1807
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,088
Therefore, if the US does it,

1808
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,132
by definition, it can't be torture.

1809
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,009
- (dogs barking)
- (man screaming)

1810
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:11,763
KURT:
<i>But torture and privacy laws</i>

1811
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,558
<i>weren't the only laws Cheney
re-wrote with John Yoo.</i>

1812
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:17,769
<i>They had a full menu of legal opinions</i>

1813
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,980
<i>stretching and challenging constitutional</i>

<i>and international law.</i>

WAITER:
Good evening, gentlemen.

1816
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,736
Tonight we're offering
the enemy combatant,

1817
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,281
whereby a person
is not a prisoner of war,

1818
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,157
or a criminal,
which means of course

1819
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:33,785
that he has absolutely
no protection under the law.

1820
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,454
We're also offering
an extraordinary rendition

1821
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,916
where suspects are abducted
without record on foreign soil

1822
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,293
and taken to foreign prisons

1823
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,711
in countries that still torture.

1824
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,379
Oh, that sounds delicious.

1825
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,214
We also have Guantanamo Bay,

1826
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,216
which is very, very complicated,

1827
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,010
but it does allow you to operate

1828
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,429
outside the purview of due process

1829
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,931
on land which isn't
technically US territory,

1830
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,100
but where we still
do have control.

1831
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,561
And also, we have
a very fresh and delicious

1832
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,855
War Powers Act interpretation

1833
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:04,024
which gives the executive
branch broad powers

1834
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,484
to attack nations or people

1835
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,820
who it deems still possibly a threat.

1836
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,865
We have the fact that under
the unitary executive theory,

1837
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,491
if the president does anything,

1838
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,243
- it must be legal.
- (scoffs)

1839
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:18,204
Which, of course, means you can
do whatever the fuck you want.

1840
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,581
So, gentlemen,

1841
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:20,665
which would you like?

1842
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:23,585
Hmm. We'll, uh...
We'll have them all.

1843
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:24,961
Excellent choice.

1844
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,046
Thank you.

1845
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,342
WOLFOWITZ:
Look, Dick, uh, we've been working

1846
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,677
with these focus groups
and advertising executives

1847
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,930
to try and sell the War on Terror.

1848
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,515
WOMAN: <i>I'll reiterate,
we are still being recorded,</i>

1849
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,392
<i>and there still may
or may not be clients</i>

1850
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:40,518
<i>back behind the two-way mirrors...</i>

1851
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,271
These guys are pretty sharp.

1852
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:44,314
Go on.

1853
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,650
There's a problem.

1854
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:48,360
The results show
that people are confused.

1855
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,946
WOMAN:
<i>You all support the president,</i>

1856
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:54,908
<i>you hate terrorism,
yet you're still confused.</i>

1857
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,327
<i>Can you tell me why? Anybody?</i>

1858
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:01,915
MARK: <i>Don't we have to just get
Osama bin Laden? He did it.</i>

1859
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:04,918
So why are they calling it a war?
A war with who?

1860
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,419
WOMAN:
<i>Okay, thank you, Mark.</i>

1861
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,922
<i>Uh, Jasmine, jump in, please.</i>

1862
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,549
I don't get what this AI-Qaeda is.

1863
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,010
Are they a country, like,
why can't we just bomb them?

1864
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,553
WOMAN:
That's really interesting.

1865
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:19,349
<i>Um, is anybody else confused
about what Al-Qaeda is?</i>

1866
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,809
<i>Show of hands, please.</i>

1867
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,228
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...</i>

1868
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,939
<i>That's a lot of you. Right?</i>

1869
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,899
<i>Would it be less confusing</i>

1870
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,275
if it was a country?

1871
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:30,402
MARK: Damn right.

1872
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,778
I'm angry as hell.

1873
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,407
We've gotta fuck someone up.

1874
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,033
WOMAN: <i>Got it. Mark.</i>

1875
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,202
Really strong feelings coming
from Mark. I'm interested.

1876
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,745
<i>Does anybody else feel
the same or agree...</i>

1877
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,664
They understand we're at war, but...

1878
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,291
they don't know against who.

1879
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,043
They want a country.

1880
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:48,545
It's cleaner, simpler.

1881
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:50,171
ADDINGTON:
That would certainly help us legally.

1882
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:51,506
CHENEY: Hmm. Well...

1883
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,926
looks like it's time to take Iraq.

1884
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,139
- (chuckles)
- RUMSFELD: It is about goddamn time.

1885
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:07,564
CHENEY:
It's called the Office of Special Plans.

1886
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,692
Tenet is not yet serious enough

1887
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,236
about the threat that Saddam poses

1888
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,779
to the global war on terror.

1889
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,741
But I can promise you

1890
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:19,868
that this intelligence group will be.

1891
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,036
Wolfie, I got something.

1892
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,370
WOLFOWITZ:
Truck transmissions.

1893
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:23,997
If there's a donkey
with a radio up his ass,

1894
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,081
I wanna know what it's transmitting.

1895
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,875
I think that's an excellent idea.

1896
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,463
I've been wantin' to take
that motherfucker Saddam down

1897
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,173
- for a long time.
- Hmm.

1898
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,216
FEITH: Here's a report
that says Mohamed Atta,

1899
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,676
one of the 9-11 hijackers,

1900
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,471
may have met with
an Iraqi spy in Prague.

1901
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,930
WOMAN:
It's a really strong statement.

1902
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,807
Does anybody agree
with that statement?

1903
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,518
Wait a minute.
We can't just bomb people.

1904
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:46,561
- Oh, please.
- WOMAN: Yeah, no.

1905
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,771
It's from Czech intelligence,

1906
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,731
and they question its credibility.

1907
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,775
WOLFOWITZ: I've been to Prague.
They question everything.

1908
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,778
Who wants to be an anonymous source?

1909
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,529
Make sure you work in the phrase,

1910
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:59,115
"We don't want the smoking gun
to be a mushroom cloud."

1911
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,617
That focus-grouped through the roof.

1912
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,036
RICE: There will always be uncertainty

1913
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:06,039
<i>about when he will acquire
nuclear weapons.</i>

1914
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,416
<i>But we don't want
the smoking gun</i>

1915
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,834
<i>to be a mushroom cloud.</i>

1916
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,878
<i>There is a smoking gun
or a mushroom cloud</i>

1917
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:13,797
<i>- we have waited too long.</i>
- CHENEY: <i>Simply stated,</i>

1918
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,257
<i>there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein</i>

1919
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:18,510
<i>now has weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1920
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,345
<i>We gotta get rid of this dictator.</i>

1921
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,013
<i>He's got anthrax,
he's got all these weapons...</i>

1922
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,099
<i>There is no doubt
he is amassing them</i>

1923
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:25,725
<i>to use them against our friends,</i>

1924
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,811
<i>against our allies,
and against us.</i>

1925
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:30,730
<i>When, and not if, but when</i>

1926
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,608
<i>Saddam creates
and uses nuclear weapons,</i>

1927
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,527
<i>what will we tell
the American people?</i>

1928
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:39,364
<i>Saddam Hussein will continue
to increase his capacity</i>

1929
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,491
<i>to wage biological
and chemical warfare.</i>

1930
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:42,784
- Hello?
- MAN: <i>Whassup!</i>

1931
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:47,288
(all exclaiming)

1932
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,041
To show that we will stand up
for what we know to be right,

1933
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:52,335
to show that we will confront
the tyrannies

1934
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,920
and dictatorships and terrorists

1935
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,880
<i>who put our way of life at risk.</i>

1936
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,715
BROKAW: <i>...of winning
a second UN resolution</i>

1937
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,634
<i>authorizing war against Iraq.</i>

1938
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,302
<i>So tonight President Bush...</i>

1939
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,429
<i>...and the hopes
of an oppressed people...</i>

1940
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:04,556
The tribe has spoken.

1941
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,978
Polling for an invasion of Iraq

1942
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,147
is at 53 percent.

1943
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,606
Focus groups show people

1944
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,692
still aren't sure about a connection

1945
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:18,444
between Saddam and AI-Qaeda.

1946
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:19,946
And France and Germany
have both said

1947
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,739
that they will not join
our coalition

1948
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,616
And neither will Israel.

1949
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,703
Ariel and I we went
to the Wall together with Condi.

1950
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:27,912
We-we prayed together.

1951
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,081
Israel's one of our closest allies.

1952
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:33,251
They said an invasion of Iraq would...

1953
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,545
destabilize the region, sir,

1954
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,255
and that they don't believe
Saddam is an immediate threat.

1955
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,841
That's not good.

1956
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,552
I really want
a strong coalition for this.

1957
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,220
I have an idea.

1958
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,139
Secretary Powell has the highest

1959
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:48,266
trustworthy ratings of all of us.

1960
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:51,436
What if he gave an address
to the UN

1961
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,271
and the American people

1962
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,356
to push this over the finish line?

1963
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,567
Karl, I have been very vocal,

1964
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,986
very vocal about my reservations
about invading Iraq.

1965
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:03,740
Oh! Colin, you're such
a nervous Nellie.

1966
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,867
- We are talking about invading...
- A worry wart.

1967
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,619
- ...a sovereign nation...
- Sovereign nation?

1968
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,913
- ...without any provocation, Don.
- RUMSFELD: Don't give me that...

1969
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,372
POWELL:
It is a sovereign nation, Don.

1970
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:12,874
RUMSFELD: ...in any way, shape,
or form. You're wrong.

1971
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,167
POWELL:
What's the exit strategy?

1972
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,461
What, what about the intelligence?

1973
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,171
- Does intelligence matter to you at all?
- The exit strategy. Oh, please.

1974
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,672
- You break it, you bought it.
- You know you're wrong.

1975
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,216
- You break it, you bought it.
- You're a chicken-shit.

1976
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:23,176
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, all right.

1977
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,802
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

1978
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,054
Let-let's slow down.

1979
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:28,681
That's enough of that,
you guys.

1980
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:29,933
Well, are you...

1981
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:34,103
gonna take Saddam down or not?

1982
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,273
You are the president.

1983
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,696
War... is yours.

1984
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,910
Not the UN,
not some coalition.

1985
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,954
Do not share powers...

1986
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:53,790
that are yours alone.

1987
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,464
(inhales deeply)

1988
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:04,676
George, make sure Powell sees
the intelligence.

1989
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,386
TENET: Yes, sir.

1990
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,554
GEORGE W. BUSH:
Colin, I want you to make that speech.

1991
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,640
I'm president,
and I want this to happen.

1992
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:11,766
- TENET: Yes, sir.
- HUGHES: Yes, sir.

1993
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,559
POWELL: Yes, sir.

1994
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:15,436
I look forward to being briefed
on that intelligence.

1995
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,189
On another note, I've been
handed a credible report

1996
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,776
of a small terrorist enclave
in North Eastern Iraq.

1997
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:22,860
If we're gonna invade,

1998
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,654
we suggest taking it out before.

1999
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:26,531
Let it go, George.
We have bigger fish to fry.

2000
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,700
Let me see that intelligence.

2001
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,326
- TENET: Of course.
- (clears throat)

2002
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,288
KURT:
<i>That classified document</i>

2003
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:37,709
<i>described a terrorist named
Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi</i>

2004
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:40,044
<i>who had started
as a drug dealer and pimp</i>

2005
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,629
<i>before becoming fully radicalized</i>

2006
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,965
<i>in a Jordanian prison.</i>

2007
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,135
<i>Zarqawi went to meet
bin Laden in Afghanistan.</i>

2008
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,762
Did he or did he not meet
with AI-Qaeda?

2009
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:54,392
KURT: <i>But Zarqawi had vowed
to kill all Shia Muslims,</i>

2010
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,770
<i>and bin Laden's mother was Shia.</i>

2011
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,856
<i>So the meeting didn't go over well.</i>

2012
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:01,482
They had no operational contact.

2013
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:02,817
Hogwash.

2014
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,820
POWELL:
Larry, have you seen this speech?

2015
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:07,447
Yes, sir. It's bone-thin.

2016
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,033
I saw at least five pieces
of disproved intel in there.

2017
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,159
Who wrote it?

2018
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,577
They said it was the president,

2019
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,911
<i>but I think you can guess
who really wrote it.</i>

2020
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,997
Well, there's no need to yell, Larry.

2021
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:20,376
Yeah, well,
we reviewed the speech,

2022
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,086
we gave some notes.

2023
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:27,383
Powell really doesn't have
a clue, does he?

2024
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,886
KURT:
<i>After the US invaded Afghanistan,</i>

2025
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:32,597
<i>Zarqawi set up shop in Iraq.</i>

2026
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,266
<i>It was the only connection Cheney had</i>

2027
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,143
<i>between AI-Qaeda and Iraq.</i>

2028
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:39,645
<i>The Security Council will now begin</i>

2029
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:43,649
<i>its consideration
of item two of the agenda.</i>

2030
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:45,651
<i>I call now on the distinguished</i>

2031
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,028
<i>Secretary of State</i>

2032
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:48,863
<i>of the United States
of America,</i>

2033
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,491
<i>His Excellency,
Mr. Colin Powell.</i>

2034
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:54,285
<i>My purpose here today
is to share with you</i>

2035
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:55,661
<i>what the United States knows</i>

2036
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:58,873
<i>about Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction</i>

2037
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:01,793
<i>as well as Iraq's involvement
in terrorism.</i>

2038
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:04,796
<i>Iraq, today, harbors
a deadly terrorist network</i>

2039
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,715
<i>headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,</i>

2040
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,009
<i>an associate and collaborator...</i>

2041
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:12,678
KURT: <i>Powell's UN address was
seen by millions of Americans,</i>

2042
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:15,264
<i>but other people
were watching as well.</i>

2043
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,100
POWELL:
<i>Collaborator of Osama bin Laden</i>

2044
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:18,684
<i>and his Al-Qaeda lieutenants...</i>

2045
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,521
<i>Zarqawi's activities are not confined...</i>

2046
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,939
KURT:
<i>The great general of America</i>

2047
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,816
<i>saying his name over and over again</i>

2048
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:27,402
<i>immediately made Zarqawi a star.</i>

2049
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:29,320
POWELL (on TV):
<i>Staying in the capital of Iraq...</i>

2050
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:30,696
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

2051
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,949
KURT: <i>Within a day,
he had gone into hiding.</i>

2052
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,868
ALL: <i>Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!</i>

2053
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:38,871
POWELL: <i>...but these denials
are simply not credible.</i>

2054
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:41,332
<i>They are simply not credible.</i>

2055
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:43,668
<i>An AI-Qaeda source
tells us that</i>

2056
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,753
<i>Saddam and bin Laden
reached an understanding</i>

2057
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:48,089
<i>that Al-Qaeda would no longer</i>

2058
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,508
<i>support activities against Baghdad.</i>

2059
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,218
KURT:
<i>By the time we invaded Iraq,</i>

2060
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:54,470
<i>70 percent of Americans thought</i>

2061
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:57,014
<i>that Saddam Hussein
was involved in 9-11.</i>

2062
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:02,103
<i>Later, Colin Powell would call the speech</i>

2063
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,856
<i>the most painful moment of his life.</i>

2064
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,441
(whispers)

2065
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:08,734
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

2066
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:12,363
MARY: And what was it?
Justin, right?

2067
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:13,865
LIZ: She can buy
her album now, Mom.

2068
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,700
HEATHER: What was
the girl's name that won?

2069
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,827
- No, Kelly. And then Justin.
- Last year.

2070
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,328
CHENEY:

We watched it.
You've seen it.

LIZ: Yeah, you...

2080

CHENEY: Do you know how
to stop a fish from smelling?

2081
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,014
LIZ: Very appropriate.

My fellow citizens,

American and coalition forces

2102
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:44,539
are in the early stages
of military operations

2103
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:47,750
to disarm Iraq,
to free its people

2104
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:50,086
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

2105
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:54,340
On my orders, coalition forces
have begun striking

to wage war.

2109
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,891
These are opening stages
of what will be

2110
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:07,478
a broad and concerted campaign.

2111
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:10,356

Hi. Um...

2130
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:37,026
It seems like they've been
shipping men and equipment

out of Afghanistan, into Iraq,

2132
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,741
and at the moment,
we're a little unsure

As you know, the no-bid
contracts they received

2142
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,982
were quite sizable, and now...

2143
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:19,360
Well, we're not concerned,
are we?

2144
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:20,319
Not at all.

2145

the same fucking Zarqawi

a major insurgence in Iraq.

2189
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:33,452

it's because we talked him up.

Has POTUS seen this?

2191

KURT:
<i>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</i>

<i>had taken his fame
from Powell's UN speech</i>

<i>on the bottom of a stack of papers...</i>

2203

<i>to just do whatever the hell he wanted.</i>

2205
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:11,782
<i>And what he wanted...</i>

2206
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,368

<i>And death versus life.</i>

2210
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:28,841
<i>And on top of that,</i>

2211

2241
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:49,421
<i>There is a chorus of people calling</i>

2242
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:52,174
<i>for Vice President Dick Cheney
to step aside and resign.</i>

2243
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:54,843
REPORTER 2: <i>These issues may
not be resolved for some time.</i>

2244
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:56,053
Go away!

2245
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:05,604
(sighs)
I swear to God

2246
01:48:05,688 --> 01:48:07,731
this whole place
is turning against me.

2247
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,902

2248
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,988
<i>- CHENEY: Where are you?
- I'm in an empty office</i>

2249
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:15,447

2250
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:18,742
<i>Listen, if we could just get</i>

2251
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:20,160
an air bombardment in Iraq,

2252
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,912
I think it would make a statement

2253
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,747
<i>and it would give us
some political cover.</i>

2254
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,582
It's over, Don.
(clears throat)

2255
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:26,792
RUMSFELD:
<i>What's that?</i>

2256
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:29,211
What is?

2257
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:30,587
CHENEY:
<i>It's over.</i>

2258
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:31,922
<i>President wants you
to step down.</i>

2259
01:48:32,006 --> 01:48:33,424
<i>He appreciates your service.</i>

2260
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:40,681
Don?

2261
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:46,729
Well, does, uh...

2262
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:48,981
Bush's kid want me out
or do you?

2263
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,153
I can't win every fight, Don.

2264
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,821
You are a little piece of shit.

2265
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:01,368
<i>Wow. How did you become
such a cold son of a bitch?</i>

2266
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:03,454
CHENEY:
<i>I'm sorry, Don.</i>

2267
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:05,873

01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,047
'Cause I wouldn't be.

2271
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:20,846
Think they'll prosecute us?

2272
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:26,977
Okay, then.

2273
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:31,356
Okay, then.

KURT:
Few years later,

2280
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:12,815
Dick's heart trouble started up again.

2281
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:16,276
And with no donor available,

2282
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:19,404
he finally found himself
at death's door.

2283
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:24,284
(indistinct chatter)

2284
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:27,079
LYNNE: Well?

2285
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:31,166
I wish I had... I had better news.

2286
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,502
Your heart just isn't pumping
enough oxygen

2287
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,003
to keep your vital organs alive.

2288
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:39,466
Should I call for a minister?

2289
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:42,678
No, no.
He's not going anywhere.

2290
01:50:45,347 --> 01:50:46,849
Okay, then.

2291
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,562
Dick Cheney,

2292
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,314
you are not going anywhere,
do you hear me?

2293
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:56,733
You're not going anywhere.

2294
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:57,943
This may be the, uh...

2295
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:00,821
one time, I, uh,

2296
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:01,822
I can't do...

2297
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:05,159
- what your mother says, girls.
- (Lynne sniffles)

2298
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,579
(chuckles softly)

2299
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,790
- (clears throat)
- (Mary sniffles)

2300
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:15,669
(kisses)

2301
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:17,254
- MARY: I love you, Daddy.
- CHENEY: I love you, Mary.

2302
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:20,591
I love you, Lizzie.

2303
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,718
And we love you so much.

2304
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:25,596
We love you so much.

2305
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,930
My girls.

2306
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,475
(sniffling)

2307
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:34,521
I love you, girls.

2308
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:40,944
(Cheney sighs)

2309
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:53,248
So Dick Cheney told his family
that he was ready to die

2310
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:55,334
and that he wasn't afraid.

2311
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:58,587
He told them he had lived a full life

2312
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:00,005
and that he had zero regrets...

2313
01:52:00,088 --> 01:52:01,006
- (grunts)
- (tires screech)

2314
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,403
(sirens wailing)

2315
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:47,761
(helicopter blades whirring)

2316
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:52,224
(indistinct chatter)

2317
01:52:52,307 --> 01:52:54,935
NURSE: Vice President Cheney,
cross your arms, please.

2318
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:59,106
There you go.
Okay, on a count of three.

2319
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:00,691
One, two, three.

2320
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,863
They say my heart could
give him another ten years.

2321
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:12,744
Cheney doesn't like to refer
to it as someone else's heart.

2322
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:15,330
He likes to refer to it
as his new heart.

2323
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:19,293
Which, even though I'm dead,
I have to say...

2324
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,587
still makes me feel pretty shitty.

2325
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:28,176
<i>And so, when Liz decided
to run for one</i>

2326
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,262
<i>of Wyoming's two Senate seats</i>

2327
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:33,765
<i>against Republican incumbent Mike Enzi,</i>

2328
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:35,600
<i>our Dick was right there</i>

2329
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:39,146
<i>to hopefully see the Cheney legacy
of power continue.</i>

2330
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,107
ENZI: <i>Are you aware Wyoming
Senate candidate Liz Cheney</i>

2331
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:43,650
<i>supports gay marriage?</i>

2332
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,402
<i>Her sister is married
to another woman,</i>

2333
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:47,446
<i>and Liz Cheney refuses to support</i>

2334
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:50,741
<i>a constitutional amendment
banning same-sex marriage.</i>

2335
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,075
<i>Instead, she equivocates,</i>

2336
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,952
<i>claiming it's a states rights issue.</i>

2337
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:55,787
<i>Don't you agree Wyoming deserves</i>

2338
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:58,206
<i>a senator who believes
marriage should be</i>

2339
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,833
<i>between a man and a woman?</i>

2340
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:01,918
These calls went
to every house in Wyoming.

2341
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:04,755
Every single house.

2342
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:09,259
I will never win.

2343
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,221

2346
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,902
who is running for the Senate
from the state of Wyoming.

2347
01:54:26,985 --> 01:54:28,362
According to one poll,

2348
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:31,073
she is behind by double digits.

2349
01:54:31,156 --> 01:54:32,240
Welcome.

2350
01:54:32,324 --> 01:54:33,408
Thank you

2351

Great to be with you.

<i>And may I point out,

2360
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,636
<i>Let me be very, very clear.</i>

01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:57,766
<i>I do not support gay marriage.</i>

2362
01:54:57,849 --> 01:55:01,686
<i>I believe that marriage
is between a man and a woman.</i>

2363
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,979
CHRIS:
<i>But you've always claimed</i>

2364
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,815
<i>gay marriage is a state issue.</i>

2365
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:08,110

2411
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:04,114
- MARTHA: Ready?
- Hmm.

2412
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:07,867
MARTHA:
Two-thirds of Americans say

2413
02:00:07,951 --> 02:00:11,287
the Iraq War is not worth fighting.

2414
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:13,790
And they're looking at the value gained

2415
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:15,875
versus the cost in American lives

2416
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,419
and Iraqi lives.

2417
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:18,586
So?

2418
02:00:20,255 --> 02:00:23,341
So, don't you care what
the American people think?

2419
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:28,471
No, uh, I think you, uh,

2420
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:31,057
cannot be, uh,

2421
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:32,475
blown off course.

2422
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:35,186
(clears throat)

2423
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:36,438
(sighs)

2424
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:45,447
I can feel your recriminations...

2425
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:48,032
and your judgment...

2426
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:50,535
and I am fine with it.

2427
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:56,249
You want to be loved,
go be a movie star.

2428
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:01,713
The world is as you find it.

2429
02:01:01,796 --> 02:01:04,716
You gotta deal with that reality.

2430
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:07,385
And there are monsters in this world.

2431
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:12,807
We saw 3,000 innocent people

2432
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:15,810
burned to death by those monsters.

2433
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:17,270
And yet you object...

2434
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:19,773
when I refuse

2435
02:01:19,856 --> 02:01:22,192
to kiss those monsters on the cheek

2436
02:01:22,275 --> 02:01:24,652
and say "pretty please."

2437
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,196
You answer me this.

2438
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:30,950
What terrorist attack
would you have let go forward

2439
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:35,205
so you wouldn't seem like
a mean and nasty fella?

2440
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:39,000
I will not apologize...

2441
02:01:40,585 --> 02:01:42,170
for keeping your family safe.

2442
02:01:43,588 --> 02:01:45,298
And I will not apologize...

2443
02:01:46,299 --> 02:01:48,718
for doing what needed
to be done...

2444
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:52,222
so that your loved ones

2445
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:53,890
can sleep peaceably at night.

2446
02:01:58,561 --> 02:01:59,604
(sniffs)

2447
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:02,524
Has been my honor...

2448
02:02:04,025 --> 02:02:05,235
to be your servant.

2449
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:08,696
You chose me...

2450
02:02:10,448 --> 02:02:13,284

Sorry to interrupt,
But Mark wanted

2479
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:10,086
to share something
with everyone.

2480
02:05:10,169 --> 02:05:12,588
Something's been bothering me
this whole movie,

2481
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,674
and I just figured it out.

2482
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:16,551
The whole thing's liberal.

2483
02:05:16,634 --> 02:05:18,553
It's got a liberal bias.

2484
02:05:18,636 --> 02:05:20,805
Interesting.
Does anyone else feel that way?

2485
02:05:22,098 --> 02:05:24,559
One, two, three, four people.
Yeah, go ahead.

2486
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:27,103
It's all facts. Right?

2487
02:05:27,186 --> 02:05:29,272
I mean, they had to vet all this
with a lawyer.

2488
02:05:29,355 --> 02:05:30,440
How does that make it...

2489
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:33,818
- What's liberal about that?
- You would say that, lib-tard.

2490
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:35,611
Okay, I'm sorry.

2491
02:05:35,695 --> 02:05:37,739
So, because I have the ability
to understand facts,

2492
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:38,990
that makes me a liberal?

2493
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,408
WOMAN:
Okay, guys, let's just take it down.

2494
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:42,452
You probably like Hillary.

2495
02:05:42,535 --> 02:05:44,120
- Let's take it down a notch or two, okay?
- MAN: Idiot.

2496
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:46,581
Okay, first of all,
Hillary's not president. Okay?

2497
02:05:46,664 --> 02:05:49,542
The-the-the orange Cheeto
that you hired

2498
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:50,793
is the president
and he's ruining the country...

2499
02:05:50,877 --> 02:05:52,879
Trump is the best thing
in this country.

2500
02:05:52,962 --> 02:05:53,963
You chicken-shit!

2501
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:55,757
<i>John! Now, come in, please.</i>

2502
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,300
WOMAN 2: <i>Hey, guys, come on.</i>

2503
02:05:57,383 --> 02:06:00,219
- WOMAN: Guys! Guys!
<i>- Stop it. Knock it off!</i>

2504
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:01,888
I can't wait to see the new
<i>Fast and the Furious</i> movie.

2505
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:03,514
That looks lit.
