1
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,195
Colm?

2
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,131
Are you coming out
to the pub, Colm?

3
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,304
It's 2:00, like.

4
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,812
Will I see you down there, so?

5
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,484
I'll see you down there, so.

6
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,832
What are you doin' home?

7
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,499
Brother?

8
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,669
What are you doin' home?

9
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:25,006
I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.
He's just sitting there.

10
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,741
Sitting there doin' what?

11
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,543
Sittin' there doin' nothing.

12
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,677
Smoking.

13
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:31,646
Was he asleep?

14
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,380
He was smoking, Siobhan.

15
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,382
How do you smoke
in your sleep, like?

16
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,451
Have ye been rowing?

17
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,786
We haven't been rowin'.

18
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,256
I don't think
we've been rowin'.

19
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,493
Have we been rowin'?

20
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,668
Why wouldn't he
answer the door to me?

21
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,572
Maybe he just
doesn't like you no more.

22
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,633
Pint, Jonjo.

23
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,040
Is Colm not with you?

24
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,742
No.
Colm's always with you.

25
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,978
I know.
Did you not knock for him?

26
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,179
I did knock for him.

27
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,514
Well, where is he?
Just sittin' there.

28
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,982
Sittin' there doin' what?

29
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,349
Sittin' there doing nothin'.

30
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,252
Smokin'.

31
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,687
Have ye been rowin'?

32
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,156
I don't think
we've been rowin'.

33
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,422
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

34
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,959
It does sound
like we've been rowin'.

35
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:53,326
Will I try him again?

36
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,929
That'd be the best thing.

37
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,572
Officer Kearney.

38
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,044
Never says "hello."

39
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,345
Never fecking says "hello."

40
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,889
Colm?

41
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,736
Colm?

42
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,107
The door was open, Colm.

43
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,685
Colm?

44
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,818
Where the hell
are you headin' off to?

45
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,891
- Everybody?
- No, this is true.

46
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,759
He scored six points
from open play.

47
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,197
He was barely
the size of a dwarf!

48
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,265
This is true!

49
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,005
- Howdo.
- Howdo, Padraic.

50
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,039
Sit somewhere else.

51
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,174
Huh?

52
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,281
Uh... But I have
me pint there, Colm.

53
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:54,682
He has his pint there, Colm,

54
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,184
from when he came in
and ordered his pint before.

55
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:58,719
Okay.

56
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,821
I'll sit somewhere else, so.

57
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,631
Are ye rowin'?

58
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,199
I didn't think we were rowin'.

59
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,433
Well, ye are rowin'.

60
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,635
Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside

61
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,270
on his own
like a whatchamacallit.

62
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,506
It does look
like we're rowin'.

63
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:24,211
Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.

64
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,147
See what all this
is fecking about.

65
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,782
That'd be the best thing.

66
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,886
Now I'm sittin' here
next to you,

67
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,220
and if you're
goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside,

68
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,856
and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.

69
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,428
Now, if I've done somethin'
to ya,

70
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,595
just tell me
what I've done to ya.

71
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,164
And if I've said
somethin' to ya,

72
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,132
maybe I said somethin'
when I was drunk,
and I've forgotten it,

73
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,701
but I don't think I said
somethin' when I was drunk,
and I've forgotten it.

74
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,669
But if I did,
then tell me what it was,

75
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,671
and I'll say sorry
for that too, Colm.

76
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,274
With all me heart,
I'll say sorry.

77
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,945
Just stop running away
from me like some fool
of a moody schoolchild.

78
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,948
But you didn't
say anything to me.

79
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,518
And you didn't
do anything to me.

80
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,486
That's what
I was thinking, like.

81
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:09,557
I just don't like you no more.

82
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,202
You do like me.

83
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,137
I don't.

84
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,207
But you liked me yesterday.

85
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,742
Oh, did I, yeah?

86
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,778
I thought you did.

87
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,076
Padraic.

88
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,110
Dominic.

89
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,047
What's the matter with ya?

90
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,150
There's nothing the matter
with me, for God's sake.

91
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,484
Look at this I found.

92
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,286
A stick with a hook.

93
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,788
What would you use it for,
I wonder?

94
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,058
To hook things
that were the length
of a stick away?

95
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,460
Where you goin'?

96
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,594
Down here.

97
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,296
As good a plan
as any!

98
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,631
Have you any fags?
No.

99
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,766
Uh, you do.
You always have fags.

100
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,503
ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's
handing out a rake of fags.

101
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:29,637
Whoever's in the mood for one.

102
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,871
Is he?
No!

103
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,879
You're behavin' awful unusual.

104
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,894
What are you doin' here?

105
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,365
Was the pub closed?

106
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,768
No, it was open.

107
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,074
Anything in the paper?

108
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,744
Just the Civil War still.
Ugh.

109
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,747
A bad do.

110
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,428
Mrs. McCormick's
comin' over later, Padraic.
I couldn't avoid her.

111
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,897
I don't know if you're
gonna be in or out,
but you're usually out.

112
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,600
Am I?

113
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,467
You are.
Yeah, you know you are.

114
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,069
I don't care, Siobhan.

115
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,671
This is your house, too.

116
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:08,002
Is it six years since your
mammy and daddy died, Siobhan,

117
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,804
or is it seven years
since they died?

118
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,875
It's coming up to eight years,
Mrs. McCormick, aye.

119
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,411
Is it comin' up
to eight years?

120
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,915
Doesn't time be flyin'?

121
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,050
Aye, when you're havin' fun.

122
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,718
Oh, be off
to the pub now, Padraic,

123
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,153
if you're gonna
be annoyin' us.

124
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,355
I don't have to be down there
every night, do I?

125
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,963
ColmSonnyLarry's
scared him off, I suppose.

126
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,234
What did you hear
of ColmSonnyLarry?

127
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,470
Didn't you and he used to be
the best of friends?

128
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,805
We're still
the best of friends.

129
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,307
MRS. McCORMICK:
No, you're not.
Who says we're not?

130
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,374
She says.

131
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,776
Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.

132
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,946
I said nothing of the like,
Mrs. McCormick!
I was just chatting.

133
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,948
Now, you go off
to Jonjo's, Padraic,

134
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,449
and don't be getting
under our feet.

135
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,918
Sure, Mrs. McCormick
never gets a chance
to come over for a chat.

136
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,588
She never gets a chance
'cause you avoid her.

137
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:00,888
I do not avoid her!

138
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,224
You hide behind walls
if she's coming up the road.

139
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,227
I do not!

140
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,062
h... hide behind walls.

141
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,909
Good luck to ye.

142
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,346
Whatever it is
you're fightin' about.

143
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,146
I didn't hear
there was to be a session.

144
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,682
Last-minute thing.

145
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:02,316
Colm decided.

146
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,656
All the ladies love Colm,
you know. Always did.

147
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,157
Yeah? That's not true.

148
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
You're still barred,
Dominic! Out!

149
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,162
You said barred until April.

150
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,297
What are we now?

151
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,164
April.

152
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,566
Well, put that stick
outside anyways,

153
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,900
and don't be
bothering the women.

154
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,135
There's women?

155
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,903
There is women.

156
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,238
And good ones.

157
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,750
<i>♪ Well, I took out my dog</i>

158
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:38,620

<i>♪ All down</i>
<i>in the County Kildare...</i>

160
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:48,095
If we sat next to Colm,
the women would have
to talk to us too,

161
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,331
and then we could get at them
with our small talk.

162
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,866
I'm happy enough
sittin' here, now.

163
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,835
Are ya, yeah?

164
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,203

165
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,038

Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

169
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:05,846
To dance to.

170
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,115

that mope whining.

172
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,295

enough trouble with him
without your mouthing?

173
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,531
What trouble in
are you in with him?

174
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,332
Uh, he just...

175
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,636
doesn't want to be friends
with me no more.

176
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,139
What is he, 12?

177
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,579
Why does he not
want to be friends
with you no more?

178
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,529
Shh.

179
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,234
Daddy'll kill us
if we wake him
when he's been wanking.

180
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,429
You won't get into trouble
for taking his poteen?

181
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,063
I will get into trouble,

182
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,032
but fuck it.

183
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:37,971
I saw cannon-fire
and rifle-fire
on the mainland tonight.

184
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,741
Did you see it?

185
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,543
That'll be the Civil War.

186
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,243
I know that, sure.

187
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,313
Me, I pay no attention
to wars. I'm agin 'em.

188
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,282
Wars and soap.

189
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,788
I tell you this much.

190
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,757
We're good at chatting,
aren't we?

191
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,224
Me and you?

192
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:04,064
Your sister,
does she like to chat?

193
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,167
Not as much as most women,
but she'll chat, like.

194
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,402
She more likes reading.

195
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:10,605
Reading?

196
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,508
Feckin' hell.

197
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,309
Reading.

198
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,349
And did you ever see her
with no clothes on?

199
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,621
I didn't.

200
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,624
Did you not,
and you her brother?

201
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,060
Not even as a child?

202
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,530
I don't like to be chattin'
about these types
of things, Dominic!

203
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:36,664
What types of things?

204
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,398
Sisters with no clothes on!

205
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,300
You saw my daddy
with no clothes on.

206
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,937
And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.

207
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,539
Sure, don't I know it.

208
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,643
The tiny, brown cock on him.

209
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:58,620
What's the matter with him?

210
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,390
Maybe bad news he's had?

211
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,859
Daddy?

212
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,161
No, ColmSonnyLarry.

213
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,564
Didn't I tell ya
I'd be off if you went

214
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:11,633
whining about that lummox
one more time?

215
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,570
I tell ya, it didn't look like
he had bad news tonight.

216
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:18,573
It looked like
a weight was lifted
from his shoulders tonight.

217
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,550
Just bringing me cows past.

218
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,483
What?

219
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,919
I was just bringing
me cows past.

220
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:40,220
I wasn't, you know,
trying to...

221
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,023
You don't usually
bring them this way.

222
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,256
I don't,
but then the little fella

223
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,492
took a fright
at a hen on the corner, so...

224
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,330
I only...

225
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,335
I only just saw what month
we changed to yesterday.

226
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,274
More fool me?

227
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,848
Changed to April.

228
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:16,924
So, will I be callin' for ya
on me way to the pub later?

229
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,663
I will so.

230
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,398
Anyways,

231
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,000
I better chase
after these goons

232
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,702
for they're gettin' away
from me.

233
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,807
Maybe they don't
like me no more neither.

234
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,445
See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

235
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,218
Why don't you come down
for a sherry later?

236
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,622
There's no need
to be stuck inside
on a nice day.

237
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,925
I will so.

238
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,959
How's the book?

239
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:55,429
It's sad.

240
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,831
Sad?

241
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,733
Well, you should read
a not sad one, Siobhan,

242
00:19:58,766 --> 00:19:59,934
else you might get sad.

243
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,303
Hmm.

244
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,913
Do you never
get lonely, Padraic?

245
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,518
Never get what?

246
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,353
Lonely.

247
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:23,658
Do I never get lonely?

248
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,930
What's the matter
with everybody?

249
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,900
Jesus.

250
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,972
"Lonely." Fecking hell.

251
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,418
Colm?

252
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:27,955
Pint, Jonjo.

253
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,700
How's he seem?

254
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:42,469
Grand, I think.
With me, anyways.

255
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,380
What are you doing?

256
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,050
Oh, so you're gonna be
an eejit again today, is it?

257
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,152
Amn't I allowed to have a
quiet pint on me own, Padraic?

258
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,487
Well, don't ask a man
to call up to ya
at your fecking house, so,

259
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,989
like he has nothing better
to do with his fecking time.

260
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,258
I didn't ask you to call up
to me at me house.

261
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,561
And you do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

262
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:07,762
Huh?

263
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:10,531
You do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

264
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,600
I know I've nothing better
to do with me fecking time,

265
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,702
but there's better things
I could be doing
with me fecking time

266
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,871
than to be calling up to ya
at your house, Colm Doherty!

267
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,606
Like what?

268
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,074
Huh?

269
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,876
Like what else
could you be doin'?

270
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:24,679
Reading.

271
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:25,847
Reading, yeah?

272
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,349
Me, this morning...

273
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,520
this I wrote.

274
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:06,721
Tomorrow, I'll write
the second part of it.

275
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,290
And the day after, I'll write
the third part of it.

276
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,759
And by Wednesday,
there'll be a new tune
in the world,

277
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,762
which wouldn't have been there
if I'd spent the week

278
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,031
listening to your bollocks,
Padraic Suilleabhain.

279
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,268
So, do you want
to take your pint outside,

280
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:23,070
or do you want me
to take my pint outside?

281
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,538
I'll take my pint outside,

282
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,173
'cause it's a shite tune
anyways,

283
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,909
I wouldn't bother with it.

284
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,473
I was too harsh yesterday.

285
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,777
Yesterday, he says.

286
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,346
I know well
you was too harsh yesterday.

287
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,580
And today.

288
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,749
I just, uh...

289
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:14,689
I just have this tremendous
sense of time slippin' away
on me, Padraic.

290
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:17,158
And I think I need to spend
the time I have left

291
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,193
thinking and composing.

292
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,430
Just trying not to listen

293
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,765
to any more of the dull things
that you have to say
for yourself.

294
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,201
But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.

295
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,604
Are you dying?

296
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,139
No, I'm not dying.

297
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,043
But then you've loads of time.

298
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:37,345
For chatting?

299
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:39,113
Aye.
For aimless chatting?

300
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:42,717
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.

301
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:46,554
So, we'll keep
aimlessly chatting

302
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,789
and me life'll keep dwindling.

303
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:52,793
And in 12 years,
I'll die with nothin'
to show for it

304
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:56,197
bar the chats I've had
with a limited man,
is that it?

305
00:24:57,598 --> 00:25:00,835
I said,
"Not aimless chatting."

306
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:04,105
I said,
"Good, normal chatting."

307
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,208
The other night,
two hours you spent
talking to me

308
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,977
about the things you found
in your little donkey's shite
that day.

309
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,246
Two hours, Padraic.
I timed it.

310
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,815
Well, it wasn't me
little donkey's shite, was it?

311
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,818
It was me pony's shite,
which shows how much
you were listenin'.

312
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,254
None of it helps me,
do you understand?

313
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,857
None of it helps me.

314
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:33,701
We'll just chat
about somethin' else then.

315
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,393
What's the matter with ya?

316
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,694
Nothin'.

317
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,163
Aren't we going for a sherry?

318
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:03,664
Don't feel like it.

319
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:08,669
No, I'm not having this
again today!

320
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,142
Hey! What the hell's
going on with you
and me fecking brother?

321
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,777
Don't come in here
shouting the odds at me

322
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:18,279
in the middle
of the fecking day,
all right, Siobhan?

323
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:19,814
You can't just all of a sudden

324
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,449
stop being friends
with a fella!

325
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,350
Why can't I?

326
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:26,487
Why can't ya?
Because it isn't nice.

327
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:27,556
Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?

328
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:28,789
No!
Righty-ho.

329
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:30,291
Has he said somethin' to ya
when he was drunk?

330
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:31,759
No, I prefer him
when he's drunk.

331
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,727
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.

332
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,564
What's the fecking
matter, then?

333
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,031
He's dull, Siobhan.

334
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:38,999
He's what?

335
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,168
He's dull.

336
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:47,274
But he's always been dull.
What's changed?

337
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:49,710
I've changed.

338
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:53,747
I just don't have
a place for dullness
in me life anymore.

339
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:58,052
But you live
on an island off the coast
of Ireland, Colm.

340
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:01,021
What the hell
are you hoping for, like?

341
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,190
For a bit of peace, Siobhan.
That's all.

342
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,827
For a bit of peace
in me heart, like.

343
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:10,998
You can understand that.
Can't ya?

344
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,375
Can't ya?

345
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,287
Do you think I'm dull?

346
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,757
No. 'Cause you're not dull,
you're nice.

347
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,026
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.

348
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,828
Or I was.

349
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,398
Till me best friend started
acting the gilly-gooly.

350
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:19,900
It's him, Padraic.

351
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,103
Maybe he's just depressed.

352
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,740
That's what I was thinking,
that he's depressed.

353
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,210
Well, if he is,

354
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,545
he could at least
keep it to himself, like.

355
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,346
You know, push it down,
like the rest of us.

356
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,551
- No, Jenny!
- Out!

357
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:37,885
Out!

358
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:41,690
She just wants
a bit of company, Siobhan.

359
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,357
Animals is for outside,
I've told ya.

360
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:52,333
And people don't be laughing
at me behind me back,

361
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,668
do they?

362
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:54,969
No. Why would they be?

363
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,404
They don't think
I'm dim or anything?

364
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,173
Dim?

365
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:00,908
No.

366
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,978
You don't seem
very sure about it.

367
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,879
Of course, I'm sure about it.

368
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,950
Dominic's the dim one
on the island, isn't he?

369
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:13,120
He is, aye. By miles.

370
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,924
Uh, hang on, by miles.

371
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,627
And then,
who's the next dimmest?

372
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,994
Well, I don't like
to judge people

373
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,262
in those terms now, do I?

374
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,863
In what terms?
In order of their dimness.

375
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,699
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?

376
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:25,766
But try, like.
No!

377
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,201
I won't try.

378
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:30,404
There's enough judgy people
on this fecking island, so no!

379
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,372
You're not dim!

380
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:34,241
You're a nice man, all right?
So, move on!

381
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:37,746
I'm as clever as you, anyways.

382
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,879
I know that at least.

383
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:41,081
Yeah,
don't be fecking stupid.

384
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:42,684
Huh?

385
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,264
What happened to you?

386
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:32,701
Me daddy discovered
the poteen situation.

387
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:33,967
Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

388
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,903
You poor thing, ya.

389
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,739
What the hell
was he hittin' you with?

390
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,106
A kettle was the final thing.

391
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,974
I wouldn'ta minded,
but for the spout.

392
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,010
Do you want a ride to church?

393
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,579
Uh, feck them gobshites!

394
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:45,879
Dominic!

395
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:48,650
But could I stay the night
with ye the night?

396
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,084
Just for the one night, like?

397
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:52,052
Mm...

398
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:54,823
Well, just
the one night, mind.

399
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:57,592
Nice! I'll see ye
for supper, so.

400
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,159
Whoo-hoo!

401
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,405
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

402
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:47,207
It's eight weeks
since my last confession,
I think.

403
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,476
Go on, Colm.

404
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,880
Just the usual,
I suppose, Father.

405
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:55,015
The drinking
and the impure thoughts.

406
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,518
And a bit of pride, I suppose.

407
00:31:56,551 --> 00:32:00,187
Although I never really
saw that as a sin,
but sure I'm here now.

408
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,122
And

409
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,025
how's the despair?

410
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,663
Not so much of it of late.
Thanks be.

411
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:13,467
And why aren't you talking
to Padraic Suilleabhain
no more?

412
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,772
That wouldn't be a sin, now,
would it, Father?

413
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:22,142
It wouldn't be a sin, no,
but it's not very nice either,
is it?

414
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,446
Who told you?

415
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:28,550
It's an island, Colm.
Word gets around.

416
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:33,187
Also, Padraic asked me
to put in a word, like.

417
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,122
I see.

418
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,190
So...

419
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,294
It isn't him you have
the impure thoughts about,
is it?

420
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,430
Are you joking me?

421
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:46,366
I mean,
are you fecking joking me?

422
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,904
People do have impure thoughts
about men, too.

423
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:52,239
Do you have impure thoughts
about men, Father?

424
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,276
I do not have
impure thoughts about men.

425
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,581
And how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth?

426
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:01,315
Well, you started it.

427
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,318
Well, you can get out
of my confessional
right now, so you can.

428
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,086
And I'm not forgiving you
any of these things

429
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,655
until the next time,
so I'm not!

430
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,591
Well, I better not be dying
in the meantime then,
eh, Father?

431
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:10,625
I'll be pure fucked!

432
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:12,861
You will be pure fucked!

433
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:16,396
Yes, you will be pure fucked!

434
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,213
Pint, Colm?

435
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,184
If you don't
stop talkin' to me,

436
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,753
and if you don't
stop botherin' me,

437
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:41,221
or sendin' your sister
or your priest to bother me...

438
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,857
I didn't send me sister
to bother you, did I?

439
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,224
She has her own mind.

440
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:46,193
Although, I did send
the priest though,
you have me there.

441
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:48,730
What I've decided
to do is this.

442
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,899
I have a set of shears
at home.

443
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:53,902
And each time you bother me
from this day on,

444
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,503
I'll take those shears

445
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,505
and I'll take one
of me fingers off with them.

446
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,974
And I'll give
that finger to ya.

447
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,877
A finger from me left hand.
Me fiddle hand.

448
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:05,045
And each day
you bother me more,

449
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:06,781
another I'll take off
and I'll give ya

450
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:09,182
until you see
sense enough to stop.

451
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,219
Or until I have
no fingers left.

452
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:14,354
Does this make things
clearer to ya?

453
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,124
Not really, no.

454
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:18,191
Because I don't want

455
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,594
to hurt your
feelings, Padraic.

456
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,662
I don't, like.

457
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,429
But it feels like the drastic

458
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:23,898
is the only option
left open to me.

459
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,433
You've loads of options
left open to ya.

460
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,603
How's fingers
the first port of call?

461
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:32,840
Please, don't talk to me

462
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,843
no more, Padraic. Please.

463
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:37,311
I'm begging you.

464
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,246
- But...
- Shush, like, Padraic.

465
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,749
Just, you know, shush, like.
Yeah, I'd shush, like.

466
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,551
I will shush.

467
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,789
Except me and me sister
were thinking

468
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:51,191
you might just be
a bit depressed, Colm.

469
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:55,329
And I tell you this much,
fingers just confirms it.

470
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:59,166
Don't you think, Colm?

471
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,503
Starting from now.

472
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,356
Well, I never heard the like.

473
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,759
I never heard the like.
He must really not
like you, Padraic.

474
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,126
Fingers!

475
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,729
Jesus. He's serious, lads.

476
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:28,663
He is serious!

477
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:30,497
You can see it
in his eyes he's serious.

478
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,332
Just because
he thinks you're dull.

479
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:33,801
That's going overboard!

480
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,637
Who told you about the dull?

481
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:38,072
Well, I overheard it.

482
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,907
Like, what was I
supposed to do?

483
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,475
I don't think you're dull.

484
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,645
And jeez, if I was
to cut something off meself

485
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:47,481
for every dull person
that came in here,
I'd only have me head left.

486
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:48,883
Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

487
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,150
No.

488
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,453
That said,

489
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,958
I did think the two of ye
always made
a funny pairing, like.

490
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:59,027
- No, we didn't.
- Yeah, ye did.

491
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,595
Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

492
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:03,497
'Cause now he'd rather
maim himself than talk to ya.

493
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,800
Colm was always
more of a thinker.

494
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,868
Huh?

495
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:08,770
Why's every... I think.

496
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:09,671
Ah, you don't, Padraic.

497
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:11,438
You don't, Padraic.
Your sister does.

498
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,440
Your sister does, aye.
Siobhan does.
You're more of a...

499
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,976
You're more of a...
What is he?

500
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,011
You're more one
of life's good guys.

501
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,179
You're more one
of life's good guys, aye.

502
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:20,414
Apart from when you're drunk.

503
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,717
Apart from when
you're drunk, aye.

504
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,753
I used to think
that'd be a nice thing to be.

505
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:27,789
One of life's good guys.

506
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:30,558
And now, it sounds like
the worst thing I ever heard.

507
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,060
Ah, don't take it
like that, Padraic.

508
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,995
Don't take it
like that, Padraic.

509
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:35,530
We're on your side.

510
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,278
What are you smiling at?

511
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:18,338
What's this mope so mopey for?
He's just a fecking man, lads!

512
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,974
A fat, ginger man!

513
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,309
Ay yi yi.

514
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,079
I'll tell ya this much.
Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

515
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:27,782
Luckily, you won't have
to put up with us
more than one night, so,

516
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:29,550
and try eatin'
with your mouth closed.

517
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,152
Where are we now, France?

518
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,520
Will you tell him, Padraic?

519
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:35,089
Aye, stop being a little
fecking bollocks, Dominic.

520
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:37,324
No. Just about
the mouth thing.

521
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,696
Colm Doherty
and his fat fecking fingers.

522
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,864
He probably
wouldn't even be able

523
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,199
to cut through the blubber
on them fingers.

524
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,567
Would you not want him
to have to do the one finger

525
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:48,102
to see
if he was bluffing, like?

526
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,237
No, we wouldn't.

527
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,638
That's what I'd have him do,

528
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,907
I'd have him do the one finger
to see if he was bluffin'.

529
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,108
'Cause worst comes to worst,

530
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,611
he can still play the fiddle
with four fingers,
I'll bet ya.

531
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,045
Or the banjo.

532
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,180
We don't want any of that.

533
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:00,548
We just want nothing
to do with him no more.

534
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,750
You don't. This gom does.

535
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,719
I am a gom, is right.

536
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:06,988
You're not a gom!

537
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,957
Jeez.

538
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:12,059
This is a depressing house.

539
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,228
Would you prefer your own, so?

540
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:16,030
I've heard it's a barrel
of fecking laughs.

541
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:18,633
Well, touche.

542
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,467
Too what?

543
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,937
Che. Touche.
It's from the French.

544
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,318
And how is it, Siobhan,
that you was never married?

545
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:43,524
It's none of your
fecking business

546
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:45,660
how I was never
fecking married.

547
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:46,761
How isn't it?

548
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,830
How isn't it?

549
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,731
Was you never wild?

550
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:55,269
Wild? Was I never wild?

551
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:57,138
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Dominic.

552
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,372
Wild, how? Angry?

553
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,242
'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,
I can tell ya!

554
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,677
Not angry. Wild.

555
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,477
You just keep
sayin' wild, Dominic!

556
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,180
Wild!
My brother told you,
didn't he?

557
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:07,380
That you'd be out in the road

558
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,317
if you started
talking stupid to me?

559
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,952
He said creepy, not stupid.

560
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,920
Well, you've failed
on both counts, haven't ya?

561
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:13,955
I have.

562
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,358
I'm off to bed
and he's not stayin' here
another night, Padraic.

563
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,161
I don't care
how depressed you are.

564
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,963
I'd rather have the donkey in.

565
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,203
Foiled again.

566
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:31,371
But "faint heart"
and all that.

567
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:40,948
Here.

568
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:45,086
Ye two, ye'll be all right.

569
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:47,955
Will we be?

570
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:38,806
Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I've the milk outside for ya.

571
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,641
So, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, I think.

572
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,109
Nobody has a lick of news

573
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:44,812
for us from your side
of the island, Padraic.

574
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,347
Are you going
to be the same as them?

575
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,615
I am, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I'm afraid.

576
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,550
And I'm in a bit
of a rush, so...

577
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:52,687
Eileen Coughlan had no news.

578
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,089
Vincent Shaughnessy
had no news.

579
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,758
It was a poor old week
for news. But then it is,
sometimes.

580
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:01,128
ColmSonnyLarry,
he had no news.

581
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:02,430
Did he not?

582
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,332
That man never talks.

583
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,033
Eh, he talks sometimes.
Up himself.

584
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:08,936
Aye, aye, anyways, so,
it's the two weeks you owe me
for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

585
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,237
As I was sayin'.

586
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,010
Ladies.

587
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:16,877
Oh, it's Peadar.

588
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,113
Peadar always
has a rake of news.

589
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,882
- What news have you, Peadar?
- News, is it?

590
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,685
Fella killed himself,
over Rosmuck way.

591
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,620
Walked into a lake
for himself.

592
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:29,323
Twenty-nine and nothing wrong
with him, the fool.

593
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,825
God love us!

594
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,260
No,
not "God love us." Fool!

595
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:34,395
Another fella,

596
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:35,863
Protestant, of course,

597
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,299
stabbed his missus
in Letterkenny.

598
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:40,201
Six times he stabbed her.

599
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,570
Good God!
And did she die, Peadar?

600
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,071
She did die, aye.

601
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:46,340
It wasn't with a spoon
he was stabbin' her.

602
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:47,808
That's a lot of news.

603
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:51,445
This man has no news,
don't ya not? No-Newsy!

604
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:54,882
- Stukes never have news.
- Stukes!

605
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,050
Funny.

606
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,420
There was a bit of news
I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

607
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:01,555
Dominic Kearney's father
beat Dominic senseless

608
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:02,890
with a kettle Saturday,

609
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:04,825
and is staying with me
and me sister, Dominic is.

610
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,560
So, at least his father'll
take a bit of a break

611
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:07,795
from his beatin' of him.

612
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,498
And him, a policeman.

613
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,600
Isn't that news?

614
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,269
Ar, that Dominic's
an awful little bollocks.

615
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,470
That's no news.

616
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:18,806
Still, he was in a bad way
when I came upon him.

617
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,175
I'd beat him
with a kettle meself
if I wasn't old.

618
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,544
It's news is all I'm sayin'.

619
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,813
That's no news.
That's shite news.

620
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,882
Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan,
thanks for the...

621
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,184
I'll see ya when I see ya.

622
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:53,641
And you can tell
that skitter of a son of mine

623
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,176
he'd better be home
by teatime,

624
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,512
or it's over to batter
the both of ye I'll be,

625
00:42:57,546 --> 00:42:59,246
and your dreary
fecking sister, too!

626
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:11,092
Oh, hello there, Colm.

627
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:13,761
Will I see you
at Jonjo's tonight
for that pint you owe me?

628
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,229
I owe you no pin...

629
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,231
You will, Peadar.

630
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,732
Good man yourself.

631
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:31,805
Whoa, stand.

632
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:33,374
Stand.

633
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,508
What's that, Jenny?

634
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,344
Will we go to the pub
for ourselves?

635
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,548
We will. Come on.

636
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,067
One drink you're havin', lady,
then it's off home with ya.

637
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,970
I've a shirt that
wants ironing for the morning.

638
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:45,939
Okay, Daddy.

639
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:49,343
Aye. Off to the mainland
in the morning I'm headin'.

640
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,513
That's why I need
the clean shirt, like.

641
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:55,382
"And why are you off
to the mainland
in the mornin', Peadar?"

642
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:58,285
Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.
I'll tell ya why.

643
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,920
They've asked
for extra manpower

644
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,922
for a couple of the
executions

645
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:04,191
in case there's
any kind of a to-do, like.

646
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:06,795
Six bob and a free lunch
they're payin' me.

647
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,896
And sure I'd have gone
for nothin'.

648
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,800
I've always wanted
to see an execution,
haven't you?

649
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,735
Although, I'd have
preferred a hanging.

650
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:15,235
Who are they executin'?

651
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:18,506
The Free State lads
are executin' a couple
of the IRA lads.

652
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,576
Or is it the other way around?

653
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:25,714
I find it hard
to follow these days.

654
00:47:25,747 --> 00:47:28,048
Wasn't it so much easier
when we was all
on the same side,

655
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:30,150
and it was just the English
we was killin'?

656
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:33,020
I think it was.
I preferred it.

657
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:35,089
But you don't care
who's executin' who?

658
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:37,424
For six bob and a free lunch,
I don't care!

659
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,561
They could be
executin' you.

660
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,029
Why don't you come with me?

661
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:44,566
You could write
a miserable feckin' song
about it.

662
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,036
Nah, I'm only messin'.

663
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:15,462
Who are them?

664
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:18,198
Music students, I think,
from Lisdoonvarna.

665
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:32,547
Another whiskey,
anyways, Jonjo.

666
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,784
Jeez, you're goin' at it
at a fair old lick
tonight, Padraic.

667
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:38,218
Yeah? What's it to ya?

668
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,484
Padraic, don't now...

669
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,657
Go get Siobhan,
Dominic, would ya?

670
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:21,529
What are you
after, gobshite?

671
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:22,963
Another beatin', is it?

672
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:25,299
You, copper, I'm allowed
to chat to you, aren't I?

673
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,401
It's just tubbyguts
I'm not allowed to talk to.

674
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:29,571
Actually, no, I'd rather
you didn't talk to me neither.

675
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:32,005
Oh, well, anyways,

676
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,876
do you want to know
what the three things
that I hate the most

677
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,276
on Inisherin is?
Not really.

678
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:37,679
One,

679
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:39,647
policemen.

680
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,950
Two,

681
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,183
pudgy fiddle players.

682
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:46,286
And three...

683
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,690
Wait, I had some funny thing
for three. What was it?

684
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:51,626
Uh, I'll start again. One, um,

685
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,794
policemen.

686
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:54,228
Two...

687
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,898
Pudgy fiddle players.

688
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,099
Pudgy fiddle players.

689
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:00,602
And shite, what was three?

690
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:02,837
Go on back
to your own gang now, Padraic.
I'm serious, now.

691
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:04,137
Serious, are ya?

692
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:09,042
And talkin' to me, are ya?

693
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:12,145
Siobhan!

694
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:16,918
Padraic's out of his brains
on whiskey, and Colm's there.

695
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,485
You'd better come.

696
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:28,095
You, Colm Doherty,
do you know
what you used to be?

697
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:30,297
No, Padraic,
what did I used to be?

698
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,398
Nice!

699
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,668
You used to be nice!

700
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,069
Didn't he not?

701
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,405
And now,
do you know what you are?

702
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,841
Not nice.

703
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,676
Ah, well,

704
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:45,513
I suppose niceness
doesn't last then,
does it, Padraic?

705
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:47,381
But will I tell ya something
that does last?

706
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:50,183
What? And don't say
somethin' stupid like music.

707
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,319
Music lasts.
Knew it!

708
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:55,289
And paintings last.
And poetry lasts.

709
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,424
So does niceness.

710
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,395
Do you know
who we remember

711
00:51:01,428 --> 00:51:03,932
for how nice they was
in the 17th century?

712
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:06,233
Who?
Absolutely no one.

713
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,336
Yet we all remember
the music of the time.

714
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,438
Everyone, to a man,
knows Mozart's name.

715
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,775
Well, I don't,
so there goes that theory.

716
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:17,512
And anyway,
we're talkin' about niceness.

717
00:51:17,946 --> 00:51:19,446
Not whatsisname.

718
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:22,784
My mammy, she was nice.

719
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:25,687
I remember her.

720
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,288
And my daddy, he was nice.
I remember him.

721
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:31,191
And my sister, she's nice.

722
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:34,529
I'll remember her.
Forever I'll remember her.

723
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:37,097
- And who else will?
- "Who else will" what?

724
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,601
Remember Siobhan
and your niceness?

725
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:41,502
No one will.

726
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:43,103
In 50 years' time,

727
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:45,472
no one will remember
any of us.

728
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:50,044
Yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago...

729
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:52,312
"Yet," he says,
like he's English.

730
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:54,414
Come home, Padraic.

731
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:58,118
I don't give a feck
about Mozart,

732
00:51:58,586 --> 00:51:59,988
or Borvoven,

733
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,256
or any of them
funny name feckers.

734
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,258
I'm Padraic Suilleabhain.

735
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,063
And I'm nice.

736
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:10,598
Come home.

737
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:13,467
So you'd rather be friends
with this fella, would ya?

738
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:15,036
A fella who

739
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,871
beats his own son
black and blue every night

740
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:17,905
that he's not fiddling
with him.

741
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:22,476
I never told him that, Daddy.
He's... He's just drunk now.

742
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:24,746
You used to be nice.

743
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,782
Or did you never used to be?

744
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:31,819
Oh, God.

745
00:52:34,522 --> 00:52:36,758
Maybe you never used to be.

746
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,709
I'll have a word
with him, Colm.

747
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:57,177
You don't need
to do anything drastic.

748
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,047
He won't be
botherin' you no more.

749
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,515
That's a shame.

750
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:03,316
That's the most interesting
he's ever been.

751
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,886
I think I like him again now.

752
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:12,192
It was the 18th century,
anyway. Mozart.

753
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,327
Not the 17th.

754
00:53:49,731 --> 00:53:52,667
Siobhan Suilleabhain!
Well, well.

755
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,602
I only came in for rashers,
Mrs. O'Riordan.

756
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,070
I've no time to talk,
I'm afraid.

757
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:57,605
Letter came for ya.

758
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:02,275
Fell open, did it?

759
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,811
Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

760
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,753
A job offer, is it?

761
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:22,597
A job offer from a library
on the mainland, is it?

762
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,501
Just the rashers,
please, Mrs. O'Riordan.
About ten of them.

763
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:36,611
You never tell me anything!

764
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,882
Well, it'd crucify him,
your leaving!

765
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,550
Hey, no one's leaving!

766
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:58,933
Listen, I didn't
come down to chat.

767
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,068
I just came down to say
that all that last night

768
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,503
was just
the whiskey talkin', Colm.

769
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:03,638
All what last night?

770
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:05,940
All whatever it was
I was sayin'.

771
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,074
What were you sayin'?

772
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:09,844
Uh... Yeah.
I can't remember much of it,

773
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:12,547
but I remember the gist
of it wasn't the best.

774
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,582
You always know, don't ya?

775
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:20,588
Well, anyways, I just wanted
to say I was sorry.

776
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:21,889
Will we leave it at that?

777
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:25,626
Why can't you just
leave me alone, Padraic?

778
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:28,328
Huh?

779
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,231
I've already told ya,
haven't I?

780
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:31,699
Yeah, I know. I was just...

781
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:33,935
I mean, why can't you
just leave me alone?

782
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,982
What are ya doing?
I don't know.

783
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,885
For fuck's sake, like.

784
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,728
How... How's the new tune?

785
00:56:01,696 --> 00:56:02,697
What?

786
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:19,247
Ar, for God's sake, Padraic.

787
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,581
How many more times?

788
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:23,951
I am not putting
me donkey outside
when I am sad, okay?

789
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,153
Well, stringy bits of shite
I had to pick up

790
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,454
yesterday when ya let her in!

791
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,557
There was no stringy bits
in that donkey's shite.

792
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,026
There was bits of straw,
if there was anything.

793
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,861
Maybe it was straw, so.

794
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,932
I'll get us
our porridge.

795
00:56:57,218 --> 00:56:58,451
Was I awful last night?

796
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,758
No, you was lovely.

797
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,260
Well, I know I wasn't lovely
now, Siobhan.

798
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:08,729
You were lovely.
About me, anyways.

799
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:11,866
Of course
I was lovely about you.

800
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:13,501
What else is there
to be about ya?

801
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:21,002
What was that? A bird?

802
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,404
What was what?

803
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:24,772
The bang at the door.

804
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:26,273
A bird?

805
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:27,508
Aye.
No.

806
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:30,144
What was it, so?

807
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,479
The bang at the door?
Aye!

808
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,247
What was the bang
at the door?

809
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,282
It was, uh...

810
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:36,417
hard to lie...

811
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,986
it was, uh...

812
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,756
a finger.

813
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:46,527
A what?

814
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:47,895
Finger.

815
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:51,332
Jesus, Siobhan!
You'll frighten
the little fella!

816
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:52,767
Throw it out, Padraic!

817
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,969
I'm not throwing
his finger out!
It'll get dirt on it!

818
00:58:58,672 --> 00:58:59,907
Where... Where'd you put it?

819
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,310
Shoebox.

820
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:05,446
Oh, my. Oh, God.

821
00:59:05,479 --> 00:59:06,680
Well,

822
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,050
he's serious, then.

823
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,828
Do we have to have it in here
while we're eating?

824
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:30,197
Once I finish me porridge,
I'll bring it back to him.

825
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:35,336
Are you feckin' stupid?

826
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:38,239
I mean,
are you feckin' stupid?

827
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:40,374
No, I'm not feckin' stupid.
We've had this discussion.

828
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:43,711
You've got to leave him
alone now, Padraic. For good!

829
01:00:44,546 --> 01:00:45,580
Do you think?

830
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:47,948
Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

831
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:50,818
He's cut his
feckin' finger off,
and thrown it at ya!

832
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:53,053
Come on! It wasn't at me.

833
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:57,224
Well, what are we going to do?

834
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:59,293
We can't keep a man's finger.

835
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,388
Jesus, Colm!

836
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,157
Did it hurt?

837
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:33,227
Hurt awful to begin with.
Thought I was going to faint.

838
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:38,432
It's funny, feels fine now,
in all the excitement.

839
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:41,936
Would you like a cup of tea?

840
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:45,105
I won't, Colm. I only came up
to give you your finger back.

841
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:46,941
Oh, yeah?

842
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,410
Thanks.

843
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,113
Cleared up
quite nice, actually.

844
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:55,749
And you wouldn't
have thought it would.

845
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:58,352
What do you need
from him, Colm?

846
01:01:58,385 --> 01:01:59,954
To end all this?

847
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,758
Silence, Siobhan.

848
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,696
Just silence.

849
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:12,466
One more silent man
on Inisherin, good-oh!

850
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:14,101
Silence it is, so.

851
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,673
This isn't about Inisherin.

852
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:19,740
It's about one boring man

853
01:02:19,773 --> 01:02:21,710
leaving another man alone,
that's all.

854
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:25,379
"One boring man"!
You're all fecking boring!

855
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:28,415
With your piddling grievances
over nothin'!

856
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:31,318
You're all fecking boring!

857
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,922
I'll see he doesn't talk
to you no more.

858
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:36,490
Do.

859
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:40,160
Else it'll be all four of them
the next time,
not just the one.

860
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,830
You're not serious.

861
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:47,401
Well, that won't help
your fecking music.

862
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:49,704
Aye.

863
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:51,338
We're gettin' somewhere now.

864
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:57,679
I think
you might be ill, Colm.

865
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:02,449
Do worry sometimes
I'm just entertaining meself

866
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:04,418
while I stave off
the inevitable.

867
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:07,488
Don't you?

868
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,526
No, I don't.

869
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:15,462
Yeah, you do.

870
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:53,494
Declan!

871
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:41,709
Howdo!

872
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,678
Howdo!

873
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:45,045
Do you want a ride?

874
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:47,816
I will so.

875
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,216
Thanks, fella!

876
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:01,563
Oh, no, you're not
that student fella
from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

877
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:03,163
I am. I'm Declan.

878
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:05,032
Why?

879
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:06,400
They told me
at the post office
to try to find

880
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,903
that student fella, Declan,
from Lisdoonvarna.

881
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:10,705
Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

882
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:12,574
From your mammy.

883
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,241
My mammy is no longer with us.

884
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:16,343
Not your mammy, sorry.

885
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:18,680
Did I say your mammy?
Your auntie.
Yeah, your auntie.

886
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,080
It's about your daddy.

887
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:21,816
What about Daddy?

888
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,719
Uh, bread van
crashed into him.

889
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,420
The bread van?
Yeah.

890
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:29,056
They said you'd best
hurry home to him,
lest he should die all alone.

891
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:30,625
Die?

892
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:33,260
Or get worse, all alone.

893
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,631
This is impossible.

894
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:38,131
It's not impossible.

895
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:39,968
Bread vans crash
into people all the time.

896
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,201
I know!

897
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:43,538
That's how me mammy died.

898
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,445
If it's the same fecking
bread van, I'll kill them.

899
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:09,129
Thanks.

900
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,200
What were you talking
to the boat fella for?

901
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:15,570
For none of your fecking
business, I think it was.

902
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:17,939
Of course, it's me business.
Aren't I the law?

903
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:19,473
Fecking knob.

904
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,009
Huh?

905
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,510
Well, you can tell
that whiny brother of yours

906
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:25,013
I'll be around soon
for that battering I owe him.

907
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,514
A battering?

908
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:29,449
That'd be good, actually.
It might take him
out of himself.

909
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:30,885
Huh?

910
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:33,186
You're an awful strange lady.

911
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:35,422
No wonder no one likes ya.

912
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,919
Oh.

913
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:06,453
Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

914
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:11,091
A death shall
come to Inisherin
afore the month is out.

915
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:13,027
A death, huh?

916
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,763
Maybe even two deaths.

917
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:17,832
Well, that'd be sad.

918
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,502
We shall pray to the Lord

919
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:26,106
'tis neither you,
nor poor Siobhan,
will be either of them.

920
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:28,175
Well, is that a nice thing
to be sayin'?

921
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,511
I wasn't trying to be nice.

922
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:33,715
I was trying to be accurate.

923
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:39,520
Fecking hell.

924
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,688
What's the matter?

925
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:16,758
Nothing.

926
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,660
Me daddy say
he's gonna kill you Sunday

927
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:54,862
for spilling the beans
about that fiddling with me.

928
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:01,334
"Kill me," kill me,
or, you know,

929
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,072
"beat me up a bit," kill me?

930
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:06,574
"Beat you up a bit," kill ya,
I think.

931
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:08,743
Although he did
kill a man once.

932
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:15,282
I'm sorry for that spilling
the beans on ya, Dominic.

933
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,985
I was out of order that night.

934
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,655
You was funny
apart from that bit.

935
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:24,058
That's why I don't understand
why that fat fella
threw the finger at ya.

936
01:10:24,092 --> 01:10:25,793
He seemed fine
when you were slagging him.

937
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:27,528
He did not.

938
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:28,763
Did he?

939
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:32,332
"That's the most interesting
Padraic's ever been," he said.

940
01:10:33,433 --> 01:10:34,836
"I think I like him
again now."

941
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:41,609
Aye.

942
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:47,148
Maybe this whole thing
has just been about
gettin' you to try a new tack,

943
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:48,983
start standin' up
for yourself a bit.

944
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:51,119
Do you think?

945
01:10:51,152 --> 01:10:53,921
Yeah, and be less of a,
you know,

946
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:55,022
whiny little dull-arse.

947
01:10:56,824 --> 01:10:59,160
Well, I have been less
of a whiny little
dull-arse, actually.

948
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,460
Have ya, yeah?

949
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:02,462
Just yesterday,
there was this musician fella

950
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:04,397
that Colm was
getting along great with.

951
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:05,533
And what did I do?

952
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,001
I went and sent him
packing from the island.

953
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:09,302
Did ya? How?

954
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,938
I told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy,

955
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:13,674
and he'd have to be rushing
home to him, lest he die.

956
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:18,713
Oh...

957
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:23,751
That sounds like
the meanest thing
I've ever heard.

958
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:26,654
Huh?

959
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:30,658
Well, aye,
it was a bit mean, but...

960
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:33,426
he'll be fine
once he gets home

961
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,395
and he finds his daddy
hasn't been hit
by a bread van.

962
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:40,635
I used to think
you were the nicest of them.

963
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,005
Turns out you're just
the same as them.

964
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,740
I am the nicest of them.

965
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:49,811
Ar, Dominic, now!

966
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:54,882
Well, maybe I'm not
a happy lad, so!

967
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,619
Maybe this is the new me!

968
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:01,823
Aye.

969
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,892
Maybe this is the new me.

970
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:40,393
Howdo!

971
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:42,330
Jesus Christ, Dominic!

972
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,232
Would you ever stop
creeping up on people?

973
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:46,466
You almost gave me
a fecking heart attack!

974
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:47,602
I wasn't creeping up on ya.

975
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:48,736
I was sidling up on ya.

976
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:50,872
Between you
and that ghoul, Jesus!

977
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:53,774
I always call her
a ghoul, too,
because she is a ghoul.

978
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:56,510
Jeez, we have a lot
in common, don't we?
Me and you.

979
01:12:56,544 --> 01:12:58,946
Calling old people
ghouls and that.

980
01:13:01,983 --> 01:13:04,752
It's a great old lake,
isn't it?

981
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,626
I'm glad
I caught you, actually.

982
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:14,494
Because there
was somethin' I was wantin'
to ask ya, actually.

983
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:17,531
And discovering how much
we have in common,

984
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:20,400
well, it just makes me
want to ask you even more.

985
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:21,836
We don't have
anything in common.

986
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:24,305
Uh, don't skip ahead.

987
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:26,774
But yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

988
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,745
Somethin' along
the lines of...

989
01:13:30,778 --> 01:13:33,381
Should've planned
this, really.

990
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:35,616
Well, yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

991
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:43,423
You probably wouldn't
ever want to, I don't know,

992
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:46,661
to fall in love with a boy
like me, would ya?

993
01:13:49,397 --> 01:13:52,300
Oh, Dominic,
I don't think so, love.

994
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:55,503
No, yeah, no.
Uh, I was thinking no.

995
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:01,008
Not even in the future, like?
Like when I'm your age?

996
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:11,819
Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

997
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:14,055
Just thought I'd ask
on the off chance, you know,

998
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:16,691
like, "faint heart" and that.

999
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:24,098
Well, there goes that dream.

1000
01:14:30,237 --> 01:14:31,906
Well,

1001
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:35,776
I best go over there
and do whatever that thing
over there I was gonna do was.

1002
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:37,912
Mm-hmm.

1003
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:57,565
<i>♪ I walked from Mallow Town</i>

1004
01:14:57,598 --> 01:15:00,835
<i>♪ To Aghadoe, Aghadoe</i>

1005
01:15:00,868 --> 01:15:04,605
<i>♪ I took his head</i>

1006
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,240
Come on, Sammy,
you have to dance too.

1007
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:11,912
<i>♪ Like an Irish king he sleeps</i>
<i>in Aghadoe ♪</i>

1008
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:15,383
How are you, fatty?

1009
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:16,717
Dancing with your dog, is it?

1010
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:17,885
Well, who else
is gonna dance with ya?

1011
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:19,520
Your poor dog
has no say in the matter.

1012
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:21,856
And if you're too rude
to be offering me a seat,

1013
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:24,191
I'll be taking
one of me own accord!

1014
01:15:25,826 --> 01:15:28,429
Now, how's that
for an old hello?

1015
01:15:28,462 --> 01:15:30,464
Have you gone fecking mental?

1016
01:15:30,498 --> 01:15:32,501
Have I gone fecking mental?

1017
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:35,903
No, I haven't gone
fecking mental, actually.

1018
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,972
Not only have I not gone
fecking mental,

1019
01:15:38,005 --> 01:15:40,509
but I have ten fingers
to prove I've not gone
fecking mental.

1020
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,210
How many fingers do you have
to prove you've not gone
fecking mental?

1021
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:44,612
Nine fingers.

1022
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:46,981
And nine fingers
is the epitome of mental.

1023
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,918
That's right. The epitome!

1024
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,921
Heh. There'll be none of that!
I didn't come here for licks!

1025
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,256
I came here
for the opposite of licks.

1026
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:56,323
What's the opposite of licks?

1027
01:15:56,357 --> 01:15:57,591
Huh?

1028
01:15:58,426 --> 01:15:59,760
What did you come here for?

1029
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:02,229
I didn't come here
for anythin', did I?

1030
01:16:02,263 --> 01:16:04,365
I just came
to kick your door in
and give you a slagging.

1031
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:05,900
Well, you've done that,
so you can go now.

1032
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:07,768
Haven't finished yet, have I?

1033
01:16:07,802 --> 01:16:09,703
Well, I finished
with your door.

1034
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:11,639
I haven't finished
with your slagging.

1035
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:14,075
We were doin'
so well, Padraic.

1036
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:15,976
I wasn't doing so well.

1037
01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:20,247
I was doing terrible.

1038
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,049
All right,
I was doin' so well.

1039
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:24,385
Yeah, well, it can't all be
you, you, you, can it?

1040
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:25,953
Yes, it can.

1041
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:28,122
There's two of us in this.
No, there isn't.

1042
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:29,457
It takes two to tango.

1043
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,192
I don't want to tango.

1044
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:33,327
Well, you danced
with your dog.

1045
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:48,543
Talkin' of tangos,
how's your new tune
comin' along?

1046
01:16:48,577 --> 01:16:50,978
I just
finished it, actually.

1047
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:52,646
Just this morning.

1048
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:55,584
No, Colm, that's great, like!

1049
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,018
That's why I was dancing
with me dog.

1050
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:00,621
I don't usually dance
with me dog.

1051
01:17:00,654 --> 01:17:03,657
There's no harm
dancin' with your dog.

1052
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:07,228
I'd dance with me donkey
if I knew how. And she did.

1053
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:10,931
Is it good?

1054
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:12,133
Your tune?

1055
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,839
Mm, what's it called?

1056
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:21,976
"The Banshees of Inisherin,"
I was thinking.

1057
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:26,814
But there are no banshees
on Inisherin.

1058
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:29,216
I know, I just like
the double S-H sounds.

1059
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,153
Aye.

1060
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:35,022
There's plenty
of double S-H on Inisherin.

1061
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:35,890
Yeah.

1062
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:39,160
Maybe there are banshees, too.

1063
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:43,063
I just don't think
that they scream
to portend death anymore.

1064
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:48,002
I think they just
sit back, amused, and observe.

1065
01:17:48,603 --> 01:17:49,970
Portend?

1066
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:52,039
Yeah.

1067
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:57,745
I keep having thoughts
about playing it for you
at your funeral.

1068
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:00,347
But that wouldn't be fair
on either of us, would it?

1069
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:17,198
Well, that's great that you
finished your tune, Colm.

1070
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:18,766
That's more than great.

1071
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:20,467
That's...

1072
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:23,170
really great.

1073
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:37,918
So, do you want
to meet me down the pub, Colm?

1074
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,622
We could celebrate
your tune, like.

1075
01:18:47,428 --> 01:18:49,698
Only if you'd like, like.

1076
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,967
But I could run up ahead.
Order them in.

1077
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:57,805
Why don't you
do that, Padraic?

1078
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,275
Why don't I run up...

1079
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,445
and order them?

1080
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,381
Well, I will so.

1081
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,554
Jeez, that went well!
And maybe on the way,

1082
01:19:12,587 --> 01:19:15,155
I can find that student friend
of yours, that Declan fella!

1083
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:16,991
I told him
his daddy was dying,
so he'd feck off home

1084
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:19,827
and leave us alone,
but there's no need now!

1085
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,428
Sure he could join us.

1086
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:16,250
What are you sitting
over there for
when I'm over here?

1087
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:18,886
Just thought I'd have a sit
for meself, you know.

1088
01:20:19,788 --> 01:20:21,322
Wait for me friend.

1089
01:20:21,355 --> 01:20:23,424
Are you fecking joking me?

1090
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:24,992
Your four-fingered friend?

1091
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,528
I mean,
are you fecking joking me?

1092
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,862
No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

1093
01:20:28,896 --> 01:20:31,165
He just needed
a bit of tough love was all.

1094
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:07,334
Siobhan, do you want a sherry?

1095
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:09,002
No.
Righty-ho.

1096
01:21:10,772 --> 01:21:11,872
What are you doin'?

1097
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:13,541
Me?
Yes, you.

1098
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:15,075
Nothing. Just drinkin'.

1099
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:16,644
Not waitin'?
Not waitin'.

1100
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:18,747
Well, he is waitin', Siobhan.
He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

1101
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,814
I amn't waitin'.

1102
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:21,348
He just told me
he was waitin'.

1103
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:22,916
Telltale!

1104
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:29,657
Come home with me, Padraic.
I've somethin' to discuss
with ya.

1105
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:31,458
You've somethin'
to discuss with me?

1106
01:21:32,694 --> 01:21:34,395
That sounds, uh...

1107
01:21:34,428 --> 01:21:36,463
I don't want
to discuss somethin'.

1108
01:21:36,497 --> 01:21:39,667
Well, ya have to,
'cause I'm leavin'.

1109
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:42,269
Leavin'?

1110
01:21:45,305 --> 01:21:46,508
Like leavin'?

1111
01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:49,343
Like...

1112
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:52,212
not staying?

1113
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:57,619
Yeah.

1114
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:42,697
But what about me?

1115
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:43,997
What about you?

1116
01:22:44,031 --> 01:22:45,332
I'll have no friends
at all left!

1117
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:47,769
You'll have Dominic.
Ah here!

1118
01:22:47,802 --> 01:22:49,637
And he's gone off me now, too.

1119
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:52,272
What kind of a place is it
when the village gom
goes off ya?

1120
01:22:53,006 --> 01:22:54,609
And who's gonna
do the cookin'?

1121
01:22:54,642 --> 01:22:57,277
Oh, that's your
first question, isn't it?
"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

1122
01:22:57,311 --> 01:22:58,880
Well, it wasn't me
first question, was it?

1123
01:22:58,913 --> 01:23:01,181
"But what about me?"
was me first question.

1124
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,552
Padraic.

1125
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:40,588
Padraic!

1126
01:23:43,725 --> 01:23:47,261
Now?
But you can't be leavin' now!

1127
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:49,396
I can be leavin' now.

1128
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:52,065
I can't be waitin' round
for any more of this madness!

1129
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:54,569
What the hell
did you say to him, Padraic?

1130
01:23:54,602 --> 01:23:55,803
Nothin' really.

1131
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:59,641
Well, I'd sort of had a chat
with Dominic earlier.

1132
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:02,342
And a new sort of,

1133
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:05,880
you know, standin' up
for meself sort of tack
we thought I should try.

1134
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:07,281
God!

1135
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:10,083
It was all going fine
until he chopped off
all his fingers.

1136
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:20,695
Me books wouldn't fit.

1137
01:24:21,796 --> 01:24:23,998
Would you look
after them for me?

1138
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:25,900
Ar, don't go, Siobhan.

1139
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,802
They're all I have, really.

1140
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:31,539
Apart from the obvious.

1141
01:24:39,146 --> 01:24:41,583
You'll be back soon,
won't you, Siobhan?

1142
01:24:42,215 --> 01:24:44,919
Oh, Padraic!

1143
01:24:44,953 --> 01:24:46,788
Don't say, "Oh, Padraic."

1144
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:49,323
Say yes.

1145
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,688
Ah, Jenny.

1146
01:28:47,662 --> 01:28:48,663
Oh.

1147
01:30:53,087 --> 01:30:54,588
I don't want to talk.

1148
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:57,258
Don't go killin' his dog now.

1149
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:58,426
And don't be puttin' things
in me head

1150
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,627
that weren't there
in the first feckin' place,

1151
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,429
you feckin' nutbag!

1152
01:31:02,263 --> 01:31:04,031
"Nutbag!"

1153
01:31:57,018 --> 01:31:59,053
What would I ever
hurt you for?

1154
01:32:00,721 --> 01:32:02,857
You're the only nice thing
about him.

1155
01:32:32,486 --> 01:32:34,889
How are you, Padraic?
You're lookin' well.

1156
01:32:42,663 --> 01:32:44,031
That's lovely, lads.

1157
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:51,038
I don't need your apologies,
all right?

1158
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,441
It's a relief to me.

1159
01:32:53,474 --> 01:32:54,975
So, let's just call it quits

1160
01:32:55,009 --> 01:32:58,012
and agree to go
our separate ways,
for good this time.

1161
01:33:00,781 --> 01:33:03,684
Your fat fingers
killed me little donkey today.

1162
01:33:03,717 --> 01:33:06,720
So, no, we won't
call it quits.

1163
01:33:06,754 --> 01:33:07,955
We'll call it the start.

1164
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:10,591
You're jokin' me.
Yeah, no.

1165
01:33:10,624 --> 01:33:12,561
I'm not jokin' ya.

1166
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:14,563
So tomorrow, Sunday,

1167
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:16,997
God's day, around 2:00,

1168
01:33:17,031 --> 01:33:19,433
I'm going to call up
to your house
and I'm gonna set fire to it,

1169
01:33:19,467 --> 01:33:21,735
and hopefully
you'll still be inside it.

1170
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,738
But I won't be checkin'
either way.

1171
01:33:27,475 --> 01:33:29,276
Just be sure
and leave your dog outside.

1172
01:33:30,512 --> 01:33:32,680
I've nothing against that gom.

1173
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:37,751
Or you can do whatever's
in your power to stop me.

1174
01:33:40,888 --> 01:33:43,124
To our graves
we're taking this.

1175
01:33:44,658 --> 01:33:46,627
To one of our graves, anyways.

1176
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:49,730
Here.

1177
01:33:49,763 --> 01:33:51,832
I've a bone to pick
with you, dreary.

1178
01:33:51,866 --> 01:33:53,701
Is that little gobshite
of mine at your place again?

1179
01:33:53,734 --> 01:33:55,903
Leave him, Peadar.
His donkey's just died.

1180
01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:57,506
Did he?

1181
01:33:57,539 --> 01:33:59,039
The little miniature fella?

1182
01:33:59,073 --> 01:34:01,775
Well, Jesus, boys,
I'll tell ya this much...

1183
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,022
Two o'clock.

1184
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:18,319
I killed a miniature donkey.

1185
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:24,091
It was by accident...

1186
01:35:27,094 --> 01:35:28,963
but I do feel bad about it.

1187
01:35:31,298 --> 01:35:35,836
Do you think God gives a damn
about miniature donkeys, Colm?

1188
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:39,106
I fear he doesn't.

1189
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:44,411
And I fear that's where
it's all gone wrong.

1190
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:48,082
Is that it?

1191
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:50,985
Is what it?

1192
01:35:51,018 --> 01:35:52,953
Aren't you forgetting
a couple of things?

1193
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:57,124
No, I think I've covered it.

1194
01:35:57,157 --> 01:36:00,894
Wouldn't you say
punching a policeman is a sin?

1195
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:03,598
Ah here.

1196
01:36:03,632 --> 01:36:05,700
If punching a policeman
is a sin,

1197
01:36:05,734 --> 01:36:08,936
we may as well just
pack up and go home.

1198
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:12,873
And self-mutilation is a sin.

1199
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:15,075
It's one of the biggest.

1200
01:36:15,744 --> 01:36:17,077
Is it?

1201
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:20,314
Self-mutilation,
so you have me there.

1202
01:36:20,347 --> 01:36:21,949
Multiplied by five.

1203
01:36:27,288 --> 01:36:29,156
How's the despair?

1204
01:36:33,628 --> 01:36:35,095
It's back a bit.

1205
01:36:37,865 --> 01:36:40,067
But you're not gonna
do anything about it?

1206
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:46,574
I'm not gonna
do anything about it, no.

1207
01:37:01,088 --> 01:37:02,856
<i>Dear Padraic,</i>

1208
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:07,394
<i>I am safely ensconced</i>
<i>in the mainland and, Padraic,</i>
<i>it's lovely here.</i>

1209
01:37:07,428 --> 01:37:10,230
<i>There's a river running</i>
<i>past my window as I write,</i>

1210
01:37:10,264 --> 01:37:12,900
<i>and the people already seem</i>
<i>less bitter and mental.</i>

1211
01:37:12,933 --> 01:37:17,471
<i>I'm not sure why, but I think</i>
<i>it's 'cause a lot of them</i>
<i>are from Spain.</i>

1212
01:37:17,505 --> 01:37:21,008
<i>Mostly, I wanted to say</i>
<i>there's a spare bed here</i>
<i>for you, Padraic.</i>

1213
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:25,245
<i>And with the war almost over,</i>
<i>I think there'd be work</i>
<i>for ya here.</i>

1214
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:27,948
<i>Because there's nothing</i>
<i>for you on Inisherin.</i>

1215
01:37:27,981 --> 01:37:30,552
<i>Nothing but more</i>
<i>bleakness and grudges</i>

1216
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:33,220
<i>and loneliness and spite</i>

1217
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:36,223
<i>and the slow passing of time</i>
<i>until death.</i>

1218
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,292
<i>And sure,</i>
<i>you can do that anywhere.</i>

1219
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:44,231
<i>So come, Padraic. Leave there.</i>

1220
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:47,134
<i>Dominic can look after Jenny</i>
<i>and the rest of your animals.</i>

1221
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,470
<i>They could move</i>
<i>into the house together.</i>

1222
01:37:59,246 --> 01:38:00,247
Hut!

1223
01:38:21,935 --> 01:38:25,105
<i>So come now,</i>
<i>Padraic, please.</i>

1224
01:38:28,676 --> 01:38:31,078
<i>Before it's all too late.</i>

1225
01:41:21,749 --> 01:41:23,417
<i>Dear Siobhan.</i>

1226
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:26,486
<i>Obviously, I don't know</i>
<i>what "ensconced" is,</i>

1227
01:41:26,521 --> 01:41:30,223
<i>but I thank you for the offer</i>
<i>of the free bed</i>
<i>and the whatnot.</i>

1228
01:41:30,257 --> 01:41:32,727
<i>But I won't be takin' you up</i>
<i>on it, I'm afraid.</i>

1229
01:41:33,728 --> 01:41:36,898
<i>As I told you,</i>
<i>me life is on Inisherin.</i>

1230
01:41:36,931 --> 01:41:38,866
<i>Me friends, me animals.</i>

1231
01:41:42,737 --> 01:41:43,805
<i>Even now as I write,</i>

1232
01:41:43,838 --> 01:41:46,040
<i>little donkey Jenny</i>
<i>is looking at me, saying,</i>

1233
01:41:46,074 --> 01:41:48,643
<i>"Please don't go, Padraic.</i>
<i>We'd miss ya."</i>

1234
01:41:48,676 --> 01:41:51,579
<i>And nuzzling me,</i>
<i>the gilly-gooly.</i>

1235
01:41:52,212 --> 01:41:53,715
<i>Get off, Jenny.</i>

1236
01:41:57,085 --> 01:41:58,285
MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

1237
01:42:08,062 --> 01:42:09,864
<i>In other news,</i>

1238
01:42:09,897 --> 01:42:12,399
<i>in sadder news, actually,</i>

1239
01:42:12,432 --> 01:42:15,235
<i>I won't be able to ask Dominic</i>
<i>anything, I'm afraid.</i>

1240
01:42:17,237 --> 01:42:19,807
<i>Because they found him</i>
<i>in the lake this morning.</i>

1241
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:27,280
<i>I suppose he must've slipped</i>
<i>and fell in.</i>

1242
01:42:35,056 --> 01:42:38,291
<i>So, there'd be</i>
<i>no one to take care</i>
<i>of the animals, anyway.</i>

1243
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:03,483
<i>No other news, really.</i>

1244
01:43:12,426 --> 01:43:14,662
<i>Except that</i>
<i>I love you, Siobhan.</i>

1245
01:43:15,797 --> 01:43:16,931
<i>And I miss ya.</i>

1246
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:21,703
<i>And I hope I'll see ya</i>
<i>again someday.</i>

1247
01:43:24,271 --> 01:43:26,206
<i>If you ever come back home.</i>

1248
01:43:28,943 --> 01:43:31,244
Come back home, Siobhan.

1249
01:43:36,117 --> 01:43:39,252
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>
<i>your loving brother...</i>

1250
01:43:41,155 --> 01:43:42,790
<i>Padraic Suilleabhain.</i>

1251
01:45:16,651 --> 01:45:18,853
Suppose me house
makes us quits.

1252
01:45:20,588 --> 01:45:23,658
If you'd stayed in your house,
that would've made us quits.

1253
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:26,459
But you didn't, did ya,
so it doesn't, does it?

1254
01:45:37,872 --> 01:45:40,373
I'm sorry
about your donkey, Padraic.

1255
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:42,409
Honestly, I am.

1256
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:46,714
I don't fucking care.

1257
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:05,733
Haven't heard any rifle fire
from the mainland
in a day or two.

1258
01:46:05,766 --> 01:46:08,636
I think they're coming
to the end of it.

1259
01:46:08,669 --> 01:46:11,973
I'm sure they'll be
at it again soon enough,
aren't you?

1260
01:46:13,708 --> 01:46:16,010
Some things
there's no movin' on from.

1261
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,982
And I think
that's a good thing.

1262
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:44,805
Padraic.

1263
01:46:50,711 --> 01:46:53,581
Thanks for lookin'
after me dog
for me, anyways.

1264
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,855
Any time.
