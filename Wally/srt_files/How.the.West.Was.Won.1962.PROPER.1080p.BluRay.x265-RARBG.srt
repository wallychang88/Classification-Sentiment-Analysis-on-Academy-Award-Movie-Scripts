1
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,730
<i>This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.</i>

2
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,820
<i>But the names and the marks
and the land all had to be won.</i>

3
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,450
<i>Won from nature and from primitive man.</i>

4
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,750
<i>Five generations ago,
a mere 125 years back...</i>

5
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,960
<i>...this land was known only as the West.</i>

6
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,500
<i>Known only to a handful of white men...</i>

7
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,420
<i>...lonely trappers wandering its
vastness in search of beaver.</i>

8
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,680
<i>They were known as mountain
men, a new breed.</i>

9
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,770
<i>Men like Jim Bridger, Franch√®re
and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.</i>

10
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,350
<i>More Indian than the Indians
in all but blood.</i>

11
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,480
<i>They held to no law but their own...</i>

12
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,240
<i>...drifted free as the clouds, settled
nowhere, kept forever on the move.</i>

13
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,240
<i>Their mocassined feet and unshod
horses leaving no trace on the land.</i>

14
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,450
<i>Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...</i>

15
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>...they wanted nothing
beyond what they found, and little of that.</i>

16
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,800
<i>The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...</i>

17
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,470
<i>...were as unchanging
to them as the stars...</i>

18
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,350
<i>...and just as unyielding.</i>

19
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,060
<i>Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...</i>

20
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,940
<i>...they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.</i>

21
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,990
<i>The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...</i>

22
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,450
<i>...look at a forest and see
lumber for houses...</i>

23
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,320
<i>...look at a stony field and see a farm.</i>

24
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,580
<i>Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...</i>

25
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,830
<i>...ever since Plymouth
Rock and Jamestown.</i>

26
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,090
<i>The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.</i>

27
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,760
<i>But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...</i>

28
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,470
<i>...there had to be broader ways.</i>

29
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,180
<i>There were no roads
into the wilderness, only rivers.</i>

30
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,390
<i>And they flowed in the wrong
direction: north or south.</i>

31
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,690
<i>Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.</i>

32
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,610
<i>Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.</i>

33
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,200
<i>He conceived of a river
that would go west.</i>

34
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,700
<i>And in the way Americans have of acting
out their dreams, it came to be.</i>

35
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,540
<i>The Erie Canal left
the Hudson above Albany...</i>

36
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,170
<i>...and carried clear
across to the Great Lakes.</i>

37
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,710
<i>People who yearned for virgin
land and a new life...</i>

38
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,220
<i>...now had a highway to take them.</i>

39
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,970
<i>And they moved along.</i>

40
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,720
Pride of Utica now loading!

41
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,100
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

42
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,900
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

43
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,440
...the Skoga family!

44
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,610
All eight of them!

45
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,320
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

46
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,620
Is the laddie's health
the reason you're heading west?

47
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,910
Partly.

48
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Only partly. Mostly
our trouble East was rocks.

49
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,750
I had me a farm where some years I'd raise
100 bushels of rocks to the acre.

50
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,420
Zebulon, you hadn't ought
to lie to the man like that.

51
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,170
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul,
and I tell the truth as I see it.

52
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,760
Now, I never used a plow. I'd blast
out the furrows with gunpowder.

53
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,850
And then one morning, I hauled
the bucket up out of the well...

54
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,890
...and so help me, the bucket
was full of rocks.

55
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,100
Rocks.

56
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,400
I just stood there right still
trying not to blaspheme.

57
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,980
I said to myself, "You've got
a son that's ailing...

58
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,730
...you've got a daughter what won't
take to herself a husband."

59
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,110
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.

60
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,120
You've got another who don't
seem quite right in the head.

61
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Lilith?

62
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,950
Yes, Pa?

63
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Now, I'll remind you, sir.

64
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,130
I'm still standing there holding
a bucket full of rocks...

65
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,170
...and staring into a bleak old age.

66
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,720
So I made me a vow right
then and there. I said:

67
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,140
"If I can find a man
with $500 who likes rocks...

68
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,970
...then there's gonna be
another fool owning this farm."

69
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,810
Well, sir, the Lord provided
such a man...

70
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,190
...and here I am.

71
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,150
He ain't told you one word
of truth, Mr. Harvey.

72
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,110
We had the best farm in the township.

73
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,650
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.

74
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh, it was not.

75
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,160
It was his itching foot
that brought us here.

76
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,620
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

77
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,170
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.

78
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,500
- How do you do?
- Hello.

79
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,380
I think they're already
acquainted with your daughters.

80
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,010
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.

81
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,470
Well, this Illinois country's beginning
to sound better to me.

82
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,680
Lilith?

83
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,140
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune
for these handsome lads.

84
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,440
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...

85
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,310
...this ain't the time.

86
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,980
All right.

87
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,190
All right.

88
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,490
<i>A captain bold in Halifax Who
lived in country quarters</i>

89
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,330
<i>Betrayed a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters...</i>

90
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,790
Lilith.

91
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,710
Now, you know better
than to sing a song like that.

92
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,210
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."

93
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,170
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.

94
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,380
They haven't had much learning
in the social graces.

95
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,010
All right, give them "A
Home in the Meadow."

96
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,230
Eve, come on, you too.

97
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,440
That's it.

98
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,060
Come on, join in.

99
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
That's it.

100
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,160
Come on.

101
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,080
Stop.

102
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>Loading for the Flying Arrow!</i>

103
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,930
<i>All aboard for the Flying Arrow!</i>

104
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,480
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.

105
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,610
Alec Harvey and three sons!

106
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,240
Jeffrey Rose and family!

107
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,110
<i>But the canal was only the first
step toward the promised land.</i>

108
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,480
<i>The next steps were longer and harder.</i>

109
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,490
<i>Those who could raise the fare went
by steamboat to the end of the line.</i>

110
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,120
<i>Others found a cheaper way
to head for Ohio, Illinois...</i>

111
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,580
<i>...and the open spaces beyond.</i>

112
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,010
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:

113
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,640
"Theirs was a poignant
parting in the forest.

114
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,190
The handsome young backwoodsman
carved two hearts on a tree trunk...

115
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,740
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife
at the junction of the two hearts."

116
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,490
Junction. What's that?

117
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,570
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:

118
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,160
"His marksmanship was uncanny.

119
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,870
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck', he said the first time.

120
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,920
'That was for love. Deep, divine
love', he said the second.

121
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,050
And the third time, 'That was a prayer,
a plea for love undying.'"

122
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,890
Isn't that beautiful?

123
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,720
I reckon. If anybody
ever talks like that.

124
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,060
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

125
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,560
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.

126
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,440
You wanna to be a farm wife, but you
don't wanna marry a farmer.

127
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,650
Neither do you.

128
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,860
Of course not.

129
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,450
I don't wanna have nothing
to do with farms.

130
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,620
I want silk dresses and fine
carriages and a man to smell good.

131
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,620
What I want's back East, not West.

132
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,080
But I'll get there yet. You watch.

133
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,250
You don't know what you want yet.

134
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,590
It's the man that counts,
not where he lives.

135
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,180
- Ready, now? Ready.

136
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,850
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.

137
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,620
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.

138
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,170
They say no honest man
travels this river at night.

139
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,090
I can only see one man, Pa.

140
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,460
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...

141
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,260
...till they're ready to jump you.

142
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,430
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.

143
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,690
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

144
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,690
And keep your hands
where we can see them.

145
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,710
Name's Linus Rawlings.

146
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm hungrier than sin
and real peaceful like.

147
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,880
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.

148
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,550
I said beaver pelts.

149
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,680
I never had a chance to see
a beaver pelt, Mr. Rawlings.

150
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,770
Well, in that case,
ma'am, I'll show you one.

151
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,770
There you are.

152
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,020
That's real soft.

153
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,440
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.

154
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,980
Now, my apologies, sir.

155
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,570
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.

156
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,780
Come on, let's have supper
and get acquainted.

157
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,580
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.

158
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,890
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

159
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,390
Is he the backwoodsman
you've been waiting for?

160
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,430
More than likely he's got a wife
and six kids waiting for him.

161
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,960
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

162
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,510
You've only had four plates. I was beginning
to think you didn't like it.

163
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,800
Well, it don't pay to eat too
much on an empty stomach, ma'am.

164
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,350
How come you're to be
traveling so late at night?

165
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,640
Well, I'm kind of anxious
to get to Pittsburgh.

166
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,140
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.

167
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,900
Well, now, we've never seen
a mountain man before.

168
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,610
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains
as high as they say?

169
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...

170
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,450
Uh...

171
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, you know, that just
ain't exactly true.

172
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,080
Jim Bridger and me...

173
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,340
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

174
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,630
And then, one day, we see this fella...

175
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,100
...and he has a great big
pair of white wings...

176
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,930
...and a harp in his hand.

177
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,640
And I said to Jim...

178
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,600
...l said, "Jim, I don't like the way
that fella's looking at us."

179
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,940
And Jim said he didn't care
too much for it neither...

180
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,190
...so we both skedaddled
down out of there...

181
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,370
...and to this day I ain't never had
a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

182
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,250
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.

183
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,630
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.

184
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,880
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.

185
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,880
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.

186
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,390
Oh, well, that's mighty
hospitable, Mr. Prescott...

187
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,930
...but sometimes I wake
up and get the urge to move.

188
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,350
I might be long gone
by sunup, but thank you.

189
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,060
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.

190
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:05,240
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

191
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,010
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.

192
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,640
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?

193
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,760
Yours.

194
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,850
I ain't ever saw a bed
like that since last time I come east.

195
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,060
Why'd you do it?

196
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,480
Ain't polite to ask a girl why
she done something for a man.

197
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,780
No. Well, I reckon my manners
ain't much at that.

198
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,490
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.

199
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
Are them Indian girls pretty?

200
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,170
Well, now, I reckon that all depends
on just how long a man has gone...

201
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,420
...without seeing one.

202
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,470
How long's it been since you
seen a white girl?

203
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,430
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

204
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
How pretty do I look to you?

205
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,600
But, ma'am...

206
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,400
...ain't you just being
a little bit forward?

207
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,650
Well, you're headed upriver
and I'm headed down.

208
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,570
There's no time to get
these questions answered.

209
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,740
You dead sure you want them answered?

210
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,450
Yes.

211
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,340
Glory be.

212
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,310
Ma'am, it seems
like you've been kissed before.

213
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,020
I've never been kissed permanent before.

214
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,810
By golly, you sure use surprising words.

215
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,150
I never heard "permanent" mixed
up with a thing like a kiss before.

216
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,280
I can still feel that kiss.

217
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,780
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...

218
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,700
...that we had not forget:

219
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,710
I'm heading upstream
and you're headed downstream.

220
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,380
Lovers have parted
before and come together again.

221
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,960
- Ma'am.
- Eve.

222
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,090
Eve, I'm a sinful man.

223
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,890
Deep, dark, sinful.

224
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh
to be sinful again.

225
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,020
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

226
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,900
I won't even remember the fancy
gals I dally with...

227
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,940
...or the men I carve up just
out of pure cussedness...

228
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,730
...any more than I'll remember you.

229
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,200
Linus, I'm asking you. Can
you still feel that kiss?

230
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,490
Eve...

231
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,460
Eve, you make me feel like a man
standing on a narrow ledge...

232
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,710
...coming face-to-face
with a grizzly bear.

233
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,050
There just ain't no
ignoring the situation.

234
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,280
Eve!

235
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,200
Eve!

236
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,620
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?

237
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,790
Anyways, you're here. I thought
you'd gone with him.

238
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,960
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.

239
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,300
I knowed you were setting with him...

240
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,470
...but I kept telling myself, "At
least she's looking at a man."

241
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,390
Even a wisp of smoke
like that is better than...

242
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,810
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?

243
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,020
Now, tell me what that means.

244
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,650
Nothing, Pa.

245
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,980
What time did you come to bed?

246
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,490
It was early, Pa.

247
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,530
It wasn't. It was late.

248
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,330
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

249
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,910
Is there anything for your ma
and pa to worry about?

250
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,580
No, Pa, there ain't.

251
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,060
He'll be back.

252
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,100
I'll see him again.

253
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,020
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.

254
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,360
I don't care. I'll see him again.

255
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,450
Look.

256
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,000
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.

257
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,210
Did you get him to say them crazy words?

258
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,500
I told you before, it ain't
the words, it's the sentiment.

259
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,050
You mean, he didn't even giggle
nor nothing at such foolishness?

260
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,350
He said it was a real solemn occasion.

261
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,180
Like shooting the rapids
without a paddle.

262
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,020
No matter what he said, he did it just
to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

263
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,320
You know that's so.

264
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,320
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna
live like a squaw all your life?

265
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,950
Go on, say anything you like...

266
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,030
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

267
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,500
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

268
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,870
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

269
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,720
Hey, Pierre!

270
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,220
Someone's coming upriver.

271
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
Customer.

272
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,790
Trapper, seems like.

273
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,840
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.

274
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,230
Thirsty, mister?

275
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,940
Drier than a grasshopper
on a hot griddle.

276
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,740
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.

277
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
My name is Jeb Hawkins, late
colonel of the Alabama militia.

278
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,610
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.

279
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,820
Pittsburgh? Well.

280
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,540
Looks like he's got a whole
canoe of furs, Pop.

281
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,910
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.

282
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,670
One of our explorers gonna extend our domain
to the far shores of the Pacific.

283
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,170
Well, nothing but the finest
for you, sir. Whiskey?

284
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,920
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.

285
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,510
Nothing but the pure grain
and the sweet kiss of the malt.

286
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,510
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?

287
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,520
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.

288
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,540
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.

289
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,420
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose
he might know what that varmint is we got?

290
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,210
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.

291
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,720
Sir, we caught us
a cave-dwelling critter...

292
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,970
...that no man in these
parts has seen before.

293
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,390
You know, it'd be right satisfying
to having you tell us what it is.

294
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,560
Well, I don't know too much
about cave-dwelling varmints.

295
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,060
Just yonder. Take your jug.

296
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,730
Well, I...

297
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,740
I don't know.

298
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,630
WO It's right over here.

299
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,100
You know any sweet-talking
gals in Pittsburgh?

300
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,940
No, no. Nary a one, yet.

301
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,440
Well, Pop and I are hoping
we'll vacation there.

302
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,570
I'll be at the Duquesne House
if it ain't burned down.

303
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:13,240
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl,
you sure you got a varmint in here?

304
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,910
Now, you...

305
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,700
WO Do you hear him? Huh?

306
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,330
WO He breathes loud and fierce.

307
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,710
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?

308
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,300
You gotta look a little closer.

309
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,820
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.

310
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,950
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.

311
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,490
He was hard muscled. I could feel
the blade just skitter along his ribs.

312
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,790
Oh, you just need more
practice, that's all.

313
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,330
It's a pity you ain't got
the knack your ma had.

314
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Lord rest her soul.

315
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,840
All right, men, lay it on, men.

316
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
Come on, come on. We
got more fish to fry.

317
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,260
Down to the island.

318
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,900
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.

319
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,090
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?

320
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,220
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?

321
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,970
It's only 15 cents.

322
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Fifteen cents? Put it back.

323
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,440
You're right, sir. Absolutely right. You
save the pennies and dollars will grow.

324
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,230
Likely you've growed many a dollar.

325
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,940
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving
to avoid becoming a millionaire.

326
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,900
I think I've succeeded right well.

327
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,700
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.

328
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,240
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.

329
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,950
Now, you, sir. You look
like a man of property.

330
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,290
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say you
was worth, say, a thousand dollars.

331
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,460
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.

332
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,190
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.

333
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,110
Now, there's women and children here.

334
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,530
You gents wouldn't want us to have
to start shooting, now, would you?

335
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,780
Be of good cheer, folks.

336
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,740
It's in our noble tradition
that we conquer the wilderness...

337
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,330
...with nothing but our bare
hands and stout hearts.

338
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,410
You can build new rafts and sally forth
in the spirit of your forefathers.

339
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,790
Why, you pious old scoundrel.

340
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,210
I'll see you burn.

341
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,470
Americans can't be whipped.

342
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,970
It's him. I knew he'd come back.
It's him.

343
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,080
Now let us pray.

344
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,370
O Lord...

345
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,210
...we thank thee for our salvation.

346
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,050
We commit the souls of our dead
to thy gentle keeping.

347
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,420
We pray for a speedy
recovery of our wounded.

348
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,180
And now another matter.

349
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,770
O Lord...

350
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,600
...without consulting with thee...

351
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,150
...we have sent thy way some souls
whose evil ways passeth all understanding.

352
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,740
We ask thee humbly to receive them.

353
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,490
Whether you want them or not.

354
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,160
Amen.

355
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,010
Now, it'll be a job...

356
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,520
...but I guess I can patch her
up good enough to get to Pittsburgh.

357
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,850
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...

358
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,110
...let's just not talk any more about it.

359
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,690
Linus, I'm telling you, you
don't know your own mind.

360
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,900
Well, maybe so, maybe not.

361
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,490
You know, I ain't saying that you
haven't been on my mind some.

362
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,160
I ain't saying that.

363
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,660
But I still went to see the varmint
with that pirate girl.

364
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,870
I'll always be going
to see the varmint, Eve.

365
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,040
I just ain't cut out to be
a farmer or a husband.

366
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,260
Linus, I ain't never bringing
up the subject again...

367
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,220
...whether ever I see you or not.

368
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,890
No, it's for the best.

369
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,100
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.

370
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,980
And I ain't said that to anybody
for a long time.

371
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,760
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.

372
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,270
Look. Look.

373
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,350
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.

374
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,900
Let's beach her on this side.

375
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,400
Harvey!

376
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,480
Rapids!

377
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,110
Rapids ahead! Beach her!

378
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,610
Beach her!

379
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,120
Hold her steady.

380
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,630
Rein!

381
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,250
Pa, we're in the current!

382
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,090
Get inside, Zeke.

383
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,100
No, I don't wanna.

384
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,020
Straighten her, Pa.

385
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,980
Lilith!

386
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,920
Hold it steady!

387
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,050
I can't!

388
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,420
Go on. Go on to help Pa.

389
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,420
I'll get it.

390
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,940
Lilith! Lilith!

391
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,310
Lie down!

392
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,230
Lie down!

393
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,520
What happened?

394
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,520
They took the wrong fork of the river
and they went over the falls.

395
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,770
Did you happen to hear
the name of the family?

396
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,570
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.

397
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,750
As soon as they're buried decent...

398
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,880
...I'm heading back East
on the first boat that comes along.

399
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,090
And if you were in your right
mind, you would too.

400
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,540
Oh, Linus.

401
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,500
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?

402
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,440
Eve, I...

403
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,650
Eve, all the time I was paddling
down here I was thinking...

404
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,700
...if I found you alive, I'd...

405
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,620
Would you come to Pittsburgh
with me, Eve?

406
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,370
Oh, Linus.

407
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,210
I'm staying right here.

408
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,380
I ain't moving a foot
one way or the other.

409
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,340
Now, would you explain that a little?

410
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,510
Ma and Pa, they wanted
a farm in the West...

411
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,310
...and this is as far as they got.

412
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,560
Seems to me this is where
the Lord wanted the farm to be.

413
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,440
But your brother, Sam, he's bad
hurt, and winter's coming...

414
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,030
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.

415
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,740
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.

416
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,410
Well, half the people that come West
don't make much sense, I reckon.

417
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,040
All right.

418
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,250
All right.

419
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,170
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.

420
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,430
I reckon I seen that varmint
for the last time.

421
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,060
<i>The westward course was no
smoother than that of true love.</i>

422
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:29,650
<i>Not only the hard hand of nature
was against it, but the impediment of war.</i>

423
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,360
<i>Trouble over land smoldered
along the Mexican border.</i>

424
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,160
<i>Not all Americans were for war,
including Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.</i>

425
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,330
<i>But a war did break
out, and in the end...</i>

426
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,330
<i>...vast new territories came into the Union
along with their rich Spanish names:</i>

427
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,420
<i>Rio Grande, Santa Fe,
Albuquerque, El Paso.</i>

428
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,550
<i>And most glittering of all, California...</i>

429
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,430
<i>...named after a mythical island of pearls
and gold in a 15th-century novel.</i>

430
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,430
<i>Here, in 1848...</i>

431
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,140
<i>...at Sutter's Mill, a man found
something he wasn't even looking for...</i>

432
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,770
<i>...at the bottom of a ditch.</i>

433
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,070
<i>And the cry of his discovery was heard
clear across the continent...</i>

434
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,980
<i>...in Boston, New York, Savannah...</i>

435
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,660
<i>...and across the oceans
in London, Paris, Berlin.</i>

436
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:21,040
<i>But nowhere was the clamor of gold heard
more eagerly than in St. Louis...</i>

437
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,710
<i>...the busiest fur-trading
center in the world...</i>

438
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:28,130
<i>...and the noisiest, bawdiest,
most uppity town west of New York.</i>

439
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,340
I say there's no more than three.

440
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,760
- Six.
- Six?

441
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,020
It's that lace that fooled you.
I say three.

442
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,980
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats.
Anyway, you can never prove it.

443
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,190
We're going to be late
for that poker game.

444
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,150
Look, I've just stuck you
for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.

445
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,280
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.

446
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,780
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.

447
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,410
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.

448
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,630
Second girl.

449
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,010
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.

450
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,510
It's rather important.

451
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,260
It's always important.

452
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,010
The older they are,
the more important it gets.

453
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,770
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...

454
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,020
...attorney in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

455
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,190
He means nothing to you?

456
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,650
That old goat?

457
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,440
Well, you must've meant something
to him, Miss Prescott.

458
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,360
- Why?
- You're included in his will.

459
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,280
Of course, you have to make the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

460
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,830
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...

461
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,910
...if John Jacob Astor
left me San Francisco.

462
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,670
I don't think Mr. Astor
had holdings there, no.

463
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,000
However, the yield from Mr. Brooks,
property is not to be scorned.

464
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,470
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

465
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,550
- Gold?
- Precisely.

466
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,390
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.

467
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,680
Gold mine?

468
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,610
Well. Well, l...

469
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,530
That sweet old goat.

470
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,820
For heavens...

471
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,040
Well.

472
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,880
This is an unexpected pleasure.

473
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,300
- Where's the money?
- Money?

474
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,550
Money?

475
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,640
Oh, yes. You're referring,
of course, to our little agreement.

476
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,640
One hundred to start you off...

477
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,600
...and my share of the winnings.

478
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,690
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report
that the hundred no longer exists.

479
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,610
That $100, I assure you...

480
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,360
...will turn out to be the best
investment you have ever made.

481
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,450
I have plans, gentlemen...

482
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,410
...beyond your wildest dreams.

483
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,420
I'm gonna earn you
a piece of a gold mine.

484
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,880
Gold mine.

485
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,090
You ain't gonna earn nothing.

486
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,050
You ain't gonna be nothing,
you ain't gonna do nothing...

487
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,470
...unless we get that 100
back by the morning.

488
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,930
Grimes, you don't mean that.

489
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,930
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.

490
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,020
We'll be waiting.

491
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,710
<i>Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.</i>

492
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,300
<i>Solid, God-fearing families bound
for the farmlands of Oregon...</i>

493
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:49,640
<i>...and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.</i>

494
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,980
Try it.

495
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,980
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.

496
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,400
And a team to pull it?

497
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,950
I can get everything I need.

498
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,160
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.

499
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,620
No traveling companion?

500
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,960
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.

501
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,630
Alone and single brings
out the deviltry in a man.

502
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,130
Gets them all worked up and they're
wild enough already.

503
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,670
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

504
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,090
Oh, woman of your sort?

505
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,060
One day you'd find yourself in trouble,
and there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.

506
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,640
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

507
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,690
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.

508
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,150
Hey, you got a pretty face
under that powder too.

509
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,120
And a fine, sturdy body
under them clothes, I wager.

510
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,200
There's a woman named Clegg, Aggie Clegg.

511
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,410
Why don't you go see her?

512
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,130
Thanks.

513
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,180
I told you, no.

514
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,230
I was hoping to make this
trip with a husband.

515
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,810
Nearly got one last week.

516
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,990
Look, I hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

517
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,740
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.

518
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,240
I need a man.

519
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,370
Any man.

520
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,170
Morning, ladies.

521
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,840
Beautiful morning.

522
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,300
Would you, by any chance, happen
to be Miss Lily Prescott?

523
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,060
Not unless you got a big imagination.

524
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,770
Then you must be the lady in question.

525
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,350
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

526
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,270
At your every command
from here to California.

527
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,650
Well, thank you.

528
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,030
But whatever you're
offering, I don't need.

529
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,610
Perhaps you don't understand.

530
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,030
Yes, I do. I know
a tinhorn when I see one.

531
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,620
Miss Prescott.

532
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,830
I'm offering you an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay.

533
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,620
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.

534
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:26,340
Well, it's been a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Clegg.

535
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:32,010
May I say I have never seen
a woman with more beautiful hair.

536
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,300
What a prize catch it'll make...

537
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,260
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

538
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,310
Beauty alone in the wilderness,
and who's to protect you?

539
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,560
No one.

540
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,860
Not one person won't be
looking after himself.

541
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,240
Well...

542
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,910
Good day, ladies. Good day.

543
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,000
Nobody ever said that to me before.

544
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,960
What?

545
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,170
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.

546
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,180
You know something?

547
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,850
I got a hunch you're gonna draw
men like fish to the bait.

548
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,940
Maybe I can catch one of them
while they swim by.

549
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,150
You got yourself a partner.

550
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,730
Thank you.

551
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,280
How's it, men?

552
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,530
It's all clear through here. Look
for a little mudhole up through the next pocket.

553
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,700
How far? Oh, maybe half a quarter.

554
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,870
Well, thanks. Looks
a little higher up on that ridge.

555
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,920
There's a water hole up there about half a mile.
Let's head for it.

556
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,970
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

557
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,390
Hey, you're driving.

558
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,640
I was raised on a farm.

559
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,520
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

560
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,190
Hey, Aggie?

561
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,690
- Can you use these? Yeah, sure.

562
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,700
Thanks.

563
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,960
Ladies.

564
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,220
At your service.

565
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,970
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

566
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,890
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of you
two making this trip without my help.

567
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,940
If I was to hear later on that something
happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

568
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,570
You came 100 miles alone?

569
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:39,240
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.

570
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,660
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.

571
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,990
I told you, when a wagon breaks
down, I want men who can fix it...

572
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,910
...not bet how long it'll take.

573
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,750
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

574
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,500
Pass me adrift at the mercy
of savage Indians?

575
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,840
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...

576
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,800
Uh-uh-uh. I appeal
to your sporting instinct, sir.

577
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,260
I'm prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

578
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,340
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

579
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,350
The fact is, I hired this man.

580
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,970
We'll put up his stake.

581
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,020
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

582
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,730
If Miss Clegg says so.

583
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,120
Ma'am...

584
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,370
...I'll be forever grateful.

585
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,420
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

586
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,050
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

587
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,220
He says he's a man wanting
to do an honest day's work.

588
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:49,560
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

589
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,520
Hey, you men on that last
wagon, keep up that slack.

590
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,480
Keep it up.

591
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,320
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.

592
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,660
Don't let those lines sag.

593
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,280
Keep them up. Keep them up.

594
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,460
Keep those teams moving.

595
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,340
Keep them moving.

596
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,840
Don't let those lines sag.

597
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,470
You, on that middle
team, keep them moving.

598
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,060
Get in there. Over here, Pa.

599
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,980
Get in there.

600
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,610
Get in there. Get in there, mule.

601
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,400
I'm just overwhelmed by all this
attention, Miss Prescott.

602
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,910
I want to confess...

603
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:36,000
...l have lied about why
I wanted to work for you.

604
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,870
I know.

605
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:42,420
The real reason is, of course,
that I'm in love with you.

606
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,920
No.

607
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,380
It's the truth.

608
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:51,390
From the first moment I saw you, I've known
that I couldn't live without you.

609
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:57,190
Well, I'd hate to be the cause
of your death, Mr. Van Valen.

610
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,480
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.

611
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,940
I'm prepared to assume the responsibilities
of a faithful husband.

612
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:07,400
Oh, and are you ready to assume
the responsibilities...

613
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,990
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?

614
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,910
Really?

615
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,700
What kind of property?

616
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,870
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.

617
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,130
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.

618
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:25,300
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.

619
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,050
Why, I had no idea.

620
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,600
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...

621
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,640
Here comes Agatha. If you
must propose to somebody...

622
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,440
...l suggest you get
on your knees to her.

623
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,150
Besides, she has beautiful hair.

624
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,450
Look at them.

625
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,450
Think they was getting
ready to bury somebody.

626
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,450
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?

627
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,210
Well, let's wake them up.

628
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,750
Listen, everybody.

629
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,420
That's the spirit!
That's the way to feel!

630
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,890
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!

631
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:53,360
Aggie. For lunch.

632
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,950
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.

633
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,580
What is it, Mr. Morgan?

634
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,710
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.

635
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,380
Oh?

636
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,890
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest
woman I ever did see.

637
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,720
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.

638
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,560
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.

639
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,900
Why, for you, childbearing would come
as easy as rolling off a log.

640
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,650
Well, I think I'd rather
roll off a log, Mr. Morgan.

641
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,900
Ma'am, I'm telling you,
you got the build for it.

642
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,120
I want you for my wife.

643
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,040
I've got a cattle ranch
just below the Merced.

644
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,330
I'll be settling down there,
fit and proper.

645
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,880
I'm sure you're very fit
and proper, Mr. Morgan.

646
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,130
Well, then...

647
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,170
...you just couldn't do no
better than marrying me.

648
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,090
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine
family in no time at all.

649
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:03,720
I believe that.

650
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...

651
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,400
...but I can't accept your proposal.

652
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,110
Why not?

653
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,190
Well, a woman likes to hear
something a little more inviting.

654
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,450
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?

655
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,240
Inviting you to share
my life, Miss Prescott.

656
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

657
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,880
It's something else, ain't it?

658
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,130
Must be something else nagging at you.

659
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,050
Well...

660
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,510
...l don't aim to let it
stop me, Miss Prescott.

661
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,600
You can count on that.

662
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,850
What did he want?

663
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,850
Children.

664
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,810
Children?

665
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,360
Well, I'll be...

666
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,820
Why didn't he come shopping
at the right store?

667
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,410
- I'll take a look.
- Well.

668
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,740
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?

669
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,950
I'm gonna see and I'm gonna
raise this fine pistol...

670
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,000
...London-made and loaded for bear.

671
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,880
I'll take part of that bet.

672
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,510
I told you I wouldn't stand
for you fleecing any...

673
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,640
Cheyennes.

674
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:13,310
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.

675
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,060
You can't outrun them with wagons.

676
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,440
The minute you get moving,
cut your teams loose.

677
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:19,530
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.

678
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,740
Chances are they want
our stock more than us.

679
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,820
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.

680
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,970
Keep them closed up there.

681
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,690
I don't know how to unhook them.

682
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,670
Cleve, watch out!

683
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,620
Cleve!

684
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,570
Joe, pick me up.

685
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,080
We'll be moving at daybreak.

686
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:00,410
I'll take a few men, see
if we can find him.

687
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,170
Give him a decent, Christian burial.

688
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,840
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!

689
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,680
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar
a day, and I'll give you a good team.

690
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:03,890
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.

691
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,190
Could you tell me the way
to the Brooks claim?

692
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,810
Well, the claims are down by the river.

693
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,730
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.

694
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,450
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.

695
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,380
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.

696
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,420
You found him.

697
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,890
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.

698
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,310
I figured.

699
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,730
They told me you was a real looker.

700
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,150
Yup. It's all here for you. Just
the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.

701
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,060
Must've had 20 men working on it.

702
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,070
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?

703
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,070
Gold? I ain't never seen a better
grade since I come here with Millie.

704
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,030
It was just a pocket, though.

705
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,500
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.

706
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,330
Oh, we cleared 4200 before it played out.

707
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,710
Now, about that 4200...

708
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,380
Mr. Brooks, he spent
three before his heart give out.

709
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,420
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.

710
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:20,220
I figure the rest you owe me
for sitting on your claim.

711
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:27,100
Oh, miss, I mean,
that's only fair, ain't it?

712
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,480
I mean, wouldn't you...?

713
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,280
Funny pair, all right.

714
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,100
How about you boys? Come and see
the brand-new attraction.

715
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,970
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.

716
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,220
Miss Prescott?

717
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,800
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

718
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:30,520
I'd invite you in,
but it's a little cramped.

719
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,320
This is no life for a fine
woman like you.

720
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,990
I heard your mine was played out.

721
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,040
But where's your fancy friend?

722
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,000
Cleve?

723
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,050
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.

724
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,760
You mean that no-good
went off and left you?

725
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,600
He went off and left me.

726
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,390
But I don't agree that he's no good.

727
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,270
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.

728
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,610
You're a perplexing woman, Miss Prescott.

729
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,740
When a skunk needs killing...

730
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,950
...well, it ain't enough just
to say a skunk's a skunk.

731
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,870
Mr. Morgan...

732
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:35,000
...all my life I've wanted
to marry a rich husband.

733
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,460
Can I blame Cleve for wanting
to marry a rich wife?

734
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,550
Both of us may have been born
for the poorhouse...

735
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,340
...but we're not the kind to like it.

736
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,600
Do you believe all this
you've been saying, or is it just words?

737
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,890
Now, tell me the truth.

738
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,560
The truth is...

739
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:03,820
...Cleve and I couldn't
live alone just on love.

740
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,570
Not for five minutes.

741
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:11,700
Then you've answered the question
I've been asking for better than 2000 miles.

742
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,160
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.

743
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,250
You can't ride across it in a day.

744
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,840
That land's gonna mean money
sooner than you think.

745
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,760
You want a rich husband...

746
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,300
...you're looking at him.

747
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:39,690
There ain't a blessed thing you
have to do except mind the kids.

748
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,900
I'm sorry.

749
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,150
Not now.

750
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,110
Not ever.

751
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,500
What a waste.

752
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,750
Someone put together like you.

753
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,510
Aggie.

754
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:20,730
<i>Those who struck it rich wanted
all the pleasures that money could buy.</i>

755
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,230
<i>And there were plenty to sell to them.</i>

756
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,820
<i>Even the Sacramento riverboats
took on luxury goods.</i>

757
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:52,550
I'll see it.

758
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,010
It's up to you.

759
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,640
Betting?

760
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,850
What's the matter with you?

761
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,070
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?

762
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,110
What's the matter with him?

763
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,200
Lily, I got to talk to you.

764
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,380
I found myself throwing
in a winning hand.

765
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,750
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.

766
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,550
Lily.

767
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:57,880
How'd you like to hook
up with a no-good gambler?

768
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,930
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.

769
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,440
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.

770
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,310
A married man should spend
his evenings at home.

771
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,650
Then we'll open a music
hall in San Francisco.

772
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,320
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.

773
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,450
No. A married woman should
spend her evenings at home.

774
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:22,700
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.

775
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:25,290
Have you seen San Francisco?

776
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:29,120
It's ugly, and it's small,
and it's full of fleas.

777
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,380
And it burns
down about every five minutes...

778
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,420
...but each time they keep on rebuilding
it a little bigger and better than before.

779
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:40,590
It's alive and kicking
and nothing can stop it.

780
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,720
And it makes you wanna
build something too.

781
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,850
A railroad.

782
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,140
A steamship line.

783
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,900
Something to help the baby grow.

784
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,570
Cleve, on $1200?

785
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:57,280
We could start
out with a wagon or a rowboat.

786
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,740
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.

787
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:48,420
<i>Young America was not
only a union of East and West.</i>

788
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,210
<i>There were North and South too.</i>

789
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:54,760
<i>And between them,
the bonds were weakening.</i>

790
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:58,180
<i>Mr. Lincoln, now retired
from Congress and practicing law...</i>

791
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,640
<i>...realized that the South would fight...</i>

792
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:04,980
<i>...to mold the new and uncommitted
territories to its own image.</i>

793
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,610
<i>Still two years from the presidency...</i>

794
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:11,280
<i>...he pleaded that the free West
be allowed to remain free...</i>

795
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,650
<i>...and warned of the hazards
of a house divided against itself.</i>

796
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:19,490
<i>But the South, seeing its
power and influence wane...</i>

797
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:24,290
<i>...struggled against the inevitable
in dozens of Western towns.</i>

798
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:29,790
<i>And slowly, the bitter seeds
of civil war took root.</i>

799
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,330
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.

800
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,710
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.

801
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:18,430
Say, Mr. Peterson,
what's that suit you got on?

802
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:22,760
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.

803
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,730
Our militia company was sworn in...

804
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:29,690
...and I'm Corporal Peterson
now, Ohio Volunteers.

805
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,900
You won't be seeing me for a spell.

806
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,280
Hey, I got a letter for you,
from way out in California.

807
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,200
It must be from my sister, Lilith.

808
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,410
"Dear Eve..."

809
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,380
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?

810
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,460
I wanna answer this right away.

811
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,380
Zeb?

812
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,380
Zeb, come on down here.

813
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:03,600
Well, we was hoping that Zeb
might be going with us.

814
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,810
His pa went when the first bugle blew.

815
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,180
Ain't one enough?

816
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,060
Hi, corporal.

817
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:16,110
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson
some buttermilk.

818
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,570
Buttermilk.

819
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,330
It's from your aunt Lilith.

820
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,710
She says there ain't no war out in California
and they don't expect there'll be one.

821
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,760
"Business is brisk.

822
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,430
Many opportunities
for an energetic young man."

823
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,850
There's talk of building a railroad east.

824
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:49,060
"Cleve has hopes of getting
in on the ground floor.

825
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,480
We would welcome Zeb
if he wants to come."

826
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:56,570
Ma, did you write her about me?

827
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,150
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?

828
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,030
I told her you didn't like farming
any better than your pa did.

829
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,200
Ma, you got the wrong
idea about this war.

830
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:10,120
It ain't gonna be so
bad, is it, corporal?

831
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:12,250
You know Pa's having
the time of his life.

832
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,210
Now, Ms. Rawlings, I got it
from the captain himself...

833
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,840
...that we ain't gonna
be gone no time at all.

834
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:23,010
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.

835
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,800
But you know what he really felt.

836
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:28,760
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much
glory in tromping behind a plow.

837
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:33,520
Reckon there's no hurry
in answering this letter.

838
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,020
Thank you for waiting.

839
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,190
You mean I can go?

840
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:44,530
Oh, there'll be things to do.

841
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,740
Ma...

842
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:54,250
Gotta get your underwear
washed and your socks darned.

843
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:59,420
Do they give you one of them suits?

844
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:02,340
One of them uniforms?

845
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,880
I reckon.

846
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,930
Might not give you no shirts, though.

847
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,970
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.

848
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,560
I got the others washed,
they aren't ironed yet.

849
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:18,440
Mother, I...

850
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,650
Why'd you call me that?

851
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,490
It's always been "Ma" before.

852
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,580
I don't know.

853
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,160
All of a sudden...

854
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,000
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.

855
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,980
Hey, cowpoke!

856
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:53,370
Go on back, dog!

857
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,660
Go on!

858
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:21,060
What could I do, Pa?

859
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,650
He's Linus, boy.

860
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:29,200
Always was more Linus, blood.

861
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,330
I guess that's why I love him so much.

862
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,380
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.

863
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:50,090
Help me pray.

864
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,090
Ohio.

865
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,130
Battery B, Ohio!

866
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,220
- Let's go! On the double, come on!

867
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:38,640
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?

868
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:42,390
Thirty-sixth Indiana.

869
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:48,770
<i>Evening of April 6th, 1862.</i>

870
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,110
<i>The guns that had roared
all day fell silent...</i>

871
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:57,870
<i>...around a little church called
the Shiloh Meeting House.</i>

872
01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:01,910
<i>Many a man had met his God that Sunday...</i>

873
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,750
<i>...but not in church.</i>

874
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:14,130
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.

875
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:18,550
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.

876
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,600
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.

877
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:33,820
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.

878
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,740
Watch it.

879
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,750
Saw. Brandy.

880
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,080
Chloroform.

881
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:50,500
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.

882
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:55,010
Come on, we're just in the way here.

883
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:04,270
<i>It had been the bloodiest day
of the war on the Western front.</i>

884
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:10,150
<i>In the morning, it had looked
like a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...</i>

885
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:15,070
<i>...no man cared to use
the words "win" or "lose."</i>

886
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:19,160
<i>After Shiloh...</i>

887
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:22,870
<i>...the South never smiled.</i>

888
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,840
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.

889
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,890
Well, try it.

890
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:47,850
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.

891
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,730
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.

892
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,400
Pinker than sassafras tea.

893
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:54,690
You mean...?

894
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:57,860
It don't seem fitting a man should
have to drink water like that.

895
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:01,620
Don't seem fitting a man should have to do
any of the things we've done today.

896
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,580
Did you kill anybody?

897
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,910
I don't think so.

898
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,960
I got knocked dizzy right off.

899
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:15,090
And when I come to, found
my rifle, it was busted.

900
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:21,050
And then some more soldiers come
along and tried to stick me in the arm.

901
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,600
All the rest is mixed up after that.

902
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,940
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.

903
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,400
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.

904
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:38,360
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?

905
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:41,740
I don't rightly know anymore.

906
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,540
It ain't quite what I expected.

907
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:55,340
There ain't much glory looking
at a man with his guts hanging out.

908
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,800
- Where are you from?
- Texas.

909
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:03,890
Say...

910
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,180
You ain't a Reb, are you?

911
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:11,060
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.

912
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,360
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.

913
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:19,440
Well, you got anything to shoot with?

914
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,820
No.

915
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,490
All I got's this bayonet.

916
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,160
I got a pistol.

917
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,080
I took it off a dead officer.

918
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,840
Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?

919
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,630
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?

920
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,380
Just leave this here war
to the folks who'd want it.

921
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,520
They say there ain't no
war out in California.

922
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:57,440
Get that battery over here.

923
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:04,820
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!

924
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:16,710
I'm planning to move
Rousseau's brigade into this area.

925
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:22,050
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?

926
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:25,220
I'll approve any dispositions
you wanna make.

927
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,560
If you hadn't held the flank today,
we'd have been whipped for fair.

928
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:34,480
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.

929
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:38,110
Lantern.

930
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,900
You may find yourself in command here.

931
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:47,160
Why?

932
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:53,700
I've seen some of the dispatches the newspaper
correspondents have filed today.

933
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:57,000
They're saying I was taken
by surprise this morning.

934
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:59,840
You weren't taken by surprise.

935
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,250
I was.

936
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,170
No matter.

937
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,670
They're saying...

938
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:09,140
...l was drunk again last night.

939
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:13,520
Were you?

940
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:17,440
No.

941
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:21,060
But you can't fight front and rear.

942
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:23,480
Win or lose, tomorrow...

943
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,110
...l intend to resign.

944
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:30,490
Because of the newspapers?

945
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:35,620
Because of a general lack
of confidence in me.

946
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:38,920
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?

947
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,670
A month ago they were
saying I was crazy. Insane.

948
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,300
Now they're calling me a hero. A
hero or crazy, I'm the same man.

949
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,840
It doesn't matter what the people think.

950
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:51,600
It's what you think, Grant.

951
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,730
You mean that's Grant?

952
01:43:58,690 --> 01:44:00,150
I reckon.

953
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:02,480
General Grant.

954
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:06,190
You know this war's gonna be won
in the West, and how to win it.

955
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,900
Everything you've done proves it.

956
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:14,790
And I say that a man has the right
to resign only if he's wrong.

957
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,080
Not if he's right.

958
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:23,290
I guess I never thought of it that way.

959
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:25,420
I'll think it over.

960
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:27,840
What is there to think about?

961
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:32,220
The Army's better off with you
than without you. That's the test.

962
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:37,600
All right.

963
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,180
Thanks.

964
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,980
There's a lot to do
before morning, Sherman.

965
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,190
What are you doing?

966
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,170
Why did you make me do that?

967
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,010
Fire.

968
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,200
Hey, Zeb!

969
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,560
Didn't you get my letter?

970
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:09,390
I wrote more than four months ago.

971
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:13,770
She never was...

972
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:18,070
...quite the same after she got
the news about Pa.

973
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,410
I don't think she minded
going, Zeb, except...

974
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,330
...she wanted to see you again.

975
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:36,170
Of course Pa ain't really there.

976
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:40,880
I put up a stone anyway.

977
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:01,610
Well...

978
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,410
...better be on my way.

979
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:07,450
Way? Where?

980
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,540
I need you, Zeb.

981
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,170
Only one thing brought me back.

982
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:15,250
She's...

983
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:17,710
Well, this farm is half yours.

984
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:22,470
I was thinking we'd finally clear away
that patch of woods down by the river and...

985
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:26,300
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.

986
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:30,100
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.

987
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:34,270
Sure don't feel right about this.

988
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,940
What are you gonna do?

989
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:37,770
I haven't mustered out yet.

990
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:40,070
I can still transfer to the regulars.

991
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,320
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.

992
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:45,990
Have to fight Indians?

993
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,200
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.

994
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:53,370
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?

995
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:58,840
You remember the story Pa used to tell
us about fighting that grizzly bear?

996
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,090
Yeah.

997
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:03,510
And I asked him, I said, "Well,
why'd you get in such a fix?

998
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,090
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"

999
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:07,800
He said:

1000
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:12,310
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...

1001
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:17,020
I just wanted to go somewhere
and the bear was there first."

1002
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,200
Well, I...

1003
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,960
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.

1004
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:44,670
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.

1005
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:07,160
<i>Even while North and South
were being torn apart...</i>

1006
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:11,200
<i>...East and West had been drawn
together by the Pony Express...</i>

1007
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:13,790
<i>...the most daring mail route in history.</i>

1008
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:17,620
<i>Eighty riders were in the saddle
at all times, night and day, in all weather.</i>

1009
01:51:17,790 --> 01:51:20,590
<i>Half of them riding east,
half riding west...</i>

1010
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:22,880
<i>...between Missouri and Sacramento...</i>

1011
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:27,090
<i>...carrying mail across country
in days instead of months.</i>

1012
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:30,050
<i>Unarmed, they rode to save weight.</i>

1013
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:33,890
<i>Five dollars a letter, the mail
cost, and on thin paper too.</i>

1014
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:37,020
<i>It was courage, skill and speed...</i>

1015
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:42,690
<i>...against hostile Indians, bandits,
hell and occasional high water.</i>

1016
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,650
<i>Even as they rode, men
were already building...</i>

1017
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:50,620
<i>...a faster message carrier
across the country: the Overland Telegraph.</i>

1018
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:53,280
<i>And the Indians found a new amusement...</i>

1019
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:56,620
<i>...listening to the level
tune of the singing wires.</i>

1020
01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:58,920
<i>But far less amusing to the Indians...</i>

1021
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:02,960
<i>...was the coming of the steel
roadway of the iron horse.</i>

1022
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:09,130
<i>The surveyors, route lay through immense
natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...</i>

1023
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,550
<i>...and the equally
discouraging High Sierras.</i>

1024
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:16,640
<i>But range upon range could never
stop the titanic contest...</i>

1025
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:19,310
<i>...between two corporate
giants racing to put down...</i>

1026
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:22,810
<i>...the greatest mileage
of track before they met.</i>

1027
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:27,780
<i>The Central Pacific eastward
from Sacramento through the Sierras.</i>

1028
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:35,700
<i>And the Union Pacific, forging
westward across the plains...</i>

1029
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:37,750
<i>...with the Rockies still to come.</i>

1030
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:43,460
<i>The prize in the race was free land, vast
parcels for every mile of track laid.</i>

1031
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:47,050
<i>Land that would one day
be worth millions.</i>

1032
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:54,010
Hold it.

1033
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:55,970
Set it down.

1034
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:58,680
Workers, up.

1035
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:06,320
Where'd you find them?

1036
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,900
About a mile back yonder.

1037
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,820
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.

1038
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:16,870
What the hell is this? A picnic?

1039
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,750
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.

1040
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:23,960
Now you're a tracklayer. Now
get back to work, all of you!

1041
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:25,500
Move it!

1042
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,300
Fast!

1043
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,590
- You.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,090
You're the foreman till I can
find somebody better.

1045
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,590
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.

1046
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,720
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!

1047
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:37,640
Your name Jethro Stuart?

1048
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:39,220
All right, get at it.

1049
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:43,020
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired
to hunt buffalo to feed these men...

1050
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:46,730
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?

1051
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:50,030
They're railroaders. I thought somebody
in the railroad might be interested.

1052
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,070
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.

1053
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:56,490
You should've buried them, then
tracked down the Indians who did it.

1054
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:59,950
Well, Mr. King, like you
said, I was hired to hunt...

1055
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:03,250
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.

1056
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:05,120
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.

1057
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:07,790
You wouldn't think a couple
dead men bother them much.

1058
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:11,840
I don't want anything in their thick
skulls but their work. Do you understand?

1059
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:15,050
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.

1060
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:19,930
You keep forgetting,
Mr. King, my job's buffalo.

1061
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,730
It was buffalo.

1062
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:26,270
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.

1063
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,860
Well, now, that foreman
fella, you didn't fire him.

1064
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:31,820
You just took him down a peg
because you needed him.

1065
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,950
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?

1066
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,150
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.

1067
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:11,150
Milk?

1068
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,030
The Army must've changed
since I was in it.

1069
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:17,990
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?

1070
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:21,330
But you'd rather watch them than eat.

1071
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:23,160
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1072
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:26,750
Well, I wish you were as eager
to protect this railroad.

1073
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:30,000
Did you get any word about those
two men who were killed today?

1074
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:33,210
I tracked the Arapahos
and talked to the chief.

1075
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,470
Those men were a mile
off the right-of-way...

1076
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:38,720
...where they had no business,
drunk and chasing squaws.

1077
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:42,600
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?

1078
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:47,100
Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight
Indians, not to agree with them.

1079
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:51,730
Mr. King, there were 200
Arapahos and I had 20 men.

1080
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:53,650
Now, to me...

1081
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,860
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.

1082
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:57,990
To you, huh?

1083
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:01,780
Well, you know, I might just
send off a wire to the colonel.

1084
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:04,200
He may not agree.

1085
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:08,000
I already reported. He does agree.

1086
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,990
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.

1087
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,580
Trouble, sir?

1088
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,580
I don't know.

1089
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,590
Hey, lieutenant.

1090
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:58,760
I got a message: Indians
are up to something.

1091
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,680
You know anything about it?

1092
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:03,590
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.

1093
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,100
Changed the route, come smack
through Arapaho hunting grounds.

1094
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:09,680
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.

1095
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:12,100
They're getting the war paint ready.

1096
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,690
Can you stand there and tell me...

1097
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:21,740
...that one little change is gonna
cost the Arapahos one buffalo.

1098
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:24,240
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.

1099
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:27,740
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?

1100
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:30,960
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.

1101
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:35,250
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.

1102
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,250
The buffalo hunters
slaughtering off their herds.

1103
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,090
And then the settlers coming in.

1104
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:43,130
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?

1105
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,470
By then, we'll all be dead.

1106
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,810
Right now we're just crossing the land.

1107
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:51,640
That's all. Land that's safe
to the Arapahos for our lifetime.

1108
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:52,980
Now, you go talk to them.

1109
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,110
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.

1110
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:58,480
Just get them to make a new agreement.

1111
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,570
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?

1112
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,410
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...

1113
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:09,950
...but you keep your promise.

1114
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:20,510
Hear your name's Rawlings,
you're from Ohio.

1115
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:24,010
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?

1116
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,840
- Could be.
- Knew him.

1117
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:27,390
Jethro Stuart.

1118
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:30,180
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?

1119
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:32,560
Pa was killed at Shiloh.

1120
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:35,520
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.

1121
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,270
Well, better than dying behind a plow.

1122
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:42,360
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.

1123
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:44,700
Took 10 years off my life.

1124
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,870
Your ma...

1125
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:54,120
She must've been something real special
getting old Linus to stay put.

1126
01:58:54,290 --> 01:58:57,880
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.

1127
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,710
Old Linus.

1128
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,420
Two years running once. Your
pa and me trapped together.

1129
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,510
Up along the Waunakee.

1130
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:07,220
Got so many beaver, we had
to tie them tail-to-tail...

1131
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,300
...just to drag them down the mountain.

1132
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:12,560
Over a mile long it was,
that line of beaver pelts.

1133
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:17,060
Mr. Stuart, my father could take
the truth and stretch it about six ways.

1134
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:19,310
You sound just like him.

1135
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:22,820
I'll take it you meant that kindly.

1136
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:26,030
Well, I'd think twice
before I called you a liar.

1137
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,950
Tell me something, talking about liars.

1138
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:33,870
Why would a son of old Linus get
mixed up with a man like Mike King?

1139
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,250
I know what you mean.

1140
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:39,420
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?

1141
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,750
I don't think he knows that.

1142
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,380
He's changing the route back, is he?

1143
01:59:44,550 --> 01:59:46,010
No.

1144
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:47,930
I know.

1145
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:51,100
But he'd do anything to gain
a day on the Central Pacific.

1146
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:55,890
He's not a fool. He doesn't want
a war, and neither do the Arapahos.

1147
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:59,440
I think I could get them to agree
to this change in route...

1148
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,770
...if I sit down and talk
with them for a while.

1149
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,610
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.

1150
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:08,070
I need somebody that knows
the language and who they trust.

1151
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:12,660
You wouldn't happen to know someone
like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?

1152
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:20,170
Your pa could set a trap like no
man I ever come across.

1153
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:23,340
Just coax them on and, bam.

1154
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,980
You'd better do something so
he'll know you're pledging your word.

1155
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:34,370
That blame whistle's like the crack
of doom for all that's natural.

1156
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:37,790
My ma felt a man ought to make
his scratch on the land.

1157
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:40,910
Leave it a little different
than when he come.

1158
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,750
Anyway, thanks for fixing
things with the chief.

1159
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,380
Me? I fixed nothing.

1160
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:48,550
You put the words to my mouth
but that won't make them come true.

1161
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:51,170
Jethro, I said what I had
to to keep the peace.

1162
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,300
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?

1163
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:55,470
Maybe you don't understand.

1164
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,220
You pledged your word back there.

1165
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:59,890
Not mine, not the Army's,
not the railroad's.

1166
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:02,770
It's your word told them
they'd keep their hunting grounds.

1167
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:05,650
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...

1168
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:09,440
...like a prairie chicken waiting
for one side or the other to chop it off.

1169
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:12,530
Your pa and me got kicked
out of one territory after another...

1170
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:16,120
...with people pouring in, killing
off game, putting up towns.

1171
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,080
It ain't gonna stop.

1172
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:22,200
Your treaty's gonna get broke and I don't
wanna be around to see it happen.

1173
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:25,040
Look me up when you get your bellyful.

1174
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:27,460
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.

1175
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:31,550
A high lonesome where there
ain't no people at all yet.

1176
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,550
So long.

1177
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:44,730
<i>By now, the Central Pacific had broken
through the wall of the high Sierras...</i>

1178
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:49,360
<i>...and was straining eastward
across the flatlands of Nevada.</i>

1179
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,320
<i>While the Union Pacific, thanks
to its long peace with the Indians...</i>

1180
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:58,200
<i>...was able to keep up pressure just
as avidly in the opposite direction.</i>

1181
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,380
<i>The competition was exciting,
but also costly...</i>

1182
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:21,760
<i>...and both companies were itching
to earn money from tracks already laid.</i>

1183
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:38,200
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.

1184
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:42,330
We'll have to rest them a day before we can
start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.

1185
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:44,620
Just get them to water right away.

1186
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:47,000
You say no buffalo hunter come.

1187
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,790
White man, liar.

1188
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,630
We scout for you no more.

1189
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:59,050
Not in our lifetime, you said.

1190
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:03,350
And there they are. The buffalo
slaughterers and the settlers.

1191
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:06,140
All right, it's sooner than I figured.

1192
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:09,520
But the railroad's broke. They
need money to keep moving on.

1193
02:04:09,690 --> 02:04:11,980
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.

1194
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:14,780
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?

1195
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:18,820
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.

1196
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:21,120
They'll have a rough time,
but they'll make it.

1197
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,200
And do you wanna know
why they'll make it?

1198
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:26,830
Because they're willing
to change their ways.

1199
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,040
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.

1200
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:33,090
I know they have to and someday
the land will be taken over...

1201
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:35,800
...by these farmers
with their towns and their cattle.

1202
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:37,170
But not like this.

1203
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:40,760
They don't have to be double-crossed,
and I don't have to be a part of it.

1204
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:43,180
You don't, lieutenant?

1205
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:45,560
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?

1206
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:47,930
That's right, Mr. King,
I'm forgetting it.

1207
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:51,400
If the Army hasn't got any authority
out here, I'm resigning. And now.

1208
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,730
I don't see how that's gonna
help the Arapahos.

1209
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:55,230
Nothing will help them.

1210
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:58,110
But nothing's gonna stop them.

1211
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:30,060
Indian attack!

1212
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,980
Indian attack! Take cover!

1213
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:44,160
Take a good look.

1214
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:48,040
You wanted a war and you got one. I hope
you're the first man killed in it.

1215
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,660
Turn those wagons over!

1216
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:14,480
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.

1217
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:16,860
Rawlings, try that.

1218
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,330
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.

1219
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:31,000
Dirty skunks. Come on.

1220
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:50,970
I told you there'd be no war.

1221
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:52,590
Look at them.

1222
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,850
They've quit.

1223
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:57,140
They'll be back.

1224
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,100
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill
an animal they call the "iron horse."

1225
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:04,650
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?

1226
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,900
And nothing's gonna stop it.

1227
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:29,670
You think you can live with that?

1228
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,760
I can live with it, or I can die with it.

1229
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:34,760
Just listen.

1230
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:37,350
You can live with that?

1231
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:39,180
That?

1232
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:41,100
That ain't crying.

1233
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:44,190
That's just new life going on.

1234
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:53,360
Pick up this woman and put the rest
of the injured in the tent house.

1235
02:09:57,870 --> 02:09:58,870
Hey, Merv...

1236
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,120
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.

1237
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,090
Well...

1238
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,930
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.

1239
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:02,020
Hello, Jethro.

1240
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,730
Appears you're doing well.

1241
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,270
Can't complain.

1242
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:11,650
Creek's loaded with beavers,
fighting their way into the trap.

1243
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:13,690
No white men looking over my shoulder...

1244
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:16,450
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.

1245
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:19,450
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.

1246
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:21,120
Thanks.

1247
02:11:22,370 --> 02:11:23,540
You'll be bunking yonder.

1248
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:26,460
Take your bearings now so you
can find it when you need it.

1249
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,500
If you don't like my snoring,
you can build your own cabin.

1250
02:11:29,670 --> 02:11:31,840
I'll furnish the ax.

1251
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:36,760
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?

1252
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:39,050
Anywhere you go
is like where you've been.

1253
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:41,470
Ain't you lost enough tail
feathers back there?

1254
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,600
I've been plucked some.

1255
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,480
But that's what I like about this
country.

1256
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:51,610
There's always greener
grass over the next hill.

1257
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:54,610
Not no more. Not
since that damn railroad come.

1258
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:58,320
All the grass is being staked
out now, with a lock on it.

1259
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:04,080
Maybe I'll just have to climb
a little higher hill to find it.

1260
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,500
How about coming along?

1261
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:10,750
You crazy?

1262
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:14,670
Like the Indians say, "These rocks and trees
around here feel no call to move."

1263
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:16,420
Why should I?

1264
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:19,840
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.

1265
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:22,850
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.

1266
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:26,180
Man belongs his own kind,
like him or not.

1267
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:06,560
<i>The coming of railroads brought changes
in the land through which they passed.</i>

1268
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:10,390
<i>Now immense herds of cattle were driven
hundreds of miles to meet the lines...</i>

1269
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,400
<i>...bound for markets in the East.</i>

1270
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:16,110
<i>Fences went up, cattle
trails were barred...</i>

1271
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:20,150
<i>...and a long and bloody wrangle began
between cattlemen and homesteaders.</i>

1272
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:24,830
<i>The law was in the hands of whoever could
shoot fast and straight...</i>

1273
02:13:24,990 --> 02:13:29,200
<i>...except where there was somebody
determined to stand for law.</i>

1274
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:33,130
<i>Others might look on sheep
and a shepherd as a pastoral scene.</i>

1275
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,300
<i>Not the cattleman.</i>

1276
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:43,050
<i>To him, sheep destroyed
grass, and grass came dear.</i>

1277
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:45,850
<i>And if a man's life were
held cheaper than grass...</i>

1278
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:50,020
<i>...it was considered a casualty
of war, not a crime.</i>

1279
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:55,900
<i>And, in all this, the man with the star
was only one against many.</i>

1280
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:59,110
<i>But time was running
out for the reckless ones...</i>

1281
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:02,950
<i>...the desperadoes,
the gallop-and-gunshot boys...</i>

1282
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:05,910
<i>...as more and more citizens
demanded respect for the law...</i>

1283
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:08,950
<i>...and showed themselves
ready to fight to uphold it.</i>

1284
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:12,460
<i>And the raw new towns that sprung
up in the West began to dream...</i>

1285
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:17,380
<i>...of becoming as refined as that one-time
hooligan city by the Golden Gate.</i>

1286
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:19,840
<i>San Francisco was now respectable.</i>

1287
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:23,970
<i>So sophisticated, in fact, it
even had mansions up for auction.</i>

1288
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:25,800
Two thousand dollars.

1289
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:27,970
Two thousand dollars.

1290
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:30,220
Is that your last bid?

1291
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:34,980
Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy
is solid gold and fully inscribed.

1292
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:40,110
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president. San
Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."

1293
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:43,030
It's a treasure he held
dear to his heart.

1294
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:47,120
Do I hear $3000 for this
priceless possession?

1295
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,660
Priceless, my foot.

1296
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:52,160
We used it for a doorstop.

1297
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:55,170
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1298
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:57,170
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1299
02:14:57,330 --> 02:15:00,000
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.

1300
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:02,840
It's a sad day, Lilith.

1301
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:04,510
Sad?

1302
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:07,340
We made and spent
three fortunes together.

1303
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:09,510
What's so sad about that?

1304
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:13,350
And if he'd lived a little longer,
we would've made and spent another.

1305
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:15,770
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?

1306
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:17,900
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.

1307
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:20,730
Well then, take it. Quit
apologizing and take it.

1308
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:22,150
Thank you, madam.

1309
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,860
If there'd been some other
way to pay off the debts...

1310
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:26,320
It doesn't matter.

1311
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:29,950
I've got two things no
one can ever take from me:

1312
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:34,160
This and my land in Arizona.

1313
02:15:34,330 --> 02:15:37,290
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...

1314
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:39,670
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.

1315
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:41,340
Well, it's there, isn't it?

1316
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:44,380
Yes, but most of the cattle
have been sold off or stolen.

1317
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:47,050
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.

1318
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:49,550
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.

1319
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,850
Who?

1320
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:55,060
My nephew. He's a marshal
out there somewhere.

1321
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:58,980
Now, Lilith, at your age,
it might be kind of rough.

1322
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,150
Rough?

1323
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:06,110
My ma and pa were killed going
down the river just looking for land.

1324
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:10,910
I guess I got a little of that Prescott
blood in me after all.

1325
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:20,830
Pa?

1326
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:25,420
Is Aunt Lilith's house
on Nob Hill as high as that?

1327
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:28,300
I don't know, son.

1328
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:32,300
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.

1329
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:23,650
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?

1330
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:25,320
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.

1331
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:28,150
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.

1332
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:31,660
Zeb? What's the matter?

1333
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:33,320
Nothing.

1334
02:17:33,490 --> 02:17:34,990
Come on.

1335
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:42,500
Thank you.

1336
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:51,840
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.

1337
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:57,470
- Lilith.
- Zeb.

1338
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,020
Zeb Rawlings.

1339
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:02,690
Oh, goodness.

1340
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:05,690
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.

1341
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:09,400
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.

1342
02:18:09,570 --> 02:18:11,820
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.

1343
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:13,410
Pleased to meet you.

1344
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:15,820
I'm pleased to meet you too.

1345
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:19,200
I just can't tell you how pleased.

1346
02:18:19,370 --> 02:18:22,210
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.

1347
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:24,540
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?

1348
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:28,210
Sam's our horse. He could
pull two wagons if he wanted.

1349
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:32,170
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.

1350
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:33,380
Come on.

1351
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,640
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.

1352
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,260
Come on. Okay.

1353
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:39,810
Come on. Just a minute.

1354
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:42,180
I think this means a whole lot to her.

1355
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:44,810
You have no idea how much
it means to me...

1356
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:48,900
...to be able to settle
down to a life of peace and quiet.

1357
02:18:49,070 --> 02:18:50,480
I'll get the luggage.

1358
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:55,820
Hello, boys.

1359
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:57,740
Jake.

1360
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:59,160
Tom.

1361
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:01,040
Pablo.

1362
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:13,670
Zeb. Let's go.

1363
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:19,930
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come
all the way to Gold City just to meet me?

1364
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:22,680
I hardly expected it.

1365
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:27,060
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?

1366
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:29,190
What a pleasure.

1367
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:33,690
I envy you, marshal. A
well-favored, bright-eyed wife...

1368
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:37,700
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.

1369
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:41,030
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?

1370
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,870
It makes a person wanna live.

1371
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:51,800
That's Charlie Gant.

1372
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:54,340
I thought you said he was in Montana.

1373
02:19:54,510 --> 02:19:56,170
Zeb?

1374
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:59,140
I'm just gonna get
the luggage, that's all.

1375
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:09,810
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?

1376
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:12,610
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.

1377
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:16,190
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.

1378
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:24,540
Anything wrong, Julie?

1379
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:27,370
No. No, nothing.

1380
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,670
Come on, Eve.

1381
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:38,510
- Lou.
- Zeb.

1382
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,180
Got a minute?

1383
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:42,350
Of course I got a minute.

1384
02:20:44,140 --> 02:20:45,640
Here.

1385
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:48,350
Now, I urge you, most respectfully
to peruse the...

1386
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:51,150
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

1387
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,860
Well, what can I do for you?

1388
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,690
Go ahead, name it.

1389
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:59,700
I saw Gant get off the train
this morning.

1390
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:02,410
There were three men waiting for him.

1391
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:07,950
That's why you're here, huh?

1392
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,330
That's it.

1393
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:14,710
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...

1394
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:19,470
...to keep Charlie Gant from going
where he wants to in this territory.

1395
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:23,970
I know. I know what he was...

1396
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:26,390
...but that's over now.

1397
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:29,270
It was over the day his brother got...

1398
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:34,230
Should've killed them
both that day, but...

1399
02:21:34,730 --> 02:21:37,940
Well, you didn't. There ain't
a thing I can do about it now.

1400
02:21:38,110 --> 02:21:40,860
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?

1401
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:44,530
Well, what do you want me to do? Run
him out of town at the point of a gun?

1402
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:47,240
Do you think we still put
the law inside a holster here?

1403
02:21:47,410 --> 02:21:50,500
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.

1404
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,920
With all its writs and decrees and...

1405
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:58,090
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?

1406
02:21:58,250 --> 02:22:00,170
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.

1407
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:03,590
Doc Holliday, the Clantons,
the Youngers...

1408
02:22:04,050 --> 02:22:08,100
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.

1409
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:12,060
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.

1410
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:16,150
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon
with the gold shipment tomorrow.

1411
02:22:16,310 --> 02:22:20,940
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.

1412
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:24,030
I'll take Clayton and Sims
with me, all right?

1413
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:30,040
Well?

1414
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:32,080
Well what?

1415
02:22:32,290 --> 02:22:34,420
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

1416
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:37,960
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.

1417
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:40,300
What happens then?

1418
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:43,050
You know there's gold going
out here every month or so.

1419
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:46,840
There hasn't been a train robbery
since Jesse James was killed.

1420
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:50,810
Now, if the councilors wish to have
a conference, we'll have one.

1421
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:52,480
Zeb.

1422
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:57,900
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.

1423
02:22:58,610 --> 02:23:00,690
As a friend...

1424
02:23:00,860 --> 02:23:02,900
...I'd like you to leave town.

1425
02:23:25,050 --> 02:23:27,340
Boys, get back from there.

1426
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:32,020
Look down there, son.

1427
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:34,730
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.

1428
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:36,770
That's a thousand foot deep.

1429
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,520
Do you know how deep a thousand foot is?

1430
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:39,690
Uh-uh.

1431
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:44,030
Well, if you had 200 brothers,
all standing on your shoulders...

1432
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:48,200
- ...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.

1433
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:51,950
Come on. I'll show you
boys the donkey engine.

1434
02:23:57,210 --> 02:24:00,500
You boys go ahead. I'll be
along in a minute.

1435
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:06,720
I hear you've been talking
to the local marshal about me.

1436
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:12,680
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.

1437
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:15,270
I don't like you, marshal.

1438
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:19,310
I don't like what you and your kind
are doing to this country.

1439
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:21,690
Now, I don't want any trouble.

1440
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:26,360
But you wanna put things
on the old basis, just you and me?

1441
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:28,860
That's fine.

1442
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:32,080
I'm not gonna get
in a fight with you, Gant.

1443
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:35,500
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?

1444
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:37,080
Peace?

1445
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:40,080
There's only one kind I know of.

1446
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:42,960
That's the kind my brother's got.

1447
02:24:43,210 --> 02:24:46,920
What happened to your brother
didn't teach you very much, did it?

1448
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:49,430
Easy, marshal.

1449
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:51,430
Floyd never made mistakes...

1450
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:54,810
...except the one time he trusted you.

1451
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:56,850
And you're the one that got away.

1452
02:25:00,650 --> 02:25:03,900
One of these days, I'm likely to pay
you Rawlingses a little visit.

1453
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:33,220
Come on, move along.

1454
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:35,720
Get those gold boxes up there.

1455
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:38,020
That's a lot of gold.

1456
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:40,770
Come on, keep moving, boys.

1457
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:44,480
Zeb?

1458
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:46,940
Lou Ramsey's here.

1459
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:50,490
Lou.

1460
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:53,950
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?

1461
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:56,410
Gant came to see me last night.

1462
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:59,540
Said you tried to start
some trouble with him.

1463
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:01,290
You believe him?

1464
02:26:01,460 --> 02:26:04,710
I'm telling you, Zeb, you take
your trouble to your own territory.

1465
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:06,420
I don't want any more of it here.

1466
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:13,340
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.

1467
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:15,970
Rode out of here early this morning.

1468
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:17,350
With who?

1469
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:19,350
His gang.

1470
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:24,310
They should be somewhere
between here and Kingman...

1471
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:25,690
...waiting on that train.

1472
02:26:26,190 --> 02:26:27,940
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.

1473
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:30,820
You are not looking for a robbery,
you're looking for Gant.

1474
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:34,200
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.

1475
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:37,700
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.

1476
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:41,950
I'm sorry, Julie...

1477
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:45,670
...but I don't want my office
to be any part of this.

1478
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:56,550
Zeb?

1479
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:59,180
The boys have got the team hitched.

1480
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:01,100
I know.

1481
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:03,430
It's almost time to go.

1482
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:09,230
Zeb?

1483
02:27:33,090 --> 02:27:36,010
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.

1484
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:37,930
No one's making you.

1485
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:41,180
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.

1486
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:48,400
Maybe there's something
you haven't told me.

1487
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:50,770
Is there, Zeb?

1488
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:57,700
I'm asking you not to go.

1489
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:00,120
Please.

1490
02:28:00,450 --> 02:28:02,870
Don't go.

1491
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:05,370
Sorry, Julie.

1492
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:28,980
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded
in a man than his sense of honor.

1493
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:32,900
They're all the same, every one of them.

1494
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:35,150
You take my Cleve now.

1495
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,780
Never could turn down a poker game.

1496
02:28:37,950 --> 02:28:40,070
Felt duty-bound to go.

1497
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,780
Three nights running sometimes,
but he wouldn't quit...

1498
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:46,040
...not if his life depended on it. He...

1499
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:49,420
I guess it isn't very funny.

1500
02:28:49,580 --> 02:28:51,210
Ma?

1501
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:52,630
Where's Pa?

1502
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:55,300
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?

1503
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:58,260
Nothing's the matter. Come
on, now, in the other room.

1504
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:00,550
- What's the matter? Come
on, we're gonna play.

1505
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,350
That's a good girl. That's better.

1506
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:05,010
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.

1507
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:06,310
Do you know any games?

1508
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:08,390
We know tag. Musical chairs.

1509
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:10,310
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.

1510
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:12,190
Well, do you know how to play poker?

1511
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:13,360
- Poker?
- Poker?

1512
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:17,230
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.

1513
02:29:17,490 --> 02:29:19,280
But we don't know how to play poker.

1514
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:21,780
Well, it's time you learned.

1515
02:29:21,950 --> 02:29:25,620
First, we'll start
off with a little five-card stud.

1516
02:29:44,050 --> 02:29:46,220
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.

1517
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:47,560
Your pistol too.

1518
02:29:50,890 --> 02:29:52,770
Sorry, Lou.

1519
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:54,520
I just can't oblige.

1520
02:30:04,030 --> 02:30:06,370
Thought the law wouldn't
let you use that anymore.

1521
02:30:07,450 --> 02:30:09,080
I'll use it if I have to.

1522
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:12,920
I'm going out of here, Lou,
and I'm taking this with me.

1523
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:14,920
To kill Gant.

1524
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,040
That's what you think, isn't it?

1525
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:19,920
It's something personal
between him and me.

1526
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:22,430
Well, Lou, it could be...

1527
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:26,010
...if I settle down with my family
and wait for him to come.

1528
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:29,720
And he'll come if I don't
stop him here and now.

1529
02:30:29,890 --> 02:30:33,440
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed,
breaking the law...

1530
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:37,440
...and then I'm gonna use the law
to put him away once and for all.

1531
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:38,860
The law, Lou.

1532
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:41,110
I'm gonna use the law...

1533
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,160
...but I haven't got much
chance without your help.

1534
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:11,270
How many men in the caboose?

1535
02:31:11,430 --> 02:31:12,810
Just one brakeman.

1536
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:16,270
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.

1537
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,650
I'll be in the express car.

1538
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:25,650
Thanks, Lou.

1539
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:29,660
Marshal? There's some riders up ahead.

1540
02:31:30,490 --> 02:31:32,830
I'll take a look.

1541
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:55,270
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!

1542
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:57,190
Open it up, wide open.

1543
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:24,710
Zeb!

1544
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:27,880
Come on. Come on.

1545
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:49,740
Everyone make it? - Frenchy's horse fell.

1546
02:32:49,910 --> 02:32:51,950
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.

1547
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:54,080
It's a long way from here to that gold.

1548
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:56,080
There's no danger. Just keep going.

1549
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,430
It's Rawlings.

1550
02:34:47,270 --> 02:34:48,860
Back this train up!

1551
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:50,230
And fast!

1552
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:19,010
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?

1553
02:37:19,170 --> 02:37:21,930
We got a long way to go, son.

1554
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:23,680
Here.

1555
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:29,440
Auntie, when we going to your house?

1556
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:31,810
Your daddy will decide
when we get to your home.

1557
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:33,520
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?

1558
02:37:33,690 --> 02:37:36,530
I think Sam is taking us.

1559
02:37:58,260 --> 02:38:00,880
Pa, how much further is it
to Aunt Lilith's ranch?

1560
02:38:01,050 --> 02:38:04,430
Well, son, it's around the next bend,
the next bend...

1561
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:07,060
- ...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.

1562
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:13,650
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
- That's our song.

1563
02:38:13,810 --> 02:38:15,230
Your song?

1564
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:19,490
I sang that song long
before your pa was ever born.

1565
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:24,990
Come on.

1566
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:32,750
Zeb.

1567
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:13,120
<i>The West that was won by its pioneers,
settlers, adventurers is long gone now.</i>

1568
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:15,750
<i>Yet it is theirs forever.</i>

1569
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:20,500
<i>For they left tracks in history
that will never be eroded by wind or rain...</i>

1570
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:26,340
<i>...never plowed under by tractors,
never buried in the compost of events.</i>

1571
02:39:26,930 --> 02:39:30,640
<i>Out of the hard simplicity
of their lives, out of their vitality...</i>

1572
02:39:30,810 --> 02:39:33,310
<i>...their hopes and their sorrows...</i>

1573
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,480
<i>...grew legends of courage and pride...</i>

1574
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:39,480
<i>...to inspire their children
and their children's children.</i>

1575
02:39:40,150 --> 02:39:42,570
<i>From soil enriched by their blood...</i>

1576
02:39:42,730 --> 02:39:45,530
<i>...out of their fever
to explore and build...</i>

1577
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:48,990
<i>...came lakes where once
were burning deserts...</i>

1578
02:39:49,240 --> 02:39:52,660
<i>...came the goods of the earth,
mines and wheat fields...</i>

1579
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:55,290
<i>...orchards and great lumber mills...</i>

1580
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:58,790
<i>...all the sinews of a growing country.</i>

1581
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:04,010
<i>Out of their rude settlements,
their trading posts, came cities...</i>

1582
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:07,180
<i>...to rank among the great
ones of the world.</i>

1583
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:10,470
<i>All the heritage of a people
free to dream...</i>

1584
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:15,180
<i>...free to act, free
to mold their own destiny.</i>
