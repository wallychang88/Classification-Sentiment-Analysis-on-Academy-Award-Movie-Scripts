1
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,696
Pile out, you tramps.
It's the end of the line.

2
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:02,099
Grab your last look at free side, kid.

3
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,650
- Hi, Emma.
- Hi.

4
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,118
Shut up!

5
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,158
Line up by twos.

6
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:37,070
Take them to the receiving room,
Cassie. You know the way blindfolded.

7
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,551
Heard you was falling back in.

8
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,960
Still got you scrubbing,
Meta? Give me some skin!

9
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,532
No guy's given me a tumble in months.

10
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,900
Shut up!

11
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:11,532
The lists are alphabetical. Marie Allen.

12
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,080
Court says you're married. Legitimate?

13
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,324
All valuables must be turned over
to us until you hit free side.

14
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,734
Wedding ring, too.

15
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:01,190
Some county-jail gum heels
must have been here first.

16
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,827
Do they still soak you a fiver
for a phone call or a visitor?

17
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,593
Sign this. I'll fill it in later.

18
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,235
Mother living? Father? Any brothers? Sisters?

19
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,630
Well, there's just my
mother. She got married again.

20
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,536
Nothing like this has ever
happened to anybody in the family.

21
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:26,810
No previous criminal record.

22
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,648
In case of death, who do we notify?

23
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,621
Death? Oh, Mom, I guess.

24
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,055
Belong to any church?

25
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:41,452
We used to go. It's a church on State Street.

26
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,193
I forget its name. I think...

27
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,330
Armed robbery, huh? For one to 15 years.

28
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,441
The judge called me an accessory.

29
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,568
I've got to get to your
version of the crime, so shoot.

30
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:59,448
Well, we'd only been
married a couple of months.

31
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,316
We tried to find a place to live,
but everything costs so much,

32
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,321
so Mom let us move in
with her and my stepfather.

33
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:12,990
Well, Tom was always fighting
with Gus. That's my stepfather.

34
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,456
He tried to find a better
job, and then he got fired.

35
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,193
Get to the crime.

36
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:23,261
When Tom drove into that gas station,
I stayed in the car while he...

37
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,604
Then the attendant hit Tom over the
head, and I went out to help him.

38
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,839
I guess that's why they
called me an accessory.

39
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:34,877
They took back the $40.

40
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,784
Five bucks less, and it wouldn't be a felony.

41
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,652
Don't try to kid me. How old are you really?

42
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,247
Nineteen.

43
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,954
Sign this. I'll skip the mental
test. You look normal enough.

44
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,994
Lots of them haven't all their marbles.

45
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,597
You can take your physical.

46
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,036
- Where?
- The infirmary. Your number's 93850.

47
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,031
98350.

48
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,543
No, 93850. Remember it.

49
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,581
The infirmary's at the end of
the corridor. Follow your nose.

50
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,613
Next, Emma Barber. Snap into it.

51
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,013
Say, you got real skinny, didn't you?

52
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,092
I hope your batch is
cleaner than the last lot.

53
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,657
I had to scrub them with brooms.

54
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,830
Eyes okay.

55
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,477
No drugs in the ears. Open your mouth wide.

56
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,614
I said, wide.

57
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:56,290
No drugs in the mouth. Teeth sound.

58
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,464
Lung tap sound.

59
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,997
Heart excited but strong enough.

60
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,608
What's the matter?

61
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,216
I feel a little sick.

62
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,979
Get that way often?

63
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:19,681
Yes, the last week or so.

64
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,453
Say, you expecting company?

65
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,495
I don't know.

66
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:30,532
Another pregnant one. Get up.

67
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,562
You know who the father is?

68
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,531
My husband.

69
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,338
Well, ain't we getting respectable?

70
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,276
Could he help with the expenses?

71
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,439
He's dead.

72
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,610
Another bill for the State. Get dressed.

73
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,243
Shall I put down "pregnant"?

74
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,948
No, better wait. See what the doc says.

75
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,786
That trained seal sure
can ask a lot of questions.

76
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,556
Who's this Pearl Harbor,
anyway? Is she an inmate?

77
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,428
- Shut up, Emma, and strip.
- Oh, goodie.

78
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,101
Never mind the glamour, puss.

79
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,570
Couldn't I have a comb?

80
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,634
What's the difference?
There's no men in here.

81
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,000
Can I write a letter to my mother?

82
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,536
No, not while you're in isolation.

83
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,767
You gotta stay here until
your blood test comes back,

84
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,901
so for two weeks, there'll be
no mail, no visitors, no nothing.

85
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,097
Welcome to Lysol Lane.

86
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,835
Did you just get in today?

87
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,745
I'm on the last lap.

88
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:25,946
Ten to 20. They had to put me in here.

89
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,711
No beds in the infirmary.

90
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,386
I'm sick.

91
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,450
I got it bad.

92
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

93
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:42,861
You better not stay too
close to the bed, sister.

94
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,326
It's just the break you get.

95
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,039
Sometimes you get a matron who's a louse.

96
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,235
Sometimes you get a good egg.

97
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,482
I'd walk a mile for a
cigarette if they'd let me.

98
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,812
I was just thinking.

99
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,011
Quit bragging!

100
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,281
It's all the judge's fault I'm here.

101
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:43,018
When Joe first beats me up, I grab his
gun and just wing him in the shoulder.

102
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,787
Do they arrest me? No!

103
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,454
Then a year later, I fires
at Joe again and miss.

104
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,465
Do they give me a rap
for attempted assault? No!

105
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,328
Then last year, I defends
myself again with a gun,

106
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,394
and the police still treats
me like I was poison ivy.

107
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,464
And then finally I finish Joe off for good.

108
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,909
Well, it's that judge. If he had nabbed me

109
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,241
the first three times
while I was just practicing,

110
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,338
I wouldn't be here now for murder.

111
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,179
It's all the judge's fault.

112
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,217
Read it and weep.

113
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,821
Rubbing it in because we're behind the iron.

114
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,605
Heads or tails, you lose.

115
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,346
You girls are moving along today.

116
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,819
Marie Allen, I've got news
for you from the infirmary.

117
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,516
Your blood came back okay. No treatment.

118
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,651
Now, the Superintendent will see you first,

119
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:55,686
and Doc says you're two months on the way.

120
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,697
That's swell, honey.

121
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,266
I got a grownup son older than you.

122
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:13,546
It's funny. You get a baby from a guy, and
then 20 years later, you finish him off.

123
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:17,074
Hello, Ann. Well, it's good to see you.

124
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,381
How are things up front?

125
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,354
Busy. Who's first?

126
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,981
Marie Allen.

127
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,928
Good luck, kid. Be seeing you.

128
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,695
It's tough at first. I know.
I've been through the mill.

129
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,997
Been here eight years.

130
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:38,369
Kept my nose clean, and Mrs. Benton
let me help her in the office.

131
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:41,035
Having a regular job like that
certainly makes you feel good

132
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,601
after working in the bakery for five years.

133
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,813
What are you in for?

134
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,982
Murder.

135
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,463
Come in. Sit down here, please.

136
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,976
Don't be frightened.

137
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:19,174
I want you to know that
we're all here to help you.

138
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:23,844
I want you to believe that I'd like
to be your friend if you'll let me.

139
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,718
What is it? What's troubling you, Marie?

140
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,010
I have been so lonely the last two weeks.

141
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:57,418
Those other women, the way they
talked and the awful things they said

142
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:02,355
and those matrons, always
watching, never leaving you alone.

143
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,322
You'll find all kinds of women in
here, just as you would outside,

144
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,665
but every large institution must have rules,

145
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,964
and the matrons are here to
see that the rules are obeyed.

146
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,868
You weren't sent here to be punished.

147
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,102
Just being here is the
punishment. That's all.

148
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:29,216
You know, first offenders like you,
Marie, are our greatest concern.

149
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,483
Unfortunately, they have to be
crowded in with more experienced women

150
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:35,319
simply because we haven't more space,

151
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,086
and you'll be with such women.

152
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,489
Of course, I want you to have friends.
All of us need an outlet for affection,

153
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,896
but no prison is a normal place.

154
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,337
How soon can I go home?

155
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,334
If your record is good, you can
come up for parole in 10 months.

156
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:01,044
But I'm going to have a baby.
Do I have to have it in here?

157
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,477
I know how you feel, Marie,

158
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,147
but the inmates aren't allowed
to go home to have their babies.

159
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,222
Don't worry.

160
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:17,061
Any blood relative can take care
of your child until you get out.

161
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:22,359
Then my mother will take care of it.

162
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,398
But they wouldn't let me
write her. Can I write her now?

163
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:29,205
Of course, now that we're sure
that your relatives actually exist.

164
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,738
That's because some of the inmates
change their criminal contacts

165
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,511
into kindhearted uncles and cousins

166
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:37,916
and sometimes even sick grandmothers.

167
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:44,418
I know how strange all this is
to you, but you were sent here

168
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,053
because you were involved
in a serious crime.

169
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,092
We want to help you so
that when you go home,

170
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,292
you can start a new life.

171
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,262
I want to do the right thing.

172
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:59,603
You're an intelligent girl.
You know good from bad.

173
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,204
Try to keep busy. It's important.

174
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,712
Now, as to your work,

175
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:11,678
I'll bet you helped your mother with
your father's shirts, didn't you?

176
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:12,743
Yes.

177
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,621
Well, we'll put you in
the laundry as a checker.

178
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:18,319
It will be easier for
you because of the baby.

179
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,017
You can see me anytime.

180
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,617
Hi, Ann.

181
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,181
Hello, Harper.

182
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,151
Since you went fancy working upstairs
for Benton, I kind of missed you.

183
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,960
This is Marie Allen. Mrs. Benton
says to put her in laundry.

184
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,759
Marie's gonna have a baby.

185
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,394
A baby, huh?

186
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,496
Why, you're just a kid yourself.

187
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,710
- So long, Marie.
- Goodbye, Ann. Thank you.

188
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,606
Let's you and me get acquainted, honey.

189
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,314
You may be a number to
the others but not to me.

190
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,045
Sit down in this chair. It's kind of roomy.

191
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,192
You like the stuff in here, huh?

192
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,232
Just little presents from my
girls for taking good care of them.

193
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,570
- Caramel?
- No, thank you.

194
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,128
Cigarette?

195
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,401
You know, you're gonna find out

196
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,377
that a lot of things
are tough to get in here.

197
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,582
This is just a little
personal service of my own.

198
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,813
On the side, sort of. Understand?

199
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:56,516
I like to do a good turn for my girls.

200
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,353
Why, sometimes, on my night off,
I drop in on their relatives.

201
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:04,791
I could get real news to your husband.

202
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,299
He's dead.

203
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:10,630
What about your people? What do they do?

204
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:14,369
My stepfather's a mechanic,
but he's not working.

205
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:19,270
Well, I bet they saved up for a rainy day,

206
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,442
like me investing in real
estate for my old age.

207
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,986
Why, you think how much
easier I could make it for you,

208
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,183
you being in a delicate
condition, so to speak.

209
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,988
The little comforts.

210
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,551
Maybe you got a habit that's hard to break,

211
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,425
cigarettes or something.

212
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,932
I know how it is.

213
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,569
I could get you whatever you wanted.

214
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:46,935
Time's money to me. I can't
favor every one of 60 girls.

215
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:50,670
Mom would be glad to help if she could.

216
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,338
No dough, eh?

217
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,315
Follow me.

218
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,457
Home, sweet home.

219
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:13,934
Just like the big cage in the zoo, only
you clean it up instead of the keeper.

220
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,562
Bucket and brush is in the corner closet.

221
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,373
Mrs. Benton said I was
going to work in the laundry.

222
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:22,376
I'm the boss here. Start scrubbing.

223
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,242
But Mrs. Benton told me...

224
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,945
Where do I begin, Miss Harper?

225
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,078
Now you're getting hip.

226
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,566
Use this lye. Soap's low.

227
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,084
Okay, get going.

228
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,853
Didn't you ever scrub a floor
before? Put your shoulder in it.

229
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,967
You're doing okay.

230
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:24,870
Keep that up, and you and me
are gonna get along just fine.

231
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,513
Pipe the new fish.

232
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,316
Millie, the old dame in the bed
says you loud-talked to Harper.

233
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,819
That took guts.

234
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,821
How much time are you pulling?

235
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:45,059
One to 15 years, but I come
up for parole in 10 months.

236
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,823
Just a hot minute. What's your rap?

237
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,527
Robbery.

238
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:53,261
Society. Larcenists don't talk to CPs.

239
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,194
CPs?

240
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,468
- Are you kidding?
- CP, common prostitute.

241
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,372
Where you been living, the moon?

242
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,240
Her name's Smoochie.

243
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,478
Glad to meet you.

244
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,087
Got news for you. She's all right.

245
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,618
I'm Kitty Stark, and that's
Claire. What's your name?

246
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,324
Marie Allen.

247
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,964
Stop scrubbing. Chew the fat.

248
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,697
Hey, Lottie, check her.

249
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,143
Maybe you need bifocals.

250
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,246
The dish is poison, Harper's pet nose.

251
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:50,758
- I'll tell Evelyn!
- Evelyn! Don't kid me.

252
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:53,294
Harper's first name is Filth.

253
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:32,392
Kitty! Kitty! Oh, Kitty.

254
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,559
What's the beef?

255
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,627
The matron said if I broke
another dish, she'd report me.

256
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:39,196
She refuses to believe I've
never worked in a kitchen.

257
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,832
Yeah, I know, but ain't I told you

258
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,877
not to go shooting your
mouth off about yourself,

259
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,469
all about the servants you
had and your governesses

260
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,811
and the yachts your old man bought?

261
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,477
Oh, why won't anyone understand?

262
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,717
It's always been like that.

263
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:58,125
Even as a child, I had no one
to go to when I was in trouble.

264
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,091
My parents were always away.

265
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:03,896
Even after I was married, I...

266
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,600
You're new here, aren't you?

267
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:17,068
I'm Georgia Harrison. I'm
not supposed to be here.

268
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,807
I didn't forge those
checks. It was all a mistake,

269
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:23,544
but wait until my appeal comes
through. Then I'll get out of here.

270
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,650
My father's waiting for me,

271
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,587
and he knows I'm not guilty.

272
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,895
We have a rose garden out in back,
and in the summer, it's beautiful.

273
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,891
All day, I'll sit and watch the roses,

274
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,231
and in the evening...

275
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,364
She's a real lady, Georgia,

276
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,636
only she married some guy who
likes spending other people's dough,

277
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,007
so he got her to write
out a bunch of bouncers.

278
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:54,139
I got news for you. Georgia
gives this place class.

279
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,706
She ain't the only one.

280
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:59,720
I had two real mink coats and a
closet full of black lace nighties

281
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,255
and a shelf full of real French perfumes

282
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,759
that my girls lifted right out of
one of the swankiest stores in town.

283
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,020
Don't rub it in.

284
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:09,552
All I ever had was a different
pair of shoes for every night.

285
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,193
Chow line!

286
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:17,466
Lottie! Millie! Dottie! Look at...

287
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,702
Did you read all about me in the
papers? They even had my picture.

288
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,069
Get those things out of here.

289
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:28,139
Next time, I'll get somebody to
show you how to scrub a floor.

290
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,742
In line!

291
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,806
Get back to the bullpen!

292
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,520
Squealer! How did you get word to Benton?

293
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,461
I didn't.

294
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:49,258
You're a liar.

295
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:55,895
You're riding a phony, Harper.
It was me got word to Benton.

296
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:01,201
I'm a tall weed in the grass,
and the grapevine's blooming.

297
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,172
You old buzzard.

298
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,706
Lay a hand on me, and
I'll put your lights out.

299
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:15,448
I'm in for life. One more like
you is just so much velvet.

300
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,825
I ain't got no time to argue.

301
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,731
Line up for count!

302
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,164
- Lewis, Millie.
- Christiansen, Velma.

303
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,674
- Kopsky, Gita.
- O'Connor, Mary.

304
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,938
- Devlin, Claire.

305
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,809
- Roberts, June.
- Menard, Tina.

306
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,246
- Barber, Emma.
- Minnelli, Nina.

307
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:43,409
- Cassidy, Katie.
- Bates, Naomi.

308
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:45,817
- Stark, Kitty.
- Klein, Julie.

309
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,685
- Marie Allen.
- Allen, Marie!

310
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,021
- Allen, Marie.
- Mullen, Elaine.

311
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,219
- Cardnum, Ruth.
- Branigan, Lottie.

312
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,661
- Hoffman, Ilsa.
- Stone, Louise.

313
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,823
- Vogel, Dottie.
- Elkins, Peggy.

314
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,062
- Laverne, Frankie.
- Orangeman, Hope.

315
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,934
- O'Shaughnessy, Mitzi.
- Carter, Mamie.

316
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,371
- Hansen, Alison.
- Jacobs, Hattie.

317
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:08,636
- Yosta, Violet.
- Twitchell, May.

318
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,406
- Smith, Peggy.
- Harrison, Georgia.

319
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:14,277
- Taylor, Alice.
- Fuller, Mimi.

320
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,317
- Danzig, Lulu.
- West, Minnie.

321
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,211
You're stir-simple if you
think you made more dough

322
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,372
playing the con game than I did in my racket.

323
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,279
Who are you calling
stir-simple, you cheap crook?

324
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,875
Oh, quit bragging about how
much dough you used to make.

325
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,817
Both of you are giving me a pain.

326
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,287
I made double what any of you
made, and I'm not bragging.

327
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:58,190
There wasn't a crooked jeweler
in town who didn't come to me.

328
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,854
Once, I stashed a load of
hot ice worth 50,000 bucks.

329
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,590
What a sweet racket we had!

330
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,930
Six suckers a day bit the hook,

331
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,799
and we'd lam out of town
before the coppers caught up.

332
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,532
Joe and me lived high.

333
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,039
Gee, you girls are lucky.

334
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,372
I always fall in love
with a guy that won't work.

335
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,071
Last one beat me up, then beat out of town.

336
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:21,172
But I got news for you. Men are important.

337
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:23,444
Personally, I'd hate to see them abolished.

338
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:25,986
If it wasn't for men, we wouldn't be in here.

339
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,818
You said it. I've been married five times.

340
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,414
What's wrong with that?

341
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:35,361
Nothing, if you're not married to
them all at the same time, like I was.

342
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:39,161
I bet you got some story, too, huh, Kitty?

343
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:45,132
Your husband in the stir?

344
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,065
He was killed in a holdup.

345
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,703
If he was alive, he'd have another
dame when you get out anyway.

346
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:54,738
- Good night.
- Good night.

347
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:59,348
How many jobs did you pull
before they nabbed you?

348
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:03,085
I don't want to talk about it, please.

349
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,557
You will.

350
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,457
I want to go home.

351
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,687
I want to get out of here.

352
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,393
Do you hear that train?

353
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:58,733
People are going home on that train.

354
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,542
Conductor, wait for me.

355
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,411
Let me on that train!

356
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:12,383
Let me out of here.

357
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:18,390
I don't belong in here. I'm Georgia Harrison.

358
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,494
Father!

359
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,493
Father! Father!

360
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,963
Father!

361
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:32,506
Oh, Father!

362
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,335
- No.
- Grab her.

363
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,878
- No! No!
- She's bleeding like a stuck pig.

364
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:42,039
A cold hose will quiet her down.

365
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:45,313
No, Harper, the infirmary.
She's cut an artery.

366
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,135
File out, you tramps!

367
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,812
- Christiansen, Velma.
- Kopsky, Gita.

368
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:24,050
- O'Connor, Mary.
- Allen, Marie.

369
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,297
That old lady of mine, the things she writes.

370
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:16,637
"And I know you'll be a good
girl and keep out of trouble."

371
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,236
How much more trouble can I get into?

372
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:21,909
Get lost.

373
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,416
You ain't deep.

374
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,714
I've been watching you.

375
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,484
You're no squealer, so
I'm gonna give you a break.

376
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,224
What are you gonna do
when you flop out of stir?

377
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:33,726
Ever figure on boosting?

378
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:35,990
This kid wouldn't know
a booster from a hustler.

379
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:39,556
Boosting, shoplifting, the
department store circuit,

380
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:42,762
none of your five-and-dime
stuff like your first rap.

381
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:44,566
We operate on a big scale.

382
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:47,938
The boys will protect you
just like your own mother.

383
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,704
If they protect you, why are you in here?

384
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,474
I knocked a guy off.

385
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:57,382
The syndicate pays me for recruiting,
so I can take care of Harper.

386
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,817
Live easy.

387
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:03,084
You just leave it to me, and I'll
see that you get your parole quick.

388
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:08,786
You see, these guys I'm
working with, they got drag.

389
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,162
Time to flop out, and they'll
fake a legit job for you.

390
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:16,066
With the soft dough you can make shoplifting,

391
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,435
you can get the things a girl likes.

392
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:25,635
I know what's going through her
head. She's been listening to Benton.

393
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:30,546
Rehabilitation, taking cold
showers, working for good behavior.

394
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:32,977
When I get out, I'm not coming back.

395
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:36,751
- After I'm paroled...
- Parole? Didn't the parole board okay me?

396
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,657
I've been packed a solid
year pulling dead time.

397
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:40,921
You're a repeater.

398
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,656
They don't let any con out of stir

399
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,460
until the parole officer gets
her a job and a place to live.

400
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:49,230
We think we're flopping out, then
wham, they can't find us a job,

401
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,567
and we're packed in here pulling dead time.

402
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,871
You see, kid, in this cage,
you get tough or you get killed.

403
00:34:56,611 --> 00:35:01,207
Better wise up before it's
too late. Now, how about it?

404
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,178
Don't think I'm not grateful,

405
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,322
but I don't want to get mixed up in anything.

406
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,387
I don't think boosting is
the only way to get along

407
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,552
when I get out of here.

408
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,988
I've got to do it my own way.

409
00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:00,437
You was a nurse in the free
side. What's the matter with her?

410
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,238
Nothing that vitamins
and calcium wouldn't help.

411
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,370
You got them pills in the pogey?

412
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,038
They never heard of anything but aspirin.

413
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:09,981
Tell the nurse I said she should go
out and get you whatever stuff you need.

414
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,212
That slob will do it. She owes me plenty.

415
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:13,378
I'm all right now.

416
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,649
Marie knows where taking
favors from you will land her.

417
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,157
- Ain't you learned nothing?
- Quit needling her.

418
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:20,558
The only thing important is my baby.

419
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:21,686
If you're old enough to have a kid,

420
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,390
you don't need this big sister
sticking her nose where it don't belong.

421
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:25,693
Harper.

422
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:34,300
Tomorrow's parole-board day.

423
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,105
Would you find out if my name's on the list?

424
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,738
- Mrs. Benton promised that the moment...
- You're on the list.

425
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:43,682
3:30 tomorrow, Benton's office. Be there.

426
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,188
Nice work, kid.

427
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,487
I got a new bra you can have.

428
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,925
I got some slick, new perfume you can have.

429
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:55,019
Let me iron your dress.

430
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,723
Want me to put your hair
up in curlers for you?

431
00:36:58,966 --> 00:36:59,990
Do they fit?

432
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,036
They pinch a little, but
they look better than mine.

433
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,598
Thanks.

434
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,275
Well, how do I look?

435
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:12,812
Oh, fine.

436
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,716
3:00. Three hours away.

437
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,486
I'd have gone crazy if I
had to pull another year.

438
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,383
I'll be 30 soon.

439
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,826
After you got out the first
time, what made you fall back in?

440
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:32,095
The same thing that got me in the first time,

441
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,799
a guy.

442
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,370
When I met him, I was wet behind the ears,

443
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:46,072
sex and love and marriage all mixed up.

444
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:49,679
When I got out of school, he hired me.

445
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:55,478
I didn't know until it was too late
what kind of a dirty racket he was in.

446
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:59,351
I loved him too much to walk out on him.

447
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,056
You're lucky your man's dead.

448
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,622
- Don't say that!
- Your man's dead.

449
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,993
He can't turn you into a
two-time loser like mine did.

450
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,508
Even after I got out the first time,

451
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,910
there he was, waiting for me,

452
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:25,880
but that's all over with.
I'm starting from scratch.

453
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,284
They flopped me back.

454
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,454
They flopped me back.

455
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:24,177
Quit cheating, you dirty crook.

456
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,712
Who you calling a dirty crook?

457
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,611
Shut up, the both of you, and play cards.

458
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,013
- She called me a dirty crook.
- Well, it's true, ain't it?

459
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:33,451
Yeah, but I got a right to be
sensitive about it, ain't I?

460
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,419
I'll call you and up two.

461
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:39,116
You're loaded with nothing.

462
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,524
There's your two and three more.

463
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,732
You in this pot, June?

464
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:51,228
The twister and the slammer.

465
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,700
Three hundred and sixty-five more
nights and days, and I wake up.

466
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,694
Get a load of the new look.

467
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:29,774
By the time we get out of
here, it'll be the old look.

468
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,936
I got news for you.

469
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,276
If that's what dames are wearing
now, I'm glad I'm in here.

470
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:43,989
The guy outside likes the way I look.

471
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,917
Just bought himself a brand-new car.

472
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,791
Must be a truck.

473
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:53,556
He's taking me to a show.

474
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:56,967
Tough they flopped you back in.

475
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,437
We could have double-dated with his friend.

476
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:04,607
After the show, he's taking me to his place.

477
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:09,307
He's got a room up over
the bar where he works.

478
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:14,151
Real comfortable, if you know what I mean.

479
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:20,356
Every time he kisses me good night,
I just want to keep on leaving him.

480
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:23,260
- He's got...
- Keep your snoot out of our business.

481
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,770
Good night, girls. Pleasant dreams.

482
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:39,904
At least we got honest matrons in here.
When I bribe one, she stays bribed.

483
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,342
Anything you want?

484
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,287
Harper! Harper!

485
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:59,694
Before you go, you better tell
Benton. June's acting stir-bugs.

486
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,964
All repeaters act queer
when they're flopped back.

487
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,865
Pete don't like me to keep him waiting.

488
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:09,440
See you in the morning, girls.

489
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:53,417
June.

490
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:07,564
June. June.

491
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,283
I'd like to speak to Dr. Saunders.

492
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:01,717
What? I can't hear you.

493
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,324
Yes, I know.

494
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,419
He's not here. He went out on a case.

495
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,897
Dr. Ashton? This is Ruth Benton.

496
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,561
I'm sorry to call you at such an hour,

497
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:20,539
but I remember your offer
to be a free consultant.

498
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,405
An emergency. A premature birth.

499
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:26,179
Eight months.

500
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,439
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

501
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:35,151
What's everybody blowing their fuse for?
I've delivered kids in here by the dozen.

502
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:37,520
It's a miracle he didn't die.

503
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,773
Get a clean blanket.

504
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,306
When my dog had distemper,

505
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:00,779
I took him to a cleaner
infirmary than this one.

506
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:02,816
Yes, I know, Doctor.

507
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:04,145
Twice I've put in requisitions

508
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:06,118
to have this place modernized and repainted.

509
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,280
Why not use $1,000 of your
budget for the purpose?

510
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,558
Maybe if the medical
board were to take it up.

511
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,807
Five inmates have told me June
was acutely depressed last night.

512
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:32,107
They swear they asked you to advise me.

513
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:35,205
You believe any bull these inmates hand you?

514
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:39,412
I've asked you time and time again
to watch changes in a girl's behavior.

515
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,148
You mean to tell me you couldn't
see that she was acting strangely?

516
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:46,056
With 60 girls in my bullpen, my only
job is to see that nobody escapes.

517
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:49,994
You helped to kill June just as
surely as if you'd hanged her yourself!

518
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:55,601
Will they investigate?

519
00:45:57,371 --> 00:46:00,340
I wish somebody cared enough
to make an investigation.

520
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:04,938
So what are you going to do? Suspend me?

521
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:08,814
I'm going to do everything
I can to have you fired.

522
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:12,475
You gave me three suspensions,

523
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:16,114
and you couldn't make one
of them stick, remember?

524
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,521
This time, I will.

525
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:22,585
So you call the Commissioner. So what?
I call my friend, Thornton Goodrich.

526
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:26,565
He gets the Commissioner on the phone,
and, bingo, I'm back on the job again.

527
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:33,198
You sit there on your bustle, the big boss,
and think you know how to run this place.

528
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:37,733
Do you know how it ought to be
run? With a piece of rubber hose.

529
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:40,644
Break them in two if they talk out of turn.

530
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:44,272
Anyone who doesn't toe the mark
sits in solitary for one month.

531
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:45,716
Bread and water.

532
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:50,022
One funny move from a girl, and
I clip every hair off of her head.

533
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,355
That's the way it used to be run,
and that's the way it ought to be run.

534
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:56,919
Just like they're a bunch
of animals in a cage.

535
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:00,191
Get out of here.

536
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:20,513
Is she alone?

537
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,452
- She is, but...
- I'll go right in.

538
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:24,218
If you'd just let me ask her, sir...

539
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,451
Mr. Donnolly.

540
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:27,619
Blame the Lieutenant Governor for this visit.

541
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:29,286
He asked me to drop in.

542
00:47:29,363 --> 00:47:31,593
I'm always glad to see you, Mr. Donnolly.

543
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:34,759
Too bad about what happened last night.

544
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:37,201
- Please, sit down, Mr. Donnolly.
- Thank you.

545
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,401
Someone on the state medical board got
in touch with the Lieutenant Governor

546
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,909
early this morning and raised a big howl.

547
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,842
A zealous young doctor. I've...

548
00:47:47,915 --> 00:47:52,545
I forget his name. He called the board.
He was shocked about the infirmary.

549
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,416
I warned you that something
like this would happen

550
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,950
when the board voted us
$8,000 instead of $80,000.

551
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:03,653
Can't you understand that in the long run,

552
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,062
$80,000 would have saved the State millions?

553
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,363
What do you want for your girls now?

554
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,893
A swimming pool? Television
sets? A beauty parlor?

555
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,270
No, merely the things I worked to
get in other prisons and did get.

556
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:17,902
Teachers, a full-time psychiatrist...

557
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,072
Now, don't tell me that
your inmates fell in love

558
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,480
with their grandfather's
bicycles when they were little.

559
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:29,688
I'm afraid I'm too tired to
appreciate your wit, Mr. Donnolly.

560
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,181
I only know what we need.

561
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:36,628
I wish we could drag the public in
here to watch the inmates decaying.

562
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:40,527
I have a great respect
for you. You're a fighter.

563
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:44,597
I used to be a Golden Gloves
boy myself in the old days.

564
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,401
They taught me that, when the
odds were against a good fighter,

565
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:49,999
to cover up if you wanted
to keep on your feet

566
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:52,375
because even though you lose the decision,

567
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,277
it's better than a knockout.

568
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,709
Good morning, Mrs. Benton.

569
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,051
Good morning.

570
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:18,760
- Does it say on his birth certificate...
- You got a break.

571
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:22,493
Mrs. Benton insisted we just
put the name of the town.

572
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:31,734
Your mother's downstairs
in the visiting room.

573
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,511
Can she come up and see the baby?

574
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:36,678
It's against orders.

575
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,881
Mom.

576
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,375
Mom.

577
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:15,478
Marie, baby, you feeling all right now?

578
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,748
I'm okay. How are you?

579
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,257
Oh, ailing a bit.

580
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,954
I hope you understood about me not writing.

581
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:24,519
I mean, I ain't much on writing.

582
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:25,826
Sure.

583
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,864
Isn't it wonderful about your grandson?

584
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,198
Yeah, wonderful.

585
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:34,468
I'm gonna call him Tommy. Oh,
Mom, you're gonna love him.

586
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:37,601
Already he's got hair,
the same color as Tom's,

587
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,269
but he's got your eyes.

588
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,873
I can't take the baby. Oh, I want to.

589
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:45,474
What woman my age
don't want a grandchild?

590
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,486
But your stepfather won't
have it in the house.

591
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:50,352
We argued and argued till
I was blue in the face.

592
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:53,915
So help me, if I had a dime to
my name, I'd walk out on him.

593
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:56,554
I keep figuring how I could take the baby.

594
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,097
I can't leave Gus.

595
00:51:58,165 --> 00:52:00,759
There'd be no one to take
care of me till you get out,

596
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,995
and I ain't getting any younger.

597
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:06,937
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

598
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:09,976
Mom, stop crying. Tom's folks are dead.

599
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,840
If you won't take him, they'll
put him up for adoption.

600
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:13,470
What do you want me to do?

601
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,014
You've got to leave Gus.

602
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:18,073
I'll be out of here in three months.
I'll get a job and support you.

603
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:20,984
We'll have a real home,
you and the baby and me.

604
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,022
Mom, find something until I get out!

605
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:27,492
Well, I'm not as young as I was.
I tire easy. The doc says my feet...

606
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,426
Can't you think of anyone but yourself?

607
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:32,056
Maybe it would be better
if someone else took him,

608
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:35,431
some nice family with money.
They could bring him up real nice.

609
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,094
I don't want anyone else to have him!

610
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,638
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

611
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,901
You're his only flesh and
blood. You've got to take him!

612
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:44,944
Don't keep saying that!
Don't keep saying that!

613
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:48,811
Mother! Mother, come back here!

614
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:52,477
You gotta take him! You gotta take him!

615
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:56,955
Mother, come back! Mother! Mother!

616
00:52:58,358 --> 00:52:59,848
No!

617
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,497
Don't let it throw you,
honey. You're still a kid.

618
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,695
If you get paroled soon enough,

619
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,464
there'll be a lot of guys
that will tumble for you.

620
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:13,733
You can even get hitched
and have another kid

621
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:15,638
if you're dope enough to want to.

622
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:19,310
The trick's to flop out as quick as you can.

623
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:22,813
Like I've told you, the boys
can get your parole moving fast.

624
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:26,011
How about it? Don't it make sense, honey?

625
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:31,752
Think it over, sweetie, but
get this through your head.

626
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:35,784
If you stay in here too long,
you don't think of guys at all.

627
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,658
You just get out of the habit.

628
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,438
Line up, you tramps! This
ain't no upstairs delicatessen.

629
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,037
Time for count.

630
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:47,766
- Lewis, Millie.
- Christianson, Velma.

631
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:49,893
- Stark, Kitty.
- Taylor, Alice.

632
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,232
Allen, Marie.

633
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:54,933
3:00 tomorrow, Benton's
office. Parole hearing.

634
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:56,908
- Mullen, Elaine.
- Cardnum, Ruth.

635
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,611
- Branigan, Lottie.
- Hoffman, Ilsa.

636
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,841
- Elkins, Peggy.
- Vogel, Dottie.

637
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:06,214
When you get in there, say
anything you got on your chest.

638
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,311
It's the one chance you
got to spill the works.

639
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,719
Benton will be pulling for you.

640
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:11,279
And when you get out of this cage,

641
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,294
go take yourself a bubble bath
for me and park in it for a week.

642
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:18,695
Have your breakfast,
dinner, everything in it.

643
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,100
You know, honey, you're gonna find
out that most people in free side

644
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:24,864
wouldn't hand you a job
cleaning out a hog pen.

645
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:28,101
- If you'd listen to me...
- You're wasting your time, Kitty.

646
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:30,142
Your funeral.

647
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:45,152
Hey, Foley, wait till Kitty Stark sees this.

648
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:49,818
- Are they friends?
- Friends? They hate each other's guts.

649
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,467
What's so funny?

650
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:05,272
We've got a new fish coming in.

651
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:08,280
Maybe if you're real nice, you
might get her for a roommate.

652
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:11,613
And old friend of yours, Elvira Powell.

653
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:17,113
It's going to be a rich haul.
None of your penny-ante stuff.

654
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,748
You'll still do what I pay you to do.

655
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:20,417
Them days are over.

656
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:25,294
Hey, girls, take a look at your queen
bee. She's buzzing off the throne.

657
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:27,230
She never was nothing
but a dime-a-dozen booster

658
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,427
with so little influence
she couldn't even get off

659
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:31,629
on self-defense for a murder rap.

660
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:36,301
I ain't got nothing against you. It's
just a matter of dollars and cents.

661
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:40,472
Elvira Powell's an institution
with a big bankroll stashed away,

662
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:43,482
and I always wanted to meet an institution.

663
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:51,523
Someday I'm going to
get my hands in her hair,

664
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:54,318
and I'm gonna pull it out by the roots.

665
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,338
I made it! I made it! I made my parole!

666
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,148
This is Marie Allen.

667
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:02,192
Marie, we have to decide

668
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:05,857
whether nine months has taught you that
robbing people at the point of a gun...

669
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:09,129
I never wanted to, but my
husband wouldn't listen to reason.

670
00:58:09,202 --> 00:58:11,830
I couldn't leave him. I loved him.

671
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:20,678
Now, what type of work can you do?

672
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:27,118
Speak up.

673
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:31,852
I could be a salesgirl or wait tables,

674
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,951
work in a laundry after all
the experience I've had here.

675
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:37,019
Please try to make your answers brief.

676
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:43,429
This report states your stepfather
refuses to have you in his home.

677
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:45,766
Where would you live if paroled?

678
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:51,272
Well, where would you live? With relatives?

679
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:55,178
With my Aunt Rose and Uncle
Harry. They're very respectable.

680
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:57,944
Uncle Harry's a gateman for
one of the biggest factories.

681
00:58:58,017 --> 00:58:59,348
They're very fond of me.

682
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:02,411
If they're so fond of you, why
didn't they take your child?

683
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:04,820
Well, a baby would have
been a lot of trouble.

684
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:06,290
I wouldn't be.

685
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:09,494
We'll investigate them.

686
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:14,432
Maybe it would be better if I lived
alone, anyplace the parole officer found.

687
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,968
Out of the question. We must make certain

688
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:19,436
that you have beneficial
surroundings and guidance.

689
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:23,407
You're hardly more than a child, only 19.

690
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,678
A girl grows old here before her time.

691
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:29,942
Marie's been married. She's
seen her husband killed.

692
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:31,779
She's borne a baby here in prison.

693
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:34,547
She's had the baby taken
away from her by law.

694
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:38,785
How can anyone be called young who
has lived through such experiences?

695
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:41,349
I've lived a lifetime in a year in this cage!

696
00:59:41,427 --> 00:59:43,418
If I have to fall back in,
I'll be like the others.

697
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,327
And I'm not like them!

698
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:48,299
Oh, please. Please, give
me a chance to prove it.

699
00:59:48,368 --> 00:59:50,666
I've paid my debt. Let me out, please.

700
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:53,467
You'll never regret it. I promise I'll...

701
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:06,384
What? What?

702
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:10,047
Wait till I fix this thing. I
haven't gotten the hang of it yet.

703
01:00:16,462 --> 01:00:19,761
At your age, with no
favorable home conditions

704
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:23,268
and no beneficent influences on the outside,

705
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:25,566
we feel that nine months is too short a time

706
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:28,106
to prepare you for your
responsibilities outside.

707
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:30,873
Parole is not granted.

708
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:34,105
We'll review your case in a few
months, and you'll hear from us.

709
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:37,840
Got flopped back. Tried to do a mope.

710
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:39,773
Hanging on a bush, eh?

711
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:41,573
Benton says no solitary.

712
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:44,172
Oh, Benton's a fool. If I had her job, I'd...

713
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:46,449
Benton's okay with me.

714
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:56,560
So I go on this picnic, see?
Skinny takes me out in a rowboat,

715
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:00,565
begins criticizing my family, though,
and to make it worse, he slaps me,

716
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,930
so I slap him back.

717
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:03,468
You just slapped him?

718
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:05,902
Well, I did have an oar in my hand.

719
01:02:06,406 --> 01:02:08,704
He kept on hitting me,
so I kept on slapping him.

720
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,242
Still with your oar in your hand?

721
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,901
What did you keep on slapping him for?

722
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,003
Well, he kept on coming up.

723
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,744
Pipe the new fish.

724
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,716
Get a load of Elvira Powell.

725
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:20,878
Hello, girls.

726
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:24,252
So help me, I never saw such
an old-looking bunch of bags.

727
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,655
I've checked in here for maybe six months.

728
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:28,990
Grand jury's having itself a little fun,

729
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,291
so in order to save some
of my friends embarrassment,

730
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:34,333
I got myself a phony rap so they
can't subpoena me as a witness.

731
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,803
It'll all blow over by spring. I'm
used to comfort, and I'll expect it.

732
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:40,498
Pick up your check at my lawyer's, Big Davis.

733
01:02:40,573 --> 01:02:45,476
There's $100 waiting for you
every week for value received.

734
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,541
Hello, Kitty.

735
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:56,712
Read about you and Ed. Divorcing
him would have been easier.

736
01:02:58,224 --> 01:03:01,660
Gimpy Sullivan says you're drumming
up shoplifters from the inside.

737
01:03:01,727 --> 01:03:02,819
I got a concession.

738
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:06,797
No more. While I'm in, I
want no kibitzing from you.

739
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:16,302
What's your name?
How'd you hurt your hand?

740
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,046
I'm a big girl, and this isn't
my first year away from home.

741
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,278
My name is Marie Allen.

742
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,115
If I said no to Kitty, I'm
sure not gonna say yes to you.

743
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:31,751
She's a cute trick.

744
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,134
Oh, wake up, Lottie. You're playing a game.

745
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,337
Sure, you could sit down in a
department store some places.

746
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,039
That could be a gold
egg you got in your hand.

747
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:59,312
Okay, now try it again, and make out
like that cake of soap's a diamond pin.

748
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:03,785
- How much?
- $150.

749
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:05,483
Okay, wrap it up.

750
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:15,033
Spotters would have nabbed you.

751
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,966
I'm too dumb to be a booster.

752
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,970
Some dames got more talent than others.

753
01:04:19,038 --> 01:04:22,303
But I got to have some trade
if I ever get out of here.

754
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,774
You any good at it, Marie?

755
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:27,040
Anybody with half a brain could
figure out how to fool a spotter.

756
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,145
Pigeon like you would get her
wings clipped first trip out.

757
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:38,714
Now, let's see.

758
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:43,387
If this is the jewelry counter,
what counter would be over there?

759
01:04:44,263 --> 01:04:46,424
I guess perfume, gloves.

760
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:50,224
Then the elevators would be over there?

761
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,600
Yeah.

762
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:58,138
- That's showing her.
- Guess she showed her!

763
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,944
A bull's eye, baby! By
the time you're sprung,

764
01:05:03,015 --> 01:05:05,210
I can have you connected with
one of the biggest outfits...

765
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:10,821
Come on, you tramps. Line up for Christmas.

766
01:05:15,127 --> 01:05:16,389
Nina Minnelli.

767
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:22,233
Emma Barber. Emma Barber.

768
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:26,594
Mary O'Connor.

769
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,732
Santa Claus couldn't get in here. He's a man!

770
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:31,834
Marie Allen.

771
01:05:34,914 --> 01:05:36,643
Sadie Fillmore.

772
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:41,010
Naomi Bates.

773
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:42,918
Mary Brown.

774
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:46,919
What do you know? Jungle red.

775
01:05:46,993 --> 01:05:49,484
It's funny how lipstick can
make you feel all prettied up.

776
01:05:49,562 --> 01:05:50,824
Who sent them?

777
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:53,228
Powell slipped Harper a
check to buy them for us.

778
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:55,529
That bloated buzzard! Who
does she think she's kidding?

779
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:59,697
Lipstick. She knows we can't keep them.
She only did it to get Benton sore.

780
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:03,534
She'll drool when she sees the Super
coming and taking them away from us.

781
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:07,340
Well, until Benton finds out,
I sure feel like a new woman.

782
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:29,794
Rhinestones are phony.

783
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:35,037
You can have real ones
anytime you change your type.

784
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:49,278
There's $100 extra in it for you

785
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:52,290
if you get word to Benton
that Kitty's recruiting.

786
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:02,863
- Merry Christmas, girls.
- Merry Christmas!

787
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,460
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, how pretty.

788
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:10,806
I hope you'll all have
a pleasant day tomorrow.

789
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,408
Let's hope that many of you
will be home this time next year.

790
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:19,242
Now, tomorrow morning, there will
be Christmas services held here

791
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:22,014
for any of you who might like to attend.

792
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,233
Oh, Ann, where did the lipsticks come from?

793
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:43,931
Elvira Powell.

794
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:47,008
Oh, of course, by way of Harper.

795
01:07:48,414 --> 01:07:53,317
Girls? Girls, could I have
your attention a minute, please?

796
01:07:53,753 --> 01:07:56,313
I didn't know what else to
do for you for Christmas,

797
01:07:56,388 --> 01:07:58,913
but evidently, someone thought of it for me,

798
01:07:59,191 --> 01:08:03,855
so from now on, all of you
will be allowed to use lipstick.

799
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:17,866
Merry Christmas, Marie.
Why aren't you singing?

800
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,930
Give me one good reason why I should.

801
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:37,216
I know this is a frame, and I
got a rough idea who's back of it.

802
01:09:57,676 --> 01:10:01,112
I've been stretching muscles that
haven't been stretched in 30 years.

803
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,681
Even that soft job in the mailroom poops me.

804
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:08,446
I've been a lady of leisure too
long. What's new in the social set?

805
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,616
Kitty Stark is still in solitary.
I think she'll listen to reason now.

806
01:10:12,691 --> 01:10:14,283
Meaning what?

807
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,160
She tried to play rough with me when
I was taking her down to the hole.

808
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:20,528
I didn't tell you to get tough with her.

809
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:24,000
By the time I got through with
her, she knew I meant business.

810
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,601
Look what she's got.

811
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:08,339
I found it outside the
laundry. I'm gonna keep it.

812
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:10,541
Sure must be a dopey cat to crawl in here.

813
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:11,742
Boy or girl?

814
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:14,684
I'm not taking any chances.
I'm gonna call it Fluff.

815
01:11:14,753 --> 01:11:17,278
Harper will pitch a doozy if she finds it.

816
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:30,692
I'll bring my milk from supper.

817
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:32,994
Line up for count!

818
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,879
Line up for count!

819
01:12:57,656 --> 01:12:59,351
- Lewis, Millie.
- Christiansen, Velma.

820
01:12:59,425 --> 01:13:01,416
- Kopsky, Gita.
- O'Connor, Mary.

821
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:03,290
- O'Brian, Julie.
- Wagner, Rita.

822
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:05,557
- Devlin, Claire.
- Minnelli, Nina.

823
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,064
- Barber, Emma.
- Menard, Tina.

824
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,657
- Cassidy, Katie.
- Bates, Naomi.

825
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:21,376
Okay, where is it?

826
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,110
You don't get no breakfast
till you hand over that cat.

827
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,897
You know it's against the
rules to have any pets.

828
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:43,562
Hand it over.

829
01:15:04,349 --> 01:15:08,615
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

830
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:19,264
All of you know this is one
of the most serious offenses

831
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:20,628
that can happen here.

832
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:24,830
I'm taking away all privileges
until further notice.

833
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,334
Now, I want to know who started all this.

834
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:44,512
It's dead.

835
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,888
She attacked me when I
tried to take away the cat.

836
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,688
Then she tried to escape.

837
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:50,861
Is this true?

838
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:56,329
The first time you tried to escape,
I gave you the benefit of the doubt.

839
01:15:56,401 --> 01:15:58,426
This time, you have to be disciplined.

840
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:01,667
I'm going to put you in
solitary for three days.

841
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,275
All I wanted was the kitten.

842
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:05,776
Three days?

843
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:07,607
Those are my orders.

844
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:16,377
My room.

845
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:17,581
No, Evy. No!

846
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,317
Do like I said.

847
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:35,135
If Benton ever finds out...

848
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:36,572
Shut up.

849
01:17:19,418 --> 01:17:23,616
- Marie Allen, three days.
- I'm taking Kitty Stark back.

850
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:45,568
You better have the doctor
see her before Benton does.

851
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:47,168
She looks stir-bugs to me.

852
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,645
I'll take her over to the infirmary.

853
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,289
<i>Nothing to be scared about.
Being alone isn't so tough,</i>

854
01:18:04,363 --> 01:18:06,763
<i>and bread and water never killed anyone.</i>

855
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:10,392
<i>Maybe I'll sleep for three days.</i>

856
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,905
<i>Stop thinking about it. It'll grow back.</i>

857
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:25,572
Let me out of here! I'll
do anything you want!

858
01:18:26,351 --> 01:18:29,650
Oh, God! Let me out. Let me out.

859
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:34,249
Please, please, please!

860
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:40,391
That's what you think!

861
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:45,603
Don't leave. I want you to hear this.

862
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,467
Send a wire to the Commissioner.

863
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,241
Demand that you immediately
dismiss Matron Evelyn Harper.

864
01:18:51,843 --> 01:18:55,040
Inmate in serious condition of
shock due to clipping of hair.

865
01:18:55,113 --> 01:18:59,209
Harper repeatedly ordered to
discontinue these barbarous practices.

866
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,881
Insubordination reflects on my position

867
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:04,285
and the health and
well-being of the inmates.

868
01:19:04,356 --> 01:19:07,154
I'd count 10 before you sent that.

869
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:20,000
Benton sure means business.

870
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:22,471
Medford, 5342.

871
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:25,874
I can't afford to lose
my job, Evy. I got debts.

872
01:19:25,944 --> 01:19:27,605
Shut up.

873
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:29,269
<i>Yes.</i>

874
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,747
I want to speak to Thornton Goodrich, please.

875
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:33,114
Tell him Evelyn Harper.

876
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,482
<i>Yes, ma 'am.</i>

877
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,618
We're sort of distant cousins,
you know, Thornton and me.

878
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,354
<i>Good morning.</i>

879
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:46,689
Happy New Year, Thornton. How are you?

880
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,065
Oh, just fine, thanks.

881
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:54,233
I got something you ought to know.

882
01:19:56,541 --> 01:20:00,136
Oh, I couldn't tell you over
the phone, but it's dynamite.

883
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:07,648
Those filthy lies!

884
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,779
But at least it's nice to know we
have the support of so many people.

885
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:11,948
Three welfare leagues,

886
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:14,287
a half a dozen women's clubs
from all over the country.

887
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:16,190
If they'd only get
together and stick together,

888
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:18,923
then maybe situations
like this wouldn't arise.

889
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,294
You can just bet the
others have organization.

890
01:20:21,366 --> 01:20:25,166
And they won't stop there.
What are you going to do?

891
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,470
I'll know better after I
talk to the Commissioner.

892
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:30,235
They're sitting outside looking so smug.

893
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:32,276
Send them in.

894
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:39,380
Good morning.

895
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:41,078
Good morning, Commissioner.
Won't you sit down?

896
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:43,143
I think there are ashtrays handy.

897
01:20:43,221 --> 01:20:45,189
The Governor's madder
than a turkey gobbler.

898
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,384
Everyone's on my neck
because of what you've done.

899
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:48,949
Aren't you confused, Commissioner?

900
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:51,257
It wasn't I who gave those
ridiculous stories to the papers.

901
01:20:51,329 --> 01:20:53,593
What's the idea getting Harper
sore over nothing at all?

902
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:57,226
I suppose a man would call the clipping
of a girl's hair nothing at all.

903
01:20:57,302 --> 01:21:00,066
Well, you could have talked it over with
her instead of flying off the handle.

904
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:01,196
The Commissioner means,

905
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,639
your predecessor never
quarreled with the staff.

906
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:07,166
My predecessor refused to
regard criminals as human beings.

907
01:21:07,245 --> 01:21:10,942
I've tried to change that attitude.
I intend to keep on trying.

908
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:15,112
There is no place on my staff
for matrons like Evelyn Harper.

909
01:21:15,186 --> 01:21:17,848
It's too bad all this had to
happen before she was fired.

910
01:21:17,923 --> 01:21:19,891
Who said anything about firing her?

911
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,949
Why fire a political appointee

912
01:21:22,027 --> 01:21:25,155
just because of a minor
difference between you and her?

913
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:29,132
Besides, firing her won't do us any good.
It's this stink we've got to squelch.

914
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,861
How do you intend doing that?

915
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:32,870
I can get Harper to take back what she said.

916
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:35,498
She can call it a mistake,
admit that she was hot-headed.

917
01:21:35,574 --> 01:21:37,064
The directives, Sam.

918
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,371
Well, I'm coming to that.

919
01:21:40,011 --> 01:21:41,103
At the same time, we'll announce

920
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:43,477
that these directives are to
be put into effect immediately.

921
01:21:43,548 --> 01:21:44,640
Directives?

922
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:47,651
The Commissioner has put it
in the form of a memo to you.

923
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:50,244
"Inmates who have been honor
women will no longer be put

924
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,415
"in subordinate positions on the staff.

925
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,555
"The proposed plan to allow
occasional work outside the prison

926
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:58,221
"when merited by selected girls is denied

927
01:21:58,296 --> 01:22:00,560
"as well as the proposed
plan for educational..."

928
01:22:00,632 --> 01:22:03,226
You don't honestly think I'd consent to that?

929
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:05,269
Why, I'd be betraying every man and woman

930
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,135
working to free prisons
from methods like yours,

931
01:22:08,406 --> 01:22:11,569
to insulate them from the abuses
of politicians, cheap politicians.

932
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:14,077
Have respect for my position, Mrs. Benton.

933
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:16,204
I wouldn't allow the Governor
to speak to me like that!

934
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:19,739
Oh, Fred, Mrs. Benton,
let's not lose our tempers.

935
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,914
Look, we came here with the
best intentions in the world,

936
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:27,515
hoping to get together with you,
to let this thing all blow over,

937
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:30,925
but you leave me with no alternative,
except to ask for your resignation.

938
01:22:30,996 --> 01:22:33,692
If he asks for my resignation,
I'll demand a public hearing.

939
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,665
Now, just see here. We can get together.

940
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:39,135
We can if you tear up those
directives and fire Evelyn Harper.

941
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:41,868
That will clear my name
and allow me to do the work

942
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,237
that must be done around here.

943
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:45,037
He'll do nothing of the kind.

944
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:47,044
Then I'll announce you've
asked for my resignation,

945
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:48,636
and I'll demand a public hearing.

946
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:51,580
The State allows me such
a hearing, and you know it.

947
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,742
Let the public learn how this prison is run.

948
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:57,986
Fire me, Commissioner. I insist on it.

949
01:22:58,423 --> 01:23:00,857
I want that public hearing.

950
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,961
Marie Allen, back from the hospital.

951
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:55,361
Stop it! Stop it!

952
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,835
Stop it!

953
01:25:00,545 --> 01:25:02,012
Peggy Elkins.

954
01:25:03,214 --> 01:25:04,511
Naomi Bates.

955
01:25:04,582 --> 01:25:06,482
Honest, sometimes I wish
that old lady of mine

956
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:08,178
- would stop writing me.
- Julie Klein.

957
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:10,813
- "I sure wish you could be out by Easter...
- Tammy Slovo.

958
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:12,447
"...so you could see your kid brother...

959
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,617
- "...graduate from high school."
- Thelma Graham.

960
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:16,125
She must think I'm in a country club,

961
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,923
- taking a rest cure.
- Ruth Cardnum.

962
01:25:18,163 --> 01:25:19,755
- I got news for her.
- Nina Christiansen.

963
01:25:19,831 --> 01:25:22,698
My kid brother's gonna
get graduated without me.

964
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:23,859
Mimi Fuller.

965
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:25,402
Judas Priest!

966
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,365
Mary O'Connor.

967
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:29,235
Arlene Sidney.

968
01:25:30,074 --> 01:25:31,541
Evelyn Mason.

969
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,068
Alma Jones.

970
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,578
Mary Adams.

971
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:38,874
Luana Cohen.

972
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:40,281
Gee, look how she looks.

973
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:41,545
- Guess you'd look that way, too...
- Tracy Swanson.

974
01:25:41,619 --> 01:25:42,745
...if you had a week in solitary.

975
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:45,153
- Yeah, and almost a month in pogey.
- Helga Jorgensen.

976
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:06,005
I didn't know what kind of a heel Harper is.

977
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,512
She's like a cop I was sweet on once.

978
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,707
He used to work guys
over for no reason at all,

979
01:26:10,782 --> 01:26:12,875
just because it made him feel important.

980
01:26:13,651 --> 01:26:16,586
If I'd known, I wouldn't have started on you.

981
01:26:18,823 --> 01:26:21,087
Quit shaking the tambourine.

982
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:25,126
I'll be sprung soon.
You'll run the cage again.

983
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:30,299
If I can do anything for you,
try to get your rap shortened...

984
01:26:31,669 --> 01:26:33,296
What did you say?

985
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,707
- Wagner, Rita.
- Devlin, Claire.

986
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,110
- Minnelli, Nina.
- Barber, Emma.

987
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:44,614
- Menard, Tina.
- Cassidy, Katie.

988
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:46,081
Bates, Naomi.

989
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,652
Don't be smart. Let's have the name.

990
01:26:52,557 --> 01:26:54,024
Stark, Kitty.

991
01:26:54,926 --> 01:26:56,257
Taylor, Alice.

992
01:26:56,327 --> 01:26:58,261
- Allen, Marie.
- Mullen, Elaine.

993
01:27:12,744 --> 01:27:16,305
Okay, dummy, if you can't hold
that cup, get back to the bullpen.

994
01:27:21,886 --> 01:27:25,151
Feed your faces and keep your traps
shut if you don't want to get...

995
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:29,522
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

996
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:43,402
Kindly omit flowers.

997
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:13,860
Sunday. Nothing for me to do except
think about the next 10 years.

998
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:15,769
Here today, here tomorrow.

999
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:18,667
What's your itch?

1000
01:28:18,743 --> 01:28:22,839
Oh, I keep thinking of Kitty sitting
in the death house, and I get...

1001
01:28:23,314 --> 01:28:24,975
Take it easy before you blow a tube.

1002
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,311
You got to hand it to Benton.

1003
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,046
Even with all her trouble, she
tried to keep Kitty off the hot seat.

1004
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,146
Yeah, she kept telling them
Kitty was off her trolley.

1005
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,256
Boy, what's going on in Benton's office!

1006
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:36,657
There's six matrons spilling over

1007
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,389
and a bunch of girls from the other bullpens.

1008
01:28:38,463 --> 01:28:40,397
- What did you tell Benton?
- I shot the works.

1009
01:28:40,465 --> 01:28:41,898
Helen wrote down every word,

1010
01:28:41,966 --> 01:28:44,958
all about Harper chiseling
the liquor and soap and things,

1011
01:28:45,036 --> 01:28:47,561
what she did to Kitty. I
sure gave them a earful.

1012
01:28:47,638 --> 01:28:50,436
You know something? I think Benton
might use me as a witness at the hearing.

1013
01:28:50,508 --> 01:28:52,669
Maybe there are a few things
I can tell her tomorrow, too.

1014
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,838
I've got news for you. She talked
to me like I was anybody else.

1015
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:58,173
Bet you a pack a week

1016
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,581
you'll still be pulling
dead time next Christmas.

1017
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:01,811
Keep your big flapper shut.

1018
01:29:01,886 --> 01:29:03,615
Claire's giving it to you straight.

1019
01:29:03,688 --> 01:29:06,054
Ain't you played the honest John too long?

1020
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,285
You could have made a swell booster.

1021
01:29:08,526 --> 01:29:10,721
You still can get out of here.

1022
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:20,665
You ain't got much time.
She's being sprung tomorrow.

1023
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:24,003
What do you want Powell to do,
send you an engraved invitation?

1024
01:29:26,811 --> 01:29:30,247
These birdbrains giving you
spiel what to do out in free side!

1025
01:29:30,314 --> 01:29:33,909
Hand me a laugh. I got
a file long as your arm.

1026
01:29:33,985 --> 01:29:37,011
I was queen of the con women
when Claire was wearing diapers.

1027
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:39,386
There's nothing I ain't
done, including murder.

1028
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,652
Stop tooting your horn.

1029
01:29:41,726 --> 01:29:45,492
But that makes me the crookedest
crook of any of you, don't it? Okay.

1030
01:29:47,165 --> 01:29:50,760
Before you get any bright
ideas, listen to me.

1031
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:55,272
I had a first time like you, but
I can't remember how long ago.

1032
01:29:55,773 --> 01:29:59,800
Then the second rap, then
the third. Now I'm a lifer.

1033
01:30:00,344 --> 01:30:04,440
I'll be 71 soon. Been a con 40 years,

1034
01:30:04,849 --> 01:30:08,876
and you know what I think?
Nobody got cheated but me.

1035
01:30:09,454 --> 01:30:11,581
Forty years taken away.

1036
01:30:12,123 --> 01:30:14,421
So I'm giving it to you straight.

1037
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:19,191
Wait a year on dead time, but
get a legit job slinging hash.

1038
01:30:19,263 --> 01:30:22,289
Then, get a good guy, have a kid.

1039
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,169
What I'd give for a sink
full of dirty dishes.

1040
01:30:31,142 --> 01:30:32,370
Quiet.

1041
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:38,580
No, that's all right.

1042
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:40,310
Ain't they cute?

1043
01:30:40,384 --> 01:30:42,648
Amateurs coming for lessons.

1044
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,850
Bullpen B, 60 inmates,
all types of offenders.

1045
01:30:46,924 --> 01:30:48,585
This place smells like a zoo.

1046
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:50,217
What's she in for?

1047
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,728
And men call us the weaker sex.

1048
01:30:53,798 --> 01:30:56,926
- Look at those faces.
- Environment, my dear. Environment.

1049
01:30:57,001 --> 01:31:00,300
They say the Superintendent
has a murderess working for her.

1050
01:32:18,716 --> 01:32:20,308
- Did you make it?
- Yeah.

1051
01:32:20,384 --> 01:32:21,851
Gee, she's getting out.

1052
01:32:26,657 --> 01:32:28,454
Mamie will press them for you.

1053
01:32:35,366 --> 01:32:38,096
Marie Allen, checking out. 93850.

1054
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:40,433
That's six cents a day for laundry work.

1055
01:32:40,504 --> 01:32:43,371
Deduct 10 days for having
a baby, three days solitary,

1056
01:32:43,441 --> 01:32:46,035
that's 502 days times six cents.

1057
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:47,975
You can cash this on your way out.

1058
01:32:48,045 --> 01:32:49,876
Oh, wait a minute.

1059
01:32:49,947 --> 01:32:52,472
Guess you want your wedding ring,
don't you?

1060
01:33:01,892 --> 01:33:03,792
Thanks for the haircut.

1061
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:13,528
Sit down, Marie.

1062
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:28,816
Now that you're leaving,
let's not lie to each other.

1063
01:33:29,453 --> 01:33:32,854
- What do you mean?
- This cashier's job is just a blind.

1064
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,253
The parole officer okayed it, didn't she?

1065
01:33:35,326 --> 01:33:37,590
Elvira Powell has a lot of friends.

1066
01:33:38,129 --> 01:33:39,187
In a couple of more months,

1067
01:33:39,263 --> 01:33:40,890
the parole officer could have found you work.

1068
01:33:40,965 --> 01:33:44,526
You'd have made some honest money,
have self-respect and decency.

1069
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:46,794
Where did those things ever get me?

1070
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,964
Why do you give up now
that you don't need to?

1071
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,098
When you're free?

1072
01:33:50,174 --> 01:33:53,109
Free for what? Go to my baby?

1073
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:55,111
To sit down to a turkey dinner with a family?

1074
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:56,874
To kiss my husband?

1075
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:06,922
I know it's difficult to
start over again, but...

1076
01:34:06,991 --> 01:34:09,653
From now on, what's in it
for me is all that matters.

1077
01:34:11,329 --> 01:34:13,820
You did your best and where did it land you?

1078
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:16,289
You can't lick the system.

1079
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:21,862
Well, if you've got nothing more to say...

1080
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,264
Well, if you ever need any help...

1081
01:34:24,342 --> 01:34:26,105
Thanks, but I won't.

1082
01:34:28,179 --> 01:34:31,512
Well, I hope you win.

1083
01:34:43,027 --> 01:34:45,257
For that $40 Tom and I heisted,

1084
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:48,094
I certainly got myself an education.

1085
01:34:50,735 --> 01:34:53,465
Here's the address of
the parole officer, Marie.

1086
01:34:54,138 --> 01:34:56,231
- Goodbye.
- So long.

1087
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:03,940
Front gate, 93850 coming out.

1088
01:35:04,482 --> 01:35:05,949
That's right.

1089
01:36:06,043 --> 01:36:08,238
What shall I do with her file?

1090
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,506
Keep it active. She'll be back.
