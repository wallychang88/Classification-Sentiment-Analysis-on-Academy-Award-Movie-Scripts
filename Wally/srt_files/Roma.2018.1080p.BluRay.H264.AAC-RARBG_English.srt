Other languages not subtitled

2
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,780
You need a bath, Borras.

3
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,006
- [ Manita, manita. ]
- [ Yes? ]

4
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,594
- [ It's almost 1pm. ]
- [ I'm coming. ]

5
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,243
- Manita, my keys...
- [ There they are. ]

6
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,633
- [ I'm leaving. ]
- [ Take care. ]

7
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,431
Borras, stay.

8
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,508
- Don't let him out.
- Hi, Borras.

9
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,224
[ Manita, manita!
Fermín is on the phone. ]

10
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,269
What are you saying?

11
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,609
- [ Go away. ]
- [ Ok, but I want to know. ]

12
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,905
- What are you saying?
- Go upstairs.

13
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,325
Stop talking like that.

14
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,203
Go.

15
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,221
- [ What did Fermín say? ]
- [ Just hello. ]

16
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,474
[ Yeah right. ]
You're dating!

17
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:42,438
[ Of course not. ]
He’s just a friend.

18
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:49,862
- Besides, you introduced us.
- I'm just messing with you.

19
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,698
They're home.

20
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,784
Borras.

21
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:02,958
Borras, stay.
Come in.

22
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,144
So that kid was throwing water balloons
at cars that were driving by.

23
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:28,150
Then an army jeep drove by,
the kid throws a balloon at it,

24
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,861
the soldier gets mad,
he gets out, and shoots him.

25
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,196
Oh God! Is he ok?

26
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,865
He shot him in the head.
He's dead.

27
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,408
How awful.

28
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,078
Adela?

29
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:45,334
Mrs. Sofia is here
and the kids want strawberries.

30
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,544
Hurry.

31
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,382
Thank you.

32
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,009
- I got an A plus.
- That's great!

33
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,762
And Sofi did, too, I imagine.

34
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,933
Cleo, my husband's two suits
need to be taken to the cleaners.

35
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,686
But do it today, please.
He needs to pack, he's leaving Friday.

36
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,521
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

37
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,983
- Dad's going away?
- To a conference in Quebec.

38
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,152
- Where is that?
- In Canada!

39
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,366
- You're so stupid!
- I didn't know, so what?

40
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,910
Not for Sofi, she'll get fat.

41
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:28,036
When I tell you that I'm poor,
you won't ever, smile again...

42
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:36,969
I long to have it all,
and lay it at your feet...

43
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:45,304
But I was born poor,
and you'll never love me.

44
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,609
- You shouldn't be up here.
- I'm taking care of him.

45
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:58,490
Your mom won't like it.
Don't go near the edge.

46
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,139
- You were supposed to die.
- Why me?

47
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,225
- 'Cause it's my game.
- Then I don't want to play anymore.

48
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,145
Well, I don't want you to play it,
you little sissy.

49
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,720
And what's up with you?
Aren't you gonna tell me?

50
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,226
- Can't talk. I'm dead.
- Then resurrect.

51
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,939
- I can't. I'm dead.
- Alright then.

52
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,868
What are you doing?

53
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,542
What are you doing?
Tell me.

54
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,379
I can't. I'm dead.

55
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:47,474
Hey. I like being dead.

56
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,403
Here, Borras.

57
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,920
Dad's home early!

58
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,334
- Who's here?
- Daddy.

59
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,738
- Hello.
- Who are these kids?

60
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,242
- I'm glad you're home early.
- What a surprise!

61
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,625
- Money for the hurdy gurdy?
- I don't see any.

62
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,501
No, money to get one.

63
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,231
- So tell me Your Excellence.
- Your Excellence.

64
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,048
Thank you, sir.

65
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,426
- Have you heard the latest news?
- What about?

66
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,136
Hawaii, Doctor.

67
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,389
I'm very well, thank you.

68
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,680
- Cleo, can you get the Doctor a tea?
- No! She's with me!

69
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,351
- She'll be right back.
- Just a few more minutes.

70
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,920
[ Scoot. ]

71
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,464
[ Hey! ]

72
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,553
Make Dr. Antonio a chamomile.
[ Move. ]

73
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,941
Angel of God, my guardian dear...

74
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,403
to whom God's love commits me here.
Ever this day, be at my side...

75
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,115
to light and guard,
and rule and guide.

76
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,875
[ Little one, sleepy little one. ]

77
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:10,797
[ Sleep with the angels. ]

78
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,770
Time to sleep, my darling.

79
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,440
- Good night, Cleo.
- Good night, Sofi.

80
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,358
I love you.

81
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,571
I love you too.
Sweet dreams.

82
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,865
You too.

83
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,746
Toño, go to sleep!

84
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,958
And if your mom asks
when you'll be back?

85
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,213
I'll call her.
Where's my brown tie?

86
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,425
- I'll ask Cleo.
- This house is a mess.

87
00:18:55,551 --> 00:19:02,140
The fridge is full of empty cartons
and there's dog crap everywhere.

88
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:52,250
- [ Why so long, manita? ]
- [ Pepe turned on the lights again. ]

89
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,836
[ He's a prankster. ]

90
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,131
- Yes. My boy.
- Little devil.

91
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,385
Yes. But I love him.
Turn off the light.

92
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,097
[ Mrs. Teresa doesn't
like it on. ]

93
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:12,270
[ Oh that Mrs. Teresa.
She is probably spying on us. ]

94
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:18,109
Yeah, she's there stalking you.

95
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,781
- Hurry up.
- She probably stays awake.

96
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,910
Taking care of us.

97
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,664
Taking care we don't
waste electricity.

98
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,667
- Ready?
- Yes.

99
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,628
One.

100
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,798
Two.

101
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,134
Three.

102
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,431
[ Mrs. Adela. ]

103
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,935
One.

104
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,439
- For the tamales.
- They were yummy.

105
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,402
Two.
For the tortas.

106
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,016
- [ I won. ]
- [ We drew. ]

107
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,144
- [ No, I won. ]
- [ But the car! ]

108
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,022
[ Let's eat. ]

109
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,447
No movement yet.

110
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:51,536
Professor Zovek is used
to challenges.

111
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:57,584
[ Do you remember 'pushy' Moises,
from home? ]

112
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,714
- [ He kept sending me letters. ]
- [ What did they say? ]

113
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,467
[ That he can't stop
thinking about me. ]

114
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,428
[ That he needs to see me. ]

115
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:13,850
[ Then my cousin arrives carrying
a bunch of letters. ]

116
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:18,104
[ And I recognized Moises'
handwriting on one. ]

117
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,108
[ So I grabbed it and opened it. ]

118
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:28,782
[ "I can't stop thinking about you.
I want to see you." ]

119
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,285
- [ Sweet thing. ]
- [ Yeah right, 'sweet'. ]

120
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,664
- [ That letter was for another girl! ]
- No!

121
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:42,087
The bastard sends exactly the
same letter to all the girls.

122
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,676
Why so lonely with your tortitas?

123
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,554
Hello, Ramón!
Hello, Fermín!

124
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,182
- You guys want a bite?
- Thanks, we ate.

125
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:58,770
If you're done, let's go.
I like watching the previews.

126
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's go.

127
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:34,472
- You really feel like seeing a movie?
- I like movies. Don't you?

128
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,892
But it's so nice outside.

129
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,396
Yes, it's nice.
Want to go to the park?

130
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,649
Sure.
Give me a sec.

131
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,989
What, you not coming?

132
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,701
- It's really nice outside.
- Look at you.

133
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:59,080
I'd rather play in the dark.
Tell me everything later.

134
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,086
Shall we?

135
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:13,446
- What?
- You train every day?

136
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:19,035
I must.
I owe my life to martial arts.

137
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,206
I grew up with nothing.

138
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:32,792
My mother died when I was a kid.
I moved with my aunt to the slums.

139
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:39,347
There my cousins beat me.
And I met the wrong crowd.

140
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:44,560
And I started drinking, and then huffing.
I was dying.

141
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:51,067
But then I discovered martial arts.

142
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,278
And everything came into...

143
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,906
focus.

144
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,456
Just like when you look at me.

145
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,765
[ Kitty, kitty,
sleepy kitty cat. ]

146
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:50,603
[ Wake up as here
comes the mouse. ]

147
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,827
- Good morning, my princess.
- Morning, Cleo.

148
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,329
Time to wake up.

149
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,749
I need to pee.

150
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,923
- Good morning, Sofi.
- Good morning, Grandma.

151
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,853
Paco.
Wake up, my angel.

152
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,605
Come on.

153
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,777
It's time.

154
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,535
- I want one!
- They're mine.

155
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,372
- I got them for everyone.
- But I put them in the freezer.

156
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,044
Give Sofi one and I'll
get you a box.

157
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,469
Hurry up kids, it's 7:20.

158
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,181
Nah-huh, it's 7:17.

159
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,142
Here. Get fatter.

160
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,269
- Turn that off!
- No!

161
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,480
- Turn it off!
- Ok, I'll turn it off.

162
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,107
- Cleo, hold the dog.
- Yes, ma'am.

163
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,443
- Get out my way!
- You get out of my way!

164
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,986
Shotgun!

165
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,663
- Put on Radio Exitos!
- I'm up front. I choose.

166
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,335
- Be careful.
- Move over.

167
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,464
- Change the station!
- No, it's Creedence vs. Beatles.

168
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,343
- Move!
- Calm down, for God's sake!

169
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,264
You choose when it's your turn.

170
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,059
- Settle down.
- Shut up.

171
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,896
- I'm not going to shut up.
- You too, quiet!

172
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:07,550
When I was old, you were there,
but you were someone else.

173
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,220
- When you were old?
- Yes.

174
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:16,350
- Or when you get old?
- No, when I was old.

175
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:22,356
- And when was that?
- Before I was born.

176
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:27,528
- And what did you do then?
- I was a pilot.

177
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,240
- A pilot?
- Yes, a fighter pilot.

178
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,119
- Did you like it?
- No, it was scary.

179
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:39,915
Was it?
I'll be right back.

180
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,757
- [ Good evening. ]
- [ Why didn't you wake me? ]

181
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:54,055
God forbid you'll get tired.
Prepare Dr. Antonio's oatmeal.

182
00:32:54,681 --> 00:33:00,061
- Mom!
- Good morning!

183
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,362
Your juice.

184
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,990
Pepe will wait to say
goodbye to Daddy.

185
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,618
- It's fine if he's late.
- Yes, ma'am.

186
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,871
- I'll take the bags, Doctor.
- Thanks.

187
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,041
- Hi, Daddy!
- Your oatmeal is ready, Doctor.

188
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,710
Pepe waited to say goodbye.

189
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,295
Morning, Pepón!

190
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,631
Yuck! Cigarette!

191
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:56,909
- Damn...
- Mom, Daddy stepped on dog poo.

192
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,080
- Let me help you, Cleo.
- Thank you, Doctor.

193
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,589
- Bye, Pepón!
- Bye, Daddy.

194
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,384
- Take care.
- You too.

195
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,846
- Go with Cleo.
- Yes, Mom.

196
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:35,239
- We'll be here, Antonio.
- It’s just a few weeks.

197
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,266
Goddammit! I've told you
to clean up the dog shit!

198
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,561
I'll take him. Come on.

199
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,856
- Bye, Cleo!
- Bye.

200
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,440
Hey, I have to...

201
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:33,334
It’s just that, I'm late.

202
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:51,060
I think I'm pregnant.

203
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:59,234
Ah, well.
That's good, right?

204
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,154
Yes?

205
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,868
Yeah.

206
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,978
- I need the bathroom.
- But it's almost over.

207
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,438
Yes, but I have to go now.
I won't be long.

208
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,774
- Want an ice cream?
- No.

209
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:51,240
No strings!
No tricks!

210
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:02,334
Boom!
Bones is dead!

211
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:17,891
It's raining, it's pouring!
The old man is snoring...

212
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:59,474
[ Manita. You take it. ]

213
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,395
[ Don't be afraid. ]

214
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:17,659
- And when they ask about their dad?
- Say he's on a business trip.

215
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,915
Thank you, Cleo.

216
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:28,837
Mrs. Sofi? When you have
a minute can we talk?

217
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:34,218
Sure,
but just call the kids first.

218
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,053
Ok.

219
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:42,601
- Stay calm.
- Paco, Toño, your mom is calling you!

220
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:48,690
- You have to be strong for the children.
- Okay, Mom.

221
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,947
Sofi, Pepe, your mother
is calling you.

222
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,876
Come, sweetie.
We'll come back after.

223
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:27,104
- I got more hail than Sofi!
- I got more than Pepe!

224
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,525
- No, I got more.
- You both have the same.

225
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,821
- I'm going to the stationers.
- You can go later. Sit down, Cleo.

226
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,531
I have news.

227
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,242
- We're going to Disneyland!
- Yeah, Disneyland!

228
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,829
No. We're spending Christmas
at your uncle's.

229
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:48,959
- It's so boring there!
- No it isn't, my cousins are there!

230
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,045
And NewYear's,
we'll go to the Bárcenas' Hacienda.

231
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,214
Are the Richards going?

232
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,427
- And the Larssons.
- When's Dad coming?

233
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:04,182
His research is keeping
him in Quebec a little longer.

234
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,852
- Until January?
- He doesn't know.

235
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:11,690
But I brought paper so you
can write him a letter.

236
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:16,278
Tell him that you love him and
to please come home soon...

237
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,863
I'm going to the store.

238
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,699
You're not going anywhere
until you're done with your letter.

239
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,328
- Where are you going?
- Can't I write it in my room?

240
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,579
No!

241
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,543
- Sure. Go to your room.
- Then I'm going up too.

242
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,510
Sofi, I need to talk with Cleo.

243
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,472
Help Pepe write his letter at the table.

244
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:47,476
Help him write,
"I miss you a lot, Dad".

245
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:51,855
- Make lots of pretty drawings.
- Let's go, Pepe.

246
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,028
Wait, Sofi!

247
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,824
Come, Cleo.

248
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,039
What's up?

249
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,711
What is it?
Are you alright?

250
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:19,883
- Yes.
- Sure? What's wrong?

251
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,805
- Is your mom alright?
- Yes.

252
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:29,643
- Oh, Mrs. Sofi...
- What's wrong?

253
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:34,940
It’s just that I think
I'm pregnant.

254
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,946
- What do you mean you "think"?
- I haven't gotten my period.

255
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:47,953
- Since when?
- I don't know...

256
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:53,917
- Who's the father?
- Fermín. The cousin of Adela’s boyfriend.

257
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:59,798
- Does he know?
- He's gone.

258
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,843
Silly.

259
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:09,224
- Are you going to fire me?
- Fire you? Of course not!

260
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:14,604
We have to take
you to get checked.

261
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,526
- Look, Mom! I drew a plane.
- Let's see.

262
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:23,155
Why is Cleo crying?

263
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,950
She has a tummy ache.

264
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:33,248
Pain, pain, go away.
I don't want this pain to stay.

265
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,751
Sofi! I told you to help Pepe
write "I miss you a lot, Dad".

266
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,503
He wouldn't let me help!

267
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,923
Sorry.

268
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:22,065
We have an appointment
with Doctor Vélez.

269
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,778
- Under what name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

270
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,321
Here she comes.

271
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,242
- Sofía!
- Margarita! How are you?

272
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,703
Thank you for seeing us.
Remember Cleo?

273
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,831
- Hi, Cleo, how are you?
- Fine, thank you, Doctor.

274
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:42,002
I'm going to check her
and we'll see you later.

275
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,171
Ok. I'll go to say
hi to Dr. Zavala.

276
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:48,466
It'll take about 40 minutes.

277
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,553
Cleo, come with me.

278
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:58,727
When was your last period?
About when?

279
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,605
Three months.

280
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:06,818
Are you sexually active?

281
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,614
You are.

282
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:15,660
When did you start?

283
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,707
Has it been long?

284
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:26,838
- Not long.
- One or two years?

285
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:34,804
- Less.
- But more than three months?

286
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,559
How many sexual partners
have you had?

287
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:45,690
Just one?

288
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,360
Don't worry. This is common.

289
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:53,406
We'll examine you from the waist down...

290
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:58,161
she'll get you in position.

291
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,414
Lie down, carefully.

292
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,799
Put one leg here.

293
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,885
And the other here.

294
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,894
I'll see you in a month.
Any questions?

295
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:28,233
There she is.
I'll go with you.

296
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,404
He hasn't even called the kids.

297
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,782
- Mario!
- Doctor.

298
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,454
- How's Cleo?
- Cleo is fine.

299
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,083
She's three to four months
pregnant.

300
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,670
With some rest she'll be fine.

301
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:54,050
- When's she due?
- Around the end of June.

302
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,178
- Thanks for seeing her.
- It's nothing!

303
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,889
- Take care.
- You too.

304
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,641
- Mario.
- Doctor.

305
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,685
- Take care.
- Thanks.

306
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,896
Cleo, why don't you go to see the
newborns...

307
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,859
while I finish up with Dr. Zavala?

308
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,194
You have to talk to Antonio.

309
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:21,911
- Look at your little sister, Azucena.
- I'm glad she's a girl.

310
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,625
Yes. So you can play with her.

311
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:33,590
I'll do her hair, and bathe her...

312
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:41,139
Soon we'll take her home so
you can play with her.

313
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,603
Earthquake!
Kneel.

314
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,647
Get the babies out!

315
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,692
- Don't run!
- Use the stairs!

316
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,570
"Our Father, Who art in Heaven..."

317
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,450
Hurry, the babies!

318
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,930
Are they gonna be talking in English
the whole time?

319
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,270
Yes. And Ricky isn't even Gringo,
he was born in Mexico.

320
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,648
- Yes, but his mom is Gringa.
- Leslie scares me.

321
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,733
She makes me feel like I stink.

322
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,402
Because you do stink, fatty.

323
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,071
You smell even more, idiot.

324
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,532
Stinky.

325
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,243
Shut up, idiot.

326
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,178
- Comadre, welcome!
- Hi, "commy".

327
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:49,434
- That belly of yours?
- I'll tell you later.

328
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,398
- Yes, you will.
- Sure, but give me a hand.

329
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:59,444
You sure you can carry it all?

330
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,323
I'm pregnant, not sick.
Why, you tired?

331
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:07,660
- As if!
- You've got so old since last year.

332
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,955
Mountains are old,
but they're still green.

333
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:15,460
Here! You're pregnant
and forgetful?

334
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:20,340
- That's one bed.
- This goes here.

335
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,885
And there's the other.

336
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,930
This one's for Paco.

337
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,352
They were in storage.

338
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,688
They're all the dogs
that lived here.

339
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,275
Look. That there
was Pirata...

340
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:43,029
he died in 1911.

341
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:47,617
- Do you remember Canela?
- Yes, where is she?

342
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:51,371
Look at her.
She died last summer.

343
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,415
They say she ate a poisoned rat.

344
00:54:54,541 --> 00:55:00,505
But I'm sure it was the villagers
angry with Don José over the land.

345
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,050
Come on.

346
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,991
What do you think
of these city folks, Celso?

347
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,454
- Should we send for more bullets?
- There's plenty, Doctor José.

348
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,708
Paco! Don't go there!
Cleo, get him.

349
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:22,211
Paco, I'm telling you.
Stay there!

350
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,839
What? Women don't shoot?

351
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,176
No, no, no. Not that.
Leslie is our representative.

352
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,889
- Doesn't count, she's a Gringa.
- Ok, I'll go.

353
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:52,033
You look great, Lola.

354
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:04,796
Watch out Pepe! Your wife is
going to join the guerrilla!

355
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:10,760
- She's going to expropriate your hacienda!
- Nah, I'll whack her first.

356
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,489
- Come with me.
- Where?

357
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:58,409
- Just come.
- What about him?

358
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,662
Is the boogeyman coming?

359
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,253
Where are we going?

360
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,257
Don't ask.
The city's made you distrustful.

361
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,468
No, Benita.

362
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,764
- Look at the dogs.
- They're tired.

363
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,434
The kids won't leave them alone.

364
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:32,443
Be careful, don't roll down
with that belly of yours.

365
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,404
No, Benita.

366
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:51,337
- There's a lot of music.
- It's NewYears!

367
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,547
Should I call Lupe and Yola?

368
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:57,093
No, no, no.
We don't want those city nannies here.

369
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,887
They feel fancier than their bosses.
Come on.

370
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:08,187
- They allowed you out?
- Move aside.

371
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,523
Sit here.

372
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,027
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing, thank you.

373
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,906
You're not going to toast the
NewYear with us?

374
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:23,202
- It's not good for the baby.
- A little won't hurt.

375
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:28,040
Celebrate while you can!
See that man over there?

376
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,920
They killed his son in
August over the land dispute.

377
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,674
- You're carrying life, right?
- Yes.

378
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,220
- So then? Mezcal?
- No, just a little pulque.

379
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,015
That's the spirit!

380
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,312
Here.

381
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:55,776
To a beautiful 1971 and
your baby's health!

382
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,574
- Sorry, Manita...
- Go dance, Gloria!

383
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:07,079
Don't worry.
I'll pour you some more.

384
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:11,083
Here.
Clean yourself up.

385
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,753
Salud!

386
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,867
- What's wrong with you?
- I know you need it.

387
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:49,789
- Billy, no!
- I just wanted to comfort you.

388
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:56,212
- You're drunk.
- You're not even that hot, comadre.

389
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,494
Fire!

390
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,122
Fire! Fire!

391
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,791
The forest is burning!

392
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:21,547
Everybody! Quick!
Fire in the woods!

393
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:27,094
Come on! Move!
This way, everyone!

394
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:39,440
Careful!
Cover that side!

395
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:47,281
- Come here. Now!
- We need water!

396
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:51,243
Make a chain!

397
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:58,042
We need water!
Pass the buckets!

398
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,961
Kids! Stay back!

399
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,383
Kids! Don't step on the flames!

400
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:14,975
Cleo, help the little ones
get water.

401
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:19,730
Just the little fires.

402
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:25,611
That's it, Andy!
Gerardo, Cleo will help you.

403
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:35,454
Not too close to the fire!

404
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:36,867
I got one!
It ran away!

405
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,166
Got it!

406
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:03,435
- We'll reach the hill skirt and come back!
- Skirt?

407
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,897
- The hillside.
- The hill has a skirt?

408
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:11,276
- The slope then!
- Alex! The hill has a skirt!

409
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,656
If we look under we
can see its panties.

410
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,867
- What are you doing?
- Peeking at the hill's panties.

411
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,662
Hills don't have panties.

412
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:24,957
- Neither do you!
- Asshole!

413
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,168
I'm going to tell your parents!

414
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,603
This feels like my village.

415
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,899
It's drier there.
But it feels like it...

416
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,905
The animals do that too.

417
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,912
It sounds like this.

418
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,378
And smells the same.

419
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:42,576
They repaired the Galaxy.
It looks like new!

420
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,167
The Cowboys won because
Baltimore got cocky.

421
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:54,671
- We won anyway!
- Baltimore got cocky...

422
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,842
- Who likes the Cowboys?
- And Cruz Azul champions forever!

423
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,761
- Hello, Beto.
- Afternoon, Señora.

424
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,055
- Can we go to the movies?
- To see what?

425
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,265
- Marooned.
- I wanna see it too.

426
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,769
- Only Beto and me.
- Why?

427
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,063
- I wanna go too!
- No!

428
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,524
- Everyone can go!
- Not fair!

429
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,819
- I'm going.
- You're not.

430
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:19,488
- Everyone goes!
- That's not fair!

431
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:22,032
If you don't like it,
go live elsewhere!

432
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,076
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

433
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:26,245
- I'll get it upstairs.
- I'll take them.

434
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,747
No! You won't like it.

435
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,333
- I like movies.
- Not this one.

436
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,502
Eat poo!

437
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:38,465
- Is it a cartoon?
- No, it's not.

438
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:42,719
- You don't know what Marooned is.
- Yes, I do!

439
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:04,241
We're late!
Are you coming?

440
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,579
- Grandma, we need to go.
- Toño, let's go. We're leaving!

441
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:12,583
Wait! I'm coming.

442
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,769
- Catch him!
- Hurry up!

443
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:36,440
Come on, we're late!

444
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,032
What are you waiting for?

445
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,538
Don't run!

446
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,474
- Toño!
- Run!

447
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,477
- Cleo, get them!
- I'll see you at the movies!

448
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,979
Control your children!

449
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:41,982
- Check her out!
- Look at her!

450
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,235
Antonio.

451
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,405
Hey, watch out!

452
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,283
- Look, your dad!
- Run, Antonio, run!

453
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,327
- No, it wasn't my dad.
- Yes, it was your dad.

454
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,955
I said no!

455
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,878
Put the magazine away!

456
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,093
Your grandma is worried.

457
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,933
Come on, let's get the tickets.

458
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:30,041
Following our illustrious governor
instructions...

459
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:36,805
to improve the infrastructure,
I've come here today...

460
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:44,931
to respond to your
demand for water.

461
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:55,984
This can only happen by
uniting the will of the people...

462
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:04,159
with the leadership of our illustrious
President Luis Echeverría Alvarez.

463
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,211
Excuse me, do you know
where this address is?

464
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,922
- That way.
- Thank you.

465
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:15,719
We will move... above and beyond!

466
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:32,212
Ramón!

467
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,675
Hold up.
Wait.

468
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,094
- What's up, Cleo?
- Hi.

469
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,972
I just came to give
Fermín his jacket.

470
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,892
- I'll give it to him.
- But, I need to talk to him.

471
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:49,437
- He's not here.
- It's important.

472
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,482
But we're rehearsing.

473
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,361
Adela said you would help.

474
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,447
One sec.

475
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,201
Hold on to this.

476
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,204
Can you give me a ride?

477
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,414
Let's go.

478
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,500
Hold on, let me
put on some pants.

479
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:31,730
Here is where he trains.

480
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:34,065
Thank you, Ramón.

481
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:40,780
- Don't tell him I brought you.
- No. Thank you.

482
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,415
Right flank!

483
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,476
- It's Zovek.
- No! Really?

484
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,937
Yes! Look at him.

485
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:39,315
- The Professor Zovek?
- Yes!

486
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:42,110
Does he always come here?

487
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:45,321
No. But sometimes
he trains them.

488
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:07,385
Welcome!
May the energy dwell in you.

489
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,722
You.

490
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,056
You...

491
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:14,100
and you as well!

492
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,269
You can become a warrior!

493
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,355
Every human has a great potential...

494
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:22,442
that can be developed
through physical training.

495
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:30,074
Yes! But most importantly through
the evolution of the mind...

496
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,619
and the spirit.

497
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:37,624
You can develop this potential.
But don't expect a miracle!

498
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:44,130
The only miracle resides
within your own will.

499
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:52,256
Remember, the mind
is the motor for the physical.

500
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,769
And next up next...

501
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,191
an act.

502
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:12,534
This act requires total
physical and mental focus.

503
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:22,502
Only the Lamas, martial arts masters
and a few great athletes...

504
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,381
have been able to master it.

505
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,718
You.

506
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,346
Yes, you. Come here.

507
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,561
Please cover my eyes.

508
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:45,400
Make sure they are properly covered.

509
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,823
Thank you. You may return to
your place.

510
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:34,907
What? Disappointed?

511
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:39,746
What did you expect?
For me to levitate or lift a jet?

512
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,540
You are witnessing an
incredible feat!

513
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,836
If you don't believe me?
Then try it.

514
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:50,256
But with your eyes closed.

515
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,651
Hey, Lobo!

516
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,695
Hey, Fermín.

517
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:57,532
What about the new trainers?

518
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:03,371
- The Korean coach is good.
- Yes, but tough.

519
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,463
Fermín.

520
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:16,509
Do you have a minute?

521
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,055
Piss off!

522
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,227
- Hi, Cleo.
- Hi, Fermín.

523
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,730
What brings you around?

524
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:33,943
I've left you messages,
but I couldn't find you.

525
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:37,613
I'm sorry, training has been intense.

526
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,783
They even brought a gringo coach
and a Korean.

527
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,162
Well, the American was already here,
but the Korean is new.

528
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:48,583
- Is it for the Olympics?
- Something like that.

529
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:51,711
Who told you I was here?

530
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:59,010
A neighbor's brother-in-law
trains here with you.

531
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,971
- It was Ramón.
- No.

532
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:08,936
I'm gonna kick that
fat fucker's ass.

533
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:15,193
- It’s just that I'm pregnant.
- What's it to me?

534
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:19,030
- It's that... The little one's yours.
- No fucking way.

535
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:23,034
- I swear it is.
- I told you, no fucking way.

536
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,996
And if you don't want me to beat
the shit out of you and your "little one"...

537
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,083
don't ever say it again,
and don't ever come looking for me again.

538
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,548
Fucking servant!

539
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,346
Hurry up, Fermín!

540
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:09,997
He went with his mistress
to Acapulco.

541
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:15,169
He hasn't sent a dime,
and it's been six months.

542
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:19,465
He says he's short on money
and doesn't have any to send.

543
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:24,136
But now he likes diving,
and is buying all the gear.

544
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:28,975
You know how much that costs?

545
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:35,690
He sent the kids a letter
pretending he's in Quebec.

546
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:42,905
Just bullshit he invents:
That the landscape is beautiful...

547
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:49,245
That he misses them
but his research is delayed.

548
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:52,665
Lies!

549
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,546
- Ok, don't worry, I'll call you later.
- Paco, come here.

550
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:03,050
Are you spying on me?

551
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:06,637
I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry!

552
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:13,019
And you! Why did
you let him? Why?

553
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:19,108
Why are you still there?
Don't you have anything to do?

554
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,903
Get out!

555
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:26,407
Please, don't tell your siblings.

556
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:36,042
You're winning by two laps!

557
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:40,254
He's passing you, Paco!

558
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,424
But I'm still winning.

559
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:48,721
- I want to play!
- No. Move!

560
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,433
- Move, Pepe.
- No.

561
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,019
- Move!
- No.

562
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,605
I said move!

563
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,983
- That's mine, Paco!
- No, it's mine.

564
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:42,900
Cleo!

565
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,362
- They're fighting.
- I'm coming.

566
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:55,913
Paco, Toño, stop!
You're going to get hurt!

567
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:58,582
You're not animals!

568
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,628
Let him go!

569
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,340
Paco, drop that!

570
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,135
What are you doing!
Drop that!

571
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:14,015
Don't be an idiot!

572
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:18,728
Are you stupid?
You could've killed him!

573
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:22,314
It's very dangerous.

574
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,906
[ Hey manita. ]

575
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:34,910
[ I heard the government
came to the village... ]

576
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:38,748
[ ...to seize land, and they've
taken your mom's. ]

577
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:43,961
- [ How can I help her? ]
- [ You could go see her. ]

578
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:49,925
- [ Like this? ]
- [ Don't worry. ]

579
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:58,642
[ Go rest, I'll open the gate. ]

580
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,353
We are alone.

581
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:30,651
No matter what they tell you,
we women are always alone.

582
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,826
We'll have to park here.
The students are protesting.

583
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:24,580
Oh, God. I hope they don't
beat them again.

584
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:26,498
Look. Someone's leaving.

585
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:46,352
Go ahead.

586
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,209
Good afternoon, Señora.

587
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:57,089
My maid needs a crib.
Can you show them to us?

588
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:02,094
- She'll show them to you.
- Thank you.

589
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:05,347
This way, please.

590
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,190
How about this one?

591
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:19,445
- Do you like it, Cleo?
- It's very pretty.

592
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,780
How much is it?

593
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,868
No, but with a
long-standing client discount.

594
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,787
Let me ask the manager.

595
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:32,458
We bought the furniture for
the boys' room here.

596
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,710
Which is now in
Sofi and Pepe's room.

597
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,670
- The blue set?
- Yes.

598
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:13,290
Please help me!
They're killing us!

599
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,424
Where is he?

600
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,221
Get in!
Leave him alone!

601
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:29,181
Move!

602
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,975
- Shut up!
- Come here!

603
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:35,896
I said shut up!

604
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:40,025
Fermín!
Let's go!

605
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:48,325
Let's go! Now!

606
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,954
Help me!

607
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,795
Help!

608
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:07,428
Be calm, Cleo.
Ignacio!

609
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:34,329
Help me!

610
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:38,917
Jorge, please, let's go!

611
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:43,922
Why?

612
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:46,133
Help!

613
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,595
Help me!

614
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:27,382
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee...

615
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,737
Dr. Vélez!

616
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,865
- Dr. Vélez!
- Get in line!

617
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,785
- You have an appointment?
- Her water broke.

618
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:41,748
- Find Dr. Vélez.
- Here she comes.

619
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:44,668
Doctor, your patient is here.

620
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:48,088
Orderly, please.
Sofía just called me.

621
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:52,175
Hello, ma'am.
Cleo, you're having contractions.

622
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:57,014
Let's get her to delivery.
You'll have to fill out some forms.

623
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,975
Paty, take their information.
We're going to delivery.

624
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,729
Yes, doctor.
Please, come this way.

625
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:08,066
- What's her full name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

626
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,361
- Her middle name?
- I don't know.

627
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:14,448
- How old is she?
- I don't know.

628
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:17,492
Her date of birth?

629
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:21,121
- What's your relationship with the patient?
- I'm her employer.

630
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:24,291
Is there any family member here?

631
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:27,085
- No. No.
- That's fine.

632
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:30,339
One last question.
Is your patient insured?

633
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:40,140
Good evening.

634
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:45,145
Careful.
Let's go.

635
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:50,442
One moment, please.

636
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:52,110
Excuse me.

637
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,862
Doctor.

638
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:58,200
Hello, Cleo. How are you feeling?
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

639
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:01,203
Isn't it, Dr. Vélez?
How many babies have you delivered?

640
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:04,247
Hundreds, doctor.

641
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:09,795
Give me your hand.
And breathe.

642
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,548
- We must hurry.
- Yes, doctor.

643
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:20,764
Excuse me.
Over here.

644
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,392
This way.

645
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:27,187
Dr. Vélez won't let me go in.
You'll do great, Cleo.

646
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:30,273
Feel free to come if you like.

647
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,444
- I can't. I have an appointment.
- Come on, let's go.

648
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:40,575
I'm taking a patient to delivery.
Ask admissions for her file.

649
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,163
Please assist me.

650
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:49,000
Pass me the partogram.
Let's examine her.

651
01:40:49,419 --> 01:40:51,294
Yes, doctor.

652
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:55,424
She's in labor.
Her water broke.

653
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,844
Cleo, when was your last period?

654
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,012
September.

655
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:04,850
I'm removing your underwear
and shoes.

656
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,269
We're moving you into position.

657
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:12,399
- I'm going to listen to your baby.
- When did your water break?

658
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:17,529
- Around two hours ago?
- We couldn't get here quicker.

659
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:22,033
- Don't worry. Breathe.
- I'm uncovering your belly.

660
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:25,787
Easy, Cleo.
Breathe deep.

661
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:30,417
- How is the heart rate?
- I can't hear anything, doctor.

662
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:33,295
- A glove, please.
- Glove, doctor.

663
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:36,965
I need you to breathe deeply.

664
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:41,219
I'm going to inspect you.
It'll bother a bit.

665
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:44,681
- Relax. Easy, please.
- It's going to hurt a little.

666
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:48,769
- How is it?
- Complete. Direct. Third plane.

667
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:53,231
- Meconium liquid, doctor.
- We need to canalize.

668
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:57,360
- Moving patient to surgery.
- Let me listen to your baby.

669
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:59,863
Easy.

670
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:02,699
- I'm not hearing anything, doctor.
- Let's move.

671
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:05,494
Get the stretcher.

672
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:08,872
Cleo, breathe deeply.
We're taking you to surgery.

673
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:11,666
Ok. One, two, three.

674
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:14,544
- Let's go!
- Easy.

675
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:20,675
Patient coming through.
Call pediatrics!

676
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:56,920
- Call pediatrics.
- No scrubs. It's an emergency.

677
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,381
Turning on lamp.

678
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:06,513
Everyone ready?
One, two, three.

679
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,559
Pediatrics to surgery!

680
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:15,856
Move your waist
further down, please.

681
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:22,320
Doctor, she's crowning.
No time for your scrubs.

682
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:26,533
- Pediatrician to the room!
- He's in the room, doctor.

683
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:31,496
- Doctor, she's crowning.
- I'm checking.

684
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:35,542
Where is the pediatrician?

685
01:43:35,668 --> 01:43:38,044
I'm here, doctor.

686
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:43,925
Patient ready to deliver.
The head is out.

687
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:49,014
Edwin, please.
Cut the cord.

688
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:52,851
- Tongs.
- Cut the cord, please.

689
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:55,270
Cutting.

690
01:43:55,855 --> 01:44:00,775
- We couldn't hear a heart rate, doctor.
- Bulb.

691
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:02,736
Your stethoscope.

692
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:05,947
We're going to give you
a few stitches.

693
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,659
- I can't hear a heartbeat.
- Listening.

694
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:13,705
It's in arrest. Begin resuscitation.

695
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:16,166
Your placenta is coming out.

696
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:19,544
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

697
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,129
Listening.

698
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:24,466
Your placenta is coming out.

699
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:28,678
Ma'am, I can't hear a heartbeat.

700
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,513
Placenta coming out.

701
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,143
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

702
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:40,065
Listening.
No response.

703
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:43,068
- Another cycle, doctor?
- Let's continue.

704
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:47,614
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

705
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,284
- Here it is, doctor.
- Listening.

706
01:44:51,452 --> 01:44:57,040
No response.
We're suspending CPR.

707
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:09,636
- Doctor, what's the patient's name?
- Cleo, doctor.

708
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:12,430
Cutting...

709
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:19,396
Cleo, I'm very sorry.
Your baby was born dead.

710
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:23,984
We did all we could, but
there was no response.

711
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,152
Would you like to hold it?

712
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:36,371
Here is your baby.
It's a girl.

713
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:46,172
Say goodbye to her.

714
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:53,471
I need to take her now, Cleo.
Say goodbye to her.

715
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:03,565
Let me have her, please.
I need to prepare her.

716
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:12,907
Allow me...

717
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:16,619
- Prepare her, please.
- Yes, doctor.

718
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,747
Gutiérrez, Cleodegaria.

719
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:22,083
Here's the file, doctor.

720
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:35,805
There's a bit of bleeding.
We gave you a few stitches.

721
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:40,351
We're very sorry, Cleo.

722
01:48:28,085 --> 01:48:33,840
Cleo! The knife sharpener!
[ Shake yourself off. ]

723
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:13,231
- Toño! Sofi! Come!
- Mom bought a new car!

724
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:16,734
- You like it?
- How fast does it go?

725
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,528
Why not a Maverick?

726
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:21,864
Too expensive.
I wanted a smaller car.

727
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:25,827
- I've had it with that Galaxy.
- I like it, Mommy.

728
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:30,081
- What about the Galaxy?
- I sold it.

729
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,292
- It goes next week.
- Does Dad know?

730
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:35,378
No, it's a surprise.

731
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:38,589
- Do you like the new car, Cleo?
- Yes.

732
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:40,133
And speaking of surprises.

733
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:43,636
We're taking the Galaxy
for a goodbye trip.

734
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,263
- Where to?
- Tuxpan.

735
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:46,431
Where's that?

736
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:48,308
- I've got a match.
- Skip it.

737
01:50:48,434 --> 01:50:49,851
Tuxpan is near Veracruz.

738
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:51,394
- Is there a beach?
- Yes.

739
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,521
The beaches in Veracruz are ugly.

740
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:56,024
And we're going to invite
Cleo along, right?

741
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:57,483
Yes!

742
01:50:57,609 --> 01:50:59,402
Will you come?

743
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:01,362
Come on. It'll do you good.

744
01:51:01,447 --> 01:51:03,072
- Right, Adela?
- Yes, ma'am.

745
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:06,200
Besides, the kids will miss you
if you don't come.

746
01:51:06,327 --> 01:51:09,620
But she'll be on vacation,
you can't make her work.

747
01:51:09,747 --> 01:51:14,500
- Will you come?
- [ Go Manita. I'll take care of the house. ]

748
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:18,004
So, you're coming?

749
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,298
Perfect!
Would you help me pack?

750
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:22,383
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go pack.

751
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:25,094
[ Go. It'll lift your spirits. ]

752
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:30,183
- I'm gonna help her pack.
- Pepe, bring the guns.

753
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:03,424
Stop changing it.

754
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:09,514
- La Pantera doesn't reach this far.
- I just heard it.

755
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,557
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

756
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:14,268
No, it's not! It's only in the city.

757
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,230
Look! The sea!

758
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:18,856
Mom, stop, stop!

759
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:23,694
- Let's go to the hotel first.
- No. It'll be dark by then.

760
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,406
Beach! Beach!

761
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:34,330
Alright.
But just for a little bit!

762
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:35,790
Yeah!

763
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:53,266
Let's go.

764
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:14,912
- Come.
- No, I don't know how to swim.

765
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:16,831
Come on.

766
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:20,668
You go.
I'll watch you from here.

767
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:43,232
- Which way?
- Follow me.

768
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,527
- Can we go back again?
- Yes, of course.

769
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:50,281
- But now a hot bath.
- Yes.

770
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:54,452
I want to go back.

771
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:56,287
It was amazing!

772
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,165
I jumped over a huge wave!

773
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:15,056
Ow! Mom. Ow! Don't!

774
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:26,400
- Ow! It burns!
- I'm almost done.

775
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:31,030
Did you like the waves?

776
01:54:31,156 --> 01:54:34,325
I did.

777
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:39,247
Do you know how to dive
under them?

778
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:43,376
Have you gone mute?

779
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:45,628
No. Let's go.

780
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:49,215
- I told you to put on a t-shirt!
- But it was cloudy!

781
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:52,468
The glare burns the most.

782
01:54:54,763 --> 01:54:57,098
Dressed already?

783
01:54:57,224 --> 01:55:00,184
Yes, but Cleo's gone mute.

784
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,603
- Thank you, Cleo.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

785
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:06,190
You two smell like salad.

786
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,425
Children...!

787
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:36,012
Kids! Listen!

788
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:38,389
I have something to tell you.

789
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:43,561
Your dad isn't in Ottawa.

790
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:49,066
- Is he back?
- No. Your dad never went away.

791
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:53,654
Well he did, but only for a week.

792
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:58,326
Your dad isn't coming back home.

793
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:02,663
We came here so he
can take his things.

794
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:08,461
- What things?
- What he says are his things.

795
01:56:08,587 --> 01:56:12,214
His clothes... his books...
the bookcases...

796
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,968
Are you getting a divorce?

797
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:21,098
- He doesn't know.
- He doesn't love us anymore?

798
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:24,810
Of course he loves you, a lot.

799
01:56:25,646 --> 01:56:28,981
- He says he wants to see you.
- When?

800
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:34,528
He doesn't know.
But soon.

801
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:38,949
There's going to be changes.
But we'll be together!

802
01:56:39,076 --> 01:56:41,452
And it's going to be an adventure!

803
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,580
I'm starting a full-time job
at a publishing house.

804
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:47,541
But you're a biochemist.

805
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:50,878
I know, but your dad
hasn't sent us any money.

806
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:53,506
And teaching isn't enough.

807
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:58,052
And I love books!
And I never really liked biochemistry.

808
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:01,097
It'll be another adventure.

809
01:57:01,223 --> 01:57:04,809
And we must stay together,
really close.

810
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,436
- Right, Cleo?
- Yes.

811
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:11,107
Very, very close...

812
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:14,235
Darling?

813
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:19,490
Are you finished?

814
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,034
For dessert, we have ice cream...

815
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,453
coconut, strawberry...

816
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:26,330
vanilla, banana...

817
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,208
and flan.

818
01:57:40,429 --> 01:57:43,097
Ready for the picture.

819
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:50,956
- Are you coming in?
- No, I have to go check the tires.

820
01:58:51,082 --> 01:58:53,793
We're leaving early tomorrow.
Want to come?

821
01:58:53,919 --> 01:58:56,504
- No, it's our last day.
- I want to stay too.

822
01:58:56,630 --> 01:59:00,132
Ok, but no swimming.
Cleo can't swim.

823
01:59:00,258 --> 01:59:03,886
- But it's really calm.
- If you want to stay, that's the rule.

824
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:06,972
- Near the shore?
- Ok. But only near the shore.

825
01:59:07,098 --> 01:59:09,141
- Yes!
- Can I swim too, Mom?

826
01:59:09,267 --> 01:59:11,852
- Yes, but only near the shore.
- Yeah!

827
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:15,356
Can you watch over them?
I won't be long.

828
01:59:17,442 --> 01:59:20,361
Stay close to the shore!

829
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:35,125
Paco! You heard your mom.
Otherwise, you're getting out.

830
01:59:39,965 --> 01:59:44,260
Sofi! Paco! Closer to the shore!

831
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:04,071
When I was older,
I used to be a sailor.

832
02:00:04,197 --> 02:00:09,201
But I drowned in a storm.

833
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:13,956
The waves were huge!

834
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:20,004
- Sofi! Paco! Near the shore!
- It was dark...

835
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:25,050
and there was lightning,
and I didn't know how to swim.

836
02:00:25,176 --> 02:00:29,013
Wait here.

837
02:00:29,598 --> 02:00:33,183
Paco! Come closer!

838
02:00:36,771 --> 02:00:38,981
Sofi!

839
02:00:41,318 --> 02:00:45,237
Paco, help your sister!

840
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:55,159
What happened?
Are you ok, my love?

841
02:02:55,285 --> 02:02:59,913
- Cleo saved us.
- Thank you... Thank you.

842
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:03,375
Are you ok?

843
02:03:04,335 --> 02:03:09,339
- I didn't want her.
- What?

844
02:03:09,466 --> 02:03:14,428
- I didn't want her.
- They're ok.

845
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:22,061
I didn't want her to be born.

846
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:29,735
- We love you so much, Cleo. Right?
- Poor little thing.

847
02:03:32,614 --> 02:03:37,868
We love you so, so much.

848
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:45,686
- I love you, Cleo.
- I love you too, darling.

849
02:05:38,114 --> 02:05:43,660
Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, come help.
Don't play dumb.

850
02:05:45,914 --> 02:05:48,999
Hi, Borras.

851
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:56,006
- Hi, Adela.
- Hi.

852
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:59,885
- Hi, Adela.
- Hello, kids.

853
02:06:00,011 --> 02:06:02,596
- Hi, Adela.
- Welcome, ma'am.

854
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:06,016
- Can I leave this with you?
- Yes, ma'am.

855
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:12,064
It looks awful.

856
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:15,734
Without the bookshelves,
it's awful.

857
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:19,780
- I like it like this.
- It's awful.

858
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:24,034
- What's awful, Mommy?
- He misses the bookshelves.

859
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,079
- Which bookshelves?
- The ones that were there.

860
02:06:27,205 --> 02:06:32,793
- [ I'm going to make dinner. ]
- [ I have so much to tell you. ]

861
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:38,340
- They've switched the rooms!
- Where's mine?

862
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:41,718
- Why change them?
- It's better this way.

863
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:44,888
- I liked the old way better.
- Go check yours.

864
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:49,559
- How did it go?
- Sofi and Paco almost drowned.

865
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:53,230
Hi, Cleo.
Mrs. Sofi's room is there.

866
02:06:53,356 --> 02:06:56,900
- It's bigger.
- More comfy.

867
02:06:57,026 --> 02:07:01,280
- Cleo, check out my room!
- In a bit, ok?

868
02:07:01,406 --> 02:07:05,075
I love it, Mom!

869
02:07:05,201 --> 02:07:12,165
And we'll have more adventures!
We'll travel a lot.

870
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:15,544
We'll go to Disneyland!

871
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:19,923
We can't afford Disney,
but we can go to Oaxaca.

872
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:24,136
- Yes, and visit Cleo's village!
- Great idea!

873
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:28,473
Sure, whenever you like.
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

874
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:32,352
- Tell me, you almost drowned?
- Yes, the current pulled us.

875
02:07:32,478 --> 02:07:36,356
- The waves were 15 meters tall.
- No, they were only two meters.

876
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:40,736
- No, they were taller!
- And Cleo saved us, right, Cleo?

877
02:07:40,862 --> 02:07:43,405
- Cleo, can I have a smoothie?
- Yes.

878
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:45,782
- Me too.
- Are there any Twinkies?

879
02:07:45,908 --> 02:07:48,994
- Let me check.
- Yes, I got a box.

880
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,885
[ Wait, ]
where are you going?

881
02:08:05,011 --> 02:08:08,472
- [ To buy ham. ]
- [ But I have so much to tell you. ]

882
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:11,558
- [ Did you have a good time? ]
- [ Yes, it was very nice. ]

883
02:08:11,642 --> 02:08:14,269
[ I want to hear everything,
I'll be right back. ]

884
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:17,689
[ But just get the ham.
No flirting. ]

885
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:56,728
For Libo.
