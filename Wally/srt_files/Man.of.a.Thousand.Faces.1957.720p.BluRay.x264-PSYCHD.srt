1
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,342
- Good morning, Mr Thalberg.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,720
- Good morning, Irving.
- Hello.

3
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,848
- Hello. George.
- Right this way, Irving.

4
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,921
The actor is a very special human being.

5
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:23,391
There are only a few
who possess his peculiar magic,

6
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,387
that extraordinary ability
to make us feel,

7
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,605
to lift us out
of our own existence

8
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,022
and make us believe
in the world of make-believe.

9
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,896
I am speaking
of the great ones now,

10
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,819
those that audiences
have selected and set apart.

11
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:44,162
Some no longer here to enchant you,
but, well, will always be remembered.

12
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:50,578
We cannot replace these personalities.
There can only be one of each,

13
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,626
born out of their own
personal joys and sorrows.

14
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,341
Life shapes them
in wondrous ways.

15
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,463
Often beautiful, sometimes with flaws,
but all quite rare.

16
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,091
Such a one was Lon Chaney.

17
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:10,063
With his God-given talent, he did more
than just portray a thousand faces.

18
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,434
He illuminated certain dark corners
of the human spirit.

19
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,562
He showed the world
the souls of those people

20
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,362
who are born different
from the rest.

21
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,736
To understand why he was destined for this,
we would only have to go back

22
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,081
to any day in his boyhood,
in the town of Colorado Springs.

23
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,496
'Not a very easy boyhood,

24
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,621
'for his parents were different.'

25
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,543
Lon! You've been fighting again.

26
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,759
Ma and Pa don't care if kids
make fun of them, why should you?

27
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,048
Go play with your dolls!

28
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,653
What happened?

29
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,198
It's always the same, isn't it?

30
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,162
I better go help.

31
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:33,681
Don't be angry. Feel sorry for those
who do not understand like you.

32
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,807
They're no good!

33
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,355
Go wash.

34
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,510
Lon! Hey, Chaney!
Stone wants you!

35
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,846
Tell him I'll be there
in a second.

36
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,440
- What's up?
- Ask the boss!

37
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,187
Listen to them,
they're stamping holes in the floor.

38
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,544
- Where's Cleva?
- Dressing. One song.

39
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,506
One song while we get set up
for the acrobats, and she's never ready.

40
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,487
I paid a lot of money for this curtain.
I pay your wife to stand in front of it.

41
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,503
All right, you made your point.

42
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,259
She holds us up again,
she's through!

43
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,230
- Cleva, sweetheart.
- I know, I know. I'm late again.

44
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,519
Take it easy, now. Easy.

45
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,894
All right, hurry up!

46
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,512
Now, it's all right, sweet.
We'll fix it.

47
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,155
- It's ruined. Never mind. Never mind.
- We'll fix it. We'll fix it.

48
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,872
That does it. She's out!

49
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,086
What are you doing?

50
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,869
You want somebody in front
of that very expensive curtain, don't you?

51
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,010
You've already been on.

52
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,822
That's more like it.
That stays in.

53
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,327
You like the bit? Well, here.
It's yours, you can have it.

54
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,462
Hey, Lon!

55
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,581
Lon, we can talk this over.

56
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,051
I'm sorry, sorry.
You fired her, you fired me.

57
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,095
That piker!

58
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,434
Paying us off in potato peelings
and wanted us to take a ten-dollar cut.

59
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,654
Well, I wish you could have heard me.
I told him.

60
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,195
- Lon, you didn't quit?
- We both quit.

61
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,740
We're gonna get off this wreck
before it goes down with all hands. Phew!

62
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,828
It's because of me, isn't it?

63
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,538
Uh-uh-uh.

64
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,831
Don't let those get on the floor.
Be over our heads in no time.

65
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,959
Lon, what are we going to do?

66
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,674
There are other shows, and maybe
we can land in a dressing room

67
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,715
where we won't have
to wear hip boots. Phew!

68
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,678
Maybe San Francisco.

69
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,260
Why San Francisco?

70
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,475
The offer you got
from Kolb and Dill.

71
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,347
I found the telegram
in your suit.

72
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,600
They didn't want me, either, did they?
That's why you turned it down.

73
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,778
We can have Kolb and Dill anytime.
We can do better, leave it to me.

74
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,649
Take it, Lon.
Wire them tonight.

75
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,862
You want me to? Hmm?
You sure?

76
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,991
In a few months I won't have
much of a specialty anyway,

77
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,416
unless they'd like
to watch me folding diapers.

78
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,463
Oh, sweetheart.

79
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,254
Sweetheart.

80
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,178
This is wonderful! Wonderful!

81
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,677
Your feet dry?

82
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,390
Wait till the folks
hear about this.

83
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,942
What a Christmas present.

84
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,405
I'll wire them tonight.

85
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,024
- Why not tell them, instead?
- Tell them?

86
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,117
I wanna meet your family, Lon.

87
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,490
Well, but...

88
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,225
Yeah, but we haven't got time.
We gotta get to the coast.

89
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,831
We've got a whole week.

90
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,667
They didn't want you
till after the first of the year.

91
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,254
And I want to make
this Christmas special,

92
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,716
in a home,
instead of a hotel room.

93
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,196
Yeah, sure, I know,
but you see, sweetheart...

94
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,803
Lon, is it me?

95
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,133
Are you ashamed
to take me home?

96
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,601
Now, what kind of talk is that?

97
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,220
Well, then, please.

98
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,520
You're supposed to humor
an expectant mother, you know?

99
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,272
Yeah.

100
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,606
Well, if that's what you want...

101
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,743
...home we go.

102
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,084
Lon, I'm scared.

103
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,758
They're gonna love you very much.
Just remember that.

104
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,053
- Hey!
- Welcome to Colorado Springs!

105
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,597
- Oh! Cleva, my brother, John.
- Hello.

106
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,312
Say, you're the prettiest Christmas present
anybody ever brought home.

107
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,932
- I said that at the train.
- How'd you get so lucky?

108
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,151
She found me
on her door step.

109
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,110
Good to see you.
Let me help you.

110
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,980
No, I'll get them.

111
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,863
Lon. Oh, Lon.

112
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,489
Well, how's my favorite sister?

113
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,117
Your only sister's just fine.

114
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,745
Well, here she is, Carrie.

115
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,042
Lon didn't exaggerate
in his letters.

116
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,336
- She's lovely.
- Mm-hmm.

117
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,094
Hey, look here, now.
Look here. Hmm?

119
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,062
I was in a show once
called "Ring In The Dawn".

120
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,342
Folded in three nights.
They paid me off with the bell.

121
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,306
- Folks around?
- Out on a shopping spree.

122
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,684
They wanted to get
something special for Cleva.

123
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,278
- Oh, they shouldn't have done that.
- No way to stop them.

124
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,989
After all, they don't meet
a new daughter-in-law every day.

125
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,531
Here, let me take your things.
Lon, you've got your old room back.

126
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,904
George and I are doubling up.
Just like old times.

127
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,953
Yeah, he snores worse than ever.
What a Christmas this is gonna be.

128
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,917
- For you.
- Hey!

129
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,877
- Got it?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,211
Oh! Here.

131
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,211
I'm not the only hoofer
in the family.

132
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,383
The folks won this
in a waltz contest.

133
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,926
It's beautiful.

134
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,391
It was the proudest night
in our lives.

135
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,012
- How are they?
- No different, Lon. Great, you know.

136
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,189
- Is Christmas always like this?
- Like what? To the right.

137
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,565
You know, so much fuss, so warm.

138
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,113
Always that way
with the Chaneys.

139
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,237
Not with the Creightons.
Ma hired out.

140
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,705
Holidays, she'd work her hardest.

141
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,165
I used to wait up for her,

142
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,706
and we'd pretend
there was a tree in the corner

143
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,671
with a lot of presents
wrapped in red ribbons.

144
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,844
Sweetheart, from here in,
it's all gonna be red ribbons.

145
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,635
Tell me, you ever done any lake fishing
through a hole in the ice?

146
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,508
Never fished in my life.

147
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,477
Never fished in your life?
Well, it's about time you got started.

148
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,770
You can't be admitted to the Chaney clan
until you've caught your first mountain trout.

149
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,733
Well, anyway, I can try.

150
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,439
- What is it?
- Folks are coming.

151
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,066
- I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

152
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,954
- Cleva...
- Hmm?

153
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,319
Cleva, my mother and father.

154
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,485
How do you do?

155
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,657
Dinner's ready.

156
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,090
Cleva.

157
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,800
- Lon, they're deaf...
- Cleva! Please.

158
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,089
Don't let them see that look.
Please.

159
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,617
Grace.

160
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,005
Dear God, bless this food
and this house.

161
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,894
And thank you for the gift
of your son and my sons.

162
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,025
And for my daughters.

163
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,781
- Amen.
- Amen.

164
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,324
Pa says it's for
the wandering son to slice the bird.

165
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,947
All right. Well, let's see, now.
No prompting.

166
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,416
Now, Mom, white meat.
Dad, dark, and heavy on the gravy.

167
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,536
John and Carrie,
drumsticks or wings,

168
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,273
and George,
because you're the baby of the family...

169
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,755
...last part over the fence.

170
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,216
What's wrong?

171
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,148
Cleva.

172
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,945
Why didn't you tell me, Lon?

173
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,916
I wanted to, sweetheart.

174
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,885
I tried, but... I was scared.

175
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,136
I tried, but... I couldn't.

176
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,778
All right, all right, I'll tell you.

177
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,319
I couldn't, because I thought
it would be the end of us.

178
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,864
Because I was afraid
to lose you.

179
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:45,990
Oh, I thought if you saw them,
just another family, like any other...

180
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,247
Was it that hard
to look at them, Cleva?

181
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,873
I couldn't stand it.

182
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,420
Why? Because they're different?

183
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,572
Because they can't speak?
Does that make them freaks?

184
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,032
- Don't shout, Lon!
- They can't hear me!

185
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,638
What did you expect of me?

186
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,849
That I was going to accept things
all in a minute?

187
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,976
You grew up with them.

188
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,262
- They've talked to me all my life.
- With their hands!

189
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,073
Yes, I can hear them.
I've always heard them.

190
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,768
Then ask them about my baby.

191
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,484
Ask them what my baby's going to be like.
Will it be like them?

192
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,026
It's in your blood, Lon.
It can happen again!

193
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,525
I don't want to have it!
I don't want to have it!

194
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,654
I don't want to be mother
to a dumb thing!

195
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:19,300
You don't understand.
It's your responsibility to tell your wife.

196
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:24,263
Are you afraid? Or ashamed?
You must ask your wife to forgive you.

197
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,882
Words are not important.

198
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,188
Now!

199
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,577
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It was all my fault.

200
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,037
Mom is right,
I should have told you.

201
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,371
Cleva, please try to understand.

202
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,167
This didn't start just tonight.

203
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,917
All my life, I've had it.
All my life, it's been the same.

204
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,261
Kids tagging after my father and mother,
making signs,

205
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,802
yelling, "Hey, dummy!
Hey, dummy!"

206
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,517
So proud they could speak,
they had to be cruel.

207
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,388
Until I was eight,
I never talked in the street,

208
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,607
just to make them think I couldn't,
and when they yelled at me,

209
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,817
I paid them back
for my father and mother,

210
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,358
and I grew up
paying them back.

211
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,447
Cleva, can you ever forgive me?

212
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,284
It doesn't matter.

213
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,624
Sweetheart, our baby's gonna be all right.
You'll see.

214
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,336
Why, we've got a house full of voices here.
John, Carrie and George.

215
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,707
It didn't happen to any of us,
and it won't happen to our kid, either.

216
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,334
Believe me.

217
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,715
Cleva, sweetheart...

218
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,468
...I want that baby.

219
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,932
I don't.

220
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,062
But I'll have it.

221
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,625
Thanks.

222
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,767
- Good.
- Fair.

223
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,186
- Magician?
- Press agent.

224
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,399
I'm Lon Chaney.

225
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,814
Oh, yes, yes.
We've been waiting for you.

226
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,813
I'm Clarence Locan.

227
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,108
I'll see that your name
is spelled right in the papers.

228
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,576
Mr Dill, Chaney's here.

229
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,866
OK, girls, on your feet,
on your feet!

230
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,832
And look like swans,
not ducks!

231
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,291
Take it again from the top.

232
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,581
OK, girls. With long necks.

233
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,508
Glad you got here, Chaney,
but just for the records,

234
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,951
with Kolb and Dill, rehearsals
are just like a performance.

235
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,056
They start on time.

236
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,538
I'm sorry, Mr Dill, but I was
getting settled in a new house.

237
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,522
Needed a special kind of place
out in the country,

238
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,895
far away from everything.
You see, I'm having a baby.

239
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,769
OK, I love children
as much as the next man,

240
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,896
but don't let it happen again.

241
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,567
- Rehearsals, I mean.
- I won't.

242
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,033
- Starting a baby album?
- No, press book. Saves a lot of talk.

243
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,283
- Hmm. Your sketches?
- Yes.

244
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,831
Do a little scenery too,
if it's needed.

245
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,545
Not bad.

246
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,209
I hear you do
a pretty good dumb act.

247
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,253
I've been doing that
since I was a kid.

248
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,172
- Where'd you learn it?
- Parents.

249
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,137
- Show business?
- Mm-hmm. Deaf.

250
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,889
Mutes?

251
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,269
Well, don't let it bother you, Mr Dill.
It doesn't bother them.

252
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,556
Well, shall we go to work?

253
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,436
Er... come on, Lon, I'll show you
to the dressing room.

254
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,104
Do you want me to turn it off?

255
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,654
No, no, it's all right.

256
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,528
Just tell me, if you do.

257
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,076
Cleva, if you like to hear it,
it's fine.

258
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,168
But I don't like to hear it, Lon,
that's the point.

259
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,506
I don't really wanna hear it.
I'd rather talk!

260
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:56,799
About what you're doing at the theater,
the weather, anything.

261
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,846
Month after month,
it's "hello" and "good night,"

262
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,515
and nothing in between.

263
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,890
Cleva, we keep trying
to talk to each other.

264
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,359
If I tell you we had
a good matinee,

265
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,479
you ask about the kids
in the audience,

266
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,358
how they liked it,
how much noise they made.

267
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,277
We always get back
to the same thing.

268
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,404
- Now it's my fault!
- I didn't say that.

269
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,531
It's what you meant.

270
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,044
It's this place.
It's like being buried.

271
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,165
No one around,
nobody to talk to.

272
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,384
Why couldn't we have stayed in the city
like everybody else in the show,

273
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,112
where there's some life,
some excitement?

274
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:44,677
Or would that have been too normal?
Is that it, Lon?

275
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,850
Are you trying to get me used
to the silence?

276
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,605
Cleva, the doctor says
there's every reason to expect

277
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,898
that everything
is going to be fine.

278
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,647
There's nothing...
nothing to be afraid of.

279
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,942
Maybe you can be strong about it.

280
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,321
I can't. I'm scared.

281
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,874
So scared I could scream.

282
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,773
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

283
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,205
Go back to sleep, Cleva.

284
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,784
Lon, I did hear him cry?

285
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,958
- I wasn't asleep?
- No, you heard him.

286
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,082
Mrs Chaney, when a baby
is picked up by the heels

287
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,380
and slapped on the rump,
he's bound to resent it.

288
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,633
Then he's all right.

289
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,809
What is it?

290
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,271
Cleva, the baby cried,
but there's...

291
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,483
It's a little too soon to know
for certain if he can hear.

292
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,604
The fact that he cried
is no indication.

293
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,732
When we know definitely
that he reacts to sound,

294
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,325
we can be sure
that he'll learn to speak.

295
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,161
We won't know
for a couple of weeks.

296
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,622
He's a fine boy, Mrs Chaney.

297
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,994
Would you like to see him?
I'll have the nurse bring him in.

298
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,684
- Mr Chaney?
- That's right.

299
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,451
If there's an answer,
I can take it with me.

300
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,740
What is it, Lon?

301
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,250
From the folks.
They're worried.

302
00:29:56,378 --> 00:30:00,122
They haven't heard from us
since the night the baby was born.

303
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,670
What are you going to tell them?

304
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,880
No answer.

305
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,182
He's still sleeping.

306
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,153
The doorbell woke me,
but he didn't hear it.

307
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,021
God, I have never
asked for anything before,

308
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,936
but this I want more
than anything in my life.

309
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,763
Do you have to pray like that?

310
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,721
Do you have to keep me out of it?

311
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,975
I wouldn't know how to mean it
any other way.

312
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:10,822
Please, let my baby
hear and talk.

313
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,365
Please, God, please. Amen.

314
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,779
Lon! Lon, he heard you!

315
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,576
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my son.

316
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,117
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

317
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,492
That's the last time
anybody will ever scare you.

318
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,459
No, no, no.

319
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,350
Wait, please.

320
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,645
Oh, hello, Mrs Chaney,
and the big fella.

321
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,443
Well, it's about time
youse coming to see us again.

322
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,816
Growing like a weed, ain't he?

323
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,554
Scotty, would you take Creighton
to his father

324
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,347
and tell him I'll see them both
at home tonight?

325
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,141
Well, now, there's a couple of minutes
before he goes on.

326
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,934
- Why don't you...
- No, no, I'm late already.

327
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,541
Just tell him, please. Thanks.

328
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,831
Well, come on, Creighton.

329
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,047
Hi! What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

330
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,838
- Nope.
- Oh, just quiet like your daddy, huh?

331
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,177
- Can't you even say hello?
- Hi.

332
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,796
Oh, that's much better.

333
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,701
Now no flirting
with the dancing girls, sonny.

334
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,308
Come on,
let's go find your daddy, OK?

335
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,605
Well, look who's here!

336
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,100
Hi, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

337
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,693
Girls, come on, now.
Come on.

338
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,945
Mr Chaney, you have company.

339
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,866
Daddy! Daddy!

340
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,366
Oh, my boy, my boy.
My boy!

341
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,662
Uncle Clarence,
did you bring me a present?

342
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,541
Well, you came to see us, you remember?
This kid's gonna get along swell!

343
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,779
- Where's your mother?
- Mrs Chaney had an appointment.

344
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,465
She said she'd see you
at home tonight.

345
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,265
I'll take care of him while you're on.
He's my new fellow.

346
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,516
- Thanks, Miss Bennett.
- That's all right.

347
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,936
Creighton, come here.

348
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,672
Here we go.

349
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,189
Daddy, show me a story.

350
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,152
Now, way too late
and you're much too sleepy.

351
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,114
Please, just one, Daddy.

352
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,911
The one you said was Grandma's favorite,
"Old Lady Murgatroyd".

353
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,779
- "Old Lady Murgatroyd"?
- Yeah.

354
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,749
I'll tell you what.
Now we'll have a race.

355
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,291
You get into these, and get tucked in
by the time I'm ready, huh?

356
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,164
- OK.
- It's a race.

357
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,644
Come on, now.

358
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,855
Faster than that! You hear?

359
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,537
And now, young man,
young man, you go to sleep.

360
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,662
And go to sleep right now, you hear me?
Go to sleep right now.

361
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,987
Well, say it.

362
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,460
All right, I'm working.
I took a job.

363
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,414
I'm singing at Lait's.

364
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,834
What about Creighton?

365
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,172
I found a woman,
a wonderful woman.

366
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,076
She'll come in the morning
and be with him till I get up,

367
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,536
and then she'll stay
until you come home at night.

368
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,223
Except Thursdays.

369
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,347
What do we do on Thursdays?

370
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,162
Give him a dime
and let him go on the town?

371
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,688
You can take him
to the theater with you.

372
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,153
Don't make it sound so awful.

373
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,909
Mommy?

374
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,165
Yes, sweetheart, I'm here.

375
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,284
Did you bring me anything?

376
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,002
No, I didn't, baby.
There wasn't...

377
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,544
Oh, yes, I did, too.

378
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,918
See here. Look.

379
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,544
What does it do?

380
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,674
It's a nugget.
A real gold nugget.

381
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,300
Gosh!

382
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,804
Where'd you get it?

383
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,364
A customer had a little bit
too much champagne.

384
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,645
He gave it to me for luck.

385
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,322
Good night, Son.
Go back to sleep.

386
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,208
I'll save it for you, darling.

387
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,257
The gold rush is over.
You're quitting Lait's tomorrow.

388
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,328
You're not leaving my son
in the hands of a stranger.

389
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,936
Lon, she's experienced.
Takes care of children all the time.

390
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,556
And what's wrong
with my wanting to do something?

391
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,024
Lots of women have careers.

392
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,792
Creighton is more important
than a career.

393
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,024
There's time for both.

394
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:15,487
They liked me tonight,
and I like their liking me.

395
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,452
It's what I want to do.

396
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,455
Maybe when the boy's older.

397
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,078
- How much older, Lon?
- Shh!

398
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,001
When? How tall must he be?

399
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,217
I'm sick of being alone,
never seeing anyone.

400
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,758
Sometimes I get the feeling
that Creighton and I

401
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,551
are the only two people
in the world.

402
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,514
I am home
every minute I can be.

403
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,885
Only to be with your son,
not me.

404
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,138
I might as well
be 1,000 miles away.

405
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,266
We've become strangers, Lon.

406
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,940
Maybe it's because I once said
I didn't want your child.

407
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,938
You can't forgive me.

408
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:55,159
Well, I love him too, but I've got to make
some kind of life of my own.

409
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,701
I have the chance now, and you're not
going to take it away from me.

410
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,352
We haven't finished
talking about this.

411
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:07,417
Surprise, Lon.
For once, I don't wanna talk anymore.

412
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,718
If you liked me any better,
I couldn't stand it.

413
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,885
- Then we are friends?
- Friends.

414
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,639
Oh, what a sour face.
He didn't like us tonight.

415
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,266
Not a smile.

416
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,730
Watch this.

417
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:38,695
Flowers. Butterflies.
I can't. I can't.

418
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,542
You see? I made it!
The sneeze goes back into the act.

419
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,337
Yeah, already he's a critic.
Creighton, what's with you?

420
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,303
With me? It's fine.
Hiya, Pop, what's with you?

421
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,430
You know, pretty soon we put him in the act,
and then he's got to laugh!

422
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,645
- Past your bedtime, Son.
- I'll take him, Lon.

423
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,606
See, what did I tell you?
We put the sneeze back into the act.

424
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,027
- Lon, you seen this?
- Shh.

425
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,243
Look.

426
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,533
The whole show's built around her.
Not bad after three months, huh?

427
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,412
- Well, you're going, aren't you?
- No.

428
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,040
Look, Lon, I can take Creighton
home with me.

429
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,260
We get along great.
I tell him whoppers,

430
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,130
and the bigger the whopper,
the better he likes it.

431
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,758
This is a big night for her.
You should go.

432
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,637
I was not invited.

433
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,183
Where are you going?

434
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,181
Just down to the drugstore
for a minute.

435
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,945
Now, Lon, don't get panicky.

436
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,407
When I wasn't looking,
Ruby loaded him with ice cream.

437
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,153
His little stomach's just a little upset,
that's all.

438
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,497
See?

439
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,751
Clarence, will you run down
to the drugstore?

440
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,648
Tell the druggist
Creighton has an upset stomach.

441
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,085
- Have him fix something.
- Sure.

442
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,463
Hazel, a favor?

443
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,097
I've got to go someplace
after the show.

444
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,745
Will you take care
of the boy till I get back?

445
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,352
Of course.
And, Lon, don't worry.

446
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,143
He'll be sound asleep
by the time you come back for him.

447
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,609
From now on he's gonna sleep at home,
where he belongs.

448
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,861
The last thing I wanna do
is to cause you any trouble, Mr Lait.

449
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:47,239
But I've got my problem, and it's
the only way I know how to handle it.

450
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:52,120
I'll be sorry to lose her, Mr Chaney,
but I understand.

451
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,838
I got a couple of kids
of my own.

452
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,657
- Wait outside, Louisa.
- Yes, ma'am.

453
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,713
Afraid she can't see you now,
Mr Darrow.

454
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,003
Louisa, have you
no romance in your soul?

455
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,377
Must you spend your entire life
keeping us apart?

456
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,965
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'll just be a few minutes, Bill.

457
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,593
I thought you might need these.
The others are an hour old.

458
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,141
- I'll wait outside.
- Oh, no. No, please, Bill.

459
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,609
I'll join you at the table.

460
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,493
Bill, huh?

461
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,662
- He's an important customer.
- Evidently.

462
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,376
Get your things.
We're picking up Creighton at the theater.

463
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,746
I'm not through.
I've got another number to do.

464
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,625
You're off the payroll.
You've been replaced.

465
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,423
What are you talking about?
I went over big tonight.

466
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,234
Maybe this won't interest you,
but while you were going over so big,

467
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,012
your son was lying sick
in a theater dressing room.

468
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,307
- What is it? Did you get a doctor?
- No.

469
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,680
He doesn't need a doctor.
He needs his mother.

470
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,835
Someone to see to it he eats
the right food, at the right time,

471
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,226
at the right place,
in his home.

472
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,775
I've got a cab waiting.

473
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,947
You had me fired.

474
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,999
Damn you! Damn you!
Damn you!

475
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,298
What's the trouble, Cleva?

476
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,884
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

477
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:13,811
I'm from the collection agency.
I've come to collect my wife.

478
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,079
- Please.
- No.

479
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,614
- Please, Carl!
- No.

480
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,754
- I've told you why I was late.
- You're lying to me!

481
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,667
I couldn't leave the boy.

482
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,240
No, you're lying to me.
You were waiting for him, weren't you?

483
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,553
I wasn't, I swear it.
Carl, let... Please let me go!

484
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:55,678
- Lon, no! Don't!
- Get up! Get up!

485
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,647
He's brave.
Fights for you.

486
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,141
Can't be just because
you take care of his kid.

487
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,894
- Get up!
- Lon, he... He can't.

488
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,274
Stand me up, brave man.
Stand me up and knock me down again.

489
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,495
I'm sorry.

490
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,663
Don't let it keep you awake,
brave man.

491
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,879
I'm trying to apologize.
Don't make it harder for me.

492
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,090
Why should I make it easier?

493
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,842
I'll go get Creighton.

494
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,167
I'm sorry.

495
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,380
You couldn't have known.

496
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,007
Who is he?

497
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,722
Carl Hastings.

498
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,933
I was once married to him.

499
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,144
It was over years ago.

500
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,768
I heard about his accident.
I went to see him.

501
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,988
I thought maybe I could help,

502
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:34,611
but he's become so bitter,
so cruel.

503
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:39,490
Now he wants me to go back to him,
but I can't. I just can't.

504
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,089
Is this why
you wanted me home, Lon?

505
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,379
Was the boy getting in your way?

506
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,547
Keep quiet.

507
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,511
Don't bother to introduce me.

508
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,632
I'm sure this must be Hazel.

509
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,057
My son knows your name
almost as well as he knows mine.

510
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,679
Are you finished, Cleva?

511
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,650
You and I haven't been very bright,
Mrs Chaney.

512
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,861
Yes, I've finished. For good!

513
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,860
I'm not going back
to being a nursemaid

514
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,655
so you can play around
with a chorus girl!

515
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,720
It's all right, Lon.
I'll be all right.

516
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:53,238
Goodbye, Hazel.
Yeah. Goodbye.

517
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,113
What's the use?

518
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,987
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

519
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:06,702
Maybe I can't walk,
but I'm not blind.

520
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,584
- Hello, Mr Locan.
- Don.

521
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,718
Clarence. Heard anything?

522
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,591
No. Nothing.

523
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,021
Well?

524
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,731
Three days!
She's gotta be somewhere.

525
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,545
She can't just disappear
off the face of the earth.

526
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,561
Mr Locan.
Telephone, please.

527
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,608
- That may be something.
- Yeah.

528
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,761
Look, Harry,
do it any way you want.

529
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,098
You have to bother me with it.

530
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,520
Look, I give you the stuff,
and you put it in the paper.

531
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,050
Don't go away, sweet.
I'll be right with you, sweetheart.

532
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,518
Cleva, Lon's been going crazy.

533
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,979
They love him, don't they?

534
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:58,600
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?

535
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,110
Cleva!

536
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,445
Get that curtain down!

537
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,084
- Well, she's out of danger, Mr Chaney.
- Oh, thanks, Doc.

538
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,208
However, the acid
seriously damaged her vocal chords.

539
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,755
- She won't be able to talk?
- In time.

540
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,223
I understand your wife was a singer.

541
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,841
Yes.

542
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,219
Well, she won't be anymore.

543
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,768
Can I see her?

544
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,735
It might be wiser if you'd wait.
Give her a week.

545
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,865
It's my fault she's in there.

546
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,912
I drove her to it.

547
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,790
Is your name Bill?

548
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,561
She was trying to reach Darrow.
He didn't wanna be reached.

549
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,662
Gimme a chance, fellows.

550
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,282
I'm from "The Morning Post", Mr Chaney.
Why did she do it?

551
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,020
- Well, give us a break...
- Look, not now.

552
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,286
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Is it true you've been fired?

553
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,912
- Leave him out of this.
- Look out!

554
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,380
Lon!

555
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,670
- You can't...
- Come on, come on, fellows.

556
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,920
He's upset. Let it be.
You got your headlines.

557
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,718
Daddy, where's Mommy?

558
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,347
Your mommy has to be away
for a while, Son.

559
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,809
She'll be home in a few days.

560
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,737
Better finish your breakfast,
young man.

561
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,322
Thanks for taking care of him, Hazel.

562
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,071
But, you know, you shouldn't
have come here.

563
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,198
Those reporters...

564
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,076
I don't want to see you
get mixed up in this, you know.

565
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,544
Do you think I care
what they say?

566
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:24,833
I'd better go.

567
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,127
I wanna be at the theater
when Kolb gets there.

568
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,252
- You know, straighten things out.
- After all this?

569
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,088
Forget it.

570
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,715
He'll take you back, Lon,
when things quiet down.

571
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:39,094
Oh, not a chance.
Not a chance.

572
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,749
There isn't a manager in the country
that'll have anything to do with me,

573
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,355
and I don't blame them.

574
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,896
I got nobody to blame but myself.

575
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,647
Even Darrow. You can charge
that one up to me, too.

576
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,399
I'll take Cleva and Creighton
and go somewhere.

577
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,150
Someplace where nobody
ever heard of us.

578
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,155
Maybe we can get a fresh start
and stop hurting each other.

579
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,659
Well, we've gotta try.
Got to. For the boy's sake.

580
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,626
- Did you ever play Los Angeles?
- No. Oh, yeah.

581
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,249
One-night stand with a Tom show.

582
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,626
Well, nobody knows you there.

583
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,426
- What's there for me in Los Angeles?
- Moving pictures.

584
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,015
What's that got to do
with acting?

585
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,886
Well, for you, everything.
It's pantomime.

586
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,853
I don't know how long
they're gonna be around,

587
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,724
but it'll keep you going
for a while.

588
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,272
Hazel, can I have
some more milk?

589
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,065
I'll get it.

590
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:41,369
Would you mind a suggestion
from your old Uncle Clarence?

591
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,334
Find yourself a nice banjo player.

592
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,305
Now, don't forget, Son.

593
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,925
Mommy will be talking to us in whispers
for a while, and we'll go along with it.

594
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,975
Make it a kind of game.
Quiet as a couple of mice, OK?

595
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,188
- OK.
- Again.

596
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,596
- OK.
- Good. Perfect!

597
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:16,032
- Hello, there, Creighton.
- Shh! Not so loud, Uncle Clarence.

598
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,650
Lon.

599
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,412
You wait here, Son.

600
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,371
Cleva's not here.

601
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,839
What? Where is she?

602
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:35,210
They don't know.
Nobody saw her leave.

603
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:41,387
Lon, I think she's just running
from everything that's happened.

604
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,261
Hmm. Including her son.

605
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,979
Look, give her a little time, Lon.

606
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,769
Let her try and work it out.

607
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,732
No, no.

608
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,104
She's run out on him
for the last time.

609
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,652
So help me.
So help me!

610
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:01,778
As I stand here,
she'll never get near him again!

611
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,918
In view of the testimony

612
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,757
and the default of defendant,
Cleva Creighton Chaney,

613
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,468
the court grants to the plaintiff,
Chaney, a decree of divorce.

614
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,511
In the matter of the custody
of Creighton Chaney,

615
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,305
it is the opinion of the court
that the plaintiff, Chaney,

616
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:30,102
is unable at this time to give the boy
the environment of a normal home life.

617
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,440
Your Honor!

618
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,562
Mr Chaney, the court suggests
that you agree

619
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,689
to place your son in a foster home
until you've...

620
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,656
No! No!

621
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,529
Then this court must declare
Creighton Chaney a ward of the court

622
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:48,328
until such time as you can prove
permanent, gainful employment,

623
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,124
the establishment of a suitable home,
proper associations...

624
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,497
Why didn't you tell me
this could happen? Why? Why?

625
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,054
He... he's a good eater,
and I always get his breakfast.

626
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,955
He doesn't like oatmeal,
but any other cereal...

627
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,813
We set a good table, Mr Chaney.

628
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,075
You'll have lots of fun here, Son.

629
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:32,043
All those children to play with,
and the toys and the swings.

630
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,878
You be a good boy, huh?
You know.

631
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,750
I'll come to see you
every week, every week.

632
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,376
And it won't be for long, Son.

633
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:44,176
I promise you,
it won't be for long.

634
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:15,120
Hold it there, fella.

635
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,878
I been telling you,
you've got to have a pass.

636
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,673
And I've been asking you,
how do I get one?

637
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,137
Go to the front office
and get someone to OK it.

638
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,757
Look, I don't wanna steal any cameras.

639
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,476
All I want is somebody
to look at this press book.

640
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,267
I looked at it,
and I'll tell you again.

641
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,640
Go over to the bullpen.
Maybe you might get lucky.

642
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,357
But I'm not an extra.
I'm an actor.

643
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,898
Now, aren't we all?
Aren't we all?

644
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,692
- Hi, Gert.
- Hi.

645
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,487
- How's life among the 400?
- Ha! We're down to 399.

646
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,110
I just shot my husband.

647
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,200
Hey, hold it a minute.
Oh, Gert.

648
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,823
Yeah?

649
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,126
Set this fella straight, will you?

650
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,668
He says he's an actor
but doesn't want any part of extra work.

651
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,290
An actor?

652
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,759
Well! That's a novelty around here.

653
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,628
Hey, come here.

654
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,677
- Tell him the facts of life, huh?
- Sure.

655
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,392
Come along, friend. I'll even look
at your press book, if you insist.

656
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,011
Come on.

657
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,316
- Stage?
- That's right.

658
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,356
Well, that don't cut
much ice in pictures.

659
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,903
We're selling dreams, Prince Charming,
handsome knights in shining armor.

660
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,525
You mean I'm not the type?

661
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,074
- You want it straight, honest?
- Mm-hmm.

662
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:31,696
You're not any type.

663
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:36,417
You see, you're in movies
what we call an unsaleable commodity.

664
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:40,037
You're just a plain, ordinary guy
with a plain, ordinary face.

665
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,755
Well, that's straight and honest.

666
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,217
I know a lot of plain, ordinary guys
like you working extra.

667
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:49,009
Why don't you try it?
It helps them eat.

668
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,133
- Duchess, I just quit acting.
- Come on!

669
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,188
Oh, a big day today.
Four pictures shooting.

670
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,982
- Good morning, Gert.
- Hi, Harry.

671
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,026
Two Westerns, a sea epic...

672
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,240
- Hi, Gert.
- Hello, Pete.

673
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,860
A society comedy, that's me.

674
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,862
A breath of Riverside Drive.

675
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,309
All right, Indians over here.
All Indians over here.

676
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,414
- Stick around.
- For what?

677
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,125
For what?

678
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,245
The assistant directors,
no less.

679
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,024
Let's have
all the bald-headed fat men.

680
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,688
All right, all the Indians over here.
Indians, over here.

681
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,676
All right, society people over here.

682
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,138
Five men, five women
and three waiters.

683
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,430
Action.

684
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,441
Now you turn around,
laugh at Chaney.

685
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,935
Now slowly
start to wipe your face.

686
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,227
That's it. That's good.

687
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,820
Now reach behind you
and get your pie and throw it at Hank.

688
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,677
That's it, that's it.
Now start to wiping your face.

689
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:54,321
Get your pie, now, and pick it up
and throw it at Snub!

690
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,325
That's it. That's good.

691
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,576
Now, Snub, start to wipe your face.
That's it. Cut!

692
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,704
That's it. Listen, please, come on,
let's move on to the next set.

693
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,039
- Come on, strike that set.
- Come on.

694
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,720
OK, the rest of you, come on!

695
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,311
Oh, I'm sorry, Lon.

696
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:28,359
Well! Always did like chocolate, Gert.
Always liked chocolate. Mmm.

697
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,482
Oh, and Gert, thanks.

698
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,529
- Oh, forget it.
- No, I mean it.

699
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,994
Just before I was so deliciously
blinded by this chocolate pie,

700
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,205
I saw something!

701
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,853
If a guy can be enough things
in this business, he can make a living.

702
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,871
Now, listen. Don't start spending the money.
You've still got that face.

703
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:49,501
I've got a box full of faces, Gert.
A whole box full!

704
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,929
- Morning, Duchess.
- Oh, morning, Lon.

705
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,580
Did you finish your bit
at Mack Sennett's?

706
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,015
At 6 o'clock this morning.

707
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,981
Good heavens!
Don't you ever sleep?

708
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,898
Nine cowboys, four Indians,
twelve Arab horsemen,

709
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,864
four lascars, two with scars,
two dowagers.

710
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,904
No Chinese!

711
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,122
Four lascars, two with scars.

712
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,620
- Lascars? What's that?
- East Indian sailors. Me!

713
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,084
Make-up?

714
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,794
Make-up.

715
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,251
What's driving you, Lon?

716
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,801
You're getting bits now,
even billing once in a while.

717
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,430
Why do you knock yourself out
working extra?

718
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,726
Need the money, Gert.
I need the money.

719
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,723
Trying to get my kid
out of hock.

720
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:43,573
All right, you, you,

721
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,247
you and you.

722
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,665
Oh, and you.

723
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,791
I want that scar.
Report to wardrobe.

724
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,883
Hey, what's your name, fellow?

725
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,428
- Lon Chaney.
- Chaney.

726
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,678
What're you trying to do?
Be a one-man crew on this ship?

727
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,056
You heard him, Joe.
He'll be looking for this scar.

728
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,916
- Er... hey, you.
- Yes, please?

729
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,037
I'm looking for a fellow called Chaney.

730
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,004
Talk slow, please.

731
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:38,002
Er... me lookin' Chaney, Lon Chaney.
Him actor, actor.

732
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,880
Oh, him actor.
Oh, yeah. Sahib Chaney.

733
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,007
- Yeah. You know where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes.

734
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,976
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Him, him hide.

735
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,518
Him hear crazy Uncle Clarence
come after him, borrow money.

736
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,562
Well, Lon! You!

737
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,526
Hello, Clarence.
You look great.

738
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:57,897
Yeah. Yeah. You, too.
What am I saying?

739
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,635
Oh, did you get that job
you wrote me about?

740
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,322
You're looking at George Loane Tucker's
new public relations man.

741
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,410
That's movie talk for press agent.

742
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,371
- Hey, that's big stuff.
- You know him?

743
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,179
- No, could never get my foot in the door.
- Well, I've got the key.

744
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,522
Tucker's ready to start a picture
called "The Miracle Man".

745
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,755
There's only one problem.
There's a part that he can't cast,

746
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,714
a very special kind of part.

747
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,505
You wouldn't happen
to know an actor

748
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,049
who can twist his body
to look completely deformed,

749
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,921
and then unwind
before your very eyes?

750
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,970
I knew him once, Sahib Chaney.

751
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,434
- You're getting the drift.
- Mmm.

752
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,164
Did it once in "The Mikado"
when he was a kid.

753
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,188
Only half did it.
This is going to be much tougher.

754
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,148
Tucker wants to see you tomorrow.

755
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,858
Oh, no.
Make it day after tomorrow.

756
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,477
Oh, it's too late.
I promised him.

757
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,525
No. Tomorrow's the day
I visit with my boy.

758
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:42,070
Oh, yeah, yeah. OK, OK.
The next day. I'll fix it.

759
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,305
All right, on the set, folks.
Let's go. On the set.

760
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,742
Stick around
while I pick up the room rent.

761
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,251
The beggar and the miracle man
are part of the same gang of con men.

762
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,149
- Isn't that right, Mr Tucker?
- That's right.

763
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,256
Now, this is the snapper
of the picture.

764
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,797
The phony miracle man is healing Chaney
in front of the townspeople.

765
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,591
Chaney. Is it the same one
who was with Kolb and Dill?

766
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:07,057
Oh, a long time ago.
He's made hundreds of pictures since.

767
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,472
- Ready, Mr Tucker.
- OK. Excuse me, please.

768
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,436
Places, everybody.

769
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,563
- Are you sure you feel all right, Lon?
- Yes, fine.

770
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:19,357
- Shall we try one, Lon?
- Please.

771
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,034
Camera!

772
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,538
Action!

773
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,593
Cut!

774
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,465
That was wonderful!
Perfect, Lon.

775
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:57,094
Great, Lon.
I hurt all over. Great!

776
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,568
All right. All right. Ease out of it.
Let's not be so frisky, huh?

777
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,528
All right, folks.
Let's break it up!

778
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,569
Let's get ready for the next set-up.

779
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,940
Say, Lon, there's a freelance
magazine writer over there.

780
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,327
He's doing a story on the picture.
He wants to meet you.

781
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,119
- Dave Anderson, this is Lon Chaney.
- It was really something, Mr Chaney.

782
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,413
Were you ever
a professional contortionist?

783
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:22,377
No, just slack ligaments.

784
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,589
Oh, and Dr Shiels is on the set
in case they tighten up?

785
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,486
Oh, he's the studio's idea,
but he's a good friend.

786
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,046
I enjoy having him around.

787
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,013
Hey, tell me, you were married
to Cleva Creighton, weren't you?

788
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,094
What has that got to do
with "The Miracle Man"?

789
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,722
Just asking, Mr Chaney.
You had a son, too, didn't you?

790
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,648
Lon!

791
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,746
- Come on, come on. Simmer down.
- I get it all figured, all figured.

792
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,117
I make the grade,
I get my son back.

793
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,744
Now this guy comes along
and digs up the whole mess,

794
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,213
and what chance have I got?

795
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,582
What happened out there?

796
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,801
No more interviews,
no more questions.

797
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,966
Another newspaperman
comes on the set, I go off!

798
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,010
Look, Lon, publicity
is part of our business.

799
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:23,230
We're not just a goldfish bowl,
we're a whole aquarium.

800
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,270
There's no room in the industry
for a mystery man.

801
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,940
- Why, if we were to...
- Just a minute, Mr Tucker.

802
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,733
"Mystery man"!

803
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,626
I'm a deadhead from way back.
I haven't paid to see anything in years,

804
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:37,744
but you know something?
I'd buy a ticket to see a mystery man.

805
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,455
A change of face, nothing more.

806
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,745
I can hear the jingle
in the box office.

807
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,494
I can see the whole campaign now.

808
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,465
"Lon Chaney, man of mystery!"

809
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,089
"Man of mystery"?

810
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,961
What do you think of it, Lon?

811
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,737
And what happens with that guy
out there with his hot little scoop?

812
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,221
Oh, him?
He just quit the magazine business.

813
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,594
What?

814
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:05,564
Oh! I meant to tell you before,
he's on your payroll.

815
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:09,435
My new assistant.
He likes to eat steady.

816
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,367
What does that judge want?

817
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:21,114
I thought showing him this would be
the clincher, but the answer's still "no".

818
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,160
"The only concern of the court, Mr Chaney,
is the welfare of your son."

819
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,288
What does he call permanent employment
and a suitable home?

820
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,164
For months now
I've been working steady.

821
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,542
And this house that I bought
is not exactly a pup-tent!

822
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,510
You don't have to sell me.

823
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:39,052
His own room, a back garden,
school two blocks away,

824
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,847
and a summer place that starts
going up the day I get him back.

825
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,684
Just for the two of us,
where we can fish and talk

826
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,399
and... get to know
each other again.

827
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,109
Take it easy!

828
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:54,856
Take it easy! Take it easy!
You sound like that judge!

829
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,075
Look, Lon, you never can tell.
Whenever you least expect it, it might break.

830
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,202
Yeah. Yeah.

831
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,115
Oh, Lon, I... I forgot to tell you.
I asked a girl to stop by.

832
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,995
I should have mentioned it before,
hope you don't mind.

833
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:13,295
Well, if you think it's a suitable home
to bring a girl to, why, go ahead.

834
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,088
It's all right.
I'll go catch a movie.

835
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,883
Oh, no, no.
No, it's nothing like that.

836
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:25,977
Hello, Lon.

837
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:38,069
Er... about that movie, it sounds great.
Think I'll catch it.

838
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,366
Hello, Hazel.

839
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,915
Come in. Sit down.

840
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,302
Er... can I get you something?

841
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,921
No.

842
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,092
Oh...

843
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,686
Oh, that... that Locan!

844
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:13,309
Same old Uncle Clarence.
He hasn't changed a bit.

845
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,481
Neither have you.
I don't know how you do it.

846
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,947
- It's been a long time.
- Mm-hmm. Three years.

847
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:21,567
- You still dancing?
- Well, that's what they pay me for.

848
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,495
I'm on tour now. A revue.
We open tomorrow night at the Criterion.

849
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:29,037
Well, I'll... I'll have to catch that.

850
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,044
Sure, er...
sure I can't get you something?

851
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,505
Oh, no. Thank you.

852
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,384
You're doing wonderfully well, Lon.
I've seen a lot of your movies.

853
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:46,759
Well, you know, I grew up
on stories without words.

854
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,932
In Pittsburgh I sat down
and wrote you a fan letter.

855
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,352
- I didn't get it.
- I didn't send it.

856
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,727
Oh, that's too bad.
Could have used it.

857
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,696
You know, the kind of fellows I play,
pretty girls don't write to.

858
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,694
How's Creighton?

859
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,743
Well, fine.
Out in the Valley.

860
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,537
Yes, I know.
Locan told me.

861
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:18,082
Would you like to see him some afternoon?
He always had a crush on you.

862
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,709
- I'd love to.
- I'll take you.

863
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:25,006
They're very kind to fathers.

864
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,803
Regular visiting hours.

865
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,051
- You'll get him back, Lon.
- Oh, sure.

866
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,891
I've got it all worked out.

867
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:37,726
I'm gonna buy Buckingham Palace,
lay out a polo field in front,

868
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,354
move in the Taj Mahal in back
for a swimming pool,

869
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,732
and then maybe the court will rule
that's a suitable home.

870
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:49,696
Oh, I'm sorry, Hazel.
I... I've been in a rut lately.

871
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,077
Lon?

872
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,998
- Maybe...
- What?

873
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,171
I was just thinking...

874
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,299
Come on.

875
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:06,380
Maybe a suitable home
doesn't mean just a house and furniture.

876
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,600
I mean, maybe the judge feels
that a suitable home is...

877
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,470
...well, people.

878
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,607
A father, a mother...

879
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,737
...you know, people.

880
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,652
Tell you what.

881
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,026
Tomorrow on the extras call sheet,
I'm going to put,

882
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:31,326
"Wanted, one mother type,
preferably under 50,

883
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,870
"to fall in love
with actor and son."

884
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,209
I'm under 50, Lon.

885
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:44,877
You said yourself Creighton's stuck on me.
That's one of you, anyway.

886
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:50,681
- You'd do that for me, Hazel?
- For myself, Lon.

887
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,348
I guess I've always
been in love with you.

888
01:18:55,189 --> 01:19:00,275
Oh, Hazel.
Hazel, I wouldn't wish me on anybody.

889
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:04,738
Well, er... I'm willing to take my chances,
if you want me.

890
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:08,199
But I'm tough to get along with.
Ask anybody.

891
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,239
I don't know why I am, but I am.

892
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,205
That's the way it is.
Ask Locan.

893
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:14,823
I did.

894
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,287
Oh, well... Locan.

895
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:27,336
Well, anyway, that...
that's what I was thinking.

896
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,713
I'll have to add another room.

897
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,885
Would it be so difficult?

898
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,479
Two truckloads of rock
and a couple of crushed fingers.

899
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,739
Oh, that Locan!

900
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:03,672
Ah! Well, well, well, well, well!

901
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,172
- What do you think of this one, boy?
- That's a beaut!

902
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,795
Ah-ha!

903
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:12,263
Well, yeah.

904
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,261
Like him, huh?
Got one on there?

905
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:20,480
Lon, there's still no sign of them.
You suppose anything's happened?

906
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:23,566
Huh? Oh, don't worry.
They'll be here.

907
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:28,029
Gosh, Hazel. I had a whopper nibbling.
You scared it away.

908
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:31,821
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Creighton.
I'll try to remember next time.

909
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:36,947
It's OK, I guess.
But, you see, trouts are very nervous.

910
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:46,461
She's your mother now.
Why not call her that?

911
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,592
I forgot.

912
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,550
All right, you two.
What's going on?

913
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,762
Can't men talk about men's business
without women butting in?

914
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,883
Call her "Mom".

915
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,313
That'll be fun.

916
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,434
Cleaning the fish is my job, Mom.
I better get started.

917
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,530
Hey, this dock's not very clean.

918
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,154
What were you two talking about?

919
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:18,951
He's getting pretty good at it,
isn't he?

920
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:23,418
Did you tell him to call me "Mom"?
Do you think that was wise?

921
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,628
- Isn't it a better idea...
- He thinks she's dead.

922
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,748
It's best that way.

923
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,420
Here they are!
Here they are!

924
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,739
Grandma, I'm glad to meet you.

925
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,871
And I'm glad to meet you.

926
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,087
You've grown.

927
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:10,548
And I'm strong, too.

928
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,425
I'm glad you came.

929
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:24,388
- Well! Clarence, how are you?
- Lon, how are you?

930
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,014
Papa!

931
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,358
Yeah, sure lots of kissing
going on around here.

932
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,899
Don't look at me.
Thanks for bringing them up.

933
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,944
No trouble at all. I always wanted
to know what "nowhere" looks like.

934
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,658
- What's that?
- That is a script.

935
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,027
Ha!

936
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:42,827
Oh, no. This is vacation.
Not allowed to read. My wife won't let me.

937
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,429
You beat me again.

938
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,799
I'm becoming expert.

939
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,533
- You all right, Lon?
- Oh, just couldn't sleep, that's all.

940
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,992
- What have you been doing?
- Just sketching up an idea I had.

941
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,709
Oh, may I see it?

942
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,924
Is it a good script?

943
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,393
Doesn't matter.
Not gonna do it.

944
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,854
Why? Because it might remind us?

945
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:52,692
Oh, Lon, do it, if it's a good script.
The past can't hurt us.

946
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,049
And send a copy of the novel
to the New York office.

947
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,998
No, better not.
It'll take them a year to read it.

948
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,105
Send them a one-page synopsis,
short words.

949
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,065
All right, I will.

950
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,435
I'm Lon Chaney.
I've got an appointment with Mr Thalberg.

951
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,563
Oh, right in there, Mr Chaney.

952
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,790
Please sit down, Mr Chaney.

953
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,464
Mr Thalberg?

954
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,176
Don't let it bother you.
It happens all the time.

955
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,264
Did you read the book?

956
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:06,883
One sitting.
Couldn't put it down.

957
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,851
That's the way it hit me
the first time, too.

958
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,771
You see, when I was a boy,
I was sick quite a bit.

959
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,639
They made me stay in bed.

960
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:17,610
I had nothing better to do,
so I read every book I could lay my hands on.

961
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,231
I'll never forget the first day I read
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame".

962
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,779
Sent my temperature sky high.

963
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,904
Now... now I want to make it
into a picture.

964
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,454
And you know, between you and me,
this company can use a prestige picture.

965
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,480
And I don't think anyone around would mind
if it made a couple of dollars, too.

966
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,585
Oh, naturally.

967
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,206
The whole project
scares the New York office stiff.

968
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:42,677
They see it as ten reels of sheer horror,
with a monster playing the lead.

969
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,805
Tell me, Mr Chaney,
how do you see Quasimodo?

970
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:03,945
I see him as a man deformed,
cursed, tormented,

971
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,942
laughed at as a freak,

972
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:09,867
but his tormentors never see
the heartbreak or the tears.

973
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:19,548
That's just what I want
the audience to see, Mr Chaney.

974
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,839
The soul of a man
that God made different.

975
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:27,506
If you can get that on film,
we've got ourselves a picture!

976
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,161
Can you really make him
look like that?

977
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,055
I started on the make-up
the day you sent me the book.

978
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:41,110
Do you know why I wanted you
for The Hunchback, Mr Chaney?

979
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,695
No.

980
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:48,160
This project is so important to me
that I couldn't take a chance on just anyone.

981
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:53,702
Every time an actor was suggested,
I dug into his past to see what made him tick.

982
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:57,919
In your case, I dug rather deep...

983
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,632
...all the way back
to Colorado Springs.

984
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,798
My parents?

985
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,923
You know what it's like
to be different.

986
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,641
Make people understand.

987
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:15,603
Make them see it
the way you see it.

988
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:33,117
- All right. Now we'll try this.
- All right.

989
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,920
Now we'll try this one over here.

990
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:47,822
- It's too tight, Lon. It's too tight.
- No, it's all right, Doc.

991
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,783
If you have it that tight, you won't be able
to wear it more than 15 minutes.

992
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,139
Let me worry about that.

993
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:56,511
If you're going to keep ignoring my advice,
why do you have me around?

994
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,808
You never can tell.

995
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,522
I might catch cold.

996
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:11,533
You talk to him, will you, Hazel?
He pays no attention to me.

997
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:14,789
Mom!

998
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:18,408
We're up here, dear.
We're going to an unveiling.

999
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,535
- Hello, Doc Shiels.
- Hello, Creighton.

1000
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:21,911
Creighton!

1001
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:25,256
All right. All right.
I'll get it later.

1002
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,796
Horrifying but pitiful.

1003
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,261
It's great, Lon, just great!

1004
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,384
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, dear.

1005
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,383
Hi, Pop.
Uncle Clarence.

1006
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,976
Creighton.

1007
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,641
Say, Pop! There's a great new joke
going around school.

1008
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:43,437
"Don't step on that spider,
it might be Lon Chaney."

1009
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:44,900
Very funny!

1010
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,190
Darling, it's wonderful,
but isn't it very painful?

1011
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,984
Only when I laugh.

1012
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,947
What a poster you'll make!

1013
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,745
Where'd you get this? Well?

1014
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,712
A lady gave it to me.

1015
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,041
What lady? Where?

1016
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:11,965
She comes around school every week or so,
watches us play ball.

1017
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,881
It isn't worth anything, is it?

1018
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:25,646
Son, there are some drawings
on the back seat of my car.

1019
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,609
Get them for me, will you?

1020
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,623
Be at that school every day
until she shows up,

1021
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,582
and bring her to me.
I want to see her.

1022
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:45,704
- See who?
- Cleva!

1023
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,087
- All ready, sir.
- All right.

1024
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,051
Cameras!

1025
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,551
Action! Bring in the cart.

1026
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,427
Hold it!

1027
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,763
Get me out of this!

1028
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,971
- Get me out of this!
- There's something wrong, sir.

1029
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,180
Cut!
Get him out of the shackles.

1030
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:29,932
What's wrong, Lon?
Are you all right?

1031
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,748
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

1032
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,995
Still afraid of freaks, Cleva?

1033
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,464
That's a very startling make-up.

1034
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,752
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Yes.

1035
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,254
How much?
How much to leave us alone?

1036
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,013
Nothing, Lon.

1037
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,728
I don't want a thing from you.

1038
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,769
You've done a good job of raising him,
you and Hazel. He's fine.

1039
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:14,227
Don't give me that.
You came back for something!

1040
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,354
I wanted to see him.

1041
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:21,279
Was that so terrible,
wanting to see my son again?

1042
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:24,825
Your son? You have to care
for something to make it yours.

1043
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,367
- You never even wanted him!
- Lon!

1044
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,102
Come on! Come on!
Let's have it. How much?

1045
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:32,461
- Lon, please.
- Don't bother. It's no use.

1046
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,841
Lon!

1047
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,974
- Can we go someplace to talk?
- You can say it here.

1048
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,940
Lon, try not to be angry with me.
Please.

1049
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,651
I think Creighton has a right to know
his mother's alive.

1050
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:59,363
- I don't!
- He'll find out someday.

1051
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,780
Unless he's heard it from you,
he'll hate you for it. Oh, tell him, Lon.

1052
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:05,198
And make myself a liar
in his eyes?

1053
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:09,324
We won't talk about it anymore.
He's not to know!

1054
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,655
- What's all this?
- Just fooling around.

1055
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:49,280
Oh, at four it could be fooling around.
At your age, it could be an itch.

1056
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:53,500
OK, Pop, I've been thinking,
with two actors in the family,

1057
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,291
we'd sure have this business
sewed up.

1058
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:58,254
Two actors, huh?
Where'd you get that idea?

1059
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,090
An agent talked to me
on your set.

1060
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:01,800
He said he'd get me a good part

1061
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,728
if you'd let him bill me
as Lon Chaney Junior.

1062
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,325
Oh, Son, there's always somebody around
looking to make a fast dollar.

1063
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,785
They figure they can get one
with you.

1064
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,971
But he says
he can make me an actor.

1065
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:13,767
Son, to quote
the great Richard Mansfield,

1066
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:18,893
"Actors are not made.
Actors and idiots are born."

1067
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:21,441
You mean you won't let me?

1068
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:25,487
Son, I've always tried to do
what was best for you.

1069
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,450
Let me go on trying
a little longer, huh?

1070
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:31,163
Anyway, have you forgotten?
I finish my job tonight.

1071
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,375
We've got a whole week
at the cabin.

1072
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,704
I don't want to go.

1073
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,094
Creighton? Creighton.

1074
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:50,966
What is it?

1075
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,395
Oh, a crazy idea he's got.

1076
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,354
Like wanting to be an actor?

1077
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:57,893
I want more than that for him.

1078
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:01,019
Lon, don't hold him so tightly.
Don't smother him.

1079
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,567
He loves you more
than anyone, anything.

1080
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,191
You can't ask for more
than all his love.

1081
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,159
Tell him I'm leaving
for the cabin tonight.

1082
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:12,371
He can come along
or stay home, either way.

1083
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,501
Action!

1084
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,807
Cut!

1085
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,727
- Very nice, dear. Very nice.
- Thank you, Mr Chaney.

1086
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:09,697
That was great, Lon. Really.
Really, just great.

1087
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,283
There's Hazel and Creighton.

1088
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:19,248
- Hello, Hazel, Creighton.
- Thank you, Lon.

1089
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:21,367
Oh, hello, Uncle Clarence.

1090
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:34,217
The car's outside, Pop,
and the gear's all loaded.

1091
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,762
We can go
as soon as you're ready.

1092
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,142
Wonderful, Son.

1093
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,263
I've got one more shot.
I'll hurry them along!

1094
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,775
It's always the same.

1095
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:49,145
I wind up apologizing
and doing what he wants.

1096
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,691
Creighton!

1097
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,233
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- What started the ruckus, anyway?

1098
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,577
He caught me fooling around
in his make-up box,

1099
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,536
copying one of his faces.

1100
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:01,498
He's got a thousand of them,
but you should have heard him.

1101
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:04,039
- What'd you say?
- Huh?

1102
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:06,162
A thousand faces!

1103
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:09,631
Thalberg's been after me
to start a new advertising campaign.

1104
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:12,172
"The Man of a Thousand Faces".
How's that?

1105
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,386
Son, if I get a raise,
I'm gonna give you half.

1106
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:17,097
Er... make it a new fishing rod.

1107
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,843
What's he stalling for?
He's got six more changes yet.

1108
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,817
Well, Irving.
What do you think?

1109
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,277
I like it.

1110
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:15,489
Lon, we're moving
the starting date back a week.

1111
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,324
Oh? And when did you decide
to do that?

1112
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,864
Hazel phoned.

1113
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,989
Ah-ha... won't upset things
too much, huh?

1114
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:25,604
You see, er... it's the last chance
my boy will have all summer

1115
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,000
to get up to the cabin.

1116
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:29,040
I got him a job downtown
with a brokerage firm.

1117
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:33,337
I'm afraid one of these days
your wife's gonna charm me out of my job!

1118
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,131
But that's only one reason
I came down, Lon.

1119
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,925
- What's the other reason?
- Your new contract.

1120
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:40,467
Oi!

1121
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:44,639
Lon, we've got to sit down
one of these days and thrash it out.

1122
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:47,103
Irving!
Draw it up. I'll sign it.

1123
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,065
It isn't that easy.
There are terms, clauses, conditions.

1124
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:52,685
Listen, you know, the fine print.

1125
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,812
Can't we just shake hands
and call it a deal?

1126
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:56,939
And how do I explain that
to the legal department?

1127
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,565
Have your secretary
make out a memo.

1128
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:01,614
"Mr Thalberg and Mr Chaney
shook hands."

1129
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,783
- Phone, Mr Chaney.
- Thanks.

1130
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,580
Probably Hazel.
I better get on that memo.

1131
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:18,635
Hello, honey. Huh?
Almost finished here.

1132
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:21,346
Yeah. I'll be home in about an hour.
Maybe sooner.

1133
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:24,592
Everything packed?
Creighton get home yet?

1134
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:27,018
Any minute now.

1135
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,268
Yes.

1136
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:42,739
What, Lon? Yes. Yes, dear.
All right, I will. Goodbye.

1137
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:46,909
Cleva!

1138
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:50,412
Cleva!

1139
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,543
Please come inside.

1140
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,589
- Oh, no!
- Yes. Please.

1141
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,552
Do you really want me to?

1142
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,181
Lon won't be home
for at least an hour.

1143
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,684
He'd be very angry.

1144
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:11,647
I know. Come in, please.

1145
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,988
For a long time now
I've known you were coming here.

1146
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:22,278
I've seen you there
at the end of the drive.

1147
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:26,245
Until today I didn't have the courage
to do anything about it.

1148
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:38,961
It's... it's very beautiful.

1149
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,005
Thank you.
Can I get you something? Some tea?

1150
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,407
- Oh, don't bother.
- Oh, it's no bother at all. Vera, please.

1151
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:44,592
Yes, Mrs Chaney.

1152
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,556
Come on, sit down.

1153
01:41:57,653 --> 01:41:59,189
Do you live nearby?

1154
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:02,690
I'm working on a farm in the valley,
as a cook.

1155
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,867
On my day off, I...

1156
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,830
I always promise myself
I won't come here.

1157
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,914
I know it can only mean trouble.

1158
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,620
I say I'll go shopping
or to the movies.

1159
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:20,465
And here I am.

1160
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,841
I haven't bothered Creighton.

1161
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,298
It's just that...

1162
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:31,226
I just have to see him
every so often.

1163
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,975
I'm sure I'd do
exactly the same thing.

1164
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:39,147
I feel so guilty about him.

1165
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:43,822
I always have,
all these years.

1166
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,824
I just didn't know
how to handle it, Hazel.

1167
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:51,537
After what happened,

1168
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:54,909
at the time, it...
it just seemed easier to run away.

1169
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:59,417
- It's Creighton. Stay and talk to him.
- Oh, I couldn't.

1170
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,289
- Oh, please.
- I wouldn't know what to say.

1171
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,836
I shouldn't have come in.

1172
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:06,132
I've got to get to the bus station,
the last bus.

1173
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:31,653
Who was that, Mom?
Anyone I know?

1174
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:35,954
Someone you did know,
a long time ago.

1175
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:45,792
Hello!

1176
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,087
Where is everybody?

1177
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:51,224
Up here, Lon.

1178
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:54,092
Coming up!

1179
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,315
I thought you'd be ready.

1180
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,900
You, too? What is all this?

1181
01:44:06,031 --> 01:44:09,365
I'm not going.
Something more important came up.

1182
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,995
More important?
Like what?

1183
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,365
It's just that I can't go
with you, that's all.

1184
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:19,622
Well, I'd still like a reason, Son.

1185
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:31,176
Boy, you in some kind of trouble?

1186
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,469
No, nothing like that.

1187
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:36,184
Well, if it's that job I got you,
that's easily fixed.

1188
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:39,146
There are other jobs.
Just... just say the word.

1189
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:41,105
Look, let's forget it, huh?

1190
01:44:43,402 --> 01:44:46,691
Son, we've been together
a long time.

1191
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:50,941
We've never had
any secrets before.

1192
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,567
Haven't we?

1193
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:57,989
What do you mean by that?

1194
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:01,410
I'll tell you what I mean.

1195
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:05,960
I saw her today. My mother.
My real mother!

1196
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:11,674
Why did you lie to me, Pop?
Why did you tell me she was dead?

1197
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,886
Son, you've got to understand.

1198
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:21,684
I understand.

1199
01:45:21,816 --> 01:45:25,480
I understand you lied to me.
I understand that much!

1200
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,477
She ran out on you
when you were a baby.

1201
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:29,320
As far as we were concerned,
she was dead!

1202
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:32,441
- I was just trying to protect you.
- Were you, Pop?

1203
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:36,615
Son!

1204
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,326
Creighton!

1205
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:48,127
Creighton! If you go to her,
don't bother to come back!

1206
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:08,438
I knew it.

1207
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,605
I knew she'd take him from me.

1208
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,491
I told him who she was, Lon.

1209
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,954
I couldn't lie to him
any longer.

1210
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:23,917
He had every right to know.
Cleva had every right to see him.

1211
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,627
The only harm
was in your mind.

1212
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:28,838
He's her son, too.

1213
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:35,546
Well, he's gone to her now.
Are you satisfied?

1214
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:39,467
What were you really
afraid of, Lon?

1215
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:43,596
That he'd open up his heart to her
and you'd lose part of him?

1216
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:45,814
You wanted all of his love.

1217
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:50,060
He's had all of yours,
with nothing left over for anyone else.

1218
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:54,948
Well...

1219
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,571
I'm sorry.

1220
01:47:07,963 --> 01:47:10,455
- Is Lon still around?
- When isn't he, lately?

1221
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:14,676
It's after midnight again.
He's in his dressing room.

1222
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,385
Hey, Locan.

1223
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:19,423
Maybe you can do something
with him.

1224
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:22,050
He's had us working
day and night for a month.

1225
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:25,179
Some of us have families
who've forgotten what we look like.

1226
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,146
I'll do what I can.

1227
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:34,487
Got a cold?

1228
01:47:34,615 --> 01:47:36,777
No, it's... nothing.

1229
01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:39,743
Maybe you ought to slow down.

1230
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:43,363
You didn't come here this time of night
to ask about my health.

1231
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:48,494
Well, Lon, I thought you'd like to know,
I... I found them.

1232
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,461
Cleva and the boy.

1233
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,582
Would you like to go see them?
I've got the address.

1234
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,128
Tear it up.

1235
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:58,198
Lon, he's just a kid. He's working
like a dog trying to support both of them...

1236
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:00,430
He wanted it that way.

1237
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:02,277
And who told you
to go look for him, anyway?

1238
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,141
Who asked you to interfere?

1239
01:48:04,269 --> 01:48:05,997
But, Lon, I've known the kid
since the day...

1240
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:08,263
From now on,
stay away from him.

1241
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:10,891
If he wants to see me,
he knows where I am.

1242
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:14,519
He won't come to you.
You'll have to make the first move.

1243
01:48:16,782 --> 01:48:18,273
Me go to him?

1244
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,071
Get down on my knees
to my own son?

1245
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:22,034
Beg him?
Is that what you're asking me to do?

1246
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,495
That's exactly
what I think you should do.

1247
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:26,489
Well, you can stop
thinking right now!

1248
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:29,413
And you can stop
bothering me, too! Out!

1249
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:36,462
Make it a thousand and one faces, Lon.

1250
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:39,711
This is one
I've never seen before.

1251
01:48:50,733 --> 01:48:52,816
Mind if I come in a minute?

1252
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:55,880
I know I don't look dressed
for the barricades,

1253
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:57,896
but I've just come
from a revolution.

1254
01:48:58,032 --> 01:48:59,944
The premiere of "The Jazz Singer".

1255
01:49:00,075 --> 01:49:01,907
Lon, you should have
seen that audience!

1256
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:03,868
When Jolson's voice
came from the screen,

1257
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:06,989
I could hear the bells tolling
for silent pictures.

1258
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:10,450
You haven't heard a word I said.

1259
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:14,003
Oh... I'm sorry, Irving.
What were you saying?

1260
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:15,131
Nothing much.

1261
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,337
I was just trying to tell you
about a modern miracle.

1262
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:21,303
Pictures that not only move, Lon,
but they speak.

1263
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:23,262
Oh, yes, sure.
Talking pictures.

1264
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:27,225
It's the horse and the automobile
all over again. No use trying to fight it.

1265
01:49:27,352 --> 01:49:32,347
I'm afraid some of the old favorites
are gonna fall by the wayside, a lot of them.

1266
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:37,319
Well, everything has to come to an end,
and I've had a long run.

1267
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:39,779
Who said anything about you, Lon?

1268
01:49:39,907 --> 01:49:41,648
You're gonna be bigger than ever!

1269
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,696
We're going to remake
"The Unholy Three".

1270
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,513
You're still gonna play
all the different characters,

1271
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,278
only this time
with voices to match.

1272
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:49,576
A thousand voices!

1273
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:53,952
Oh, yeah. Sure, Irving.
We'll talk about it sometime.

1274
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:59,549
I'm sorry I had to break in on you, Lon,
but I just had to tell you.

1275
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:01,167
That's all right.

1276
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,383
Just remember, "The Unholy Three"
is yours anytime you want it, Lon.

1277
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,761
- Thanks, Irving.
- Good night, Lon.

1278
01:50:10,896 --> 01:50:12,307
Good night.

1279
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,192
Quiet!

1280
01:50:20,072 --> 01:50:21,563
All set.

1281
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:23,189
Ready, Lon?

1282
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:28,820
Roll them.

1283
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:31,249
Speed.

1284
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:36,119
Action!

1285
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:39,873
We've got nothing
to worry about.

1286
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:43,501
This is the greatest set-up
since thievery was invented.

1287
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:48,094
We're gonna lift every hunk of jewelry
in this town that's worth taking.

1288
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,716
Cut!

1289
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:03,734
Let's just try it once more.

1290
01:51:04,908 --> 01:51:07,821
That was the seventh take.
Now, what is it, now?

1291
01:51:07,953 --> 01:51:10,286
Sorry, Lon.
Your voice sounded a little gravelly.

1292
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:13,873
- The mike didn't pick it all up.
- Oh, that's great! Great!

1293
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:15,742
We used to think
we could make pictures.

1294
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,790
Lights, a camera
and some acting.

1295
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:22,336
Now, everything is sound.
Are you noisy enough?

1296
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:24,129
Sorry, Lon.

1297
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:27,345
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. Sorry.
Just letting off steam.

1298
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:35,304
All right. All right.
Open up.

1299
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:40,688
- What? Again?
- Just pretend it's caviar.

1300
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:43,311
- Say "ah".
- Ah.

1301
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:44,858
- Ah.
- Ah.

1302
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,731
Ah.

1303
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:48,699
- Ah.
- Ah.

1304
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:51,991
Oh, Doc, you must love tonsils,

1305
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:54,242
the way you keep looking at mine
every chance you get.

1306
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:57,013
Well, this picture ends tonight.
And tonight you go to the hospital.

1307
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:59,036
This time there's no point arguing.

1308
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:02,255
Those tonsils are badly inflamed.
Probably have to come out.

1309
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:05,375
But I've had them all my life.
They're old friends.

1310
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:08,093
All right. All right.
Let's wrap this thing up.

1311
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:09,884
I... I need a rest anyway.

1312
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,989
- Hi, Uncle Clarence.
- Creighton.

1313
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:29,116
Cleva.

1314
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:30,845
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

1315
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:33,862
Your dad's been in the hospital.
I wondered if you knew.

1316
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,329
We read about it in the papers.

1317
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:38,200
Had his tonsils out.
Sort of a second childhood, huh?

1318
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:42,249
It wasn't his tonsils.
It's malignant.

1319
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:45,169
Your dad doesn't know it,
but it's hopeless.

1320
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,425
Irving!

1321
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,928
Imagine! Tonsils at my age.

1322
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:01,227
This just couldn't wait, Lon.
I've got one I think you'll really go for.

1323
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:04,692
A story of the French Foreign Legion,
"The Bugle Sounds".

1324
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:07,065
Feels pretty good.

1325
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:09,610
We do it in Africa,
right with the Foreign Legion.

1326
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:12,575
Well, how about Hazel?
She go with me?

1327
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:14,786
I'll put it in the contract!

1328
01:53:15,914 --> 01:53:19,828
You know, Irving, Hazel and I
have never had a trip.

1329
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:23,203
Never been anywhere,
have we, honey?

1330
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:26,376
- Gonna be great, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

1331
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:27,624
When do we go?

1332
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,500
Well, there's a lot of preparations, Lon.

1333
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:31,343
Like getting you well, first.
Drink this.

1334
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,713
You heard me!

1335
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:36,637
Look, if I do, will you go away
and let us talk?

1336
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,556
- Down the hatch!
- Down the hatch!

1337
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:41,850
Not too long, Mr Thalberg.

1338
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:47,860
Lon, read it and let me know.
I'll come back and we can talk about it.

1339
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,401
You'll have some ideas, I'm sure.
You always do.

1340
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:55,197
Oh, before we get too deep into this,
I'd like to take a run up to the cabin.

1341
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,116
I do my best thinking up there.

1342
01:53:57,247 --> 01:53:59,534
Well, we'll have to ask Dr Shiels
about that, Lon.

1343
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:03,034
Irving, he's on your payroll.
Don't ask him, tell him.

1344
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,913
- Right. See you, Lon.
- Right.

1345
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,591
Thank you, Vera.
That's fine.

1346
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:25,355
Irving, I don't know
how to thank you.

1347
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:27,817
If he's busy thinking
and planning,

1348
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,027
he won't have time
to ask too many questions.

1349
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:32,238
We'll keep him that way.

1350
01:54:32,366 --> 01:54:35,859
He wants to go up
to the cabin, Doctor.

1351
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,362
There's no reason
why he shouldn't.

1352
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:24,203
Skillet's all set to go.
All we need is some trout.

1353
01:55:31,133 --> 01:55:32,965
Now's the time...

1354
01:55:33,802 --> 01:55:36,510
Now's the time
to catch the big ones.

1355
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:05,873
Well! What are you doing here?

1356
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:09,494
Mmm... figured two surprises
were better than one.

1357
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:23,968
Mrs Chaney, have I told you lately
that I love you?

1358
01:56:24,102 --> 01:56:26,264
Hmm... I don't remember.

1359
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:28,558
Well, I do.

1360
01:56:29,608 --> 01:56:31,440
It's true.

1361
01:57:14,069 --> 01:57:15,310
How's your mother?

1362
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:17,812
She's fine.

1363
01:57:18,907 --> 01:57:21,149
I think you should know.
She was against my leaving you.

1364
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:25,278
Pop, she was working on a farm,
cooking for 30 men.

1365
01:57:25,413 --> 01:57:28,906
I-I couldn't leave her there.
I had to take care of her.

1366
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:31,625
Yeah, I know.

1367
01:57:31,753 --> 01:57:37,750
I should have been proud of you, but instead,
I kept steaming myself up to stay mad.

1368
01:57:37,884 --> 01:57:41,628
You know how I am,
I don't let go easy.

1369
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:45,263
But I'm learning.

1370
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:53,269
Hazel! You've got two starving men
on your hands. When we gonna eat?

1371
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,892
I've been ready for hours.
Just waiting for the fish.

1372
01:57:59,698 --> 01:58:01,860
Well! Bring them in.

1373
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:38,152
What?

1374
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:50,537
He wants his make-up case.

1375
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:05,067
He sends all of you his love.

1376
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:23,339
And he asked of us all...

1377
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:25,924
...forgiveness.
