1
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:30,078
Ready.

2
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:32,673
Fire!

3
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:09,393
Fairpath. Calling Operations Room.

4
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:12,217
<i>M for Mother landed 04-26.</i>

5
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:14,713
<i>No sign of any other aircraft about.</i>

6
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:17,238
<i>Still no sign of B for Bertie. Over.</i>

7
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,726
Hello, Group.

8
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,563
Yes, they're all back now,
except B for Bertie.

9
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:28,386
<i>From this and other operations,</i>
<i>one of our aircraft is missing.</i>

10
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:58,357
Pilot speaking, pilot speaking.

11
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,691
Testing intercoms.

12
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:04,743
Tom Earnshaw, second pilot.

13
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:12,697
Frank Shelley, observer.

14
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,025
Bob Ashley, wireless op.

15
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,712
Geoff Hickman, front gunner,
all correct.

16
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,317
George Corbett, rear gunner.

17
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:45,609
That's all, Corbett.

18
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,251
Thank you, sir.

19
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,058
Group, sir, about tonight's operations.

20
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:10,045
Reynolds speaking. Yes. Right.

21
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,325
The target is Stuttgart,
the Mercedes-Benz works.

22
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:19,064
<i>Will all operational crews</i>
<i>report to briefing at 14:30. 14:30.</i>

23
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:21,934
- Mail. One for you, Skipper.
- Thank you.

24
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,767
One for you, Tom.
Nice Halifax postmark.

25
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:24,715
Some letter.

26
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,281
Halifax again.

27
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,231
Oh, it's from my fiancée.

28
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:29,711
Both of them? Have you got two?

29
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,422
The other's from Dad.

30
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,452
Surely not the future Mrs Earnshaw?

31
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:36,272
You're not to so far off.

32
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,107
Whittaker & Whittaker, her dad's firm.

33
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,660
Second best in Yorkshire.

34
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,232
We know whose the best firm.

35
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,518
My dad's.

36
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,255
Earnshaw & Son.

37
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:49,196
Mm. I'm dying to see those
two noble animals in the same meadow.

38
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,120
You won't have to wait long.

39
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,321
Here comes Corbett,
singing and dancing as usual.

40
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,315
Billiards after lunch?

41
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,159
- You coming on this party tonight?
- No. I'm on ops.

42
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,861
Hazel says don't forget tomorrow night.

43
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,257
Hazel Mason,
Home and Forces Programme.

44
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:08,429
9:40.

45
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,315
George, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

46
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,724
- Tomorrow?
- 9:40.

47
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,545
- Packing.
- No no no, you're listening to my wife.

48
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:14,663
Home and Forces Programme.

49
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:15,886
You can pack tonight.

50
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm flying tonight.

51
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,813
We didn't know you were on ops,
George.

52
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,285
I saw the group captain.

53
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,677
As it's my last night,
he agreed to let me go.

54
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,386
Sorry to have gone
over your head, Skipper.

55
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,134
That's all right.
Glad to have you with us.

56
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,696
Eh, fellas?

57
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,314
We're honoured, Sir George.

58
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:33,023
I suppose Hopkins has been
told about this switch.

59
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,113
I suppose so.

60
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,146
I'd like to see Hopkins' face, Frank.

61
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:37,189
Poor old Hopkins.

62
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,595
Well, the son of a gun.

63
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,339
I don't believe it.
You're pulling my leg.

64
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,968
- Hopkins.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:46,470
Sorry, but you won't be wanted tonight.

66
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,445
- I see, sir.
- Bad luck, old man.

67
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,501
Son of a gun.

68
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,757
I don't believe it.

69
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,576
Hey, he's pulling my leg.

70
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:02,229
If you're not going,
can I have your silk stockings?

71
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,468
Oh, I suppose so.

72
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,433
What's this, camouflage net?

73
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,696
That's quality. Three bucks a pair.

74
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,071
They keep you warm as toast.

75
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,580
If my girl ever finds out I lent...

76
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,707
Tell her Bob Ashley wore them.
She'll be pleased as punch.

77
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,459
<i>Boy, I wish you could have</i>
<i>seen that run of Welsh's,</i>

78
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,131
<i>a run worthy of</i>
<i>the great Bob Ashley himself.</i>

79
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,473
<i>It had all the earmarks
of an Ashley special.</i>

80
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:29,296
<i>So it's a free kick against
the Allied Forces.</i>

81
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,623
Free kick. Now, look out for Welsh.

82
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,205
Not Welsh.

83
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:35,697
Not Welsh? Hear that, Len?

84
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:37,790
I'd like to see anybody else take it.

85
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,287
Course it'll be Welsh.

86
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,959
Compton will take the kick.

87
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,783
<i>This is a tense moment.
The ball is on the spot.</i>

88
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,432
<i>Welsh is going to kick.</i>

89
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,401
What did I say?

90
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,964
<i>Welsh is going to take the kick.</i>

91
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,260
Come on, Welsh!

92
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,061
<i>Welsh has kicked. No, he hasn't.</i>

93
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:53,867
<i>He's jumped over the ball.</i>

94
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,547
<i>Compton's taking the kick.</i>
<i>Compton's the man.</i>

95
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,774
<i>Goal! Well shot, Compton!</i>

96
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,909
<i>Well, that was a surprise.</i>

97
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:03,252
Not to me.

98
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:39,679
Len, cope with this stand-in cable.
It's stuck again.

99
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,134
- I'll fix it.
- How's Bertie?

100
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:44,846
Perfect, sir. New coat, full stomach.
He's a gent.

101
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,182
Fine. Bring the car back about four.

102
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,293
Did they fix that oil pressure, Jimmy?

103
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,169
Yes, it's OK now.

104
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,089
Len, who's this new bloke?

105
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,679
Fan of yours, wants your autograph.

106
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:04,993
- Saw you in some play.
- That's right, Mr. Shelley.

107
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:08,502
I saw you in the School For Scandal.
You played Joseph Surface.

108
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,075
Got a pencil?

109
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:12,550
- No. Afraid not.
- I'll do it for you tomorrow.

110
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:15,320
- Right. Thanks.
- It was Charles Surface.

111
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,816
Fairpath calling T for Tommy,
T for Tommy.

112
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,236
It's now 21:35, 21:35.

113
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,521
You may take off.

114
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,741
Checking intercoms.

115
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:21,694
Bob, are you there?

116
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:25,431
Sergeant Ashley, sir,
receiving you all right.

117
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,307
Blasted beehive gets smaller every trip.

118
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,193
What are you grumbling about,
Sir George?

119
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,905
You've got a carriage to yourself.

120
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,586
Fairpath calling.
Q for Queenie, Q for Queenie.

121
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,711
21:37, 21:37. You may take off now.

122
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,780
Disable.

123
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,194
Check your watches, chaps.

124
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,221
In 50 seconds, it'll be 21:40.

125
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,835
In... 45 seconds.

126
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,903
In... 40 seconds.

127
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:37,953
Fairpath calling B for Bertie,
B for Bertie.

128
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,289
It is now 21:40, 21:40.

129
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:41,939
Off you go.

130
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,138
Geoff, OK to go forward.

131
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:35,053
OK, Skipper.

132
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,072
Stuttgart, here we come.

133
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,691
You know, I played in Stuttgart
with my club in, uh, 1938.

134
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:59,044
1938? I was playing in New York.

135
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,962
What's Stuttgart like?

136
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,996
Oh, like all those continental towns.

137
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,686
Played Saturday, Sunday,
Monday on the train.

138
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,486
That was Stuttgart. Well, well.

139
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:10,168
Nice girls in Stuttgart, Skipper.

140
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:11,650
Well, one anyway.

141
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,040
What do you know about
the girls in Stuttgart, Geoff?

142
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:15,930
I know a nurse from Stuttgart.

143
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,810
That's funny. Mine was a nurse.

144
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,523
<i>Was her name Liesel?</i>

145
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,856
No, Else. What was your nurse like?

146
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,648
Oh, she was a big blonde job.

147
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,737
She was a nice cook too.

148
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,590
She worked for a doctor
in Gerrards Cross.

149
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:34,397
Used to sing that song, er 
I Kiss Your Little Hand, Madame.

150
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:36,921
I kiss your little hand, madame.

151
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:40,968
That's right and, of course,
she used to sing it in German, you know?

152
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:45,700
I kiss your hand, madame.

153
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,461
<i>She was always singing it,
I suppose because</i>

154
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,947
<i>she wasn't allowed to
sing it in Germany.</i>

155
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,954
<i>The composer was a Jew, I believe.</i>

156
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,523
What was your nurse like, Skipper?

157
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,382
Else? She was blonde too.

158
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,046
- <i>Was she a good cook?</i>
- She was good at everything.

159
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,717
My next nurse wasn't half so good.

160
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,009
You seem to specialise in nurses,
Skipper.

161
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,535
Well, I did then.
I was only two, you see.

162
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,396
Had you there, Geoff.

163
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:17,763
I'd seen snaps of her
in my father's album.

164
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:19,868
He was on the reparations commission.

165
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:23,248
Stuttgart was capital of Württemberg,
once a kingdom on its own.

166
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:28,134
That's right. The biggest paper there
is called the Württemberger Zeitung.

167
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,444
Liesel used to read it to me out loud.

168
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:35,038
Over Dutch coast.

169
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:03,492
Geoff, George, look out for fighters.

170
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,677
If my course is right,
we'll be getting some flak soon.

171
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:48,975
Your course seems all right, Frank.

172
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,897
Cologne's just come off the air.

173
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't blame her.

174
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,846
Railroad ahead.

175
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:51,609
Got it. Main line to Cologne.

176
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:55,931
I've travelled on that line
and I was going to Stuttgart.

177
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,168
Mannheim on our right.

178
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,048
Tom, give them some leaflets.

179
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,762
Okey-doke.

180
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,490
Give them the Ashley special.

181
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,013
It's good for you.

182
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,041
Hold the course, John,
over River Neckar.

183
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,990
John, do you see what I see?

184
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,361
Big fire, dead ahead.

185
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:31,521
We're in the wrong end, John.

186
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,106
Can I have a smack at the searchlight,
Skipper?

187
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:45,298
OK, give it a squirt or two.

188
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,575
Can I have a go too, Skipper?
No favouritism, you know.

189
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,379
<i>OK.</i>

190
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,966
Now who's in the wrong end?

191
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,289
Colleagues to witness fire.

192
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,250
Bet that's Queenie on the job.

193
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,669
And that'll be Tommy.

194
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,778
All right, do another circuit.

195
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:30,746
Bomb doors.

196
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,942
Bomb doors open.

197
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,026
OK, let's go down.

198
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:42,153
Going down.

199
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,587
4000.

200
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:50,978
3600.

201
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:56,735
Level out.

202
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:59,470
Steady.

203
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:00,999
Left, left.

204
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:15,097
Steady.

205
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,190
All bombs gone.

206
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:44,093
Shall I transmit, sir,
mission completed?

207
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:47,352
Crikey!

208
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,547
How about it, Tom?

209
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,496
Starboard engine's packed up.
Port's all right.

210
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,935
Hello, Bob. Intercoms working?

211
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,832
Yes, sir, radio's dead though.

212
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,638
George, everything organised?

213
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:14,185
- <i>You may get your hands full.</i>
- All right, Skipper.

214
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,572
We'll sort 'em out, won't we, George?

215
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,267
How about it, Bob?

216
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:22,192
Completely cheese, sir, all tubes blown.

217
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:24,664
How about cut out the corners, Frank?

218
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:27,143
All set. Shortest route over Mainz.

219
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,451
Alter course to 301, Johnny.

220
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,010
Bob, destroy your code signals.

221
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:41,141
I have, sir. They taste filthy.

222
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:43,847
Speed still dropping, only 90 now.

223
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,144
I'll try a steep dive.
Hang on, everybody.

224
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,437
It's no use, chaps.

225
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,741
We'll have to stooge home
on one engine.

226
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:01,252
At this rate, she may stall any minute.

227
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,713
Shall I get out and push?

228
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,081
<i>Where are we, Frank?</i>

229
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,290
Over Holland. Amersfoot.
Can you see a rail road?

230
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,586
I'm not sure. How about you, Tom?

231
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:13,799
Yes, I think so.

232
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:16,182
That's the main line
from Amersfoot to Hilversum.

233
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,468
Blast!
That's both engines packed up now.

234
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:29,718
We'll have to jump for it, boys.

235
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,495
- Geoff?
<i>- Here.</i>

236
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,432
- George?
<i>- Sir.</i>

237
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,289
- Frank? Bob? Tom?
- <i>- Okay. Yes. I'm here.</i>

238
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,716
Stand by to abandon aircraft.
Stand by to abandon aircraft.

239
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:49,771
Shall we chance it together or go solo?

240
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:51,602
- Together.
- <i>How?</i>

241
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:54,618
Bail out along the rail road,
Skipper's last to leave.

242
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:55,667
If he stays put,

243
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:57,653
and we all follow the rail road
northwest,

244
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,493
we're bound to find each other.

245
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,572
Tom, jump.

246
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:36,912
Frank, jump.

247
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,793
Geoff, jump.

248
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:02,632
George, jump.

249
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,708
Bob, jump.

250
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:45,326
What can you see?

251
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:46,661
The Zuider Zee.

252
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:48,779
Anything else?

253
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,699
Windmills.

254
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:56,691
Any soldiers?

255
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,061
No.

256
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:01,972
What's the country like?

257
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,012
Can you see far?

258
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:07,123
Yes, miles. Very flat.

259
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,852
What did you expect,
the mountains of Mourne?

260
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:26,817
No sign of him, then?

261
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,369
The Zuider Zee's no good to us.

262
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:31,324
How far is it to the North Sea?

263
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:32,868
About 38 miles.

264
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,200
That's not so bad.

265
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,366
- It's 38 miles too far in this make-up.
- Yes.

266
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:37,853
Clothes are the first thing to organise.

267
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,067
Then there's Bob.

268
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:40,658
It's too bad about Bob.

269
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,487
I'd rather it'd been John or Frank.

270
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:43,608
Oh, would you?

271
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:44,804
No offence, of course.

272
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,104
Anyone got a cigarette?

273
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:47,473
I know I haven't.

274
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:49,096
You have lived abroad, Skipper.

275
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,362
And I reckon
Frank's a first-class actor.

276
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:53,128
Sorry, last one.

277
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:55,870
A football pro
is used to travelling with his team.

278
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,566
Bob'll get lost on his own.

279
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,006
Let's face it. He is lost.

280
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:06,510
We want to watch things like that.

281
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,567
And we'd better keep down too.

282
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,875
Bob might turn up here.

283
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,820
Well, he's three hours overdue.

284
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:15,123
Got a match?

285
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,205
We've wasted enough time already.

286
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,927
John, you command in the air.

287
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:20,917
No reason why
you shouldn't command on the ground.

288
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,210
Why should anyone command?

289
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,672
Let's all have a say.

290
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,543
That won't work.

291
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:25,839
I take John's view.

292
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,292
Very well. What do you suggest?

293
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,567
Well... the first thing we've got
to do is to find Bob, obviously.

294
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:34,889
We can't let him down.

295
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:39,697
And then... Well, then
we make a plan of campaign.

296
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:42,601
Decide what to do and what not to do.

297
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:46,032
- Don't you agree, Tom?
- Hmm.

298
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:50,691
Then, uh  well, act accordingly.

299
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,070
Very astute.

300
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,627
Clear as mud.

301
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,424
Here. Come on down.

302
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,241
- I must say, Frank 
- Now, listen.

303
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,740
I've been lost dozens of times.

304
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:04,830
Sometimes alone or with other men.
Several times, a whole regiment.

305
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:06,036
So I know this much.

306
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,398
Either we separate here and now.
And it's each man for himself.

307
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,579
Or we stick together.
And somebody must command.

308
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:15,206
Who's for separating?

309
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:17,109
What are you for yourself, George?

310
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,642
I'll put another question.

311
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:21,573
Do we surrender
or do we try and get back home?

312
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:24,067
- Well, what do you think?
- Right.

313
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,174
Frank, you're navigator. Where are we?

314
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,055
I'd say somewhere... somewhere here.

315
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:40,461
There's Hilversum to the west.

316
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:42,670
Amsterdam and the Zuider Zee up there.

317
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:46,019
Now, we want to aim at a spot
somewhere south of Haarlem,

318
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:50,054
between Zandvoort and Katwijk.

319
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:51,910
But there's several main roads.

320
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,178
And the whose country's
swarming with people.

321
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,415
What's "polder" mean?

322
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:56,904
Land that's reclaimed. Dykes and dams.

323
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:59,199
It's nearly all polder country
south of Haarlem.

324
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:02,130
Tulip fields. Not on our course.

325
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:04,556
Pity about that, I like a nice tulip.

326
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:06,257
What are we going to
do about our clothes?

327
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,295
We've got to get into civvies somehow.

328
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,961
Well, what's George doing?

329
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,685
- Going swimming.
- Where?

330
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,562
- In the canal.
- How do you know there is one?

331
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,371
There's always a canal in Holland.

332
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,411
The next best thing to having
civilian clothes is to have none.

333
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:23,567
I'll be a swimming Dutchman
and spy out the land.

334
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,885
- Suppose you meet a real Dutchman.
- I'll explain with gestures.

335
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:27,111
Suppose it's a girl.

336
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:28,323
Can you speak Dutch?

337
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,213
- No.
- Well, I can.

338
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,305
- Well?
- Well enough. Diplomat's Dutch.

339
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,086
I think you're going to be
the swimming Dutchman, my lad.

340
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:40,230
Shh. Somebody coming, I think.

341
00:32:43,852 --> 00:32:46,185
Fikkie, Fikkie!

342
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:54,445
Fikkie, Fikkie!

343
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:57,322
- Hey, have you seen Fikkie?
- No!

344
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,079
Fikkie, Fikkie!

345
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,567
That dog spots us, we're jiggered.

346
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,961
Willem! Willem!

347
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:07,655
Stop them Willem, this way!

348
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,436
Fikkie! Fikkie! Fikkie!

349
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,389
Lie down. Get!

350
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,557
Shut up. Shut up.

351
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,650
Fikkie! Fikkie! Where's Fikkie?

352
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,764
Willem! Willem!

353
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,059
Maartje! Fikkie!

354
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,190
Fikkie! Fikkie!

355
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:29,270
Fikkie! Fikkie! Fikkie!

356
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,750
What are you barking at Fikkie?

357
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,752
Maartje, quick, come here!

358
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:45,217
Not... afraid... be.

359
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:47,343
No run away.

360
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,401
I...friends are... English.

361
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:52,288
RAF.

362
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:55,920
R-A-F.

363
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:58,664
R-A-F. R-A-F.

364
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:03,299
Royal Air Force!

365
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,607
Ja. Royal Air Force.

366
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:06,829
Are you friend?

367
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,362
Ya. Both friends.

368
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:10,567
It's all right. He says they're friends.

369
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:11,820
Let's go and talk to them.

370
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,450
I hope they don't scram before we go.

371
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,728
Is this the invasion of Holland?

372
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,413
He asked if we've come
to invade Holland.

373
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,330
What with?

374
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,827
Hello.

375
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,037
Hello, young fella.

376
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,925
We jumped out of our aeroplane.

377
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,772
Bailed out.

378
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:41,776
One, two, three, four...

379
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,751
five, six allies.

380
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,214
Six disparu.

381
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:48,651
That's French.

382
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:49,736
Well?

383
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:53,150
Johnny, over to you, over.

384
00:34:54,096 --> 00:35:00,377
Uh  lost one comrade  somewhere here.

385
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:03,074
Have you seen him?

386
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,584
How... Your names?

387
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:11,749
Willem, Maartie.

388
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,649
- Jannie.
- Hendrik.

389
00:35:14,184 --> 00:35:15,113
Jan.

390
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,039
Tom.

391
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,712
Geoff.

392
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,165
Frank.

393
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,661
George.

394
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:25,114
Safety pin. Safe!

395
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:31,610
Against dirty Krauts!
Against dirty Krauts!

396
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:35,080
Ja. Ik begrijp.

397
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:36,667
What's this safety pin gag?

398
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:38,897
It's a sign against
Germans and quislings.

399
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,696
A safety pin means keep together.
Keep your mouth shut.

400
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:47,020
Come along to the farm.
To Els Meertens, she speaks English.

401
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,350
There's someone at the farm
who speaks English.

402
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,053
Her name is Els...

403
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:54,145
Els... Els Meertens. Els Meertens.

404
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,858
- Els Meertens.
- Els Meertens.

405
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:58,974
- She's a schoolteacher.
- He says she's a schoolmarm.

406
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,796
Sounds a useful old bird.

407
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:02,566
Is this the invasion of Holland?

408
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:07,855
No, young fellow, we have not
come to invade Holland... yet.

409
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:10,221
I know that much Dutch already.

410
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,636
Kind of a debate going on in there,
I think.

411
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,500
Listen you. I'm telling you
they are English!

412
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,224
I've heard them speak.
And they wear English uniforms!

413
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,465
They're not Germans!

414
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,352
They're English, I'm telling you!

415
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:32,486
Miss Meertens.

416
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,829
I'll never put a ferret down
a rabbit hole again, I know that.

417
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,949
It's quite stuffy in here, isn't it?

418
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,020
I think it might be a trap.

419
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,408
I'm not so sure it isn't.

420
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,578
Must be 20 of them,
talking for the last half hour.

421
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:47,859
What about?
That's what I'd like to know.

422
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,256
Fetching Germans.
I wouldn't put it past 'em.

423
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:51,363
I would.

424
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:52,777
Would you, George? Why?

425
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:54,945
I've been watching the road
ever since we got here.

426
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:58,358
No one's left the house.

427
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:00,483
Shh.

428
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,676
Sorry, gentlemen,
to have kept you waiting.

429
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:28,131
I am Els Meertens,
schoolteacher from Emmen.

430
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:31,171
How do you do, Miss Meertens?

431
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:33,775
My name is John Glyn Haggard.
And these .

432
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:37,982
The identities of all five of you
are of the greatest importance to us.

433
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,205
But if you don't mind,
we prefer to check them for ourselves.

434
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,403
Excuse me, Miss Meertens.

435
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:45,163
But how do you propose to find out
if we don't choose to tell you?

436
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,184
I see you wear an identity bracelet.

437
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,335
I'm sure you can tell me
your friend's name.

438
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:02,892
Well? Can you or can't you?

439
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:05,673
Of course. I've known him a long time.

440
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,624
I didn't ask how long
you had known him.

441
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,747
What is his name?

442
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:13,678
He's Mr. Tom Earnshaw,
our second pilot, of course.

443
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:17,603
Right.

444
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,056
You jumped out of your aeroplane, why?

445
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:24,301
We didn't want to crash with it.

446
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,139
- Where did it crash?
- It didn't.

447
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,294
The engine picked up again
after we bailed out.

448
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,539
I don't know very much
about aeroplanes.

449
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:34,013
But that means you can't prove
your aircraft has crashed.

450
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:36,202
Well, that's it.
It might have gone on for miles.

451
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,477
Would it surprise you to know
that so far as is known,

452
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:42,811
no aircraft has crashed in West Holland
during the night?

453
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:45,814
I suppose Bertie
could have reached the sea.

454
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:46,966
What do you say, John?

455
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,289
Don't ask me. Your witness.

456
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,834
- Where are your parachutes?
- We buried them.

457
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:52,915
All five?

458
00:38:52,983 --> 00:38:54,355
Five are all we know about.

459
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:55,845
What do you mean by that?

460
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,928
There were six in my crew.

461
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:59,383
You are captain?

462
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:01,565
Yes.

463
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,194
Where is the sixth man?

464
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,148
I don't know. We never found him.

465
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,630
I see.

466
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,338
And where did you bury your parachutes?

467
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,906
- Look here, I've had enough of 
- You don't know?

468
00:39:11,907 --> 00:39:14,636
Of course I know.
Along the rail road where we landed.

469
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:18,692
Can any of you prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

470
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:21,127
that you are what you say you are?

471
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,596
I'll be jiggered. I've never heard
such a thing in my life.

472
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:25,913
- But our uniforms 
- Prove nothing.

473
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:26,926
Why not?

474
00:39:26,953 --> 00:39:28,512
Anybody could get a uniform.

475
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,498
If some people were anxious
to find out

476
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:34,169
how we were to behave
towards English airmen,

477
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,382
wouldn't that be the simplest way?

478
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:40,962
You mean you think we've come here
to get you to give yourselves away?

479
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,176
But we're Englishmen.

480
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:45,347
We wouldn't do a thing
like that, would we, Frank?

481
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,638
You're not so sure about the others?

482
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,323
What are you trying to make me say?

483
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,140
Of course I'm sure.

484
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,246
What is the name of this gentleman?

485
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:56,316
Go on, George.

486
00:39:56,342 --> 00:39:58,134
This is Frank Shelley. He's an actor.

487
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,682
And his wife is to broadcast tonight.

488
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:03,392
9:40, Home and Forces Programme.

489
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:06,058
Frank, yesterday afternoon,
contrary to most regulations,

490
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:07,931
I saw you tearing
the last piece out of the Times.

491
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:08,861
You got it on you?

492
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:11,583
I think that's the sort of proof
Miss Meertens wants.

493
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:13,015
Here you are.

494
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:17,335
"Broadcasting, Home and Forces
Programme, Sunday 9:40..."

495
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:18,656
That's tonight.

496
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,529
"Hazel Mason..." That's my wife.

497
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,925
There's the date and there's
the date on the newspaper.

498
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:34,351
Yes, this is yesterday's Times.

499
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,796
Your witness.

500
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:38,840
Does that satisfy you, Miss Meertens?

501
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,117
It will do, I think.

502
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:43,245
I'm going to show it to the others.

503
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,828
You're not the only one
that had their doubts.

504
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:49,315
Not the only one?

505
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,766
No, there's nothing to stop you
sending for the Nazis.

506
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:57,269
I thought airmen
had better eyesight than that.

507
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:05,300
- What a gal.
- You say that again.

508
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,736
She shot you down in flames, Tom.

509
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:08,564
What did she mean
by that crack about our eyesight?

510
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,361
- Something we missed... in this room.
- Let's find it.

511
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,999
- Orange blossom.
- Orange blossom?

512
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,541
What's orange blossom got do with it?

513
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,996
That's their Orange altar,

514
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:19,502
Orange altar to honour Queen Wilhemina.

515
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,751
But why orange?

516
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:23,779
William of Orange, the House of Orange.
It shows they're loyal.

517
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:26,308
There should be
a picture of the queen too.

518
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,994
There it is.

519
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,954
Quite foxy. That Els Meertens.
What a girl.

520
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,282
We heard you the first time.

521
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:37,474
Gentlemen.

522
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:39,705
Won't you come in?

523
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:41,866
Thank you.

524
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:48,703
Pieter Sluys, your host, gentlemen.

525
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:54,611
Well, dear fellows.
I'll say it in my own language

526
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,972
I'm very glad you're here with us.

527
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,932
Together with all our friends.

528
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,752
And I'd like to give you
a warm welcome here.

529
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:04,472
Come on, John.

530
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,377
Ahem.

531
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,610
I, my friends... uh 

532
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:12,737
very happy.

533
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,630
I, all friends.

534
00:42:17,584 --> 00:42:19,220
Allies are...

535
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,823
so I say...

536
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:28,155
I always thought
speeches came at the end of a meal.

537
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:31,213
Wouldn't mind a little bit
of that ham anyway.

538
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:33,256
They're hungry!

539
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,680
Of course, let them sit down.

540
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,525
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.

541
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:48,300
This is very good of you but aren't
you short of food yourselves?

542
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:51,551
Sometimes. But don't worry.
We have enough for our friends.

543
00:42:51,553 --> 00:42:54,210
It was a Kraut pig, butchered illegally.

544
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:58,643
He says, "Don't worry, eat him.
He was a quisling pig."

545
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:05,065
Would you like some Schnapps?

546
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,170
- Thank you.
- Very nice!

547
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,590
Thank you.

548
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:16,640
Gesundheit.

549
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,603
Very nice.

550
00:43:39,456 --> 00:43:42,168
We are worried about
your comrade who is lost.

551
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,297
So are we, miss.

552
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,206
Bob's brains are in his feet.

553
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:46,170
In his feet?

554
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:47,977
Bob's a football player.
A very good one.

555
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,451
But not very bright.

556
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,169
Still it's a pity his brains
are not in his head.

557
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:55,241
If he's found, the Germans
are going to look for you five.

558
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:57,775
Burying the parachutes was a mistake.

559
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,750
Freshly-dug earth will be examined.

560
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:01,132
Can't we send someone
to dig them up again?

561
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:02,229
We have already.

562
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:03,669
And we will hide them.

563
00:44:03,695 --> 00:44:05,243
This time in a safer place.

564
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:08,051
You know, young lady, you've got
your head screwed on all right.

565
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:09,819
Thank you.

566
00:44:10,705 --> 00:44:12,566
The main thing is your escape.

567
00:44:12,836 --> 00:44:14,130
Any ideas?

568
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,569
You agree that we can escape?

569
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,430
Others have done it. Why not you?

570
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,142
First we must get to the sea.

571
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:21,271
The sea is 58 kilometres away.

572
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:23,114
And every village has its German post.

573
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,333
And every road is patrolled.

574
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,917
First we must get you to church.

575
00:44:27,944 --> 00:44:29,000
Why church?

576
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:32,297
Our church is ten kilometres
west of here.

577
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,107
Ten kilometres nearer the North Sea.

578
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:37,028
You must go at once.

579
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,920
Excuse me, Miss Meertens,
what is your church?

580
00:44:41,385 --> 00:44:42,819
We are Catholics.

581
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:46,702
I'm chapel.

582
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:48,924
So am I.

583
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,584
What is chapel?

584
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:53,295
- Independent Methodist.
- Baptist.

585
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,965
Those are your English Reform churches?

586
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:57,515
That's it.

587
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:00,574
But it's our only plan.

588
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:03,919
If this gets back to Halifax,
I shall never hear the last of it.

589
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,926
We will dress you in Dutch clothes.

590
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:09,124
Nobody will know.

591
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:11,060
You don't know chapel folk.

592
00:45:11,314 --> 00:45:14,143
But surely your escape
is the most important thing.

593
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:19,000
End justifies the means, Tom.

594
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:20,143
Then that's settled.

595
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:22,272
Would it be safer to travel at night?

596
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:24,090
We'd be at the coast in three days.

597
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,186
By our plan, you will be
at the coast tonight.

598
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,806
Jo will be waiting for you.

599
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:29,693
Jo? Who's Jo?

600
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:32,099
Jo de Vries,
the wife of Hendrik de Vries.

601
00:45:32,411 --> 00:45:34,241
Oh? Who's Hendrik de Vries?

602
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,409
Hendrik de Vries was
killed by the British

603
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:38,443
in the mass air attacks on Haarlem.

604
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:42,535
Since then his wife hates the British
more than anything in the world.

605
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:44,686
Not a very good choice for a hostess.

606
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,391
What is this, a conundrum?

607
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:47,874
I never heard that we bombed Haarlem.

608
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:49,678
The Germans want us to believe it.

609
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,904
So Jo de Vries obliges them.

610
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:55,438
They like her because
they believe she hates the British.

611
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:58,069
That is what she wants.

612
00:45:58,574 --> 00:45:59,861
So everyone is happy.

613
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:01,686
Oh, I see, a bit of camouflage.

614
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:04,038
Yes. We have our own ways
of managing things.

615
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,079
Did you hear our motto?

616
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,549
Who harms the water, the water turns.

617
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:12,049
No?

618
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:14,444
It means the sea is a common enemy.

619
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,150
And against a common enemy
one must unite.

620
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,225
Do you think we Hollanders

621
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:22,340
who threw the sea out of our country
will let the Germans have it?

622
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,923
Better the sea.

623
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,520
Can you all ride a bicycle?

624
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:33,191
Well, I'm not much of a hand
at a bike myself. I never was.

625
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:34,232
We will find a way.

626
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:36,288
But first we must
find you all clothes.

627
00:46:36,403 --> 00:46:37,774
Better keep our uniforms on.

628
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,487
Gives us a sporting chance
if we're caught.

629
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:41,625
You can wear your disguises over them.

630
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:45,927
If we're going to be pushing off,
I would like more ham, Mother.

631
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,925
Ham, natuurlijk.

632
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:50,536
Talking of ham, Frank,
isn't this is your big chance?

633
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:51,986
What disguise will you wear?

634
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:55,291
You're going to see a series
of perfect Dutch character sketches.

635
00:46:55,403 --> 00:46:57,035
Real little cameos.

636
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:59,663
But er... what do we do for boots?

637
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:01,202
Klompen.

638
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:04,088
- Klompen?
- Clogs.

639
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:07,161
Ah, clogs.

640
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:25,153
I should like to see you walk up
Halifax High Street in these, Tom.

641
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:29,310
The old Yorkshire saying,
"Clogs to clogs in three generations."

642
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,992
I never hoped to co-star with the great
Francis Shelley in a Dutch epic.

643
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:36,771
Now, George, you're doing quite well,
really, quite well.

644
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:40,281
But co-star? Really?

645
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:44,337
George, I haven't been
to church since my wedding.

646
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,059
You must have acted in church scenes.

647
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:47,345
I did in a picture once.

648
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:48,758
It was a spy story
and we all got shot.

649
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,658
That can happen here too.

650
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,941
"Peter Sluijs, Landweert"

651
00:47:57,198 --> 00:48:00,890
"his family and landworkers..."

652
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,759
"all of the Roman-Catholic faith..."

653
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,913
"to visit the Roman-Catholic church..."

654
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:10,576
"In Oud Losdr... er... Loosdrecht.."

655
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:20,998
The next one.

656
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:50,581
How am I doing?

657
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:51,773
Quite well.

658
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:53,890
For a beginner.

659
00:49:22,787 --> 00:49:24,416
Noisy beggars, aren't they?

660
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,851
I wonder why he's in such
a tearing hurry for on a Sunday morning.

661
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,489
Probably going on leave.

662
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:31,534
Anything wrong?

663
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,663
Germans found one of your parachutes.

664
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,556
But you dug them up.
I thought they were safe.

665
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:37,803
They are. Very safe.

666
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:40,276
Then it must be another one.

667
00:50:41,316 --> 00:50:42,614
George.

668
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,856
The Jerries have found
another parachute. It must be Bob's.

669
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,117
Found Bob's parachute.

670
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:49,739
Bob's parachute's found.

671
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:52,048
That means Bob's safe.

672
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,165
Not so good for us.

673
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,616
It's us the armoured cars
are looking for.

674
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:59,078
Els says they're searching villages
in the neighbourhood.

675
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,225
So long as they don't find
our parachutes, we're safe.

676
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:05,026
- Where are they hidden?
- Where are they hidden?

677
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:06,744
Where are they hidden?

678
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:10,076
She says that they're quite safe
and they're with us in here.

679
00:51:12,704 --> 00:51:14,717
What are you talking about?

680
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:16,187
Shh.

681
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,820
The 12th Sunday after Whitsunday.

682
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,076
Regular service.

683
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:26,665
At 10 a.m., High Mass.

684
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,553
Block all exits!

685
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:47,372
- Officer Kahle?
- Yes!

686
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,741
Ten men at west exits 1 and 2!

687
00:51:49,742 --> 00:51:50,657
Yes!

688
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:55,339
- Officer Weber!
- Yes!

689
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:58,475
- Ten men to block exits 3 and 4!
- Yes!

690
00:52:00,972 --> 00:52:02,504
Let us pray.

691
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:13,108
From the depths,
I have cried out to you, O Lord!

692
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:16,334
Lord, hear my voice.

693
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:19,832
Let your ears be attentive

694
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,994
to the voice of my supplication.

695
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:29,029
If you were to mark iniquities, Lord,

696
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,540
who, O Lord, shall stand?

697
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,362
For with you is forgiveness.

698
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:39,486
And because of your law,
I stood by you, Lord.

699
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:44,931
My soul has stood by his word.

700
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,521
My soul has hoped in the Lord.

701
00:52:49,028 --> 00:52:53,080
From the morning watch,
even until night,

702
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:56,344
let Israel hope in the Lord.

703
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:58,099
Parachute.

704
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:01,271
For with the Lord, there is mercy.

705
00:53:01,618 --> 00:53:05,629
And with him is plenteous redemption.

706
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:08,939
And he will redeem Israel

707
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,695
from all his iniquities.

708
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:18,558
Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.

709
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:31,424
Our national anthem.

710
00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:22,545
Fall in!

711
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,243
"Cornelis Ackerman,."

712
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:50,844
"Pastor
of the Roman-Catholic community..."

713
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:55,458
"Along with his family,
5 male, 3 female."

714
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:57,575
"The town of Vinkeveen."

715
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,783
Well, enjoy yourself, Mr. Pastor!

716
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:05,469
Where has Cornelis gone?!

717
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:06,957
Where is that rascal?!

718
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:10,493
How should I know?
He's your son. He won't listen to me.

719
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,792
Cornelis, my young brother,
always in trouble.

720
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:15,402
Same in England.

721
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,099
Same everywhere.

722
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:20,903
I've got a young brother, you know.
Regular little devil.

723
00:55:20,997 --> 00:55:23,008
English boys not as bad as Dutch.

724
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,897
You see the school?

725
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:28,702
German military post, 20 soldiers.

726
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:30,957
Boys love to tease the sentries.

727
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:34,209
They line up on the wall and sing,
"Eenie meanie, minie, mo,"

728
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,623
"catch a German by his toe..."

729
00:55:40,556 --> 00:55:41,832
Cornelis?

730
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:44,158
What's he doing at the post?

731
00:55:49,158 --> 00:55:51,733
Now he's in for a spanking!

732
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:54,254
He won't know his left from his right!

733
00:55:54,255 --> 00:55:55,842
Marius,
you're not going to hit that boy!

734
00:55:55,843 --> 00:55:57,549
Why not?

735
00:55:57,712 --> 00:55:59,218
What's he doing at that post?

736
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:03,909
Didn't you know what time it was?

737
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,905
Don't you know we eat at half past one?

738
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:08,443
Shame on you for
our visitors from Loosdrecht.

739
00:56:08,444 --> 00:56:10,271
Now up to your room!

740
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:12,704
And get ready for a spanking!

741
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:16,441
If you put the plates on the table,
I'll bring the meat.

742
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:21,151
Everyone, please be seated.

743
00:56:34,678 --> 00:56:36,924
Father,
will you please give your blessing?

744
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:40,302
Well, did you hear that? De Jong.

745
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:45,651
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

746
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,355
De Jong is a quisling.

747
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,493
I am ashamed to speak so
of a man of my village but it is true.

748
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:54,210
He is a traitor, paid by the Nazis.

749
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,517
He is always trying to persuade us

750
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,906
to fraternise
with the soldiers at the post.

751
00:56:58,973 --> 00:57:02,038
And now he has sent them
gramophone records to play.

752
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:05,481
And my son has carried them! My son!

753
00:57:05,828 --> 00:57:07,716
We are all trying
o bore them to death.

754
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:10,213
And my son carries them
gramophone records.

755
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,135
And from that traitor de Jong!

756
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,146
No food for Cornelis.

757
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,955
And no football match!

758
00:57:16,024 --> 00:57:17,439
No dinner for Cornelis.

759
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,939
Father says he must not
go to the football match.

760
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,255
Poor Cornelis. He loves the football.

761
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,698
All week he's been so excited.

762
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:29,763
I think something very...
how do you say... buried?

763
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:32,516
- Dug in?
- More than meets the eye.

764
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:35,354
Ja. Very good.
More than meets Father's eye.

765
00:57:35,355 --> 00:57:38,612
Poor Cornelis. He's very bad
but very cute.

766
00:57:38,698 --> 00:57:41,325
He has more than meets the eye.

767
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:44,047
A quarter Guilder.

768
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:45,279
Oh.

769
00:57:45,386 --> 00:57:46,516
Now, who's there?

770
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,474
Sientje, I am not available!

771
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:51,507
A quarter guilder!

772
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:54,328
Paid that quisling
by the stinking Germans.

773
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:58,566
That's what my son pockets for helping
to entertain German soldiers.

774
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:03,161
It's Mr. De Jong, asking for Cornelis.

775
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,159
De Jong?

776
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:08,368
Tell him we have visitors.
And we cannot be disturbed!

777
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:11,645
I have a reception, I have visitors,
You have to se

778
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,772
I apologize for interrupting.

779
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:20,006
I'm truly sorry.

780
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,451
And at such
a spiritual gathering as that,

781
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:27,450
I would have liked to see Cornelis,
Mr. Mayor.

782
00:58:27,451 --> 00:58:29,215
But some other time is fine as well.

783
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,243
Oh, Reverend.

784
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:33,923
I nearly didn't see you there.

785
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:36,663
How is your family in Loosdrecht?

786
00:58:37,123 --> 00:58:38,602
Do you remember me?

787
00:58:38,738 --> 00:58:39,860
Yes.

788
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:41,535
I know you.

789
00:58:44,203 --> 00:58:46,053
I remember our schooldays.

790
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:47,966
Like it was yesterday.

791
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,545
And is this your fiancé?

792
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,377
Let me introduce.

793
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:56,718
This is my nephew Kees Jansen,
and this is Julius de Jong.

794
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:06,210
So...

795
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:08,768
You'd rather not speak with me?

796
00:59:08,915 --> 00:59:11,818
Don't you see what would happen

797
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:15,628
if everyone in Holland
would behave like this?

798
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:18,865
The Germans want to be friends.

799
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,134
Bon appetit!

800
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,099
Get out of the way!

801
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,740
Do you speak English?

802
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:28,536
Yes.

803
00:59:28,537 --> 00:59:30,014
Then don't shout.

804
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:31,249
You wouldn't dare to keep me here.

805
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,748
Dare? Huh, you're kept.

806
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:36,729
You, you, all of you.

807
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,075
You're British airmen.
The men we're looking for.

808
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,992
You're risking your head.

809
00:59:40,993 --> 00:59:42,102
It's nothing to do
with the burgermeister.

810
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:43,476
He'll be shot before he can prove it.

811
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:44,808
Talking of shooting...

812
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,639
You wouldn't dare fire here.

813
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:50,789
Wouldn't we?

814
01:00:00,637 --> 01:00:02,070
The Wilhelmus!

815
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:04,019
Our anthem!

816
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,480
It comes from the post, from the Nazis.

817
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:09,117
Hey! Oh!

818
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:14,485
What is it, the radio?

819
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,516
Sounds more like a gramophone to me.

820
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:19,332
Dear Lord! Have you all gone insane?

821
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:21,576
It is a gramophone!

822
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:22,938
What's on!

823
01:00:22,939 --> 01:00:24,362
You're keeping the gramophone on.

824
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:26,782
You're playing the Dutch anthem!
You idiot!

825
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:29,090
Why not play the English anthem as well?

826
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:30,571
What record is it anyway?

827
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:31,554
A tango, lieutenant, sir!

828
01:00:31,555 --> 01:00:32,413
Give it here!

829
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:34,596
Father, isn't it strange?

830
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:38,062
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

831
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,155
Perhaps it's not so strange.

832
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:52,964
I don't understand.

833
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:56,385
Yes, but I do.

834
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,150
Your German friends at the post

835
01:00:58,151 --> 01:01:00,619
asked you to send them
some gramophone records, didn't they?

836
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:04,326
And you chose my son for the honour
of carrying them, didn't you?

837
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,644
And you gave him a quarter
for doing it, didn't you?

838
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:11,172
Ah. Ky son.

839
01:01:11,173 --> 01:01:14,447
Well, he changed
all your records for ours.

840
01:01:14,448 --> 01:01:16,852
And he chose some good ones too.
Trust him.

841
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:19,564
All records of our national anthem.

842
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,480
All different labels, foxtrots, tangos.

843
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,572
All pasted on so the Germans
wouldn't know what they were.

844
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:31,079
Oh, your friends will like you now,
won't they, quisling?

845
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:43,268
- Where are the records from?
- De Jong brought them...

846
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:44,892
De Jong!

847
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:46,791
De Jong!

848
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:48,829
They won't think it's me.

849
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,424
Why should they?

850
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:51,832
Why shouldn't they? That's the point.

851
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:52,942
If I was a German, I'd say,

852
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:55,452
"De Jong sent records.
He didn't bring them himself."

853
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:57,170
"They turned out to
be the Dutch anthem."

854
01:01:57,177 --> 01:01:58,388
"Very funny joke."

855
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,174
"Let's look for de Jong."

856
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,861
And there they go, looking 

857
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,215
with fixed bayonets!

858
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:09,102
Your move, my Jong.

859
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,139
They'll believe me
if I tell the truth.

860
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:14,641
You'll be shot before you can prove
it, my lad. Said so yourself.

861
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:17,479
Shot? They can't shoot me.

862
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,882
Can and will.

863
01:02:19,814 --> 01:02:21,414
Well, it really doesn't matter.

864
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:24,203
Either we shoot you now.
Or they shoot you later.

865
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:27,874
Shot? I won't be shot!

866
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:30,801
Father! Help me!

867
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:32,205
Tell me what to do!

868
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,147
They'll be after me if they
don't find me at home.

869
01:02:34,148 --> 01:02:36,271
Evidently you know your friends.

870
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:39,171
You don't think they'll believe you
if you tell the truth.

871
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,305
They believe everyone in Holland
wants to kill them.

872
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:44,613
They will shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

873
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:48,988
You are a servant of God!

874
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,315
You can't let them kill me!

875
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:52,951
You expect God to help you escape.

876
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:55,886
But I think you were meant
to fall into our hands.

877
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:03,404
"Piet van Dieren."

878
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,883
"Mayor of Vinkeveen."

879
01:03:05,884 --> 01:03:10,453
"Along with his family and guests,
6 male, 3 female..."

880
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:14,026
"to visit the football game
in IJmuiden."

881
01:03:14,745 --> 01:03:16,928
That's all fine, Herr Mayor.

882
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:20,912
Fasten us up!

883
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:24,083
Use your paws!

884
01:04:10,474 --> 01:04:13,425
If you bring the plates to the table,
I'll take care of the meat.

885
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,973
<i>Achtung! Achtung!</i>

886
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:21,396
The occupation authorities allow
only 200 spectators.

887
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:25,541
Fifty must leave the grounds
immediately!

888
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:27,268
- What's he say?
- What's Jerry say?

889
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,410
"The authorities of occupation have
to the number 200 of the crowd limited."

890
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,903
"Fifty must leave the football field
at once."

891
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:36,798
A fine cheek, ordering
other people about.

892
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:39,171
What will the people
do, Mr Burgomaster?

893
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:40,607
What would you do in your own country?

894
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:42,422
In North Yorkshire?
Tell 'em to go to hell.

895
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:44,899
- That would cause trouble.
- It would that.

896
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:46,809
Many people might be killed or injured.

897
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:48,054
On both sides.

898
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:49,792
In Holland, we've found a new system.

899
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:52,591
If 50 are ordered to go, we all go.

900
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,290
Come along.

901
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,070
But isn't that playing their game?

902
01:04:58,071 --> 01:04:59,402
You don't understand Germans.

903
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:00,925
They have orderly minds.

904
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:03,637
If they say 50, they mean 50.

905
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,100
<i>Achtung! Achtung!</i>

906
01:05:05,178 --> 01:05:08,777
It's also forbidden to
leave the grounds completely!

907
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:13,071
"As you were, it is usually forbidden
that everybody should leave."

908
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:16,884
"Cancel the previous order and
continue to enjoy the game, please."

909
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:23,661
Jerry seems a bit flustered.

910
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,453
Now we get on with the football.

911
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:42,315
There you are, you see? Dead easy.

912
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,872
Bob Ashley.

913
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:47,185
There's Bob!

914
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:49,699
It is Bob!

915
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:51,097
Well, I'll be jiggered.

916
01:05:52,017 --> 01:05:54,060
Hurray! What's he Dutch for hurray?

917
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:57,287
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah!

918
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:01,012
"Jo de Vries, living in Katwijk."

919
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:02,888
Ah, you live in Katwijk.

920
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:06,276
"Or every person, sent by the above."

921
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:09,779
"For the purpose
of seizing meat and vegetables..."

922
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,430
Ah, and so on, and so on..

923
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,642
"For the officers mess in Katwijk."

924
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:16,664
Leijmuiden.

925
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,317
Permission!

926
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:37,273
You strolled around
with your hands in your pockets

927
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:39,585
speaking broad English
and pushing men in canals.

928
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:41,198
They shouldn't have got in a flap.

929
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,612
Then you ran away,
leaving your parachute in a canal.

930
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:45,556
It was time to get cracking, sir.

931
01:06:45,582 --> 01:06:47,246
I came back later but
I couldn't find it.

932
01:06:47,247 --> 01:06:49,291
- The Germans had it by then.
- Did they?

933
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:53,302
I don't understand how you could
walk along without Geoff spotting you.

934
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:55,820
I don't either. Perhaps he was asleep.

935
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:57,553
I certainly wasn't.

936
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:59,783
Did you see a train about 6:30?

937
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:02,408
Oh, yes, sir, it overtook me. I hid.

938
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,059
Overtook you?

939
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:07,057
You were walking the
wrong way, my lad.

940
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:09,482
Walking into Germany
instead of England.

941
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:11,207
- Oh.
- Then you met a shepherd.

942
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:13,410
- Whose dog naturally bit you.
- Yes, that's right.

943
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:14,456
Then they took me to the village,

944
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:16,828
where thank God
the schoolteacher spoke English.

945
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:18,798
Schoolteacher? What was she like?

946
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,006
OK. That's where I had me breakfast.

947
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:23,948
And then they passed you along
by barge and ox cart .

948
01:07:24,038 --> 01:07:25,666
- Bicycle.
- And what have you.

949
01:07:25,752 --> 01:07:27,612
Until you find yourself
on the way to a football match.

950
01:07:27,613 --> 01:07:28,785
And turn into a ball-basher.

951
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,853
- And they said, "Good gracious".
- That's right.

952
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:34,940
They told me a truck would take me
after the game to some man called Joe.

953
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,481
Not Joe, Jo.

954
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:39,281
It's a woman, not a man,
otherwise you're all right.

955
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:41,238
Her name is Jo de Vries.

956
01:07:41,884 --> 01:07:43,397
Half a minute.

957
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:48,348
I smell the sea.

958
01:07:48,374 --> 01:07:49,837
The North Sea.

959
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:16,157
- Hear that?
- German.

960
01:08:16,168 --> 01:08:17,291
How do you know it's German?

961
01:08:17,316 --> 01:08:19,798
Heard 'em often enough
in the last war.

962
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,121
Hope Mrs. de Vries
has her weather eye open.

963
01:08:36,052 --> 01:08:37,596
Halt! Stop there!

964
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,911
I am a chauffeur from Jo de Vries.

965
01:08:46,073 --> 01:08:47,543
What do you carry in the truck?!

966
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:50,019
Three calves, sir, and vegetables.

967
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,315
I'll check myself. Show me!

968
01:08:54,892 --> 01:08:57,138
- Lieutenant Buder?
- Here!

969
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,065
You won't have veal tomorrow,
if the guard won't let him pass.

970
01:09:01,662 --> 01:09:05,304
- Alright. Guard, let him pass!
- Yes sir, lieutenant!

971
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,032
Pass!

972
01:09:14,307 --> 01:09:18,145
Said tomorrow's dinner would be
held up if he didn't let us get through.

973
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:21,158
- Would that be Mrs de Vries?
- I suppose so.

974
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:29,779
- Willem, it's all there?
- Yes, madam.

975
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:32,850
Are you there?

976
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:37,058
Englishmen, are you there?

977
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:38,482
Yes, all six of us.

978
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:40,961
When the truck stops, the driver
will open the back.

979
01:09:40,962 --> 01:09:42,336
Get out at once.

980
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:10,951
- Which way?
- There.

981
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:21,615
Officer Neuser?

982
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:25,862
At your command!

983
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:28,172
Can I have two men for unloading?

984
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:29,261
Of course, madam De Vries.

985
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:30,300
Thank you.

986
01:10:30,877 --> 01:10:32,157
Two men!

987
01:10:34,588 --> 01:10:37,405
She's getting the Jerries
to unload the truck for her.

988
01:10:37,406 --> 01:10:38,940
She's a cool customer.

989
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,009
These Dutch girls are wizards.

990
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:44,293
They are. Our girls would do just
the same if they had the chance.

991
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:46,777
They should have been here already.

992
01:10:46,777 --> 01:10:49,208
Yeah, but they've wasted their time

993
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:51,672
with drinking all night.

994
01:10:52,468 --> 01:10:55,158
Hey, come down here.

995
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:58,126
Or you'll be wasting a fine Goulash.

996
01:10:58,127 --> 01:10:59,894
Boy, oh boy!

997
01:11:00,073 --> 01:11:02,165
Quite a load you got there.

998
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:05,226
Enough to wear you out, ha ha ha!

999
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:34,316
Morning we're marching off

1000
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:37,987
to the farm in the night-time loft.

1001
01:11:37,988 --> 01:11:40,035
A cup of tea.

1002
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:41,800
Sugar and coffee.

1003
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:43,656
A cup of tea.

1004
01:11:43,657 --> 01:11:45,177
Sugar and coffee.

1005
01:11:45,178 --> 01:11:48,877
And a glass of wine.

1006
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,145
And a glass of wine.

1007
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:57,002
Morning we're marching off

1008
01:11:57,232 --> 01:12:00,756
to the farm in the night-time loft.

1009
01:12:00,986 --> 01:12:02,823
A cup of tea.

1010
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:04,598
Sugar and coffee.

1011
01:12:04,599 --> 01:12:06,566
A cup of tea.

1012
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:07,971
Sugar and coffee.

1013
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:11,564
And a glass of wine.

1014
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:15,975
And a glass of wine.

1015
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:26,705
We're passing over
the quarters of 200 German soldiers.

1016
01:12:40,016 --> 01:12:41,208
Louis?

1017
01:12:52,143 --> 01:12:54,622
All safe, madam De Vries.

1018
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:56,260
Good. All six are here.

1019
01:13:14,879 --> 01:13:18,335
We're over my house.
It's the German headquarters.

1020
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,596
My rooms are at the end of the wing.

1021
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,911
All of you, in the other room.

1022
01:14:00,288 --> 01:14:02,118
Take it easy.

1023
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:27,698
You are safe here.

1024
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:29,959
This place has good walls and floors.

1025
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,045
You can talk as much as you want to.
And you can take off those things.

1026
01:14:33,757 --> 01:14:35,667
There's a radio here.

1027
01:14:38,347 --> 01:14:40,390
It's tuned in to the BBC.

1028
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,690
Use it if you like.

1029
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:48,024
Only don't start dancing.

1030
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:50,333
Just below here is the officers' mess.

1031
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,728
I must leave you now.

1032
01:14:52,729 --> 01:14:55,676
Got to go back the way we came
and come in by the front door.

1033
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:57,871
Or they might start thinking.

1034
01:14:58,029 --> 01:14:59,504
Lock the door behind me.

1035
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:01,221
And only open it to this knock.

1036
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:05,169
- V.
- Yes. V.

1037
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:10,354
- Pity, isn't it?
- What's a pity?

1038
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:12,007
I never felt
more like dancing in my life.

1039
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:14,095
Just imagine, officers' mess below.

1040
01:15:14,096 --> 01:15:16,146
Jerries all over the place
and no dancing.

1041
01:15:16,752 --> 01:15:18,694
Such charming partners too.

1042
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:21,011
- What time is it?
- 2150.

1043
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,727
Pity. We've missed the news.

1044
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:25,421
- What time did you you say it was?
- 2156.

1045
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:27,527
- Hazel!
- Who?

1046
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:30,254
Hazel Mason,
Home and Forces Programme.

1047
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,047
Oh, your wife.

1048
01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:33,205
I thought I recognised the voice.

1049
01:15:41,582 --> 01:15:43,100
Steady, steady.

1050
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:47,150
Something's wrong.

1051
01:15:49,026 --> 01:15:50,328
That's better.

1052
01:15:55,553 --> 01:15:56,985
She's good.

1053
01:15:58,687 --> 01:15:59,941
She's damned good.

1054
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:03,003
I hope your wife won't object to us
undressing during her big scene.

1055
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,419
If she knew where you were,
she'd twitter.

1056
01:16:05,445 --> 01:16:06,782
Shh.

1057
01:16:15,512 --> 01:16:16,792
All over.

1058
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:18,181
How was she?

1059
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,143
Not bad. Not at all bad.

1060
01:16:20,235 --> 01:16:21,490
Yes.

1061
01:16:22,217 --> 01:16:23,532
Very good.

1062
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:26,181
I hadn't thought about it till now.
But .

1063
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,142
We'll have been posted missing
since this morning.

1064
01:16:28,175 --> 01:16:29,801
Matter of act, I had thought of it.

1065
01:16:29,828 --> 01:16:31,252
But I don't think the others have.

1066
01:16:31,268 --> 01:16:32,734
All the better for them.

1067
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:35,276
I suppose Hazel knows
about Frank by now.

1068
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,493
Bound to. They'd get it at the BBC.

1069
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,077
She's on tonight.

1070
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:41,018
Where do you expect her to be, off?

1071
01:16:50,786 --> 01:16:52,413
Good blackout they got here.

1072
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:55,377
You know, that's funny.

1073
01:16:55,742 --> 01:16:57,825
Them blacking out because of us.

1074
01:16:59,253 --> 01:17:01,349
I suppose we do fly over here,
eh, Frank?

1075
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,204
What, Katwijk? Yes, often.

1076
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,182
It feels like the end of a long term
with a cheap supporting cast.

1077
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:11,609
No good looking in there
for small change, my boy.

1078
01:17:12,476 --> 01:17:14,327
You know, that's very significant.

1079
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:17,148
Five of these woolens
are German to one British.

1080
01:17:17,441 --> 01:17:19,537
Might be something
in that after the war.

1081
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,668
To drive Yorkshire woolens
through Holland.

1082
01:17:21,695 --> 01:17:23,119
They might go for it in a big way.

1083
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:24,796
Don't let anybody know I said so.

1084
01:17:24,888 --> 01:17:27,535
I don't promise. I never talk about
anything but woolens.

1085
01:17:27,536 --> 01:17:29,071
I can't cure myself of it.

1086
01:17:29,152 --> 01:17:30,912
What's funny about woolens?

1087
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:32,518
All right, don't get excited.

1088
01:17:32,576 --> 01:17:35,562
Which should the world know more about,
British actors or British cloth?

1089
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,475
Now, let me see you all.

1090
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:11,779
- Frau de Vries, may I introduce 
- No, you may not.

1091
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:13,908
I shall forget your names anyway.

1092
01:18:13,996 --> 01:18:16,788
- Well, you don't mind us thanking you?
- No.

1093
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,143
Why did you do that?

1094
01:18:23,144 --> 01:18:24,308
I don't know.

1095
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,938
I was thinking of my own wife.

1096
01:18:27,657 --> 01:18:28,885
It wasn't only you.

1097
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:30,558
I see.

1098
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:34,071
- Were you a diplomat before the war?
- No, Johnny's the diplomat.

1099
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:36,275
I'm just an actor.

1100
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:37,399
Of course.

1101
01:18:37,704 --> 01:18:41,362
No Englishman would kiss a woman's hand,
except perhaps an actor.

1102
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,094
Snub or compliment?

1103
01:18:43,121 --> 01:18:44,368
Compliment.

1104
01:18:44,614 --> 01:18:47,529
The way you handled those Germans
taught me something about acting.

1105
01:18:47,788 --> 01:18:49,364
It isn't so difficult.

1106
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:51,245
They're an unhappy people.

1107
01:18:52,004 --> 01:18:56,259
I would rather be a Dutchman
in Holland now than any German soldier.

1108
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:58,886
They want to believe
that somebody's their friend.

1109
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,222
And that's the whole trick.

1110
01:19:00,223 --> 01:19:02,034
A dangerous trick for a woman.

1111
01:19:02,354 --> 01:19:04,235
You don't seem to think much of women.

1112
01:19:05,071 --> 01:19:06,958
Besides, I have Louis and Willem.

1113
01:19:06,986 --> 01:19:08,353
He was your driver.

1114
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:09,758
They're the only servants left.

1115
01:19:09,785 --> 01:19:11,322
But they won't leave me.

1116
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:16,104
I was afraid when I first started.

1117
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:19,414
Just as a pilot is afraid
the first time he goes solo.

1118
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:25,232
Then after a few minutes, when he finds
he's still alive, begins to like it.

1119
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:28,511
Will you do something for me?

1120
01:19:28,538 --> 01:19:29,862
Yes, of course.

1121
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:32,692
I want you to go and see my husband
when you get back to England.

1122
01:19:33,998 --> 01:19:35,148
Your husband?

1123
01:19:35,148 --> 01:19:36,417
I'm not mad.

1124
01:19:36,494 --> 01:19:38,740
He's in London.
I'll give you his address.

1125
01:19:38,827 --> 01:19:42,211
- But we heard...
- I know. I spread that story myself.

1126
01:19:42,463 --> 01:19:44,033
Nobody knows the truth.

1127
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:45,616
Not even my friends.

1128
01:19:45,908 --> 01:19:47,791
But he's alive and in London.

1129
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:49,468
Do you ever hear from him?

1130
01:19:49,546 --> 01:19:50,676
Five times a week.

1131
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,503
He's one of
the Dutch announcers of Radio Orange.

1132
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:56,771
- What...
- Radio Orange.

1133
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:57,817
Oh.

1134
01:19:57,818 --> 01:20:02,465
So you see we're two  on both sides
of the channel  who are still fighting.

1135
01:20:02,523 --> 01:20:03,742
Then leave it to us.

1136
01:20:03,818 --> 01:20:05,235
Can we get cracking tonight?

1137
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,882
You may be here for days or hours.

1138
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,353
It depends on your air force.

1139
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:10,975
You can only get away if there's a raid.

1140
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:13,160
We want to get back, raid or no raid.

1141
01:20:13,214 --> 01:20:14,048
Now look here, Mrs. de Vries.

1142
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,634
Are you in command of this party?

1143
01:20:15,635 --> 01:20:17,102
No no no, he's just a Yorkshireman.

1144
01:20:17,196 --> 01:20:20,309
- Are you in command?
- No. You are.

1145
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,656
We have to get you back to England.

1146
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:26,285
You won't be the first or the last
to leave this house for England.

1147
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,832
You'll reach the open sea
in a fishing boat.

1148
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:30,141
And the fishing boat by a row boat.

1149
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:32,322
And the row boat
through the cellar of this house.

1150
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:34,267
And to the cellar by a back staircase.

1151
01:20:34,632 --> 01:20:37,418
The corridor which passes
my door leads to that staircase.

1152
01:20:37,975 --> 01:20:39,776
The corridor has two features.

1153
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:42,472
A sentry  and a glass roof.

1154
01:20:42,531 --> 01:20:43,230
And so?

1155
01:20:43,257 --> 01:20:44,804
And so
if you were his commanding officer,

1156
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:47,132
what orders would you
give him in case of an air raid?

1157
01:20:47,212 --> 01:20:50,705
Well, tell him not to stand about
under a glass roof, I suppose.

1158
01:20:50,706 --> 01:20:51,684
Exactly.

1159
01:20:51,893 --> 01:20:54,272
During a raid,
the corridor is left unguarded.

1160
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,401
Now, do you understand?

1161
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,985
Exactly.

1162
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,401
Everything is prepared.

1163
01:21:00,744 --> 01:21:03,053
There's nothing to do now but wait.

1164
01:21:25,102 --> 01:21:27,099
<i>Owing to bad weather conditions,</i>

1165
01:21:27,192 --> 01:21:30,362
<i>there were no operations over</i>
<i>enemy territory last night.</i>

1166
01:21:30,363 --> 01:21:31,847
You're telling me.

1167
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:41,585
Mon herr.

1168
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,446
Pardon, mon herr.

1169
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:54,657
Our wine has been
drunk by the Germans.

1170
01:21:55,237 --> 01:21:57,090
But being a Dutch woman,

1171
01:21:57,151 --> 01:22:01,407
I think that Dutch water is
a better drink than French champagne.

1172
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:06,168
I'm sorry I haven't been able to give
you the food I would have liked to.

1173
01:22:06,263 --> 01:22:08,306
But we haven't very much left.

1174
01:22:08,394 --> 01:22:10,569
I mean, not very much left to eat.

1175
01:22:11,111 --> 01:22:12,875
But we've kept everything else.

1176
01:22:13,618 --> 01:22:16,352
We can think and hope.

1177
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:18,619
And fight.

1178
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,793
I give you a toast. Louis.

1179
01:22:26,411 --> 01:22:27,694
It has been our motto

1180
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:31,767
since the house of Orange
drove out the Spaniards 300 years ago.

1181
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,498
"Je maintiendrai."

1182
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:44,362
it's nice to be a woman again.

1183
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:46,524
Even for half an hour.

1184
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:50,054
What do they reckon that motto
of yours means, then, ma'am?

1185
01:22:52,947 --> 01:22:54,883
"We can take it."

1186
01:22:55,747 --> 01:22:56,968
Well, I never.

1187
01:22:57,044 --> 01:23:00,312
300 years ago. We don't
seem to have progressed much, do we?

1188
01:23:07,324 --> 01:23:08,811
George.

1189
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:13,292
Come on, George.

1190
01:23:14,432 --> 01:23:16,473
I don't know why
everybody's looking at me.

1191
01:23:16,703 --> 01:23:20,960
After all, we have a diplomat
and an actor here.

1192
01:23:21,885 --> 01:23:24,142
I suppose it's my age.

1193
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:30,728
Well, my dear young lady.

1194
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:36,208
We can't offer you
anything except... our love.

1195
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,347
Our gratitude.

1196
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:42,381
And our admiration for
a brave woman and a fearless country.

1197
01:23:43,905 --> 01:23:45,985
But we can promise you one thing.

1198
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:49,139
A growing help.

1199
01:23:49,829 --> 01:23:51,542
An attack,

1200
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,461
which will sweep these Germans from .

1201
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:04,824
Air raid!

1202
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:08,916
- Louis, go downstairs to the basement.
- Yes, madam.

1203
01:24:15,128 --> 01:24:17,000
Come here, all of you.

1204
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:40,109
You see?
That's what you're doing for us.

1205
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:42,909
Can you hear them running for shelter?

1206
01:24:43,004 --> 01:24:46,546
Can you understand what that means
to all the occupied countries?

1207
01:24:46,632 --> 01:24:49,260
To enslaved people
having it drummed into their ears

1208
01:24:49,268 --> 01:24:51,750
that the Germans
are masters of the earth?

1209
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:54,503
Seeing those masters
running for shelter.

1210
01:24:54,529 --> 01:24:56,904
Seeing them crouching under tables.

1211
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,649
And hearing that steady hum
night after night.

1212
01:25:00,954 --> 01:25:04,938
That noise which is
oil for the burning fire of our hearts.

1213
01:25:37,691 --> 01:25:39,734
Is that you, Fritz?

1214
01:25:40,477 --> 01:25:43,675
Fritz, get your ugly face over here!

1215
01:25:44,336 --> 01:25:46,551
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1216
01:25:46,837 --> 01:25:48,344
I am Jo de Vries.

1217
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,172
Stop here.

1218
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:56,935
Where is the flashlight?
Hand it to me.

1219
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:05,082
Well well, madam De Vries!

1220
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:07,031
You look fantastic!

1221
01:26:07,147 --> 01:26:09,074
And you've hidden this for us
all this time?

1222
01:26:09,075 --> 01:26:10,331
Utterly unforgivable.

1223
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,868
That would have been perfect
for the officer's mess.

1224
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:14,632
Careful, dear madam, careful.

1225
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:16,961
The light blinds me, dear sir.

1226
01:26:16,962 --> 01:26:18,648
- Put out the light!
- I'm sorry.

1227
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:19,944
Careful, dear madam, careful.

1228
01:26:20,249 --> 01:26:23,225
She's leading him up
the garden path beautifully.

1229
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,897
What do you think of our beerkeller?

1230
01:26:27,898 --> 01:26:29,816
Beerkeller? Winekeller, dear madam!

1231
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,951
Just waiting for friendly Fritz and...

1232
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:34,148
They're expecting another chap.
Name of Fritz.

1233
01:26:34,173 --> 01:26:37,045
A little reception committee
for Fritzy.

1234
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,564
He's gone to get a Korkenzieher.

1235
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:41,498
I don't know what Korkenzieher means.

1236
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:44,157
Can I have your flashlight for a moment?

1237
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,654
- Is that all, dear madam?
- Yes.

1238
01:26:45,655 --> 01:26:46,519
Pity.

1239
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,867
My pleasure, madam, here you go.

1240
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:49,602
Oh!

1241
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,695
- Hopla!
- Now what have I done?

1242
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:56,580
She's dropped his torch in the drink.

1243
01:26:56,943 --> 01:26:58,562
Since when did you speak German?

1244
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,580
I can understand that much.

1245
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:06,250
Kids, Kortzia has arrived!

1246
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:07,575
Thank God!

1247
01:27:07,706 --> 01:27:09,044
Hello, Fritzy.

1248
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,570
Okay.

1249
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,776
Now, what about this Korkenzieher?

1250
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,758
- Of course.
- What is it?

1251
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:22,253
Corkscrew.

1252
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:23,720
Cut it out.

1253
01:27:24,153 --> 01:27:25,721
I'll be Fritz.

1254
01:27:26,034 --> 01:27:28,721
You others follow as soon
as the fight starts.

1255
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:34,034
Now come already, come!

1256
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:36,698
Fritz, if you knew what
was waiting here for you

1257
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:37,851
you would run, my friend!

1258
01:27:38,277 --> 01:27:40,127
Yes, he will be pleased.

1259
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:42,148
Well, finally Fritz!

1260
01:27:46,516 --> 01:27:48,561
Careful! Pull back!

1261
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:53,982
- All right, Mrs. de Vries?
- Yes.

1262
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:55,728
- How about it, Tom?
- Kiboshed.

1263
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,097
- Bob?
- K.O.

1264
01:27:57,098 --> 01:27:59,617
- Frank? Geoff?
- All correct, sir.

1265
01:28:00,902 --> 01:28:02,993
I am sorry, madam De Vries.

1266
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:05,951
Louis!

1267
01:28:06,352 --> 01:28:08,084
Louis, where have you been?

1268
01:28:08,085 --> 01:28:12,038
Here. While the Germans were here,
I couldn't move...

1269
01:28:12,178 --> 01:28:15,027
You can't wait for the tide to turn
or for the fishing boat.

1270
01:28:15,052 --> 01:28:16,827
These three Germans
are going to be missed.

1271
01:28:16,828 --> 01:28:18,879
What are you doing to do with them?
We can't leave you in a spot like this.

1272
01:28:18,905 --> 01:28:20,110
Don't worry about me.

1273
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,250
And don't worry about these Germans.

1274
01:28:22,789 --> 01:28:24,296
We didn't invite them to our country.

1275
01:28:24,297 --> 01:28:26,352
But we can take care of them
once they're here.

1276
01:28:26,526 --> 01:28:27,992
Louis, quick!

1277
01:28:34,297 --> 01:28:36,341
That tunnel leads to the river.

1278
01:28:36,428 --> 01:28:38,294
Watch out for a fishing boat
coming upstream

1279
01:28:38,295 --> 01:28:40,535
with two white diamonds
on the starboard side.

1280
01:28:41,045 --> 01:28:42,356
Try and contact the fishermen.

1281
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:43,935
If you can't, trust to luck.

1282
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:47,474
The danger will be at the swing bridge
at the mouth of the river.

1283
01:28:47,475 --> 01:28:48,470
It's guarded.

1284
01:28:48,545 --> 01:28:50,039
You may be challenged.

1285
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,749
You must use your own judgment.

1286
01:28:51,817 --> 01:28:53,279
Now, hurry.

1287
01:28:53,364 --> 01:28:54,863
What about the course?

1288
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,100
Due west.

1289
01:28:56,163 --> 01:28:59,421
Steer by a light
you will pick up eight miles out.

1290
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:02,844
It's a German rescue buoy
for their airmen forced down to the sea.

1291
01:29:02,942 --> 01:29:04,477
Keep well to the left of it.

1292
01:29:04,478 --> 01:29:06,088
And watch out for E-boats.

1293
01:29:06,089 --> 01:29:07,870
- You have your compass?
- Yes. I've got it here.

1294
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:10,015
Don't waste my corkscrew.
Bring me a bottle.

1295
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:16,436
Well, God bless you.

1296
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:39,634
I suppose that's
the one advantage of being old.

1297
01:29:45,901 --> 01:29:48,070
Good luck.

1298
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,468
Stand by.

1299
01:30:20,134 --> 01:30:21,444
In.

1300
01:30:22,748 --> 01:30:24,064
Out!

1301
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,392
Swing bridge ahead.

1302
01:31:01,162 --> 01:31:03,148
Here she comes.

1303
01:31:03,174 --> 01:31:05,904
Well, let's open the bridge.

1304
01:32:22,821 --> 01:32:24,852
Here come the fishing boats.

1305
01:32:50,103 --> 01:32:51,811
Two white diamonds.

1306
01:32:55,115 --> 01:32:56,868
Hello, our buoy friends.

1307
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:04,317
Our chance will be when
the bridge starts to close again.

1308
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,001
Stand by to cast off.

1309
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:08,983
And when I give the word, row!

1310
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:30,082
Get set.

1311
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:31,973
Cast off!

1312
01:33:56,331 --> 01:33:58,015
In.

1313
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:00,501
Out.

1314
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,323
In.

1315
01:34:07,657 --> 01:34:09,277
Quicken up.

1316
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:11,902
In. Out.

1317
01:34:20,478 --> 01:34:22,564
Halt!

1318
01:34:23,146 --> 01:34:24,775
Now, row!

1319
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:30,006
Halt!

1320
01:34:33,963 --> 01:34:36,243
In, out, in...

1321
01:34:36,244 --> 01:34:37,344
Keep down, everybody.

1322
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,494
I'll be damned.
We're not going to be caught!

1323
01:34:39,495 --> 01:34:41,289
In, out...

1324
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:45,937
In, out...

1325
01:34:58,904 --> 01:35:03,040
In, out, in, out...

1326
01:35:06,756 --> 01:35:08,347
Our luck.

1327
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:12,413
They don't dare use searchlights
because of our chaps.

1328
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:25,156
Let's slow it down. Darn, I'm done.

1329
01:35:29,085 --> 01:35:31,667
What's your course, George?
We're going a bit north.

1330
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:37,056
Do you want any help, sir?

1331
01:35:39,031 --> 01:35:40,611
You all right, George?

1332
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:43,625
George?

1333
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:45,771
He's hurt.

1334
01:35:45,772 --> 01:35:47,547
Steer, somebody.

1335
01:35:50,866 --> 01:35:52,508
Are you hurt badly, George?

1336
01:35:52,508 --> 01:35:54,029
The tiller...

1337
01:35:54,030 --> 01:35:55,572
Oh, don't worry about that.

1338
01:35:55,573 --> 01:35:58,236
Here. Geoff.

1339
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:05,082
Here. I'll use that.

1340
01:36:05,513 --> 01:36:07,190
Here. Pass me that sack.

1341
01:36:12,876 --> 01:36:14,418
Oh, Lord.

1342
01:36:18,476 --> 01:36:20,307
You all right now, George?

1343
01:36:21,402 --> 01:36:25,902
If I can stick it till morning,
I'll do all right.

1344
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:40,425
I suppose this is what they call choppy.

1345
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:42,762
It's what I call nasty.

1346
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:59,442
Hey, here they come.

1347
01:37:12,246 --> 01:37:13,418
They've spotted us, sir.

1348
01:37:13,445 --> 01:37:14,542
Blast!

1349
01:37:31,408 --> 01:37:33,438
They'll be here in three minutes,
I reckon.

1350
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:35,128
Never mind. If this comes out,
we're going to be all right.

1351
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:37,349
Shut the hatch.

1352
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:42,831
- Are they still jabbering, sir?
- Yes.

1353
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,962
They're ordering these two thugs
to sit quiet till E-boats get here.

1354
01:37:46,723 --> 01:37:49,516
Damned bastards!
They'll be in for a surprise!

1355
01:37:50,526 --> 01:37:53,071
What are we going to do about
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?

1356
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:56,460
You two stay put, understand?

1357
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:58,874
Fine with us, my friend.

1358
01:37:58,969 --> 01:38:00,623
You're far too cocky.

1359
01:38:01,165 --> 01:38:02,841
You understand that all right.

1360
01:38:03,038 --> 01:38:04,448
Okay.

1361
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:13,894
No need to have an empty stomach anyway.

1362
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:40,150
Try to pick up something from our side.

1363
01:38:51,946 --> 01:38:55,441
Hello, down there! Anybody in there?

1364
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:02,720
Hello, down there! Anybody in there?

1365
01:39:04,174 --> 01:39:05,465
Out!

1366
01:39:06,097 --> 01:39:09,166
They don't seem
to understand my German, sir.

1367
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:10,834
He's one of us!

1368
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:13,475
All line up!

1369
01:39:13,727 --> 01:39:16,139
Steady! Watch it!

1370
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:20,951
Hello? Air Force?

1371
01:39:20,978 --> 01:39:22,862
That's right, six of us.

1372
01:39:24,468 --> 01:39:26,465
What are you birds doing here?

1373
01:39:28,703 --> 01:39:30,509
A wonder Jerry didn't pick you up.

1374
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:32,801
Matter of fact,
we picked up two of them.

1375
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:36,450
Jerries? Are they your prisoners?

1376
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:38,847
We've been arguing
about that since we got here.

1377
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:41,026
They were here first
and radioed their chaps for help.

1378
01:39:41,027 --> 01:39:42,722
I see their point.

1379
01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:44,596
Technically you're their prisoners.

1380
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:46,490
What, six to two? I like that.

1381
01:39:47,097 --> 01:39:48,584
Sir.

1382
01:39:51,075 --> 01:39:53,287
Got a bit too cocky.
So we took their guns.

1383
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,311
Legally, that weakens your status.

1384
01:39:55,312 --> 01:39:57,651
But don't mind me.
I'm a barrister when I'm ashore.

1385
01:39:57,652 --> 01:40:00,743
Then we loosened the cables
and hoped we'd drift.

1386
01:40:00,823 --> 01:40:01,704
You drifted all right.

1387
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:05,275
Another hour with this tide and
you'd be in our own minefields.

1388
01:40:05,552 --> 01:40:07,213
How long have you been in the pot?

1389
01:40:07,214 --> 01:40:08,775
Since about four.

1390
01:40:08,839 --> 01:40:10,336
We saw you coming, sir.

1391
01:40:10,364 --> 01:40:12,241
We thought you was Jerries, sir.

1392
01:40:12,432 --> 01:40:14,304
Hmm. Trouble with you fellows is

1393
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:15,850
you can't see anything
unless you're 10,000 feet up.

1394
01:40:15,851 --> 01:40:17,775
We heard on the radio
they were sending E-boats.

1395
01:40:17,816 --> 01:40:18,781
When did you hear that?

1396
01:40:18,808 --> 01:40:21,149
- About ten minutes ago.
- Ten minutes?

1397
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,234
What are we waiting for?
Get your fellows aboard.

1398
01:40:23,235 --> 01:40:24,877
One of us is wounded.

1399
01:40:25,617 --> 01:40:28,156
We shan't be able to get him
across to your boat.

1400
01:40:34,491 --> 01:40:38,159
Yes. I quite agree. He can't be moved.

1401
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,700
Bit old for a flyer, isn't he?

1402
01:40:40,815 --> 01:40:42,489
Well, how do you feel about it?

1403
01:40:42,553 --> 01:40:44,516
He's our rear gunner.

1404
01:40:45,353 --> 01:40:47,599
Yes... if it wasn't for those E-boats.

1405
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:50,041
Of course, you don't want to leave him.

1406
01:40:50,139 --> 01:40:51,881
It would be the wisest thing to do.

1407
01:40:52,182 --> 01:40:53,847
We can't do that.

1408
01:40:53,848 --> 01:40:56,364
We're all the one crew, you see?

1409
01:40:57,213 --> 01:40:59,324
Yes, I quite agree.

1410
01:41:03,314 --> 01:41:05,109
- Coxswain!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1411
01:41:05,195 --> 01:41:07,906
- Take this lobster pot in tow!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1412
01:41:07,994 --> 01:41:09,826
What about the E-boats?

1413
01:41:09,918 --> 01:41:11,244
That to the E-boats.

1414
01:41:11,271 --> 01:41:12,931
Next stop, Dover.

1415
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,170
That's all, Corbett.

1416
01:41:54,197 --> 01:41:55,576
Thank you, sir.

1417
01:42:08,638 --> 01:42:10,761
Well, George, this is the new kite.

1418
01:42:10,788 --> 01:42:11,670
How do you like it?

1419
01:42:11,731 --> 01:42:13,773
Yes, that's more my size.

1420
01:42:15,994 --> 01:42:17,066
Right.

1421
01:42:17,324 --> 01:42:19,426
The target, Berlin.
