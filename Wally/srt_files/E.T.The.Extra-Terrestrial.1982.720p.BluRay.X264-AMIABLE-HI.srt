- MARY: I don't know. I don't know.

883
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,936
What's the matter with Elliott?

884
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,629
DOCTOR 2: Have you noticed
any surface sweating?

885
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,380
MARY: No.

886
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,425
- Has it lost any hair?
- GERTIE: He never had any hair.

887
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,343
- DOCTOR 1: Are the children all right?
- MARY: Yes.

888
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,805
PSYCHIATRIST: Did it ever build
anything or write anything down?

889
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,973
MIKE: Uh... No.

890
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:16,249
Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

891
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:20,044
He's smart. He communicates
through Elliott.

892
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,567
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

893
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,889
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

894
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,369
SCIENTIST 1: We've identified his primary
carrier protein by electrophoresis.

895
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,620
It's definitely not albumin.

896
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,915
SCIENTIST 2: Testing shows no
deficit. Some F&F. HTS test...

897

shows complete coherence

activity between both subjects.

<i>Nitrates. 255 million equivalent.</i>

902
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,595
DOCTOR 2:
Better do IV and oral contrast.

903
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,765
If there's no response, let's
move to hypertonic saline.

904
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,183
DOCTOR 3:
We have meta-starch available.

905
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,642
DOCTOR 2: Cut five per kilo.

906
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,810

907
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,789

information with this one gain.

908
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:07,005
ELLIOTT: You have no right to
do this. You're scaring him.

909

You're scaring him!

910
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,323
DOCTOR 2: Respiratory rate, 12.

911
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,825
DOCTOR 4: Good air entry but
decreased tidal volume on the boy.

912
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:16,662
Put him on O2 five liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

913
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,790
DOCTOR 2: Temperature's dropped
from 20 to 17 degrees centigrade.

914
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,416
DOCTOR 3:
Get a hypothermia blanket...

915
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,065
ELLIOTT: Please leave him alone.

916
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,714
Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

917
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,342
DOCTOR 2: Get a Doppler-scope in here
and set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

918
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,136
DOCTOR 1:
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

919
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,806
DOCTOR 2: He's not refusing at all.
He needs inotropic support.

920
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,877
DOCTOR 4: PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

921
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,312
It could be sepsis.

922
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,106
DOCTOR 3: We've drawn
two sets of blood cultures.

923
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:46,927
DOCTOR 2: He needs broad-spectrum
coverage. How about amp, gen, flagyl?

He shouldn't talk now.

928
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,275
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

929
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,903

what does it do?

I really shouldn't tell.

935
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,238
(BREATHLESSLY) He came to me.

936
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,637
He came to me.

937
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,933
Elliott, he came to me, too.

938
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:43,642
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

939

we're not already doing?

941
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:53,493
He needs to go home.

942
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,323
He's calling his people

943
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,576
and I don't know where they are.

944
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,917
He needs to go home.

945
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:10,044
Elliott, I don't think that he
was left here intentionally.

946
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:16,058
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

948

that anybody could do.

949
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,736
