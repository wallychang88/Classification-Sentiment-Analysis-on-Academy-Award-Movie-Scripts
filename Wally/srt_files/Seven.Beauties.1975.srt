The ones who, at a certain point
in their lives,

50

create a secret weapon,
Christ, oh, yeah.

and don't know
they're not going to.

00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:09,678
Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

63
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,478
Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:41,043
What the hell?

65
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:45,653
- My God!
- Jesus! Jesus!

66
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:46,987
Why, you're Itallan.

67
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:50,922
And you...who are you?

68
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,125
- Were you on that train?
- Damn right I was.

69
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,399
Damned, miserabIe woods.

70
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,462
You scared me to death.

71
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,534
These Germans, first they shoot
and then ask, ''Who's there?''

72
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,578
You're telling me.

73
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:08,739
Maybe you can tell me
where the hell we are.

74
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,079
I'd say it's Germany.

75
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,379
Anyway, what I say is,
we're better off here than on the train.

76
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,481
- That's for sure.
- That train is a blast furnace.

77
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,823
- Poor bastards.
- Yes, poor them.

78
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:25,626
You know, I'm not
really wounded.

79
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,167
I've got to be a deserter,
or worse, by now.

80
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,135
Worse. No doubt about that.

81
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:33,104
Faking a wound...

82
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,932
But anyway...

83
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,375
It's pretty good.
It Iooks real, my Iad.

84
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,539
I saved myseIf,
but I was helped out

85
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:45,210
by a dead man,
may his soul rest in peace.

86
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,687
With all due respect for the dead,
I had to take his bandages.

87
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:53,055
Instead of being in
Stalingrad,

88
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,650
I'm here.

89
00:05:56,096 --> 00:06:00,897
So, I said to my men,
where are we going?

90
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,435
What are we doing,
running around llke this?

91
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:05,232
Who wants
to go around killing?

92
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:08,103
Let's go. Go back home.

93
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,210
You can't work for people
who send you with cardboard shoes.

94
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,212
Here, where when you blow
your nose

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,579
you get a crystal chandelier,
and when you shit

96
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,208
you get icicles.

97
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:23,086
So I grabbed two trucks
and sent the men home.

98
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:27,354
I hope they made it.

99
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,293
They would have had me
shot tomorrow.

100
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:34,629
I hate the military
courts here.

101
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,197
- How long is this river!
- It must be the Rhine.

102
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:43,037
- Where's that?
- It's still in Germany.

103
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,009
Then it's still
a pain in the ass.

104
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,473
Damn!

105
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:27,946
- Who were they?
- Maybe they are Jews.

106
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,983
- That's impossible.
- It's possible.

107
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:35,044
And we're as guilty as they are.
We're accomplices to those rotten shits.

108
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:40,559
Why do you think
that we're accomplices?

109
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,891
Because we didn't make
a sound,

110
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,987
didn't come out and spit
in their faces.

111
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,623
We could  have,
but we ran instead.

112
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,794
That's crazy.
How could we have?

113
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:53,896
They'd have come after us
and we'd be shot.

114
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:55,372
Useless suicide.

115
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,933
No, it wouldn't
have been useless

116
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:01,412
because in the face
of certain things,

117
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:04,348
you've got to say no,
and instead, I said yes...

118
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,477
to Mussolini, to duty,
and to all that crap.

119
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,647
In this war I've killed bastards

120
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,749
I didn't even know.

121
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:16,660
I killed before the war,
but I had my reasons.

122
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,164
I kill like an idiot,
for no reason.

123
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,861
I did it for a woman.

124
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,768
I killed for a woman.

125
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,002
A woman...

126
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:00,438
Mama, mama, mama mia

127
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:04,876
What a bad thing is jealousy

128
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:09,040
Tell Marianna she seems an old bag

129
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:13,108
How much you have to sanction me...

130
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:18,352
What a funny trick

131
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:23,294
The fascist ltaly under sanction

132
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:27,163
They want to give us such a slap

133
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:31,226
l do not care a rap about sanctions

134
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:38,376
l feel better alone

135
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:43,574
Than accompanied badly

136
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:49,520
l am a real beauty

137
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:55,091
Since l was sanctioned

138
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,821
Oh, pretty sanction

139
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,423
Shit, coffee

140
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,561
Mess, mess, mess

141
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,901
No sanction, no more

142
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,339
Milo, I'll make...

143
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,310
Who blows a raspberry

144
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,491
- She must be kidding!
- What more do you want?

145
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,563
Screw off!

146
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,599
Let's see you dance...

147
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,935
walking cow!

148
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,102
Screw off!
Drop dead.

149
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:10,002
How about letting me
tickle you all over?

150
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:17,599
You can tickle your mama!

151
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:27,985
I'll give you something,
so don't push.

152
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,715
Nothing easy about me!

153
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:34,451
- What a lass!
- We want more!

154
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:40,231
What do you want me to do?
There! There!

155
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,400
Give us more!

156
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,928
- Take it off!
- Come on!

157
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,204
Forget it! Fuck you!

158
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,574
There! There!

159
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,721
- Pasqualino!
- Let's taIk, Concetti.

160
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,223
Look at yourseIf
in the mirror.

161
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,522
Go on, take a Iook
at yourseIf.

162
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,721
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.

163
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,993
You're not even intelligent.

164
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,036
Among mom and our sisters
there isn't a penny.

165
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,095
I'm the only man
in the house with eight women.

166
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,300
There's one thing
I've tried to defend.

167
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,400
One thing: Our honor!

168
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:30,807
To defend and protect
that honor as best I can.

169
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:33,408
Not being the biggest
or strongest man in the worId,

170
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:36,148
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.

171
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,816
They know about it,
and they have to respect us.

172
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:41,086
And you ugly,
miserable pig

173
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,923
put your disgusting thighs
on display

174
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:45,123
in a musical...

175
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:48,759
because that lousy rat
said he'd make you famous.

176
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,497
That filthy bastard who
helped to get you started

177
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:55,667
and gave you this job--
I'll kill him.

178
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,801
- No!
- I'll shoot him.

179
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,573
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'll marry me!

180
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,377
He promised!
I'm going on 37.

181
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,246
I'll be a spinster!

182
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,977
Better a spinster than
a whore!

183
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:10,488
- I must kill him.
- No! Potono'll marry me.

184
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,854
First he'll make me somebody,
then his bride.

185
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:13,857
Somebody!

186
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,587
Somebody! Come on...

187
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,396
Look at yourself,
a squawking crow.

188
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:20,295
Didn't you hear them?

189
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,834
Disgraceful! What a shame!
I'll kill that Potono!

190
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,029
No, I'm through! I have
a much better contract.

191
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:28,437
He'll heIp me sing at Club Margarita,
then he'll marry me.

192
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:31,341
He made a promise.
He loves me very much.

193
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,607
One month, eh?

194
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:37,878
I give him one month
to straighten things up.

195
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,477
One month! Our house
mustn't be dishonored.

196
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,988
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?

197
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,321
Imagine the eldest
becoming a whore!

198
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,257
What will the others do,
become whores?

199
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,885
He's got a month

200
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:53,965
to to marry you

201
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,398
or I'll kill him.

202
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,834
The word of Pasqualino
Seven Beauties.

203
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,599
Do you understand?

204
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,637
Rosina, my carnation.

205
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:33,467
Coming right up, Pasqualino.

206
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:49,247
Damn Francesco! After all
this time in Africa.

207
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,313
Now they're sending him
to Spain.

208
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,460
We need another war?
It wasn't enough last time?

209
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,587
Now we'll never get married.

210
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:01,155
Don't give up hope.
Because with God's heIp

211
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,794
he may still be lucky
enough to get a nice wound

212
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,497
in his leg or his arm.

213
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,596
You'd get a pension
for life and you'd be set.

214
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,436
- What?
- Or he'll lose an eye.

215
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,672
What crazy talk, mama!

216
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:17,705
Hey, mama, we don't enjoy
such lucky accidents in our famlly.

217
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:19,046
Yes, of course.

218
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,279
It will pass.

219
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,623
Grandma.

220
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:28,389
Rough up those mattresses.

221
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,033
Pasqualino,
leave it in the drawer.

222
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:37,797
Are you looking for trouble?

223
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,896
Hey, mama, it doesn't
get you into trouble.

224
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,206
They learn to fear you,
and respect you.

225
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,268
And beileve me,
they all respect me.

226
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:52,109
Excuse us for a moment,
family business.

227
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,284
You'll pardon us?

228
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,984
- He needs to talk in private.
- It's business.

229
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:01,117
- It's a big secret.
- Who gives a damn!

230
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,491
Quiet.

231
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:06,464
You can't trust them
to lick Leno's famlly.

232
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,897
Is that clear?

233
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:10,491
Mama,

234
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,232
look, money
to buy groceries.

235
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:17,538
- Lucky Mama.
- I'm sick of bread and onions.

236
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,669
Buy an egg for each
one of you.

237
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,269
And be careful of cheats.

238
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,942
It'd disgust anybody to look
at such yellow faces.

239
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:28,214
There's a lot to be done
if they're ever to get married.

240
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,687
Stop that!

241
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,158
Now, listen to me.

242
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,490
Don't let anybody see your eyes.
Look down

243
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:38,359
or you may be taken for
a cheap little tart.

244
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,692
And I'll beat the first one
who misbehaves. Remember.

245
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:54,203
Smlle, no reason
to be upset like that.

246
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,739
Cheer up.

247
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:01,049
Have a good day.

248
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:06,186
And you too, Louiselle.
And you too. Hmm?

249
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,531
Don't look so gloomy, eh?

250
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,575
Smile for a change!

251
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:37,655
What's the matter with you?

252
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:40,487
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

253
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,754
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!

254
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:45,592
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!

255
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:56,766
Little girl, have your parrot
tell my fortune.

256
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:59,140
- Why the tears?
- It's my mother's fault.

257
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:02,112
I never could sing,
I go off pitch.

258
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:05,615
To make me sing is wrong.

259
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,016
But it doesn't matter,
you can yell.

260
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,079
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.

261
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:12,419
Can't you answer back?

262
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:14,686
If anyone falls
to respect you,

263
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,990
you just say that
you're my fiance, hm?

264
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,154
Like this:

265
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:22,390
Say you're engaged
to Pasqualino Seven Beauties.

266
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:26,132
But I'm not your fiance.
It's false.

267
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:33,437
At the moment. But in a few years,
things could happen.

268
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:35,776
Never try to predict
the weather or the future.

269
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,713
Think about growing up.

270
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,978
Say, come on, try.

271
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,481
To get by

272
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:53,488
Even you started stealing
from the cradle.

273
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,898
Jealousy is an ugly thing.

274
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,933
Excuse me, Don Raphaele,
I don't understand.

275
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:09,975
What's the matter?
I've aIways been loyal.

276
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,442
It's not about loyalty.

277
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:15,002
I'm interested in people
who know how to show respect.

278
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,141
What are you talking about?
What are you referring to?

279
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:20,981
I'll tell you what I'm
referring to.

280
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,782
I'm talking about someone

281
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,255
who doesn't respect
his family.

282
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:28,293
- In what sense?
- I'll tell you.

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,954
At 3 o'clock,
you'd better be at the Polonetto.

284
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:34,592
Look around.
See what they're doing to you.

285
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,999
Potono bought your sister
a pair of shoes

286
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,502
with red bows on them,

287
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,596
and put her in there for life.

288
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:46,842
We have a client.

289
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:50,413
My God! It's my brother!

290
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:52,416
- Who is he?
- It's her brother!

291
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,758
Prostitute!

292
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,999
Stupid bitch!

293
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:13,664
Are you satisfied now?
Your fiance‚ got you into this business?

294
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,230
Idiot!

295
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:19,675
What a disgrace!
You brought dishonor on us!

296
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,577
Let go! Get the hell
out of my way!

297
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:27,141
Tell me where he is

298
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:29,915
or I'll murder you,
do you hear me?

299
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:31,979
How do I find
that son of a bitch?

300
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:35,350
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!

301
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,487
This is how he married you,
that lousy bastard?

302
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,930
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?

303
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:44,833
- Right here.
- Filth! Go home!

304
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:46,393
How can I,
dressed this way?

305
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,733
- Take this.
- Go like this.

306
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,502
Go home!

307
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:56,010
No, Pasqualino! No!

308
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:59,517
Don't kill him!
I love him, pIease!

309
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:04,817
Screw you
and your love! Idiot!

310
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,775
Eighteen Karat Potono,
is that you?

311
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,316
- Damn right.
- Damn right.

312
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:44,193
Weren't you going to marry
my sister, Concettina?

313
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:03,079
You promised and therefore
you'll marry her.

314
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:09,410
Who are you? Who the hell
do you think you are?

315
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,149
Miserable worm. Get out.

316
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:30,365
I didn't understand.

317
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:58,970
Does that help you understand?
Have a good day.

318
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:11,508
- Poor boy.
- Will he be all right?

319
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,481
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!

320
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,050
Where is he? Where is he?

321
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:23,959
Where'd that rotten son of a bitch go?

322
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,122
It's really not worth
bothering about.

323
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,665
Isn't it?

324
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,701
I'm going
to chop his head off.

325
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:33,000
Scum, humiliating me.

326
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:39,134
He won't live long.

327
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:05,552
Eighteen Karat Potono...

328
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:07,891
wake up!

329
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,526
I won't shoot the brains
of a sleeping man.

330
00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:12,331
Come on, wake up.

331
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:14,668
Wake up. It's me.

332
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,300
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.

333
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,004
You're the one who caused it.

334
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:22,546
You called me
''miserabIe worm'', remember?

335
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,444
Find that pistol, I need it.

336
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:29,218
Find it and be quick!
It's important to my defense.

337
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:31,446
Shit.

338
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:53,800
He's dead.

339
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:17,560
Where the hell are we?

340
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,177
Jesus. What--

341
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:32,910
I smell onions.

342
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:52,383
Ah, Signora.

343
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,858
Good morning, good morning.

344
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,690
Excuse me for coming in without
permission.

345
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,627
Stay quiet.

346
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:01,427
Sorry to disturb, but I'm hungry.

347
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:03,364
I'm an Itallan soIdier.
Understand? No?

348
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,834
That's okay, German lady.

349
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:06,996
Oh, something to eat.

350
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,131
Italian soIdier, Naples.

351
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:12,074
Sunshine, blue water,
mandolins.

352
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:21,178
Understand? A pizza pie
with tomatoes on top, or macaroni.

353
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:24,950
There's food in here. I'm starving!
Ah, German soup.

354
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:30,126
Nice. Good and hot.

355
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:33,961
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'll have some bread, with your permission.

356
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:35,522
Oh, bread with stew?

357
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:38,766
It's so good.

358
00:31:38,837 --> 00:31:42,432
Our mama often
gave us stew in Naples.

359
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:45,567
A mama, Signora,
is never forgotten.

360
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:49,307
You're a mama too. Your daughter
will catch coId with her ass out.

361
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,077
Hard times, Signora,
the war's been responsibIe.

362
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,246
Shh, if someone's there,
I... No, it's all right.

363
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,811
Soup, bread...

364
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,921
potatoes...

365
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,528
I'm taking some bread
for my friend.

366
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:07,258
He's Italian.
This is for him.

367
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,766
A drop of wine, cin-cin,
salute.

368
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,832
Good wine. Good.

369
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:16,465
I'd like to be your guest--

370
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,806
your daughter has a great ass--
but I have to run.

371
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:20,867
Thank you.

372
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:23,039
May you live to be a hundred.

373
00:32:23,114 --> 00:32:26,140
Oh, salami...
Salami and some cheese.

374
00:32:28,353 --> 00:32:29,445
Thank you...

375
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:32,319
you're welcome,
untll we meet again.

376
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,381
Good night, Signora.

377
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,326
What's that about?

378
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:40,326
Groundsport.

379
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:43,839
A mysterious word, amigo.

380
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:47,604
We must work occasionally,
or eIse: acid bath.

381
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:51,011
- Or crematorium.
- How do you know? Who are you?

382
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,149
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.

383
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:56,243
I know an anarchist whose
bombs didn't work.

384
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,220
Mussolini, Hitler, Salazar.

385
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:01,086
I've got failure after failure.

386
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:05,217
These people have made
a business out of death.

387
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,425
That goddamn, rotten whore!

388
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,867
What's the world coming to?

389
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:14,768
How the hell did the world
ever get llke this?

390
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:17,238
And we Iet ourseIves
get killed this way.

391
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,002
Nobody says anything.

392
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:23,672
The Jews, who were
supposed to be so smart...

393
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:26,716
The brave Russians,
who began the revolution,

394
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:28,273
they're not rebelling.

395
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,946
My rotten luck, ending up
in this shit pile.

396
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,792
Jesus.

397
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:46,597
They're playing a waltz.

398
00:37:58,415 --> 00:38:00,178
My God. My God.

399
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:03,277
Like sheep about
to be slaughtered.

400
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:05,488
It can't be.

401
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:08,683
Francesco,
I don't want to die.

402
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,626
I can't accept that.
I'm still young.

403
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:13,925
I had a miserabIe life.

404
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:17,660
I wouId liked to have changed it,
but I never managed to.

405
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,796
I can't die like this!

406
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:33,249
I just can't die like this.

407
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:35,512
I'll try and get out of here.

408
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:39,385
I'll do it! I'll find
a way to get out of here,

409
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,151
starting at this moment.

410
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:48,127
A woman is a woman,
Pasqualino.

411
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:51,065
And a woman, even one who
is an evil person,

412
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:54,968
has a little good for someone
who can reach her heart.

413
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:57,165
There's a bit of sugar
always there.

414
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,571
The song goes:

415
00:38:58,642 --> 00:39:03,375
ln a cup of coffee, Rosalie

416
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:04,812
Ugly to take, unsavory

417
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:07,577
Sugary, burnt and wasting
can make it distasteful

418
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:11,781
So l must stir her up,
like a sugar in the cup

419
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:15,757
To bring to my lips
what's sweet and fine

420
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:03,762
You're crazy, Pasqualino.

421
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,563
Yes, but I must try.

422
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:08,365
It's dangerous.
She's cruel, sadistic.

423
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:10,702
I understand all that.

424
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:13,402
But I had a vision.

425
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:17,243
Something my mama said--
That bit of sugar, I know it's there.

426
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:21,580
No matter how rotten she is,
or how evil.

427
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:24,176
She must need love.
I'm right, Franche.

428
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:26,745
You're educated,
but in the matter of women--

429
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:29,121
- I'm way ahead of you.
- I'm sure.

430
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:31,387
You know what I used to be called?

431
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:33,156
''Pasqualino Seven Beauties.''

432
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,132
- They did?
- Yes, because I'm ugly.

433
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,134
You look terribIe,
all right.

434
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:42,330
But that was the point.
In spite of my looks,

435
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:43,997
I appealed to women.

436
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:46,372
They loved me.
PeopIe were amazed.

437
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:49,173
They'd say, ''It's unbelievable.
He's repulsive.''

438
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:51,737
Others replied,
''He must have the Seven Beauties.''

439
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:53,680
That's how it came
to be my name, see?

440
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,615
No, but I believe you.

441
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:58,017
I appeal to the ladies.

442
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:00,579
I used to appeal to them.

443
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:02,318
The fact is,
without any exaggeration,

444
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:04,257
I haven't looked
at the mirror in years.

445
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:07,057
Since I know, from the beginning,
that I'm an ugly man,

446
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:09,155
I'll admit it's been bothering me.

447
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,132
How did I turn out llke this?

448
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:14,136
My teeth have become loose.
I can't keep my eyes open.

449
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:16,035
My ass has dropped.

450
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:20,272
Look at me
and tell me honestly,

451
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:21,833
how do I look?

452
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:27,377
Awful, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.

453
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:29,307
No!

454
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:31,377
I'm bound to be killed,
so why not?

455
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:33,786
I want to live,
have children.

456
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,189
See my chlldren's
chlldren, and more:

457
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:38,625
The children of my
children's children.

458
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:41,163
All the children
I can possibly have.

459
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:43,426
What bullshit, amigo.

460
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:47,265
You pig! How dare you tell me
what to do!

461
00:42:47,337 --> 00:42:49,464
How dare you
insult me like that?

462
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:51,734
Come on, that's nonsense,
you're talking bullshit.

463
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:54,675
- Piss off.
- Because the more children you have,

464
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:56,575
the faster the end will come.

465
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:59,308
In what sense?
What do you mean?

466
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:03,819
In the year 1400 there were
500 million peopIe on earth.

467
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:08,586
By the year 1850 the amount
had doubled to one billion.

468
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:13,752
Now we're all...
extremely indignant

469
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,424
because of the death
of 20 million men.

470
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:20,230
But in 200 or 300 years,

471
00:43:20,303 --> 00:43:23,704
there'll be a lot more
of us, 30 billion or more.

472
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:25,070
So,

473
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:28,508
anywhere you go on earth
will be worse than here.

474
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:31,741
That's when men are going
to butcher each other...

475
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:35,843
and murder an entire famlly
for a piece of bread

476
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:38,012
or an apple...

477
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:40,819
and the world will end.

478
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:45,552
Too bad, because
I believe in man.

479
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:46,823
But soon...

480
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,129
very soon, a new man,

481
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,758
a new man will be born.

482
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:53,496
He'll have to be civilized,

483
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,562
not this beast who's been
endowed with intelligence

484
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,507
and obliterated
the harmony in the world

485
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,544
and brought about
total destruction

486
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:04,910
just by disturbing
nature's equilibrium.

487
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,210
A new man...

488
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:11,517
able to rediscover the harmony
that's within.

489
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:13,249
You mean, put things
in order?

490
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:15,188
Order? No, no...

491
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:20,289
The orderly ones
are the Germans.

492
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:24,756
A new man in disorder

493
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:26,802
is our only hope.

494
00:44:27,804 --> 00:44:31,035
A new man...in disorder.

495
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:52,084
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.

496
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:54,756
You should've waited until
he got his revolver out.

497
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:57,129
I waited about five minutes,

498
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,100
but he didn't have
a gun around.

499
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:00,636
He didn't have a weapon.

500
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:04,697
You shouldn't have shot him,
you should have given Potono a gun.

501
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:06,799
I only had one.

502
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:09,037
You should've had two
with you.

503
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:11,672
You can't ever be
careful enough.

504
00:45:11,748 --> 00:45:14,581
This case demanded
the simplest of care.

505
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:16,414
You must prepare
for the job.

506
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:19,421
You should throw him
his gun, defend yourseIf.

507
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,753
He picks the gun up,
you shoot him.

508
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:24,885
You didn't murder him.
Self-defense.

509
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:27,395
Later on, the case
comes up, a quick trial.

510
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:30,024
In no time, you're out
and you're respected.

511
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,931
It's a breeze, get it?

512
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:35,562
Don Raphael,
how couId I have known?

513
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:38,106
A real man prepares a job
with foresight

514
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:40,608
or else anyone at all
would be able to do it.

515
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:43,245
Now you've got the probIem

516
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:45,543
of making it all disappear.

517
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,281
50% is all you can hope
to get out of it morally.

518
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:52,218
I'm talking about respect.

519
00:45:53,423 --> 00:45:56,392
You must make yourseIf
a name.

520
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,620
You need lots of publicity.

521
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:01,095
For this you need discretion.

522
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:04,328
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.

523
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:08,531
It's a supposition,
but we must be sure.

524
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:12,041
- He's disappeared.
- Sounds simple.

525
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:15,339
How am I to fix it?
Throw him in the bay?

526
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:20,111
It'll rise to the top
and you'll go straight to prison.

527
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:24,814
Marvelous, perfect, damn it!
Dear God.

528
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:28,957
Imagination. A creative
effort's needed.

529
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:33,760
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.

530
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,391
Smoking cigarettes,
anybody can do that.

531
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:42,899
The man who wants
to be something more

532
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:45,600
needs the guts to perform.

533
00:46:49,646 --> 00:46:52,410
The nerve to do things

534
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:55,576
that normally no one eIse
couId possibly imagine.

535
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:56,983
Get the point?

536
00:46:59,522 --> 00:47:02,685
I get the point,
Don Raphael.

537
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:06,262
You seem nervous, my boy.

538
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,957
- Calm down, my boy.
- I am caIm.

539
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:12,058
There are men, who,

540
00:47:12,135 --> 00:47:15,593
at the very mention
of their name,

541
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:17,765
make the whole world tremble.

542
00:47:18,808 --> 00:47:21,402
- Get my point, Pasqualino?
- I get it.

543
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,002
You're intelligent.

544
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,706
You follow everything
I tell you.

545
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,510
I follow, Don Raphael.

546
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,073
As I explained,

547
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,483
you could make a great
start for yourself

548
00:47:30,553 --> 00:47:33,181
with this opportunity,
or not.

549
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:36,248
Of course, it's entirely
up to you.

550
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:39,352
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention

551
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,488
to anyone who talks about
the American system.

552
00:47:41,564 --> 00:47:46,024
Traditional cement shoes
were invented here in Naples.

553
00:47:46,102 --> 00:47:48,764
Chicago and New York
just make cheap imitations.

554
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:50,203
It's plagiarism.

555
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:53,572
The king-size coffin
is our invention.

556
00:47:53,643 --> 00:47:56,737
When you see a funeral
in Naples,

557
00:47:56,813 --> 00:48:00,305
nobody knows how many bodies
are in the coffin.

558
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:03,784
When things get busy,
two or three can be stuffed in.

559
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:07,017
Depends on the demand.

560
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,854
We invented everything
here in Naples.

561
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:11,052
For example,

562
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,152
you know
the ancient graveyard?

563
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:15,561
Well, when they first opened it

564
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:19,625
they found 500 skeletons.

565
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:22,102
Now, there are 5,000.

566
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:25,800
The question is, who put
the other 4,500 in there?

567
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,436
So, as l said,
it depends on the demand.

568
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,745
Oh, God.

569
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:41,376
He's so ugly.

570
00:50:34,871 --> 00:50:37,772
Wait a minute, here.

571
00:51:03,566 --> 00:51:05,329
Son of a bitch.

572
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:10,262
Even dead, you are a pig.

573
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,440
Just a big bag of wind.

574
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:17,945
I knew it.

575
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:53,172
Fuck!

576
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:29,567
Who's there?

577
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:32,806
Who's there?

578
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:36,735
Who is it?
Who are you?

579
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:42,948
Who is it?

580
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:47,454
Who's there?

581
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,648
What's going on?

582
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:53,285
Who's there?
What's going on?

583
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:58,064
What's going on?

584
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,533
- Get going.
- Where to?

585
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:02,900
To the station.
And hurry.

586
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:05,940
Damn stupid animal!
Blind idiot!

587
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,066
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

588
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:11,771
You have no respect
for a poor blind man!

589
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:14,271
Son of a bitch!

590
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:43,408
What is this?
Stay back.

591
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,743
Keep your hands off me,
please. Get back.

592
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:49,045
Will you get back!
I don't want any heIp.

593
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,880
I'll manage myseIf.
I don't need help. PIease.

594
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:55,481
- I can manage myseIf.
- He's so strong!

595
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:00,159
Look. A big cheese box
roped up wrong.

596
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:04,026
Could you pIease
take these?

597
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,361
Thanks.

598
00:56:06,134 --> 00:56:07,761
How did you wrap it?

599
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:17,209
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!

600
00:56:18,313 --> 00:56:21,305
- Where are you going?
- Palermo, Milano and Genoa.

601
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:25,043
You know that shipment
of Provolone?

602
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,587
It's been sent off.

603
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:29,853
Palermo, Milano and Genoa.
Goodbye.

604
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,987
It was your advice
I followed about creative thinking.

605
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:39,966
I don't think you'll hear
about it anymore.

606
00:56:40,035 --> 00:56:44,369
He killed my Potono!
Pollce! He killed him!

607
00:56:58,186 --> 00:56:59,619
Leave me aIone!

608
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,235
Give up!

609
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:57,005
You'll never take
Pasqualino Seven Beauties.

610
00:57:57,078 --> 00:57:59,376
Never will you be able
to take him allve.

611
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:02,974
- Stop bragging.
- So I'm wrong.

612
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,504
- Are you out of your mind?
- Don't worry.

613
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:09,540
- Where are you going?
- Be quiet.

614
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:35,286
Shit.

615
01:01:43,104 --> 01:01:45,538
Monster of Naples confesses!

616
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:47,870
It's Pasqualino and no other.

617
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:49,534
Latest edition!

618
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,601
Big murder story!

619
01:01:54,615 --> 01:01:58,949
- So, you have confessed.
- Yes, sir.

620
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,447
Nobody in his right mind
ever confessed such a thing.

621
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:06,186
Complete madness!
I will look ridiculous.

622
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,889
What the hell do you think
I can tell the judge, huh?

623
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:13,764
- It's impossible to defend this case.
- Advocate,

624
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:15,530
this time I Iost.

625
01:02:15,603 --> 01:02:18,970
I'm glad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.

626
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,440
No, you're an asshole.

627
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:22,874
How dare you!

628
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,172
You'll pay for that!

629
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:27,339
- Calm down or I Ieave.
- Who the hell are you?

630
01:02:27,415 --> 01:02:30,350
Your lawyer.
Want to kill me as well?

631
01:02:30,418 --> 01:02:31,851
Watch that asshole stuff.

632
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:34,387
I wanted to say incompetent.

633
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:38,448
It's not so simple.
I have a great reputation.

634
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:39,857
You understand?

635
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,020
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.

636
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:44,496
How can I defend you
if you tell the truth?

637
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:46,863
''The monster of Naples
is captured and confesses.''

638
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:50,199
Who ever heard of
such a thing? Confesses?

639
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:51,898
It's...it's...

640
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:53,998
it is unbelievable!

641
01:02:54,075 --> 01:02:57,306
Listen: ''Confesses to
cutting up the victim

642
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:01,314
and shipping the body
to three, different cities.''

643
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:03,373
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...

644
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:07,012
The only thing left
for us to do is plead insanity.

645
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:10,524
- I don't get it.
- I'll claim you're mad--out of your mind.

646
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,724
Really?

647
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:16,295
I have to deny
an honorabIe act

648
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:19,299
aimed at protecting
the loss of dignity

649
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:21,426
and pretend I'm a fool.

650
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,299
Let's forget it, my friend.

651
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:27,205
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?

652
01:03:27,275 --> 01:03:29,140
You're confused.

653
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:32,179
Look, they're going to condemn you
to death, huh?

654
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:33,611
It's the firing squad.

655
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:39,610
I can not play the fool.

656
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:42,713
I'm sorry about Don Raphael
but I'll have to send you away.

657
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,122
You'll give me a scoop,
understand?

658
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:47,888
- I won't do it.
- What shouId I do?

659
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:51,489
I have high blood pressure.
I've got to stay calm.

660
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:54,897
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity,

661
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:57,529
I'll defend you
and we may save your neck.

662
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:59,539
But if you prefer
your stupid honor,

663
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:02,508
we'll forget about it,
and you're dead.

664
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:06,172
Understand? It's your life
or your honor.

665
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:09,944
Think about it, Pasqualino Porfusso,
and let me know.

666
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,349
All right, then, you can
see your visitors.

667
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,910
Let the family in.

668
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,719
Mama! Mama!

669
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,224
Mama!

670
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:21,750
- Pasqualino.
- Mama!

671
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:22,818
Mama!

672
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:24,728
Pasquall, dear Iove.

673
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,289
Mama!

674
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,461
- My Pasqualino!
- Mama!

675
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:32,833
My son! My son!

676
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,672
Mama.

677
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:46,946
- My son.
- Mama.

678
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:50,388
- At last, I can see you.
- You're telling me...

679
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:54,861
- How you are?
- I'm not so well, mama.

680
01:04:55,863 --> 01:04:58,696
How about you? Does Don Raphael
give you anything?

681
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:01,200
He's been heIping us
a little,

682
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:03,395
but not with money,
just words.

683
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:05,803
So it's been left for us
to manage somehow.

684
01:05:05,873 --> 01:05:07,363
How do you manage?

685
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:15,779
I will do all that I can...

686
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,648
- Concettina!
- Pasqualino!

687
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,314
He's a friend.
What do you want?

688
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:26,923
Your lawyer's one of the best in Naples,
recommended by Don Raphael.

689
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:29,519
He costs a lot.

690
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,724
You did commit the crime.

691
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,267
She's not innocent...

692
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:37,270
It's one matter not being innocent.
Being a whore is another.

693
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:39,602
Now sweetheart,
have a little patience.

694
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:47,545
A rotten comedy,
a lousy farce,

695
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:49,139
called living.

696
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:50,774
One, two, one two...

697
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,161
Your ass will drop

698
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:07,530
and your belly'll get fat
without exercise.

699
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:12,639
Come on, run.

700
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,902
Keep the body beautiful.

701
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,307
You'll be as good as new.

702
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:27,180
- Italians!
- What now?

703
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:32,483
Let's welcome the war
for the virtues it brings out...

704
01:06:33,094 --> 01:06:36,029
in those of us who have
the guts to fight!

705
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:39,195
We're making history.

706
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:43,828
Our peopIe are
a race of distant warriors!

707
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:46,839
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!

708
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:49,034
It's very funny.

709
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:51,510
Our people are poets
and heroes.

710
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:55,276
- He's out of his mind.
- And that is their fame.

711
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,342
The challenge this breed poses

712
01:06:58,419 --> 01:07:01,547
is a threat
to all on earth.

713
01:07:01,622 --> 01:07:03,613
Take him away, eh?

714
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,286
And greet your sister.

715
01:12:52,157 --> 01:12:53,146
Polltical?

716
01:12:54,693 --> 01:12:55,887
Hatchet killer.

717
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:02,926
Pasqualino Porfuso,
'The Monster of Naples'.

718
01:13:07,806 --> 01:13:11,003
The act of an unbalanced
mind, 12 years.

719
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:12,304
You're Iucky.

720
01:13:12,444 --> 01:13:15,140
They gave me
28 years and 4 months.

721
01:13:16,615 --> 01:13:19,516
28? How did it come to that?

722
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,110
I simply thought.

723
01:13:23,188 --> 01:13:26,851
It's the most atrocious crime
a citizen couId commit.

724
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:28,256
He doesn't want that.

725
01:13:32,298 --> 01:13:35,665
- You're anti-fascist.
- Socialist.

726
01:13:37,503 --> 01:13:40,438
To tell the truth,
politics are boring.

727
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:42,133
I've other interests.

728
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:47,769
Papa was a brickIayer.
He talked a little Socialism.

729
01:13:47,846 --> 01:13:50,212
But I don't think
about it anymore...

730
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:57,886
because I think
Il Duce is pretty great.

731
01:13:57,956 --> 01:14:00,254
To be truthful,
he's given us roads.

732
01:14:00,326 --> 01:14:02,851
He's given so much--
an entire empire.

733
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:05,988
All the other countries
are jealous of our leader.

734
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,899
Listening to the man speak
to us--

735
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,867
that voice,
and those eyes--

736
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:14,771
and his court found me
completely insane.

737
01:14:15,774 --> 01:14:17,867
But our people are respected.

738
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:22,971
They used to spit at us, Italians,
on the face, remember?

739
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:26,882
Besides, there were
many strikes, riots, demonstrations.

740
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:29,443
We used to be in terrible condition.

741
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,455
Thanks to him, there's been no disorder.

742
01:14:31,523 --> 01:14:34,219
He is a marvel,
you're right.

743
01:14:34,293 --> 01:14:36,591
There has been law
and order,

744
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:39,358
and he's done it by outlawing
unions and strikes.

745
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:41,956
The resuIt is that salaries
in 1919 were up

746
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:44,399
and today, peope are
making less than half,

747
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:47,530
while the cost of living
has increased 30%.

748
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:51,136
You didn't know that, huh?

749
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,644
This Mussolini, of whom
everyone envies us...

750
01:14:53,712 --> 01:14:57,307
Do you know who envies us?
The masters envy Mr. Mussollni!

751
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,041
The Italians are a bunch of fools,

752
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:02,644
listening to that bag of air
on his balcony.

753
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:04,052
Your Duce.

754
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:07,249
Wait, wait...no.
Careful, they'll hear us.

755
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:10,818
You mentioned the strikes,
and the riots?

756
01:15:10,896 --> 01:15:14,229
At least then we knew if there was a disease,
we could hope to get well.

757
01:15:14,299 --> 01:15:16,460
Now we imagine
we're strong

758
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:18,093
and we hide the disease.

759
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,536
That man will bring
our country to war.

760
01:15:20,606 --> 01:15:22,574
That's the final catastrophe.

761
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:27,143
You put it very well.

762
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:31,078
What do you intend to do?

763
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:34,085
I don't bother with politics.

764
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:37,078
I go to the insane asylum

765
01:15:37,156 --> 01:15:39,090
and stay there for 10 years.

766
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:43,618
lt's just a question
of getting things organized,

767
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:46,289
becoming friendly with
some doctor or some nurse.

768
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,699
ln Naples, we're very inventive.

769
01:15:49,768 --> 01:15:54,637
I might get assigned
to clean the women's quarters.

770
01:15:54,706 --> 01:15:56,264
Then l'll have it made.

771
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:58,775
l'll be on Easy Street.

772
01:16:11,924 --> 01:16:14,552
What do you know,
you're awake.

773
01:16:14,626 --> 01:16:17,094
- Let's see how well you've done.
- A little bit.

774
01:16:17,162 --> 01:16:18,652
That's not much.

775
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,790
Not enough.
To pee is to live.

776
01:16:21,867 --> 01:16:24,597
The more you pee,
the more you live.

777
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:35,104
Pasqualino, how
are you doing?

778
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,580
Do you llke your new
job as intended?

779
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:39,173
Keep up the good work.

780
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:43,051
I'm starting procedures
for a new psychiatric test.

781
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:45,248
You'll see, they'll let you out.

782
01:16:45,324 --> 01:16:48,316
We have to put an end
to this--

783
01:16:48,393 --> 01:16:52,124
All the judicial cases
who end up here...

784
01:18:44,876 --> 01:18:47,606
What are you doing?

785
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:50,810
What do you think?

786
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:11,563
A gift from heaven
can't go to waste.

787
01:19:13,572 --> 01:19:16,564
I've had no woman now
for several months.

788
01:19:18,577 --> 01:19:20,841
I must ask you to forgive me.

789
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:23,346
I must, must have a look.

790
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:34,123
Leave it to me, I'm an expert.

791
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:35,955
Let me please you.

792
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:45,864
You want it.

793
01:19:50,442 --> 01:19:52,706
Stupid bitch! Go to hell!

794
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:57,676
Shut up. Shut up,
you idiot!

795
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,549
Shut up!
What do you want from me?

796
01:20:15,801 --> 01:20:17,359
That'll keep you quiet.

797
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,607
I'll take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?

798
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:39,050
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.

799
01:20:54,406 --> 01:20:56,533
Now we'll show you.

800
01:20:59,077 --> 01:21:00,908
- Get his pants off.
- Right.

801
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:20,559
Come on, move!

802
01:22:04,442 --> 01:22:08,105
In seven weeks
we'll be out of here.

803
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,307
Then we'll Ieave,

804
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:12,714
all of us, all of us.

805
01:22:12,784 --> 01:22:16,811
In seven weeks
we'll be out of here.

806
01:22:17,022 --> 01:22:19,047
Then we'll Ieave,

807
01:22:19,124 --> 01:22:20,113
all of us...

808
01:22:23,528 --> 01:22:25,462
My cigarette!

809
01:22:26,665 --> 01:22:31,500
May the souls of your damn famlly
burn in the hell forever, I am starving!

810
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,162
My cigarette!

811
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,834
My cigarette!

812
01:22:43,515 --> 01:22:45,540
My cigarette!

813
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:57,121
Though you've done these terribIe things,
you're normal.

814
01:22:57,194 --> 01:23:00,322
You can't be shut up in here
with these hopeless cases.

815
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:01,694
You must control yourseIf.

816
01:23:01,765 --> 01:23:05,030
You know what a revision
of your mentaI status entalls.

817
01:23:05,102 --> 01:23:07,502
Your behavior is what
counts most.

818
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:11,837
Eight more years here
couId drive me crazy, Doctor.

819
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:14,434
- I really mean it.
- I know, I know.

820
01:23:14,512 --> 01:23:16,946
Make an effort: now is your chance.

821
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:19,244
Pasqualino, Italy is at war now

822
01:23:19,316 --> 01:23:23,412
and they'll be needing all
the men they can get.

823
01:23:23,487 --> 01:23:27,048
They can't be fussy about
anyone who voIunteers,

824
01:23:27,124 --> 01:23:29,524
even if it's someone
coming out of prison.

825
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:31,823
Of course, this doesn't
apply to mental patients.

826
01:23:31,896 --> 01:23:35,161
But if we run psychiatric tests

827
01:23:35,232 --> 01:23:37,257
to demonstrate you've made
a complete recovery...

828
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:39,097
Help me, Doctor.

829
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:41,569
I want to go on living.

830
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:44,836
That isn't asking so much.
HeIp me.

831
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:45,841
Help me.

832
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,879
I'll try my best for you

833
01:23:48,946 --> 01:23:52,905
but I'm afraid this war
will end in a terrible massacre.

834
01:23:52,983 --> 01:23:56,214
It couldn't be more terrible
than in here.

835
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:59,085
I'm ready to do anything
to get out of here.

836
01:23:59,156 --> 01:24:01,784
l'm ready to do anything
to live, anything.

837
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,550
I'm ready to do anything

838
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:03,609
How much sleep have I lost for you?

839
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,823
For you

840
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,448
Let me

841
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:09,856
Crematorium six.

842
01:25:11,228 --> 01:25:15,028
A night close to you

843
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:17,659
With you

844
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:22,172
Oh, Mari, Oh, Mari,
how much sleep...

845
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:26,903
How much sleep have I lost for you

846
01:25:27,845 --> 01:25:32,282
Let me sleep

847
01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:35,045
Oh, Mari, Oh, Mari

848
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:37,110
Oh, Mari, Oh, Mari

849
01:25:47,031 --> 01:25:48,055
Get out.

850
01:25:50,968 --> 01:25:51,957
You too.

851
01:25:58,442 --> 01:26:00,034
Get up.

852
01:26:33,377 --> 01:26:38,007
What exactIy is your game,
shit macaroni?

853
01:26:41,885 --> 01:26:45,013
Jesus, you speak Italian.

854
01:26:49,259 --> 01:26:53,195
Then I can talk to you.

855
01:26:53,263 --> 01:26:55,595
At last, I can talk to you.

856
01:26:58,769 --> 01:27:00,794
Who are...who are you?

857
01:27:03,307 --> 01:27:06,208
An enchantress,
or a magician?

858
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:10,273
Because you put a spell
on me.

859
01:27:13,851 --> 01:27:16,115
When I saw you
the first time...

860
01:27:21,091 --> 01:27:22,888
I was--I--

861
01:27:31,802 --> 01:27:34,965
What are you saying,
you disgusting macaroni?

862
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:40,938
I love...

863
01:27:43,647 --> 01:27:45,547
I'm in love with you.

864
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:54,449
I love you very much.

865
01:28:13,977 --> 01:28:15,239
Strip.

866
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:21,613
What? Did I hear right?

867
01:28:21,685 --> 01:28:23,312
You asked...

868
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:26,118
me to strip?

869
01:28:32,596 --> 01:28:34,029
All right.

870
01:29:17,407 --> 01:29:19,398
I'm willing

871
01:29:19,476 --> 01:29:22,673
because I'd like to make you laugh,

872
01:29:22,746 --> 01:29:24,236
because I love you.

873
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:26,910
You hate me.

874
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:29,043
You all despise me.

875
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:33,214
You want something to eat.

876
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:37,283
You Iove me in order to get
something to eat.

877
01:29:38,428 --> 01:29:42,421
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.

878
01:29:43,433 --> 01:29:45,833
But what goes on
inside my heart--

879
01:29:45,903 --> 01:29:49,202
You, you, Signora, have no idea.

880
01:29:49,273 --> 01:29:51,366
You're right. Everybody
hates you. I should too.

881
01:29:51,575 --> 01:29:55,443
I should hate you because
I've never seen a woman llke you.

882
01:29:55,512 --> 01:29:58,504
I have to admit
I'm crazy...

883
01:29:59,683 --> 01:30:01,708
but the reason I'm crazy
is because--

884
01:30:01,785 --> 01:30:04,754
because I'm not convinced
you are as you seem.

885
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:05,981
Who--

886
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:09,452
Who are you really?

887
01:30:09,526 --> 01:30:11,221
I need to know
who you are.

888
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:12,956
Tell me the truth.

889
01:30:15,732 --> 01:30:16,790
No.

890
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:20,564
No, of course you're not
a witch or an enchantress.

891
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:24,838
I'm convinced you're just
a poor victim, yes.

892
01:30:24,908 --> 01:30:26,637
You're a victim

893
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:30,043
because you're forced into--

894
01:30:31,315 --> 01:30:33,306
forced to kill...

895
01:30:35,085 --> 01:30:37,918
You kill out of a sense of duty.

896
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:43,356
Not a witch at all,
you are a victim, llke we are.

897
01:30:44,494 --> 01:30:46,018
There is--

898
01:30:46,096 --> 01:30:49,588
There's a real femaIe
under that uniform.

899
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,725
I imagine the rosy flesh,
delicate and beautiful

900
01:30:51,802 --> 01:30:53,633
and soft to touch.

901
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:55,672
It drives me out
of my head.

902
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:57,764
Yes, I've gone out
of my head.

903
01:30:57,841 --> 01:31:01,470
To caress sainted fIesh
is something I dream about.

904
01:31:03,613 --> 01:31:04,602
Yes.

905
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:07,616
Yes, I can hardIy
stand on my feet.

906
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:10,847
I think of you
and I become weak.

907
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:13,355
Yes, I'm in love.

908
01:31:13,423 --> 01:31:16,051
Love is madness,
it's a disease.

909
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:18,492
When you're in love,
you lose all perspective.

910
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:20,757
I've gone crazy
thinking of you.

911
01:31:20,831 --> 01:31:24,790
That's why I did what I did
and that's why I'm here now.

912
01:31:24,868 --> 01:31:28,065
And that's why I'm asking
you one, big favor, one.

913
01:31:28,138 --> 01:31:31,232
If I'm to be killed,
I ask to be killed by you.

914
01:31:31,308 --> 01:31:35,506
By the touch of your hand.
I beg of you, touch me.

915
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:39,106
And I'd be very glad
if you'd kill me now. Touch me.

916
01:31:41,151 --> 01:31:44,643
You shit, Neapolitan.
You can hardly stand.

917
01:31:45,722 --> 01:31:48,816
You cannot keep on playing
in this comedy of yours.

918
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:51,750
You want to eat.

919
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,123
Now, you'll make love to me

920
01:32:25,195 --> 01:32:28,028
then I'll kill you
with my bare hands.

921
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:30,157
Understand?

922
01:32:36,573 --> 01:32:38,268
It's what you've asked, no?

923
01:32:38,341 --> 01:32:40,673
Yes, thank you.

924
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:02,151
You have to be patient.

925
01:34:02,225 --> 01:34:05,490
I love you, but I'm weak.

926
01:35:07,891 --> 01:35:10,951
You can't even open your eyes.

927
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:16,524
You don't have the energy
for an erection.

928
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,067
Wake up!

929
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:20,094
Eat, Naples.

930
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,724
Now you eat,

931
01:35:51,801 --> 01:35:53,735
afterward you fuck.

932
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:59,235
If you don't fuck,
you're finished.

933
01:36:35,044 --> 01:36:36,875
Fifi, my first love...

934
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:39,542
help me get it up.

935
01:38:09,772 --> 01:38:12,206
I want to see your eyes.

936
01:38:29,592 --> 01:38:31,082
Garbage.

937
01:39:04,827 --> 01:39:06,624
You disgust me.

938
01:39:12,168 --> 01:39:14,932
Your thirst for life

939
01:39:15,004 --> 01:39:16,904
disgusts me.

940
01:39:20,343 --> 01:39:23,835
Your love disgusts me.

941
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:33,286
In Paris, there is a Greek

942
01:39:33,356 --> 01:39:36,723
who found strength
to make love to a goose.

943
01:39:37,594 --> 01:39:40,256
He screwed for what it gave him:
something to eat.

944
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:41,695
It meant survival.

945
01:39:41,764 --> 01:39:43,425
And you,

946
01:39:43,499 --> 01:39:46,935
you sub-human Italian,

947
01:39:47,003 --> 01:39:49,801
you found the strength

948
01:39:49,872 --> 01:39:52,670
for an erection.

949
01:39:52,742 --> 01:39:56,974
And because you were strong
you'll manage to live on

950
01:39:57,046 --> 01:39:58,911
and eventually you'll win.

951
01:40:00,483 --> 01:40:02,678
Miserable creature,

952
01:40:03,686 --> 01:40:06,211
Iacking in ideaIs and ideas,

953
01:40:07,357 --> 01:40:09,120
And we--

954
01:40:09,192 --> 01:40:12,286
We who thought
to create a master race...

955
01:40:14,731 --> 01:40:16,562
are doomed to failure.

956
01:40:19,969 --> 01:40:23,598
You're in barracks number 23,
right?

957
01:40:26,709 --> 01:40:30,304
Starting right now,
you're in charge of barrack 23.

958
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,072
That's an order.

959
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:38,386
As head of barrack 23,

960
01:40:41,024 --> 01:40:44,824
you are to designate
any six that you llke

961
01:40:44,894 --> 01:40:46,555
to be eliminated at once.

962
01:40:49,399 --> 01:40:50,388
Yes.

963
01:40:50,466 --> 01:40:53,401
If not, I eliminate
all men in that barrack.

964
01:40:55,505 --> 01:40:57,234
You are to choose any six.

965
01:40:58,241 --> 01:41:00,573
And the others may get
something to eat,

966
01:41:00,643 --> 01:41:02,133
even survive.

967
01:41:03,312 --> 01:41:05,872
You pick six or you'll all
be cremated.

968
01:41:05,948 --> 01:41:08,075
Understand?
Finished.

969
01:41:12,121 --> 01:41:14,180
The choice is yours.

970
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:16,986
You pig.

971
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:19,961
You rotten, dirty pig.

972
01:41:20,029 --> 01:41:23,192
Now you're a butcher
like the rest of us,

973
01:41:23,266 --> 01:41:25,257
filthy, sub-human Italian.

974
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:42,111
- No.
- I've got to.

975
01:41:42,185 --> 01:41:45,177
The bitch said so.
It's either six or all of us.

976
01:41:45,254 --> 01:41:48,451
Every last one of them
is doomed to die.

977
01:41:48,524 --> 01:41:50,856
At least we'll
save our ass.

978
01:41:50,927 --> 01:41:53,293
No. We'll be just like them.

979
01:41:53,362 --> 01:41:56,195
That's what they want.
We must say no.

980
01:41:56,265 --> 01:41:58,631
So all the men will be
dead tomorrow?

981
01:41:58,701 --> 01:42:00,760
All the men, tomorrow.

982
01:42:02,572 --> 01:42:03,732
Screw off.

983
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:07,676
Say what you want
but remember who's boss.

984
01:42:09,612 --> 01:42:12,740
Here, group three. Whoever they
may be, I'm not interested.

985
01:42:12,815 --> 01:42:13,975
Into 14.

986
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,746
I don't want to know
who they are.

987
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,979
Here, the first six.

988
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:21,546
You need onIy five.

989
01:42:24,093 --> 01:42:27,460
- What do you mean?
- I volunteer.

990
01:42:28,998 --> 01:42:30,488
You're crazy. Why?

991
01:42:30,566 --> 01:42:33,364
Because I'm fed up with this.

992
01:42:53,623 --> 01:42:55,784
Come on, get in line.

993
01:42:59,796 --> 01:43:01,286
It's an order!

994
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:06,598
It's an order, go on!

995
01:43:24,887 --> 01:43:26,479
Quickly!

996
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:31,523
Number 9423...

997
01:43:33,196 --> 01:43:34,959
Number 9632...

998
01:43:35,998 --> 01:43:39,092
9541 ...

999
01:43:39,969 --> 01:43:42,631
Number 9376...

1000
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,535
Number 9535...

1001
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,171
Number 9464.

1002
01:44:03,926 --> 01:44:07,418
Somebody smuggIed food
into barrack 23.

1003
01:44:08,231 --> 01:44:11,632
In addition,
stolen property of the 3rd Reich

1004
01:44:11,701 --> 01:44:13,191
was found in barrack 23.

1005
01:44:13,269 --> 01:44:15,601
As punishment for
the breaking of regulations,

1006
01:44:16,672 --> 01:44:20,108
these six men will
face a firing squad.

1007
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:38,751
Enough with this fear!

1008
01:44:38,828 --> 01:44:40,762
I've had enough!

1009
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:44,027
Living in all this dark terror!

1010
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,625
I'm going to throw myseIf
in the shit!

1011
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:50,136
Screw you!

1012
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:51,434
Stop!

1013
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:56,300
Stop!

1014
01:45:02,685 --> 01:45:05,017
A man in disorder!

1015
01:45:13,896 --> 01:45:15,557
Get him out.

1016
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:25,571
Filthy rats! Bastards!

1017
01:45:25,641 --> 01:45:28,508
Lousy, rotten sons of bitches!
You filth!

1018
01:45:28,577 --> 01:45:29,566
Francesco!

1019
01:45:29,645 --> 01:45:30,907
Dirty pigs!

1020
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:34,347
- Francesco!
- Filthy murderers!

1021
01:45:34,417 --> 01:45:37,511
Enough of your filthy killing!

1022
01:45:37,586 --> 01:45:40,180
Lousy, rotten,
no good animals!

1023
01:45:41,624 --> 01:45:46,254
- Let me by!
- You're not even men!

1024
01:45:46,329 --> 01:45:48,160
Leave him to me.

1025
01:45:54,737 --> 01:45:57,831
- Give me...
- Silly bastards!

1026
01:45:59,275 --> 01:46:01,072
Put your hat on!

1027
01:46:03,312 --> 01:46:06,475
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.

1028
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,550
Please fall down.
Just pretend--

1029
01:46:09,618 --> 01:46:10,983
Fall to the ground.
Pretend!

1030
01:46:11,053 --> 01:46:13,851
No, I don't want to live
any longer!

1031
01:46:13,923 --> 01:46:16,983
- Death can't be worse than this!
- Fall down! Pretend!

1032
01:46:17,059 --> 01:46:20,426
- PIease shut up!
- I'd rather die than live in this shit.

1033
01:46:20,496 --> 01:46:22,760
I'll have the satisfaction
of yelling--

1034
01:46:22,832 --> 01:46:24,561
- Filthy pigs!
- You're mad!

1035
01:46:24,633 --> 01:46:27,295
- Inhuman sons of bitches!
- Frances!

1036
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:29,668
Rotten animals!

1037
01:47:12,448 --> 01:47:16,179
God...what do they want?

1038
01:47:18,454 --> 01:47:19,944
What do they want?

1039
01:47:44,447 --> 01:47:46,176
I won't shoot him.

1040
01:47:49,351 --> 01:47:50,375
Shoot.

1041
01:47:55,057 --> 01:47:56,649
Shoot.

1042
01:47:56,725 --> 01:47:59,023
Hurry up.
You'll be freeing me.

1043
01:47:59,095 --> 01:48:00,653
Come on.

1044
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,293
Shoot!

1045
01:48:03,365 --> 01:48:05,333
Somebody eIse will shoot me
if you won't.

1046
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:08,063
At Ieast you're my friend.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1047
01:48:08,137 --> 01:48:09,627
Shoot!

1048
01:48:09,705 --> 01:48:11,696
I won't be tortured any more.

1049
01:48:11,774 --> 01:48:13,264
Don't you understand?

1050
01:48:13,342 --> 01:48:16,334
I can't play the hero
much Ionger.

1051
01:48:16,412 --> 01:48:19,609
Don't make me ashamed
in front of the others.

1052
01:48:19,682 --> 01:48:21,946
Shoot! Do me a favor.

1053
01:48:22,017 --> 01:48:23,211
Come on!

1054
01:48:23,285 --> 01:48:25,344
Go on, shoot, damn it.

1055
01:50:59,942 --> 01:51:01,432
Mama!

1056
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:04,411
Guess!
It's Pasqualino!

1057
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,670
Pasqualino is allve!

1058
01:51:06,749 --> 01:51:10,207
He's alive!
I don't believe it!

1059
01:51:11,287 --> 01:51:12,879
He's alive! Pasquali!

1060
01:51:22,531 --> 01:51:24,761
Pasquall!
My boy is all right!

1061
01:52:35,304 --> 01:52:38,501
And so you turned out
to be a whore too?

1062
01:52:41,276 --> 01:52:42,265
Yes.

1063
01:52:44,446 --> 01:52:47,472
And did you earn enough
to get along?

1064
01:52:48,784 --> 01:52:49,773
Yes.

1065
01:52:51,153 --> 01:52:53,246
Good.

1066
01:52:53,322 --> 01:52:55,722
You're giving it up.
We're getting married.

1067
01:52:55,791 --> 01:52:57,486
There isn't much time
to lose.

1068
01:52:57,559 --> 01:53:00,221
I want children.
Many children: 25, 30.

1069
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:03,289
It's a matter of self-defense.

1070
01:53:03,365 --> 01:53:04,855
They must be strong.

1071
01:53:07,569 --> 01:53:09,799
Look at the crowds
out there.

1072
01:53:09,872 --> 01:53:11,772
Soon, they'll be
murdering each other,

1073
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,603
families slaughtered,
for an apple.

1074
01:53:13,675 --> 01:53:16,269
So we must see to it
our family is large.

1075
01:53:16,345 --> 01:53:18,836
That'll be our defense,
understand?

1076
01:53:20,749 --> 01:53:22,614
I've always loved you
very much.

1077
01:53:23,619 --> 01:53:25,348
And I'm ready.

1078
01:53:29,124 --> 01:53:31,820
We'll get married,
the sooner the better.

1079
01:53:42,504 --> 01:53:44,938
PIease, Pasqualino,
don't worry.

1080
01:53:45,007 --> 01:53:47,703
Thank the Madonna
for returning you to us.

1081
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,801
One mustn't look back on
what's passed.

1082
01:53:49,878 --> 01:53:53,837
It's so senseless.
What's done is done.

1083
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:55,247
Look.

1084
01:53:56,251 --> 01:53:58,583
Look at yourself, my son:
you're beautiful.

1085
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,984
The war is ended.

1086
01:54:01,056 --> 01:54:03,616
It's useless to think
about these miseries.

1087
01:54:03,692 --> 01:54:06,593
Pasqualino, you're alive.

1088
01:54:07,463 --> 01:54:09,226
Alive!

1089
01:54:38,627 --> 01:54:39,889
Yes,

1090
01:54:39,962 --> 01:54:41,589
I'm alive.
