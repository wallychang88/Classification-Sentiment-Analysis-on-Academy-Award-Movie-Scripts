00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,248
Her life and her work
speak eloquently enough.

328
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,001
Twenty years ago,
she was the youngest leader...

329
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,670
...in the feminist movement.

330
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:34,756
Today she's a tremendous force
in the battle...

331
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:38,843
...to preserve and extend democracy.

332
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:42,972
Let us draw from her the inspiration
to use the freedom we have won...

333
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,267
...to defend the freedom of all.

334
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,869
- Well...
- Miss Harding.

335
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,709
You'd better park the car
and meet us at gate 2.

336
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,423
It made me feel very strange,
having Tess call me "aunt."

337
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,926
I've come to regard myself
so completely as her mother.

338
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,929
See, my sister died
when Tess was a little baby.

339
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,307
- Tess was once a baby?
- To begin with.

340
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,309
She and her father were in China.

341
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:11,728
I went out to take care of her.
And him.

342
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,646
- Interesting place, China.
- Yes.

343
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:17,150
Especially if you're a maiden aunt
teaching a Chinese nurse...

344
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:20,070
...things you don't know about.
Which reminds me...

345
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:25,158
...the Chiang Kai-sheks are having
an anniversary soon. I must tell Gerald.

346
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,078
- Hope we haven't ruined your day.
- No, not at all.

347
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,747
Kept me off the streets
and out of poolrooms.

348
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:32,749
- What's the matter, Sam?
- Nothing.

349
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:35,794
- Sure?
- Well, I can't quite figure you out.

350
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:38,296
What are you trying to prove?
Why am I here?

351
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,965
- Well, Sam...
- Nurmo could've driven you here.

352
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:42,967
Why did you ask me?

353
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:46,012
Thought you might want
to kiss me goodbye.

354
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,570
They're holding the plane for us.

355
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:06,199
Goodbye, Gerald. See you Monday?

356
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:09,035
- What time?
- Send you a wire?

357
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:12,998
Yeah, but you do it.
Don't have the little corporal do it.

358
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:17,252
ELLEN:
Goodbye.

359
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,010
Could I drop you somewhere,
Miss Whitcomb?

360
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:28,304
Drop the "Miss Whitcomb."
Sounds like a reproach.

361
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:30,849
Bet it has been,
to fellas who didn't know better.

362
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,768
Just for the record, Sam,
it wasn't that exciting.

363
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:36,813
There was only one
who should've and didn't.

364
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,940
The others did and shouldn't have.

365
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:41,609
- Going by my hotel?
- Right by. Which one is it?

366
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,654
- I warn you. I'll talk your ears off.
- It won't hurt.

367
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,906
What point are you trying
to make, Sam?

368
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:49,743
Maybe there isn't any point.

369
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,538
- You like your work, don't you?
- Uh-huh. More all the time.

370
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:57,083
I don't know why, either,
unless it's because I like people.

371
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,794
I like meeting them
and writing about them.

372
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,631
Unimportant people, though. Guess
that makes me an unimportant guy.

373
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,885
That makes you
a very important guy, Sam.

374
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:11,056
Not because you rate a byline,
but because you have a heart...

375
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,892
...a job you like to do and a future.

376
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,145
You're just a normal
human being, Sam.

377
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:20,899
Go on leading your normal human life.

378
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,902
That sounds fine.
How do you go about arranging it?

379
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,363
You mean, how do you go about
arranging it?

380
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,572
Yeah.

Well, I'd say marry the girl.

All right, I will.

384
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,711

peppering me with light lefts.

for an opening with me right cocked...

...but it don't come.
First round, pepper.

387
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,595
Second round...

388
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,139
- Hello, Sammy.
- Hi, Pinkie. Back booth empty?

389
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,725
Well, if it ain't, I'll empty it.

00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:03,149

393
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,533
He's telling me who you are.
You write for Sammy's paper.

394

Sure.

403

404
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,812
No. Another Scotch, maybe.

00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,522

As a diplomat's daughter, I've had

to international spies.

428
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:03,770
...of grouping Pareto
and Spengler together...

429
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:09,484
...because they both feel that democracy
is through, whereas actually...

430
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:15,240
...Spengler is the philosophical basis
for Fascism.

431
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,910
Or... No, he's not.

432
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,912

Well, actually, they both are.

In Madrid, I mean.

437
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:44,894
Um... After I came back,
I wrote a series of articles...

438
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:49,065
...which finally blossomed
into a regular column.

439
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:52,986
And I've lived happily ever after.

440
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:56,197

- I've never seen the Mississippi.

to school in Switzerland...
