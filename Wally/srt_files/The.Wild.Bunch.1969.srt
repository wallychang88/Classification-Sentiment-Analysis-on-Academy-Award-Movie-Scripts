1
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,930
Turn him over.

2
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,271
Oh, no!

3
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:27,187
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...

4
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,486
"...thou nor thy sons with thee...

5
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,827
"...least ye shall die.

6
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:35,227
"Look not thou upon
the wine when it is red...

7
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:39,838
"...and when it bringeth his color
in the cup when it moveth itself aright.

8
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,738
"...at the last it biteth
like a serpent...

9
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:44,848
"...and stingeth like an adder."

10
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,178
Now, folks...

11
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,259
...that's from the Good Book...

12
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,020
...but in this town...

13
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,690
...it's five cents a glass.

14
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,430
Five cents a glass.

15
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,200
Does anyone really think
that is the price of a drink?!

16
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,610
The price of a drink let him decide...

17
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:14,442
...who has lost his courage and pride...

18
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,212
...who lies a grovelling
heap of clay not far removed...

19
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,677
All's quiet, sir.

20
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:19,848
Let's fall in.

21
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:33,460
Follow me.

22
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,881
I beg your pardon.

23
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:55,052
- I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

24
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,313
Thank you.

25
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,653
May I?

26
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,153
Thank you.

27
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,564
Hey, Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

28
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,733
Look.

29
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,684
I don't care what you meant to do...

30
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,685
...I don't like what you did.

31
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:34,526
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

32
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,596
...and this railroad.

33
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,877
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

34
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,867
Yes, may I help you?

35
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,947
If they move, kill them.

36
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,119
Is he with them?

37
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,129
He's there.

38
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,889
Hold your fire! Get down!

39
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,560
Wait till they come out.

40
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,059
I can nail him.

41
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,731
I said, wait!

42
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,241
What if they go out the back?

43
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,081
It's covered. You two-bit
redneck peckerwood.

44
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,412
Abe.

45
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,263
I solemnly promise...

46
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:42,443
...God helping me...

47
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:45,944
I solemnly promise, God helping me...

48
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:50,005
...to abstain from all
fermented malt liquors...

49
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:52,945
...including wine, beer and cider.

50
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:57,025
...to abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer.

51
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,818
People marching down the street.
They'll pass by the horses.

52
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,219
We'll join them.

53
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,718
The Temperance Union?!

54
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,729
They should have been told.

55
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,000
Told what?

56
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:44,230
How long can anybody in this
manure pile keep his mouth shut?

57
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,091
"Yes we gather at the river

58
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:01,522
"The beautiful, beautiful river.

59
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,863
"Gather with the saints at the river."

60
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,092
Rifles.

61
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,432
One...

62
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:13,543
...no, three!

63
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,715
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

64
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,214
Get down.

65
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:26,954
Son-of-a-bitch!

66
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,215
Bounty hunters?

67
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,285
Hell, I wouldn't know.

68
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:33,895
Buck with Abe.

69
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,626
I kill them now?

70
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,736
Hold them here as long as you can.

71
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:42,406
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

72
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:00,758
When I kick him out, blast him.

73
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,328
We'll run for it.

74
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,828
Give me that gun.

75
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,659
"Oh the beautiful river.

76
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,440
"Gather with the saints at the river

77
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:16,499
"That flows by the throne of God."

78
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:17,506
Set?

79
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,939
Let's go!

80
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,122
Good luck, boys!

81
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,654
They're blowing this town to hell!

82
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,006
You trash!

83
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,039
Now you just hush now.

84
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,991
Hey, they was playing
"Gather at the River."

85
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,331
You know that one?

86
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:36,661
Sing it!

87
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,832
"Shall we gather at the river

88
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:44,742
"Where bright angel feet have trod."

89
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,034
Hurry!

90
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:14,035
"River that flows by the throne of God."

91
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,012
Come on, you lazy bastard!

92
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,271
I'm coming!

93
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,853
They've cleared out, for chrissake!

94
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,453
Let's go, T.C.!

95
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,045
Let's go!

96
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:29,580
Take him!

97
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,180
He's mine!

98
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:38,021
He's mine!

99
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,771
He's mine!

100
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,760
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

101
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,871
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

102
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,372
You know I shot him.

103
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,452
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?!

104
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:54,772
Daddy! Daddy!

105
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,553
Damn!

106
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,953
Damn, I can't get his money belt off!

107
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:05,123
You stupid damn fools!

108
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,564
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

109
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,464
I didn't! My first shot
killed this man right here!

110
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:12,905
Liar!

111
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:18,074
He shot that employee while I dropped
this bandit and them others too.

112
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,404
I must've killed all three of them.

113
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,075
What were we doing up on that roof?!

114
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,475
Liar!

115
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:26,316
Black liar!

116
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,476
Don't talk like that to me.

117
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,647
I'm sorry.

118
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:36,326
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

119
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,997
I think this will do pretty good.

120
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,838
Next time, plan the massacre carefully,
or I'll start with you.

121
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,348
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

122
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,189
Hey, stop!

123
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,350
Stop!

124
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,960
Feathers flew like a turkey!

125
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,630
They shouldn't have run.
They shouldn't have run.

126
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:13,861
Say!

127
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:25,312
Well, how'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

128
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,333
It's better than a hog-killing!

129
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:47,165
Get them out of here!

130
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:55,516
We're holding you and your railroad
responsible for this carnage!

131
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,085
Innocent people are dead!

132
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:01,916
Women dying and hurt because
you used our town as a battlefield!

133
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:05,527
The railroad is going to pay
for our loss of blood!

134
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:08,027
We were trying to catch outlaws!

135
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,857
You lured them in here!

136
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:13,768
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big payload for weeks!

137
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:15,667
We represent the law!

138
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,231
Pike, is that you?

139
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,570
I can ride.

140
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,300
I can ride.

141
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,651
I can't see, but I can ride.

142
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,912
No!

143
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,643
I can't ride.

144
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:00,912
Finish it.

145
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,966
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him a...

146
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:36,787
...decent burial?

147
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,186
He was a good man.

148
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,126
We should bury him.

149
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,636
He's dead!

150
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,127
With a lot of men to keep him company!

151
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,876
Too damn many!

152
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,047
I think the boys are right.

153
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:54,538
I'd like to say a few words
for the dear dead departed.

154
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,048
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

155
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,388
Followed by a church supper...

156
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:01,888
...with a choir!

157
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:05,229
You crazy bastards, both of you!

158
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,800
Bishop, Engstrom...

159
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,740
...the Gorch brothers!

160
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:24,821
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

161
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,252
When the money value
of the men you killed...

162
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:32,191
...less my commission adds up to $500!

163
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,433
Any one of those pelts would have
not only cleared you with the company...

164
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,532
...but have given you money
to raise hell with!

165
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,763
We'll do better next time!

166
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,594
We'll do anything you say, but we'd
appreciate liquor money tonight.

167
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:49,433
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

168
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:52,604
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

169
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,044
And if any one of you
tries to quit on me...

170
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:58,045
...I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

171
00:20:58,285 --> 00:20:59,615
...to the man that kills him!

172
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,627
Let's pack it up then!

173
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:25,078
- Why should I let you go with them?
- We've been over that.

174
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:28,147
You might join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

175
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:32,758
What I like and what I need
are two different things. Listen.

176
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:36,658
I don't want to go back
to prison, never again.

177
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,799
But it's got to be my way!
But I need some good men!

178
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,699
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

179
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,470
You use what you have and see to it
that it doesn't happen again...

180
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,900
...or I'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

181
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,900
Try to run, I'll be after you.

182
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,100
I gave my word.

183
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,110
We'll see what it's worth!

184
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:53,410
Six minutes.

185
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:55,610
Tell me...

186
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,410
...how's it feel...

187
00:21:57,621 --> 00:21:59,281
...getting paid for it?

188
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:05,192
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

189
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:08,123
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

190
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,023
Good.

191
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,532
You dirty son-of-a-bitch!

192
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:15,872
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days to get back to Yuma.

193
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,943
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

194
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:23,444
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

195
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:27,384
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

196
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,576
I don't see nothing so
lindo about it.

197
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,408
Just looks like more of Texas to me.

198
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,077
You have no eyes.

199
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:30,951
Got a half hour of light. Let's go.

200
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:46,963
Hello, little fella.

201
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,688
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!

202
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:33,948
None of them?

203
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:38,358
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

204
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,132
About the sharing up.

205
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:18,142
It will be the same as always.

206
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:23,083
Me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

207
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:27,513
He's just starting out, and this is
our opening for a new territory.

208
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:28,714
That's right.

209
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:33,853
I figure a share to that old goat for
watching the horses is a share too much.

210
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,765
So, we decided...

211
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,655
...it ain't fair.

212
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:47,876
If you two don't like equal shares, why
the hell don't you just take all of it?

213
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,876
Why don't you answer me,
you damned yellow trash?!

214
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:56,607
Now, Pike, you know...

215
00:25:56,786 --> 00:26:01,277
I don't know a damned thing except
I either lead this bunch or end it now.

216
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,298
We divide it up like you say.

217
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,199
Chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick.

218
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,490
Silver rings.

219
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:37,721
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

220
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:39,931
Bastards!

221
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,591
Washers!

222
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:54,013
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

223
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,343
They set it up!

224
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:59,453
They? Who in the hell is "they"?!

225
00:27:05,193 --> 00:27:06,684
"They"?!

226
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,124
"They" is just plain and fancy "they."

227
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,705
That's who "they" is.

228
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:16,865
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

229
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,865
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

230
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:23,776
Oh, my, what a bunch!

231
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:25,706
Big tough ones!

232
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:31,486
Here you are with a handful
of holes, a thumb up your ass...

233
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:35,227
...and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

234
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:37,227
"They"!

235
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:39,557
Who the hell is "they"?

236
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:46,799
Railroad men.

237
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:49,168
Bounty hunters.

238
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:51,908
Deke Thornton.

239
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,179
Deke Thornton?

240
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,809
He was one of them?

241
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,420
How come you didn't know that?

242
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,521
Hey, gringo.

243
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,420
You can have my silver.

244
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,690
Come on, don't kill me.

245
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:20,212
You can have the silver.

246
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:23,272
But don't kill me.

247
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:25,442
Please.

248
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:31,353
Go on...

249
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:33,344
...go for it.

250
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:35,794
Fall apart.

251
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,563
Walk softly, boys.

252
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:11,498
What's our next move?

253
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:14,658
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

254
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:16,908
Three days, maybe.

255
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,669
We'll get news and go to the border.

256
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,768
Maybe a payroll or bank.

257
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,109
Maybe that damn railroad!

258
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,118
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure isn't getting no easier.

259
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,909
And you boys ain't getting any younger.

260
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,420
We must start thinking beyond our guns.

261
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:37,860
Those days are closing fast.

262
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:50,141
All your planning and talking
damn near got us shot...

263
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:53,142
...over a few lousy bags of washers.

264
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:57,042
This was going to be
me and Tector's last job!

265
00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:00,153
We spent all our time and
money getting ready for this!

266
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:05,323
You spent time and money running whores
while I spent my stake setting it up!

267
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:18,675
I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

268
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:21,404
While you did the planning...

269
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:24,744
...me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

270
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:27,345
...two mind you, Hondo whores!

271
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:34,246
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

272
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,486
He was.

273
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:43,757
You were matching whores...

274
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,267
...in tandem!

275
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,198
What's that?

276
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,198
One behind the other.

277
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,278
That's right!
That's what we was doing!

278
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:18,791
Mr. Thornton.

279
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:25,142
You rode with Pike.

280
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:28,811
What kind of man we up against?

281
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:30,311
The best.

282
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,153
He never got caught.

283
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,175
This was going to be my last.

284
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,016
Ain't getting around any better.

285
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,377
I'd like to make one
good score and back off.

286
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:22,877
Back off to what?

287
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:38,730
Have you got anything lined up?

288
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:46,400
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

289
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,642
Every one of those garrisons
will get a payroll.

290
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,581
That kind of information
is kind of hard to come by.

291
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:58,512
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

292
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:02,852
He'll be waiting for us.

293
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,923
I wouldn't have it any other way.

294
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:23,174
Come on Pike, let's go.

295
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:26,114
You sound like you're all caught up.

296
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,944
Enough to know we've overstayed
our welcome.

297
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:30,944
What's wrong with you?

298
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,555
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and no worries.

299
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:37,626
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

300
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,056
How can you be so damn sure?

301
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:42,626
Being sure is my business.

302
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:45,197
Being sure is my business.

303
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:49,137
Hold it!

304
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:50,708
Relax.

305
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:53,068
It's just some champagne we ordered.

306
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:56,708
Relax, it's just some champagne.

307
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,478
Being sure is my business.

308
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,589
Did you get him?

309
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,430
No, he got away.

310
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,440
You sure must have hurt that railroad.

311
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,000
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

312
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,241
I caught up with them.

313
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:27,671
Two or three times.

314
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:29,682
There was a man named Harrigan.

315
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:31,682
He used to have a way of doing things.

316
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,121
I made him change his ways.

317
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:37,952
And a hell of a lot of people...

318
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:40,962
...just can't stand to be wrong.

319
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,123
Pride.

320
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,693
And they can't forget it.

321
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,634
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

322
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:57,705
How about us?

323
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:00,485
You reckon we learned...

324
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:02,145
...being wrong today?

325
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,224
I sure hope to God we did.

326
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,008
Them's hot.

327
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,318
Hot damn!

328
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:39,529
Where in hell did you find him?

329
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:41,689
He ran with Thornton and me.

330
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,599
Did his share of killing, and more.

331
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,199
Around Langtry.

332
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,840
Only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

333
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,583
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

334
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:53,996
Watch out, boys!

335
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:56,107
Take it easy!

336
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,178
Keep his head up!
What's wrong with you?!

337
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,017
Watch him, Tector!

338
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,700
Goddamn! Son-of-a-bitch!

339
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,529
Get the horses up!

340
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,640
What the hell is going...

341
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,700
- Damned clumsy old bastard!
- Get up!

342
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,381
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

343
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,052
Help!

344
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,161
Get over here! Help!

345
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:43,832
What's the matter with you, old man?!

346
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:45,562
Leave him alone!

347
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:50,233
He'll get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

348
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:54,463
You better not! We're sticking
together, like it used to be.

349
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:58,844
When you side with a man, you stay with
him. If you can't, you're an animal!

350
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:00,674
You're finished!

351
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:03,184
We're finished! All of us!

352
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:11,186
Mount up.

353
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,647
Appears Brother Pike needs help.

354
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,317
That Brother Pike
and the old man Sykes...

355
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,428
...makes me wonder if it ain't time...

356
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:40,958
...to pick up my chips
and find another game.

357
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,840
How can you side anybody
when you can't get on your horse?

358
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:30,339
That was a fine talk you gave the boys
about sticking together.

359
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,020
That Gorch came near killing me.

360
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,280
Or me him.

361
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:41,622
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

362
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:45,361
- We start together, we'll end together.
- That's how I see it.

363
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,632
That's the way it's always been with me.

364
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:51,362
Sorry about Deke.

365
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,302
I never figured him that way.

366
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,802
Say...

367
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:57,473
...back there in Starbuck...

368
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,313
...how did my boy do?

369
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:02,313
Your boy?

370
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:03,713
Crazy Lee?

371
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:06,153
Yes, C.L. Clarence Lee.

372
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:09,314
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

373
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:12,654
I kill'em now? I kill'em now?

374
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:14,665
No, you just hold them here.

375
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:20,165
Why didn't you say
he was your grandson?

376
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:23,836
You had enough things on your mind.

377
00:41:24,746 --> 00:41:27,676
Besides, he must pull his own weight
like the rest of us.

378
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:33,517
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down when things got hot.

379
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,687
He did fine.

380
00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:39,587
Just fine.

381
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,390
All clear!

382
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:25,571
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

383
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:28,812
What's the closest town of any size?

384
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:31,243
Agua Verde.

385
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,483
What's in Agua Verde?

386
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,744
Mexicans, what else?

387
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:43,764
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

388
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:45,664
Mapache territory.

389
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,605
Don't we follow?

390
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,304
No, we go back and wait.

391
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:55,765
We're supposed...

392
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:57,436
Shut up!

393
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,945
Why won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

394
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:05,956
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

395
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,356
I have invited you to my village.

396
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:12,297
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

397
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,958
...I will kill you.

398
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,297
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

399
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:20,207
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

400
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:21,708
You got a sister?

401
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,479
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...

402
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:26,809
...and that of your mama too.

403
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,209
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

404
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,731
How bad was it?

405
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,232
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

406
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:58,742
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

407
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,852
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they protect you?

408
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:04,183
They were federal troops...

409
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,912
...commissioned by the traitor Huerta.

410
00:44:07,422 --> 00:44:09,513
And the soldier who shot my father?

411
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:11,023
What was his name?

412
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:14,863
- What does it matter?
- Your father died like a man.

413
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,524
The names are not important.

414
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:19,605
How was he called?

415
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:22,095
Mapache.

416
00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:24,434
That is name enough.

417
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:27,875
In Mexico...

418
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,036
...these are the years of sadness.

419
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:32,786
But if we had...

420
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:34,716
...rifles like these...

421
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,046
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

422
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:44,956
She went with them
because she wished to.

423
00:44:45,737 --> 00:44:47,727
She became the woman of Mapache...

424
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:51,057
...and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

425
00:44:51,638 --> 00:44:54,238
Drunk with wine and love.

426
00:44:55,578 --> 00:45:00,068
To him, Teresa was a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

427
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:03,089
I tell you, she was a mango...

428
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:04,739
...ripe and waiting.

429
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:08,319
Angel dreams of love and
Mapache eats the mango.

430
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,661
That's a good trick.

431
00:45:26,012 --> 00:45:28,102
Now I find that hard to believe.

432
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,841
Not so hard.

433
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:35,182
We all dream of being a child again.

434
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,523
Even the worst of us.

435
00:45:41,463 --> 00:45:43,864
Perhaps the worst most of all.

436
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:47,364
You know what we are?

437
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,033
Yes, just so, the both of you!

438
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,364
And you!

439
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:01,705
Where is Mapache?!

440
00:46:09,556 --> 00:46:11,896
All right, Pike? All right?

441
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:17,997
Hey, Tector, let's swap!

442
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,997
Come on, let's swap!

443
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,408
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

444
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,259
Why do you wish to know?

445
00:46:42,029 --> 00:46:43,259
For your father?

446
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,259
Or the whore?

447
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,371
Either you learn to live with it...

448
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:54,611
...or we'll leave you here.

449
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:02,772
I go with you.

450
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:36,145
You know what I'm going to do?
Steal his girl.

451
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:37,925
You are?

452
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,086
Here I go.

453
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,917
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

454
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:46,926
Come on, lady!

455
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:10,827
No gringos.

456
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:13,558
Only federales.

457
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,069
All soldiers...

458
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:29,910
...no bounty hunters in sight.

459
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:49,692
Now, what the hell is that?

460
00:52:04,214 --> 00:52:05,273
Atención!

461
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:21,966
I saw one just like it in Waco.

462
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:23,966
Run on steam?

463
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:25,906
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

464
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,406
You know what I heard?

465
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:31,477
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

466
00:52:31,647 --> 00:52:34,086
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

467
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:38,918
No, the old man's right. They've got
motors and wings, go 60 miles an hour.

468
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,818
Going to use them in the war.

469
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:44,588
Let's talk to the General...

470
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,998
...about his automobile
and our extra horses.

471
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,589
Nice and easy.

472
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:58,675
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

473
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:04,176
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

474
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:08,187
Since the Generalissimo cleaned out
this area, he ought to have a lot.

475
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,917
Generalissimo, hell.

476
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:14,187
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

477
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:16,357
Like some others I could mention.

478
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:21,199
Not so as you'd know it.

479
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:25,099
But we ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

480
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:32,279
I hope someday these people kick
the scum like him into their graves.

481
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,379
We will.

482
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,380
If it takes forever!

483
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:45,952
General!

484
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:19,765
Lookie here.

485
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:28,335
Good looking old pony, ain't he?

486
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:38,776
Boy, do you know those beauties?

487
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,031
Come on.

488
00:56:24,602 --> 00:56:25,871
She was my woman.

489
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,202
I know.

490
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:50,564
Sure ain't your woman no more.

491
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:57,465
Just look at her licking
inside that General's ear.

492
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,509
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

493
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,938
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

494
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,190
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

495
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,372
Are you with the American Army?

496
00:58:05,722 --> 00:58:08,983
No, we're not associated with anybody.

497
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:11,983
I see.

498
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:16,323
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

499
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:19,984
...is strictly for the use
of army personnel.

500
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:23,064
It can't be purchased or even owned...

501
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:24,225
...legally.

502
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:25,725
Is that so?

503
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:27,674
Weapons are my specialty.

504
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:31,504
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

505
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:37,256
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

506
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:41,257
...who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

507
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,756
We share very few sentiments
with our government.

508
00:58:50,937 --> 00:58:52,867
He's inviting us for a drink.

509
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:58,378
Good.

510
00:58:59,378 --> 00:59:00,438
Good.

511
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:19,720
Shoot him.

512
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,130
Bang.

513
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:34,572
I gave it to him, T.C.

514
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,685
Here?

515
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,945
No, no, not there!

516
01:00:19,797 --> 01:00:21,787
Wait, what are you going to do?

517
01:00:23,307 --> 01:00:25,797
We got to show a little class here.

518
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,830
Right here!

519
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:50,990
It must be that garrison rail spur.

520
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:55,331
It's the easiest to hit, but I must find
a way to get it out of there.

521
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,832
What do you think?

522
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,171
Getting close to home.

523
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:03,841
Look at them gathered around the table.

524
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:09,082
Here we sit like kitchen help.

525
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:11,922
Why do you want us to hit that train?

526
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:14,923
Can't the General take over
the whole thing?

527
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:19,423
General Huerta is anxious
to better relations with the U. S...

528
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:23,203
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.

529
01:01:23,703 --> 01:01:26,764
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

530
01:01:26,944 --> 01:01:28,534
How'd you find out about this?

531
01:01:28,704 --> 01:01:33,613
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
organized by my commanding officer.

532
01:01:34,044 --> 01:01:35,204
Now, gentlemen...

533
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:37,114
...we are well organized.

534
01:01:37,785 --> 01:01:40,445
And we'll able to pay 10,000...

535
01:01:40,725 --> 01:01:42,125
...in gold.

536
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:46,786
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.

537
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:49,896
We can do it. But we're
going to need equipment.

538
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:52,066
Do not worry.

539
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:55,056
Our accountant will take care of it.

540
01:01:58,477 --> 01:01:59,907
My General...

541
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:03,968
...soon you will be the best
equipped general in Mexico.

542
01:02:05,648 --> 01:02:07,077
Look here...

543
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:09,478
...ain't he the one.

544
01:02:12,088 --> 01:02:13,079
To the host!

545
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,660
With your permission...

546
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:27,430
...I need a bath.

547
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,171
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

548
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:34,681
I don't!

549
01:02:35,681 --> 01:02:38,452
What me and Tector need
is them women you're hogging.

550
01:02:38,952 --> 01:02:40,681
Can you fix that up for us?

551
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:47,452
Gentlemen...

552
01:02:47,632 --> 01:02:49,122
...you will excuse me.

553
01:02:49,302 --> 01:02:51,293
I'm sure.

554
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:56,864
Herrera.

555
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:58,703
Let's get Angel.

556
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:13,816
I need him.

557
01:03:13,995 --> 01:03:16,655
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

558
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,816
If you don't mind,
I'll make my own choice.

559
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,347
All right.

560
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,518
He is not important to me.

561
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:40,748
Take him.

562
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:49,029
I think we'll get the wagon now.

563
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,030
Hey, here come our sweeties.

564
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:06,280
Ain't them pretty?

565
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,941
I don't know about yours,
Lyle, but I think...

566
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:11,882
...I got more than I can handle.

567
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:24,572
Hey, get out of them...

568
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:27,573
Hey, you know what they told me?

569
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:31,973
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

570
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:33,574
Is that right?

571
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:34,904
That's right.

572
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:38,644
I tell you Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

573
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:43,085
Let's have a little target.

574
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:45,915
She won't get away. Turn her loose.

575
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,606
Why not!

576
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:25,129
Tector, look at them beauties!

577
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:55,173
How in the hell
can you stand it that hot?

578
01:05:56,003 --> 01:05:59,403
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

579
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:07,004
Hell, Lyle, look here.

580
01:06:12,424 --> 01:06:16,255
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

581
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:22,084
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

582
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:27,206
I'm not going to steal guns for that
devil to rob and kill my people again.

583
01:06:27,436 --> 01:06:29,596
Noble, noble. Very noble.

584
01:06:29,776 --> 01:06:34,037
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks
when you rode in from Starbuck.

585
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:36,617
They were not my people.

586
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:39,537
I care about my people, my village.

587
01:06:41,057 --> 01:06:44,887
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

588
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:47,118
If it does, you don't go along.

589
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,558
Then I don't go along.

590
01:06:49,898 --> 01:06:53,888
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

591
01:06:55,398 --> 01:06:57,629
Think about all the money you'll have.

592
01:06:57,808 --> 01:07:00,399
Buy them a ranch.
Move them 1,000 miles.

593
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:03,299
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

594
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,810
A very small one.

595
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,740
Don't you see? This is their land.

596
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,420
And no one will drive them away.

597
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,810
I'll drink to that sentiment.

598
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:15,481
And to love.

599
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,751
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

600
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:39,344
You're a pain in the ass.

601
01:07:39,784 --> 01:07:43,345
Would you give guns
to someone to kill your father...

602
01:07:43,524 --> 01:07:45,354
...or mother or brother?

603
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:49,285
Ten thousand cuts
an awful lot of family ties.

604
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:52,195
My people have no guns.

605
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,625
But with guns...

606
01:07:56,475 --> 01:07:57,805
...my people could fight.

607
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:01,535
If I could take guns...

608
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,966
...I would come with you.

609
01:08:04,216 --> 01:08:08,977
How many cases of rifles did
Zamora say was in the shipment?

610
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:10,487
Sixteen.

611
01:08:13,827 --> 01:08:14,717
Give him one.

612
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,329
All right.

613
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:33,569
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

614
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:35,569
I will.

615
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:38,179
We know you will.

616
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,840
We've got that settled.

617
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,850
Why, you reprobate!

618
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:00,772
Boys...

619
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:05,273
...I want you to meet my fiancée.

620
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,272
They just got engaged.

621
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:11,943
I'm a son-of-a-bitch!

622
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:14,554
Trot them right in, fellas.

623
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:19,294
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

624
01:09:26,065 --> 01:09:29,235
You want to gamble everything on
this one shipment being attacked?

625
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:31,965
If they're in Agua Verde,
they'll try for it.

626
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:35,236
- Lf? What about Juárez?
- We would have heard about it.

627
01:09:35,646 --> 01:09:38,477
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

628
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,317
And who in hell is Mapache?

629
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:43,246
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

630
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,256
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

631
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:48,827
But with enough guns, he can become
a power in northern Mexico.

632
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:51,157
Pike will try to get them for him.

633
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:53,428
The train will be guarded with troops.

634
01:09:53,598 --> 01:09:57,158
Not regular troops.
Green recruits, not worth a damn.

635
01:09:57,669 --> 01:10:00,338
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

636
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:01,839
And not this...

637
01:10:02,008 --> 01:10:04,339
...gutter trash you've given me.

638
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:08,179
What you've got is 24 more days.

639
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:24,691
Never told me how you got
all tore up like that.

640
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:27,361
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

641
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:46,153
Your husband coming back?

642
01:10:46,394 --> 01:10:47,554
No.

643
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:49,724
He's never coming back.

644
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:55,995
But you are late.

645
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:58,004
Two days late.

646
01:10:58,174 --> 01:10:59,395
She had a husband.

647
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:02,346
If I had any sense, I'd have killed him.

648
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,675
He wasn't around.

649
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:08,675
I got careless.

650
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,346
One night, he walked in on us.

651
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:15,516
Caught her with the first shot,
and got me here on the second.

652
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:17,917
Then the coward turned and ran.

653
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:40,778
Ever catch him?

654
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:45,460
No, but there isn't an hour that
passes that I don't think about it.

655
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,120
Come on! We've got a long way!

656
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,630
This is our last go around, Dutch.

657
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:55,231
This time, we do it right.

658
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:47,193
Just do your work.

659
01:17:42,288 --> 01:17:43,448
Let's go!

660
01:18:15,161 --> 01:18:17,092
They're coming!

661
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:31,433
They're coming!

662
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:33,933
Faster!

663
01:18:50,535 --> 01:18:51,465
Get over!

664
01:20:16,124 --> 01:20:18,395
Help them! Get that ramp up!

665
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,394
Get that horse out of here!

666
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:23,226
Bring them out! Get them out!

667
01:20:23,395 --> 01:20:24,954
Get over there!

668
01:20:25,135 --> 01:20:28,575
Get some order there!
Get those horses!

669
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:04,940
Hurry!

670
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:06,609
Your horse kicked me.

671
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,340
Run them up along here!

672
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,441
Where is my horse?

673
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,691
Hey, we got grenades!

674
01:21:19,861 --> 01:21:22,191
- Hurry! We must go!
- Be careful!

675
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:24,631
Let's go on this.

676
01:21:30,142 --> 01:21:30,972
Here we go.

677
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,203
Line up in two columns!

678
01:21:37,713 --> 01:21:40,043
Corporal, give us a hand here!

679
01:21:43,054 --> 01:21:44,714
We're all ready!

680
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:34,039
Let's go!

681
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:36,939
Let's go!

682
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:44,617
Get after that horse!

683
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:46,946
That was my horse!

684
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:48,357
Get after him!

685
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:51,017
Get out!

686
01:23:53,197 --> 01:23:55,798
Get that damn horse off my butt!

687
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:58,368
Get the horse out! The train's coming!

688
01:23:58,538 --> 01:23:59,868
- Train?
- The train's coming!

689
01:24:00,038 --> 01:24:00,699
Where?

690
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:01,969
What train?

691
01:24:02,139 --> 01:24:03,628
I don't see any tr...

692
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:11,140
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

693
01:24:40,182 --> 01:24:43,413
Corporal! Ride back
to the telegraph at Todos Malos...

694
01:24:43,582 --> 01:24:46,353
...and tell them the railroad deputies
robbed the train...

695
01:24:46,523 --> 01:24:47,753
...and we're in pursuit!

696
01:24:48,193 --> 01:24:49,424
Yes, sir!

697
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:56,194
Come on!

698
01:26:16,193 --> 01:26:17,623
Damn son-of-a...!

699
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:20,852
Come on! It's lit!

700
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:33,035
Get them horses going!

701
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:54,887
Don't shoot! It's the army!

702
01:27:04,908 --> 01:27:05,899
Come on!

703
01:28:09,415 --> 01:28:10,905
Let's go!

704
01:28:15,586 --> 01:28:17,415
Come on, you lazy bastard!

705
01:28:17,595 --> 01:28:19,756
I'm coming, damn it!

706
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:37,947
Is it all right?

707
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:41,178
Where will they meet us?

708
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:43,518
Agua Verde or before.

709
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:47,619
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

710
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:50,278
Least we won't have to worry about Deke.

711
01:28:51,529 --> 01:28:54,859
Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

712
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:59,470
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

713
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:18,845
I would like to get hold of that
fool horse of mine.

714
01:31:19,295 --> 01:31:22,194
Some Mex kid's probably
riding him home right now.

715
01:31:22,365 --> 01:31:25,295
I don't see how I could've
lost both my boots.

716
01:31:25,966 --> 01:31:27,866
They were hard to get on.

717
01:31:28,035 --> 01:31:29,626
The river sucked them off.

718
01:31:29,806 --> 01:31:31,867
That dynamite helped some.

719
01:31:32,036 --> 01:31:35,976
Maybe the same kid riding
T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots.

720
01:31:37,207 --> 01:31:38,647
You stupid bastards!

721
01:31:39,317 --> 01:31:41,476
Why did you fire at the soldiers?

722
01:31:42,047 --> 01:31:43,707
Huey started firing at them.

723
01:31:44,047 --> 01:31:45,388
I tried to stop him.

724
01:31:45,557 --> 01:31:46,888
One of the bandits...

725
01:31:47,058 --> 01:31:48,318
Don't blame me!

726
01:31:48,488 --> 01:31:49,218
Liar!

727
01:31:49,728 --> 01:31:51,319
Shut your mouths!

728
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:53,388
Are we following?

729
01:31:53,559 --> 01:31:55,828
Yes, or you'll face a firing squad.

730
01:31:58,898 --> 01:32:00,729
Come on, T.C.!

731
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:04,670
My hair's wet!

732
01:32:41,384 --> 01:32:44,284
Impossible! We have
no arms or ammunition.

733
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,621
They assaulted the train!

734
01:33:51,962 --> 01:33:53,362
They got the guns.

735
01:33:56,862 --> 01:33:58,202
We must go!

736
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:02,962
Take the necessary people and
take the road to Agua Verde.

737
01:34:03,142 --> 01:34:06,473
Convince them to give you the guns.
I wait at the village.

738
01:35:32,972 --> 01:35:34,802
He's still heading east.

739
01:35:37,912 --> 01:35:40,402
Are they bluffing, or did they miss it?

740
01:35:45,054 --> 01:35:46,884
I'd say they missed it.

741
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,444
Take a look.

742
01:35:51,565 --> 01:35:53,223
There's only five left.

743
01:36:01,575 --> 01:36:02,966
Hell, we lost them.

744
01:36:03,135 --> 01:36:04,296
I don't see how.

745
01:36:04,476 --> 01:36:07,636
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

746
01:36:07,816 --> 01:36:12,306
There was but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this is it.

747
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:14,076
They didn't take it out.

748
01:36:14,486 --> 01:36:17,247
We haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

749
01:36:17,757 --> 01:36:19,416
Sit still, damn it!

750
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:22,087
You think they aren't watching us?

751
01:36:22,597 --> 01:36:25,258
They know what this is about.
What do I have?

752
01:36:25,598 --> 01:36:28,587
Nothing but you
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

753
01:36:28,768 --> 01:36:30,827
...with not even 60 rounds between you.

754
01:36:31,168 --> 01:36:32,828
We're after men.

755
01:36:33,338 --> 01:36:35,599
And I wish to God I was with them.

756
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:39,939
The next time you make a mistake,
I'll ride off and let you die.

757
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,778
Come on.

758
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,291
I never figured they'd
come down here after us.

759
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:57,072
How much you reckon
we could be worth?

760
01:36:57,141 --> 01:36:59,730
Depends on how hungry they are.

761
01:37:03,311 --> 01:37:06,141
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

762
01:37:06,312 --> 01:37:08,802
I'll go and start rigging the fireworks.

763
01:37:08,983 --> 01:37:10,142
All right.

764
01:37:15,093 --> 01:37:18,082
Get that case of explosives
off the back there!

765
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:22,593
Hand me down those blasting caps.

766
01:37:30,105 --> 01:37:32,165
What you doing with the dynamite?

767
01:37:33,845 --> 01:37:37,675
I figure Mapache will try to take
this load without paying for it...

768
01:37:37,845 --> 01:37:39,445
...and shoot us as well.

769
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,786
The thing to change his mind
is something happening to the guns.

770
01:37:44,956 --> 01:37:47,187
I'm making sure something could happen.

771
01:37:47,356 --> 01:37:49,847
Hey, Pike, take a look at this.

772
01:37:50,966 --> 01:37:52,127
Can you handle that?

773
01:37:54,467 --> 01:37:57,527
What I don't know,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

774
01:39:07,285 --> 01:39:09,445
My people are here for their guns.

775
01:39:14,885 --> 01:39:17,115
You were supposed to be guarding us.

776
01:39:17,295 --> 01:39:19,125
I never heard them,
didn't even see them.

777
01:39:33,747 --> 01:39:37,908
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

778
01:39:38,478 --> 01:39:41,148
But only by caution
do they remain alive.

779
01:39:46,589 --> 01:39:48,819
Tell them not to break that fuse.

780
01:39:51,429 --> 01:39:53,330
These people from your village?

781
01:39:53,499 --> 01:39:56,260
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

782
01:39:56,670 --> 01:40:00,830
They are puro Indio and
these mountains belong to them.

783
01:40:23,632 --> 01:40:26,693
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

784
01:40:26,873 --> 01:40:28,703
They've fought Apaches
for a 1,000 years.

785
01:40:28,803 --> 01:40:30,294
That's a sure way to learn.

786
01:40:30,874 --> 01:40:34,814
If they ever get armed, this whole
country will go up in smoke.

787
01:40:34,975 --> 01:40:37,465
That it will, son. That it will.

788
01:40:38,385 --> 01:40:40,975
They made damn fools out of us.

789
01:40:42,715 --> 01:40:47,655
A man can't sleep with both eyes closed
for fear of getting his throat cut.

790
01:40:47,826 --> 01:40:48,726
Where were you?

791
01:40:49,226 --> 01:40:50,886
You listen to me.

792
01:40:51,066 --> 01:40:55,996
If you get up and help once in a while,
I wouldn't got caught so easy.

793
01:41:11,518 --> 01:41:14,678
With the new guns and ammunition,
this couldn't have happened.

794
01:41:41,221 --> 01:41:43,452
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

795
01:41:43,621 --> 01:41:45,782
- Bring them on!
- Come on!

796
01:42:00,073 --> 01:42:01,564
Come on, horse!

797
01:42:15,425 --> 01:42:16,485
Hold up!

798
01:42:16,655 --> 01:42:17,985
Whoa there!

799
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:21,415
Mapache's?

800
01:42:22,095 --> 01:42:23,755
Let's hope they aren't Villa's.

801
01:42:37,676 --> 01:42:39,337
We are friends.

802
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:41,677
We are from el General Mapache.

803
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:44,018
Tell the one in front to come here.

804
01:42:44,187 --> 01:42:45,448
Alone.

805
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,689
I am coming.

806
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,859
I am your friend, remember?

807
01:42:58,199 --> 01:42:59,639
We are friends.

808
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,139
All of us.

809
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:05,030
I bring you love and affection
from el General.

810
01:43:09,051 --> 01:43:11,710
You bring the guns with you?

811
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:16,381
What bravery you have done!

812
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:19,881
I am to escort you to the General.

813
01:43:21,732 --> 01:43:23,322
Tell him to come closer.

814
01:43:23,502 --> 01:43:24,482
I hear.

815
01:43:25,563 --> 01:43:27,662
I am coming, my friend.

816
01:43:31,503 --> 01:43:32,563
Recognize this?

817
01:43:41,754 --> 01:43:45,014
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

818
01:43:51,595 --> 01:43:53,086
Very smart!

819
01:43:53,265 --> 01:43:56,526
That's very smart for you
damn gringos.

820
01:43:56,706 --> 01:43:58,537
So nobody can rob the guns.

821
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:00,427
Nobody.

822
01:44:00,706 --> 01:44:02,366
I am not afraid.

823
01:44:02,535 --> 01:44:04,206
They are not afraid.

824
01:44:04,376 --> 01:44:06,437
You blow up the wagon, you die.

825
01:44:06,606 --> 01:44:08,207
Or we kill you pretty soon.

826
01:44:09,217 --> 01:44:10,707
But we are amigos.

827
01:44:11,047 --> 01:44:12,378
Show them, boys.

828
01:44:25,299 --> 01:44:27,059
Start the ball, Tector.

829
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,809
Please cut the fuse.

830
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,311
Please.

831
01:45:20,295 --> 01:45:23,455
El General waits
in Agua Verde to meet with you.

832
01:45:23,635 --> 01:45:27,125
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

833
01:45:27,865 --> 01:45:29,356
Any trouble...

834
01:45:29,705 --> 01:45:30,696
...no guns.

835
01:45:45,657 --> 01:45:47,317
Damn gringos!

836
01:46:22,691 --> 01:46:25,252
Get them up there! Get them over!

837
01:46:32,873 --> 01:46:35,702
Get up there! Get up!

838
01:47:01,305 --> 01:47:02,566
You bring the guns?

839
01:47:03,305 --> 01:47:05,296
Don't worry, we've got them.

840
01:47:06,077 --> 01:47:07,136
Hidden.

841
01:47:09,316 --> 01:47:12,646
When I get my share of the gold,
2,500 dollars' worth...

842
01:47:12,816 --> 01:47:15,146
...I'll tell you where four cases are.

843
01:47:16,487 --> 01:47:19,147
The others are waiting
for me at the wagon.

844
01:47:19,488 --> 01:47:22,258
If I don't show up pretty
quick, they'll blow it.

845
01:47:22,758 --> 01:47:26,428
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fool me.

846
01:47:27,168 --> 01:47:30,098
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

847
01:47:32,269 --> 01:47:33,929
When do we get our guns?

848
01:47:34,109 --> 01:47:37,440
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

849
01:47:41,619 --> 01:47:42,840
Open it up.

850
01:47:54,961 --> 01:47:57,361
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

851
01:47:57,532 --> 01:47:59,971
...you'll find three cases of rifles...

852
01:48:00,202 --> 01:48:02,972
...and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush.

853
01:48:10,883 --> 01:48:13,144
I understand you have a machine gun.

854
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:18,713
Our contract called for
16 cases of rifles...

855
01:48:18,893 --> 01:48:21,324
...and ammunition for $10,000.

856
01:48:21,494 --> 01:48:23,154
Not a machine gun.

857
01:48:26,664 --> 01:48:28,895
That's our present to the General.

858
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,995
Gringo, you fight with Mapache.

859
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,846
I'll think about it.

860
01:48:41,746 --> 01:48:44,186
In case he don't find them...

861
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:45,677
Go.

862
01:48:46,016 --> 01:48:47,687
I trust him.

863
01:49:13,049 --> 01:49:14,879
Why don't you stir up some grub?

864
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,950
Why don't you go to hell?

865
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:31,462
Shit!

866
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:34,972
Damn it!

867
01:49:36,472 --> 01:49:40,141
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

868
01:49:40,312 --> 01:49:41,472
You whip me?

869
01:49:42,252 --> 01:49:43,302
Nope.

870
01:49:43,483 --> 01:49:46,313
But you better hope
I don't get riled enough...

871
01:49:46,483 --> 01:49:48,924
...to dog you when this is over.

872
01:49:49,253 --> 01:49:52,284
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

873
01:49:52,924 --> 01:49:54,654
We'll see.

874
01:49:55,435 --> 01:49:56,864
We'll see.

875
01:49:58,104 --> 01:49:59,654
Pike's coming!

876
01:50:05,445 --> 01:50:07,846
He's got it. Carrying gold.

877
01:50:09,846 --> 01:50:11,276
Any trouble?

878
01:50:11,446 --> 01:50:13,435
Just from carrying this weight.

879
01:50:15,516 --> 01:50:17,787
Pike, I want to go next.

880
01:50:17,956 --> 01:50:21,017
You and Lyle take the next load,
with the machine gun.

881
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:25,527
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and get the pack horses.

882
01:50:32,807 --> 01:50:36,468
It must be mounted on a tripod!

883
01:50:37,308 --> 01:50:39,969
It must be mounted on a tripod.

884
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:06,402
They're crazy bastards!

885
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:26,321
Put it on the tripod!

886
01:52:48,952 --> 01:52:51,792
We brought the last of it, General.

887
01:53:12,145 --> 01:53:13,976
At the arroyo, in the wagon.

888
01:53:22,555 --> 01:53:24,826
Keep the wagon, we'll keep the horses.

889
01:53:27,566 --> 01:53:30,227
How many cases did you take
from the train?

890
01:53:31,007 --> 01:53:34,568
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

891
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:36,237
He stole it.

892
01:53:37,237 --> 01:53:39,907
The mother of the girl
he killed told me so.

893
01:54:39,514 --> 01:54:41,505
I'm wasting time here.

894
01:54:51,355 --> 01:54:53,456
He's a thief. You take care of him.

895
01:55:50,691 --> 01:55:52,521
Well, he had guts.

896
01:55:53,262 --> 01:55:54,922
We're lucky he didn't talk.

897
01:55:55,532 --> 01:55:58,193
He played his string right to the end.

898
01:56:06,044 --> 01:56:09,773
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of Judas.

899
01:56:10,044 --> 01:56:11,944
Sykes says we should go after him.

900
01:56:12,114 --> 01:56:15,944
How will we do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

901
01:56:16,555 --> 01:56:17,885
No way.

902
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:20,285
No way at all.

903
01:56:21,225 --> 01:56:22,715
Is that Sykes?

904
01:56:48,988 --> 01:56:50,248
Mapache!

905
01:56:53,829 --> 01:56:54,819
Thornton.

906
01:56:59,498 --> 01:57:00,829
I got him.

907
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:05,660
They got Freddie.

908
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,271
He looks hit pretty bad.

909
01:57:09,611 --> 01:57:11,771
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

910
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:15,010
What would you do? He gave his word.

911
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,441
Gave his word to a railroad.

912
01:57:17,621 --> 01:57:18,451
It's his word!

913
01:57:18,621 --> 01:57:22,022
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

914
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:32,462
We can stay up here and
kick hell out of them!

915
01:57:36,543 --> 01:57:38,303
No, we're running out of water.

916
01:57:39,544 --> 01:57:41,304
Run for the border?

917
01:57:43,214 --> 01:57:46,154
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

918
01:57:46,985 --> 01:57:48,974
I'm tired of being hunted.

919
01:57:50,224 --> 01:57:53,815
Let's go to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

920
01:57:55,165 --> 01:57:55,995
You're crazy.

921
01:57:58,336 --> 01:58:00,896
He would just as soon
kill us as break wind.

922
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:05,895
He's so tickled with the guns, he'll be
celebrating and happy to do us a favor.

923
01:58:06,236 --> 01:58:08,576
Thornton won't follow us in there.

924
01:58:09,747 --> 01:58:11,906
While they're picking over Freddie...

925
01:58:12,077 --> 01:58:15,067
...we'll find a back trail
and head for town.

926
01:58:18,588 --> 01:58:20,249
What about our gold?

927
01:58:27,699 --> 01:58:30,189
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

928
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:32,019
Bury the rest.

929
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:37,030
Together.

930
01:58:56,391 --> 01:58:57,621
Look out, Jess!

931
01:59:05,142 --> 01:59:08,133
Lots of blood, then it stops.
No tracks.

932
01:59:08,473 --> 01:59:10,133
Ten dollars says he's dead by now.

933
01:59:10,314 --> 01:59:12,743
Take us a day to find him if he is.

934
01:59:13,143 --> 01:59:15,413
If not, he has a gun on us right now.

935
01:59:20,484 --> 01:59:21,924
Let's find the others.

936
01:59:22,094 --> 01:59:24,755
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

937
01:59:25,495 --> 01:59:29,486
Ride out tomorrow, if you can stay
on your horse, and watch the buzzards.

938
01:59:29,665 --> 01:59:31,155
They'll show you.

939
01:59:31,505 --> 01:59:32,935
What if he ain't dead?

940
01:59:33,835 --> 01:59:34,825
That's your problem.

941
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:36,666
Let's go!

942
02:01:08,606 --> 02:01:10,196
I hate to see that.

943
02:01:10,546 --> 02:01:12,035
No more than I do.

944
02:01:35,408 --> 02:01:38,239
Welcome amigos!
You come for your friend, no?

945
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:50,250
I want to buy him back.

946
02:01:55,331 --> 02:01:57,921
I don't think he looks worth too much.

947
02:02:04,841 --> 02:02:06,771
I don't think he'll live long.

948
02:02:07,102 --> 02:02:08,942
I'll give half my share.

949
02:02:09,113 --> 02:02:12,602
I need no gold.
And I don't sell this one.

950
02:02:12,783 --> 02:02:14,513
You've had your fun with him.

951
02:02:14,683 --> 02:02:16,944
El General is happy with the guns.

952
02:02:17,854 --> 02:02:19,783
Why don't you go get a drink?

953
02:02:19,953 --> 02:02:22,683
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

954
02:02:27,294 --> 02:02:29,355
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

955
02:03:12,178 --> 02:03:14,168
Son-of-a-bitch!

956
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:27,760
Why not?

957
02:03:42,542 --> 02:03:44,102
There ain't nobody here!

958
02:03:44,282 --> 02:03:47,873
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

959
02:03:48,052 --> 02:03:49,452
They ain't here now!

960
02:03:55,794 --> 02:03:57,624
Army patrol!

961
02:03:58,134 --> 02:03:59,464
Coming this way!

962
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,230
You said dos for two!

963
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,631
Here's your dos
and one to grow on.

964
02:06:38,811 --> 02:06:41,241
That's all you'll get out of me.

965
02:07:13,444 --> 02:07:15,005
Let's go.

966
02:07:26,196 --> 02:07:27,686
Why not?

967
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:13,541
What do you want?

968
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,210
We want Angel.

969
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:23,891
You want Angel, no?

970
02:11:24,052 --> 02:11:25,211
All right.

971
02:11:25,392 --> 02:11:27,382
I'm going to give him to you.

972
02:15:29,958 --> 02:15:30,618
Bitch!

973
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:57,150
Come on, you lazy bastard!

974
02:16:33,094 --> 02:16:35,195
Give them hell, Pike!

975
02:16:41,605 --> 02:16:43,195
No, Pike!

976
02:17:38,272 --> 02:17:39,672
Look at them.

977
02:17:40,441 --> 02:17:41,772
Come on.

978
02:17:41,942 --> 02:17:45,102
- Come on, T.C.! This is fine!
- Wait for me!

979
02:17:45,273 --> 02:17:47,672
Come on, let's get all the guns.

980
02:17:48,512 --> 02:17:51,002
This is just like a big old picnic!

981
02:17:51,282 --> 02:17:53,183
Here's a rifle for you.

982
02:18:22,386 --> 02:18:23,876
He's got a gun.

983
02:18:28,327 --> 02:18:29,887
It's them!

984
02:18:30,997 --> 02:18:32,487
It's the Gorches!

985
02:18:32,667 --> 02:18:35,158
Come on, get up there, Coffer.
Come on.

986
02:18:35,497 --> 02:18:36,988
Mr. Thornton...

987
02:18:37,167 --> 02:18:38,657
...it's them.

988
02:18:38,838 --> 02:18:40,328
It is them.

989
02:18:43,839 --> 02:18:47,008
This boy's got gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

990
02:18:47,179 --> 02:18:49,339
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!

991
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:54,338
Should we load up?

992
02:18:55,689 --> 02:18:57,849
Do we wait for Jess or meet him?

993
02:18:58,019 --> 02:19:02,590
If he's waiting for buzzards to lead
him to Sykes, he's got a long wait.

994
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,201
Look! We got them all.

995
02:19:05,201 --> 02:19:07,101
There he is.

996
02:19:07,371 --> 02:19:08,771
There's Pike.

997
02:19:08,931 --> 02:19:12,200
There, you ain't so damned
much now, are you, Mr. Pike?

998
02:19:19,782 --> 02:19:21,272
You ain't coming?

999
02:19:27,953 --> 02:19:29,943
Maybe we should wait for Jess.

1000
02:19:31,563 --> 02:19:33,793
No, we pick him up on the way.

1001
02:19:33,964 --> 02:19:35,894
I want to get out of this damn place.

1002
02:19:35,964 --> 02:19:39,024
Anyway these boys'll
start going ripe by tomorrow.

1003
02:19:39,134 --> 02:19:40,624
We got to move.

1004
02:19:43,906 --> 02:19:46,905
"I went to the river and
I couldn't get across.

1005
02:19:47,074 --> 02:19:49,975
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day,

1006
02:19:50,145 --> 02:19:53,246
"I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse,

1007
02:19:53,415 --> 02:19:56,076
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day.

1008
02:19:56,256 --> 02:19:57,817
"Fare thee well..."

1009
02:21:29,755 --> 02:21:32,696
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?

1010
02:21:33,366 --> 02:21:34,917
I sent them back.

1011
02:21:35,597 --> 02:21:37,187
That's all I said I'd do.

1012
02:21:37,697 --> 02:21:39,187
They didn't get far.

1013
02:21:40,107 --> 02:21:41,087
I figured.

1014
02:21:44,607 --> 02:21:46,438
What are your plans?

1015
02:21:47,707 --> 02:21:49,368
Drift around down here.

1016
02:21:49,547 --> 02:21:50,878
Try to stay out of jail.

1017
02:21:52,278 --> 02:21:55,449
Well, me and the boys here...

1018
02:21:55,889 --> 02:21:57,049
...got work to do.

1019
02:22:01,789 --> 02:22:02,949
Want to come?

1020
02:22:05,230 --> 02:22:07,630
Ain't like it used to be, but...

1021
02:22:08,130 --> 02:22:09,400
...it'll do.
