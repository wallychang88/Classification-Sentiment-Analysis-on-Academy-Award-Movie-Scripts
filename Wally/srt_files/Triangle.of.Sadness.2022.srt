1
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,771
<i>Check the audio.</i>

2
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,980
<i>Great.</i>

3
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:04,853
So, what are the most important
aspects of being a male model?

4
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:06,822
I would say: look good.

5
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:09,759
Yes? And?

6
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,288
- Er, that's it.
- And walk!

7
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,732
Look good and walk? But
not at the same time, right?

8
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:19,526
- Most of the times at the same time.
- Really? Can you do that?

9
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:23,740
- Er, sure.
- Please show us! Yes, yes, go ahead.

10
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:25,466
Whoo! Yeah!

11
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,750
Thank you. Next!

12
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,721
Okay... Hello, hello, hello.

13
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,251
What do we have here?

14
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:43,220
- Hey, there.
- What's up, man?

15
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:46,730
So, I want to know, did your parents
support you in being a male model?

16
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,699
All the way,
right from the start.

17
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:51,867
- Even your father?
- Even my father, yeah. Why?

18
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,706
He wanted you to enter this industry
where you earn only 1/3 of the women,

19
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,103
where you constantly have
to maneuver homosexual men

20
00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:00,204
who want to sleep with you?

21
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,676
Hot.

22
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:11,116
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and I'm standing
here with my very best friend...'

23
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,888
- What was your name?
- Er, Carl.

24
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,218
My best friend Carl!

25
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,958
- How are you today, Carl?
- Yeah, good, good.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,291
So, is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

27
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,800
Er, I don't know,
man. I don't know.

28
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:26,461
Well,
smiley brands are the cheap ones,

29
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,937
and the more
expensive the brand gets,

30
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,466
you start to look down
on your consumer.

31
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,811
Like, if you want to be a part of
this "von oben" one-man in-crowd,

32
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,978
you have to show
us some serious cash.

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,982
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah?
- Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

34
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,985
And if you get the job,
you will get to wear exclusive clothing,

35
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:46,316
and look down on your consumer.

36
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,450
Okay,
Carl. Show us some of that grumpy look.

37
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,123
- No, no...
- Yeah, let's go!

38
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,191
Come on, Carl! You can do it.

39
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,459
Yes! "Don't you dare talk to me!

40
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:01,100
"I'm an Aryan 'Übermensch',
too obsessed with the image of myself

41
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:05,842
"to be involved with anything that doesn't
fit my stylized image of the world."

42
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,502
Wait...

43
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:10,505
"Suddenly, I'm dressed in
something way less expensive.

44
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,276
"It's H&M!"

45
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:14,146
Everybody, come together!

46
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:17,953
"You can too be a part of this happy,
smiling group of mixed skin colors,

47
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:21,516
"for not that much money! #friendship,
#everyonesequal,

48
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:24,861
"#happylife,
#stopclimatechange."

49
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:28,865
Oh, no! Oh! I am so sorry,
darling.

50
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:32,869
I didn't see that it was
Balenciaga you're wearing.

51
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:35,872
"We are strong and tough
and unapproachable!"

52
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:37,973
Show me that Balenciaga look!

53
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,636
Oh, I'm sorry,
I think it's back to H&M again!

54
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:46,376
"Yeah! We're just kidding. We're so cheap,
we're so happy!"

55
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:48,378
Everybody, come closer together!

56
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,480
Balenciaga is back! Ooh,
fiercer than ever!

57
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,218
"We are stone cold.

58
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,715
"Yes! Oh, my God,
get away from us!"

59
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:57,762
H&M is here again!

60
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,159
Balenciaga!

61
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,324
And H&M!

62
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:01,655
Balenciaga!

63
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,525
And H&M!

64
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,902
Oh, everybody,
give it up for these guys!

65
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:09,070
Fabulous! Fabulous, Carl!

66
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,178
Here...

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,917
- Hi.
- Hello.

68
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,051
How are you guys doing?

69
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:37,197
- Oh, it's you?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,264
You can hardly
tell it's the same guy.

71
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,760
How old is this
perfume campaign?

72
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:43,730
When was it? Er,
three years ago.

73
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:47,944
- And then maybe a year after that.
- Okay...

74
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,276
So you do castings again, then?

75
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,850
Yeah.

76
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,083
Could you
do a little walk for us?

77
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:59,054
Er... Just quick. No
smiling. No stopping.

78
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,549
Yeah.

79
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,758
One more time.

80
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,907
Okay.

81
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,209
Okay...

82
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:27,148
Today, fashion is not just about
surface. It's about the inside.

83
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,316
Think about a tune that
you like when you walk.

84
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,988
Look at me.

85
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,900
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, so like a rhythm?

86
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:44,791
Yeah. Go!

87
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,984
<i>Maybe he needs Botoxing.</i>

88
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:59,213
Can you relax your
Triangle of Sadness?

89
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,986
- It's like between your eyebrows here.
- Okay.

90
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,120
A little bit more...

91
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,716
Okay. And open your mouth so
you look a little bit more available.

92
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,392
Okay,
not that much. A little bit less.

93
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,868
Okay. Thank you very much.

94
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,905
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

95
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,631
Next, please!

96
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,410

00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,060

<i>Perfect.</i>

124
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,504
- Where can I sit?
- Sorry?

125
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:41,836
- I don't have a seat now.
- Can you just...? There's a seat.

126
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,642
Just right up there.
Yeah. Just there.

127
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,559
Yaya! Yaya!

128
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,732
Yaya,
look here. Look here, Yaya!

129
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,406
Yaya!

130
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,870
Yaya!

131
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,264
Thank you, sir.

132
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:24,004
Thank you, honey.

133
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,348
That's so sweet of you.

134
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,758
Do you like the place?

135
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,266
- A little stuffy?
- A little stuffy.

136
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:51,966
What?

137
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:57,280
I don't know,
you looked like you were thinking there.

138
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,105
No, I'm not. I'm not.

139
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,582
Cool.

140
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:07,785
I can tell there's something's
wrong. Just talk to me, what is it?

141
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,495
No, it's just...

142
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,200
When you say...

143
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,699
When you say, "Thank you,
honey" like that...

144
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,306
You don't really give
me an option but to pay.

145
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:28,311
It was just an observation.
Just something I've noticed.

146
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:35,174
- We can split the bill if you like.
- No, no...

147
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:38,684
- I can whip out a calculator...
- No, no, okay.

148
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:40,686
- How many glasses of wine did you have?
- Oh, sure...

149
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:43,689
- You had, like, three more.
- That's not what I mean.

150
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:46,296
Yeah, I think it all evens out,
you know.

151
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,056
Hmm...

152
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,632
Don't you remember last
night? You said you were gonna...

153
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,735
You said you were
gonna pay for food today.

154
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:02,345
At the end of the meal, you said,
"Thanks. Tomorrow I'll get it."

155
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,679
Sure,
but then you picked up the bill,

156
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,175
and I thought you wanted to pay,
so I said, "Thank you, honey."

157
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:13,257
- But it was there for such a long time...
- I didn't see it.

158
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,823
- You didn't see it?
- I, er...

159
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:21,529
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

160
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:24,994
Or I didn't notice it. We
were just having a nice dinner.

161
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:30,670
You didn't see the bill
when it got put on the table?

162
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:32,738
No, I didn't, Carl.

163
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:43,045
So the waiter came in, and put it
in the middle of the table just there.

164
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,883
- And you didn't happen to see it?
- Oh, my God!

165
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:50,019
What? I'm asking you seriously now,
because...

166
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,493
Wow...

167
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,220
What's... What's "wow"?

168
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,601
What are you doing?

169
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:04,197
No, no, no. Just don't... Wait.
Can you sit down? Sit down.

170
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,740
I'm just trying to figure out
what exactly I did wrong!

171
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:12,271
- Seriously?
- Calm down. Please, just sit down.

172
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:16,078
- You're fighting over money!
- No! That's not what's...

173
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,047
- That's literally
what's happening.

174
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,950
- I'm just pointing
out the fact that...

175
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,281
- Why are you so obsessed with money?
- I'm not obsessed.

176
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:25,626
Can you just sit down,
please? I'm not obsessed with money.

177
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:29,157
It was just an observation from
yesterday. Can you please sit down?

178
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,973
- No, no, no... What are you doing?
- It's fine.

179
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,077
Well, you can't pay now,
that's ridiculous.

180
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,618
- Don't, Carl.
- What are you doing?

181
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,423
- Let go.
- No, no, no... I'm paying the bill.

182
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,086
That's not why I said it.

183
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,334
- Sorry.
- Are we enjoying ourselves?

184
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:07,228
Yes, thanks, yeah. Yaya...

185
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,571
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

186
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,786
Now I feel bad.

187
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:29,426
Why? I make more money than you.

188
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:44,265
Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

189
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,808
- Do you have another one, maybe?
- Can you try it again, please?

190
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,042
I tried it twice.

191
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,212
- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one.
- Just take this one.

192
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,522
Carl! Just give me
a second. Just wait!

193
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,590
- Let me pay.
- Just wait!

194
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:08,828
It's fine,
you don't have enough cash. Take that.

195
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,930
- You accept that one, yeah?
- Yes.

196
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,702
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

197
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,503
Thank you.

198
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:33,715
I do think it's quite crazy how
it's such a hard thing to talk about.

199
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,410
Money.

200
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:42,823
It's such a touchy
subject. Don't you think?

201
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,925
Yeah,
I think it's un-sexy to talk about money.

202
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,494
Okay, but then why is that?

203
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,233
I don't know,
it's just not sexy.

204
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:00,676
Well, you don't think it's because
it's so tied to gender roles?

205
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:05,076
Fuckin' hell, the menu in the
restaurant didn't even have prices for you.

206
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,144
That's not fair, Carl.

207
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:08,283
I'm always paying.

208
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:11,346
No, no, no, let's take you out of it here.

209
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:14,019
And just talk about
women in general.

210
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,661
I'm a generous person,
Carl. Ask any of my friends.

211
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,896
Sure you're generous, but...

212
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,703
But?

213
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,577
When it comes to you and me,
we're dealing with roles that I hate.

214
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:35,007
I don't want to be the man,
whilst you're the woman,

215
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,009
I want us to be best friends.

216
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,144
- I don't wanna sleep with my best friend.
- No, that's not...

217
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:43,246
You don't understand what
I'm trying to say. I mean...

218
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,886
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

219
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,317
that everyone else
seems to be doing.

220
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:54,829
I want us to be equal.

221
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,744
Excuse me?

222
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,714
- You have to fight.
- I'm sorry, what?

223
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,574
If you love her,
you have to fight for her.

224
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,411
I've been there, I know.

225
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:19,414
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

226
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,420
The thing is, Yaya, I like to take
you for dinner. I enjoy paying for you.

227
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:28,423
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

228
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,701
I use you?

229
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:33,428
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

230
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,068
No, no. Just wait. If we
go back the last week or so,

231
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,367
then, yeah,
maybe there is a point...

232
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,072
Are you being serious?

233
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:42,272
I got you this shirt. I
invited you for dinner.

234
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:45,946
- You're staying at my hotel.
- Well, you got this shirt for free.

235
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,212
- And actually you
didn't pay for dinner.

236
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,214
- That's because
my card didn't work.

237
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,448
There's a cash machine in the
lobby. I'll pay you back every last cent...

238
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,417
It's okay.

239
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,287
Carl,
I always intended to pay you back.

240
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,555
I didn't realize you wanted the
money right now before going to bed.

241
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:06,197
- So your intention was to pay me back?
- Yes.

242
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,903
- Really?
- Yeah.

243
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,565
So why did you
take the 50-euro bill?

244
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,570
Once I realized you didn't
have enough cash, I paid the bill.

245
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,376
Instead of giving me the 50-euro bill,
you put it back in your purse.

246
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:24,248
What? I'm just saying what happened,
Yaya.

247
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:26,888
What are you...? Don't!

248
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:31,552
What the fuck are you doing?

249
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:34,093
Don't fucking do that to me!

250
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:37,327
Don't... fucking do that to me,
Yaya!

251
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:39,901
Don't do that to me!

252
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,904
- 'Going down.'
- Don't fucking shove things down me!

253
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,499
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

254
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,743
You're behaving
like a crazy person.

255
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,601
Shut up! Don't do
things like that to me!

256
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,339
What the hell are you
doing with my money?

257
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:53,013
Your money? Oh,
my God! It's not about money, Yaya!

258
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,542
It's not about...

259
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,856
It's not about the fucking money,
Yaya!

260
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:01,726
- Oh!
- This is... No, it's not!

261
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:04,552
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

262
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:07,258
I'll give you that 50 euros!
I'll give you a 100 euros!

263
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,458
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

264
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,263
This is not about the fucking
money! Why won't you understand it?

265
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,529
Understand my point!

266
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,367
This is not about the money!

267
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,470
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, Yaya!

268
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:26,310
Thought he might be dangerous,
but he just looked like...

269
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,856
Bullshit feminist.

270
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,430
<i>The person you're trying to reach...</i>

271
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,042
For fuck's...

272
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,734
- What have you been doing?
- Trying to sleep on a chair.

273
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,803
- How'd that go?
- Well, I'm back.

274
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,346
What have you been doing?

275
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:44,580
I was... walking up and
down the corridor and...

276
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:48,386
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

277
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:51,620
- You saw them?
- Yeah.

278
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,002
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

279
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,534
I'm... so good at being...

280
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:06,833
...manipulative.

281
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,674
I don't know, I do it and I don't
even realize that I'm doing it.

282
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:15,842
- Yeah...
- I love you.

283
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,814
No, but seriously,
it's amazing that you can tell me that.

284
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,894
Now you're a generous person.

285
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:25,996
Okay.

286
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,591
Alright.

287
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,073
Ask me anything.

288
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:38,898
You sure?

289
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,274
Uh-huh.

290
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:45,905
In the restaurant,
with the bill...

291
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,874
What about it?

292
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:51,054
You intentionally didn't pick that up,
right?

293
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,780
- Yes.
- Of course.

294
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:58,753
Didn't that embarrass you?

295
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:01,196
Nope.

296
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:05,266
- But you make more money than I do.
- It's not about the money.

297
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,366
And you said you
were gonna pay...

298
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:16,936
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

299
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,148
What is it about, then?

300
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:22,019
What if I...

301
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,878
...fall pregnant?

302
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,385
With me?

303
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:32,457
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

304
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,033
I need to know that the person
I'm with intends to take care of me.

305
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,134
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

306
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,141
Yeah,
I guess you're not the kind to work in...

307
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,637
...a restaurant or a supermarket,
are you?

308
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:49,837
No offense.

309
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,939
I'm a model, honey,
the only way for me to get out of this life

310
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:56,086
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

311
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:00,387
So,
there's nothing else to this for you?

312
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,093
Other than...

313
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:07,822
...increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

314
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:10,331
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

315
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,202
I like you. You like me.
It's good for business.

316
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,565
Yeah.

317
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,437
- Nothing more?
- Uh-hmm.

318
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,340
- Uh-hmm?
- Uh-hmm.

319
00:25:21,508 --> 00:25:23,805
I'd like to put a bet on that.

320
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,248
Okay.

321
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,086
- Deal.
- Yeah.

322
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:34,684
We'll see.

323
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,984
I'll make you love me.

324
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,691
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

325
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:43,957
- Yep.
- Okay.

326
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,597
You'll forget about
this trophy shit.

327
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,204
And you'll love me.

328
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:48,824
'The success of a luxury
cruise mainly depends on two moments.

329
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:53,434
'Number one: the first
hours the guests are onboard.

330
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,471
'And number two: the last
day the guests are onboard.

331
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,178
'And if we can impress
them on those two occasions,

332
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,037
'then the cruise will
probably be a success.'

333
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:07,106
And I don't want to
hear anybody saying,

334
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:11,748
"We don't need to uncover the sundeck,
they all leave after breakfast."

335
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,818
No. I want full
set-up every morning.

336
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,392
No excuses.

337
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:20,494
Not even for the last hour.

338
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:25,466
It's always, "Yes,
sir! Yes, ma'am!"

339
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,896
If there is an illegal substance they want,
or...

340
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,471
...a unicorn!

341
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,802
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

342
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:34,442
- Yes!
- Whoo!

343
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:36,938
Yes!

344
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:41,350
I know,
I know what it is to work for service.

345
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:43,945
I know all the
challenges you're facing.

346
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:48,818
But at these times,
I ask of you to keep that chin up.

347
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,526
Stay strong.

348
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:55,088
And try to remind yourself...

349
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:59,203
...if everything goes well...

350
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:02,799
...at the end of the cruise...

351
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:05,341
- Money, money, money...
- ...you might be getting...

352
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:09,839
- ...a very generous tip!
- Money, money, money...

353
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,353
Money! Money! Money!

354
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,916
Money! Money!
Money! Money! Money!

355
00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:30,794
- Money!
- Yes!

356
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:33,336
Alicia, who do we have onboard?

357
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:38,164
No...

358
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,347
- Housekeeping!
- No. No, thank you.

359
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:49,175
- Do you want me to clean the room?
- No, thanks.

360
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,453
Okay,
I'll come back in 30 minutes?

361
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:54,456
- No, you can come back a bit later.
- Okay, one hour?

362
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,886
Could you just come back later,
please?

363
00:28:56,888 --> 00:29:00,021
Okay, I'll come back later. Sorry,
ma'am.

364
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,835
Let me change.

365
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,032
<i>- Hey there!
- Hey!</i>

366
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,619
<i>- Mario the red, how are you?
- Yes, all good!</i>

367
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:11,247
<i>Great, guys!
Let's greet the rich!</i>

368
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,297
<i>Make it shine man,
make it shine!</i>

369
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:22,551
<i>Make it shine...</i>

370
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,481
What?

371
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:26,878
Nothing.

372
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:33,489
- Hey!
- Hey.

373
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:42,564
- What are you doing?
- What?

374
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:47,602
- Are you talking to the crew?
- Yeah...

375
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:52,265
- Why are you talking to the crew?
- I said hello.

376
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,675
Yeah,
you smiled at him and said hello.

377
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:57,744
- So?
- Ah...

378
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:12,120
Seriously, Yaya, we're sitting
here together, you shouldn't...

379
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,794
- You just don't do that.
- Do what?

380
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:20,536
If I started smiling at
the hot stewardess and...

381
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,604
- You know...
- You think she's hot?

382
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:28,874
No, but if she was,
and I started smiling at her,

383
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:31,448
and giggling and saying,
"Hey," like you did,

384
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,516
then you wouldn't like it,
would you?

385
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,375
- Are you jealous?
- No.

386
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,312
- No?
- No, I'm not. I'm not. It's just like...

387
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,217
I mean, come on,
look at you. And then...

388
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,892
And then a hot guy turns up. I mean,
he shouldn't be...

389
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:48,795
Do you think he's hot?

390
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,291
He's alright.

391
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,669
- Do you?
- Yeah!

392
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:58,739
- What the fuck, man?
- You just said you thought he was hot!

393
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:02,875
But come on, you don't have
to... You said it very quickly. Jesus!

394
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:06,582
Drop it, okay?

395
00:32:58,064 --> 00:33:00,196
Can I help you, sir?

396
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:02,264
- Sorry, just quickly...
- Yes?

397
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:05,431
I was on the rear deck,
and one of your crew members was...

398
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:07,137
- ...bare-chested.
- Really?

399
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:08,974
Yeah,
and like smoking and stuff.

400
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:11,108
Oh,
I'm so sorry. That's so inappropriate.

401
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,946
- Yeah, it did feel a little bit...
- No, of course.

402
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:15,816
I'll take care of
that. I'm so sorry.

403
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:18,477
- Maybe it's not a big issue...
- No, but it's not acceptable here.

404
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:21,657
I thought I'd just let you know, cos...
Yeah, I didn't wanna make anything of it.

405
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,824
Well, thank you so much.
It won't happen again, sir.

406
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:25,892
- I promise you that.
- Alright, thanks.

407
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,664
- Alicia?
- Yeah?

408
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,799
There's a crew member
up on deck with no shirt on.

409
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,196
- No shirt on?
- Yes.

410
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:45,076
Sorry. Just, er...

411
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,341
Yes?

412
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:50,377
Is it possible to look at
the engagement rings?

413
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,084
- Yes. Yes, of course!
- Is that alright?

414
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:56,515
Definitely, yes. Okay.

415
00:33:56,517 --> 00:34:00,157
This is a beautiful ring.
This is 24-carat gold.

416
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,632
And we have a point
nine diamond in the middle,

417
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:06,426
and we have four brilliants
on every side of the band.

418
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:09,837
- It's a very beautiful ring.
- Yes. It's really nice.

419
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,675
Do you want me to try it on
so you can see it on a hand?

420
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,204
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

421
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,436
- If you don't mind?
- No, of course.

422
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:21,079
Hmm...

423
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:27,690
Yeah?

424
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:30,759
It's a very nice diamond,
this one. It's a flawless diamond.

425
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:34,158
What was the price of that one?

426
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,359
This one is... 28,000 euros.

427
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,001
Mm-hmm...

428
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:51,274
'Can we get an
almond latte to foredeck?'

429
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:07,125
Captain?

430
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:12,591
Uh, yes?

431
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:16,233
I just wanted to tell you
it's time for the safety drill.

432
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:18,268
Uh, well, no, I'm...

433
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,501
I'm just not feeling well.

434
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:25,275
- Should I get the doctor?
- No, no, I'll be fine.

435
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:28,652
Just have the First take care of it,
and then...

436
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,479
...you know, I'll see you later.

437
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,922
Okay!

438
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

439
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:43,425
Abigail? Could you
get the tray? Thank you.

440
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:54,633
Honey, Nutella.

441
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,042
Hm-mm...

442
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,649
Another one?

443
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:06,415
Have a little look.

444
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:12,828
- Aren't you going to eat the pasta?
- Sorry?

445
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,591
Aren't you going
to eat the pasta?

446
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,365
Oh,
er... No. I'm gluten intolerant.

447
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,707
Oh?

448
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:27,073
It's just for the pictures.
She's an influencer.

449
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:29,009
- Oh!
- Okay.

450
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,472
Wow!

451
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,014
You make money from that?

452
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:38,117
- Champagne, sir?
- Nah... White wine.

453
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,121
- Sorry, what?
- Yeah... It depends.

454
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:46,191
It depends. You mostly get free stuff,
to be honest.

455
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:49,161
We got this cruise for free.

456
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:55,134
Good! Her looks paid for
the tickets. Not bad, huh?

457
00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:00,205
- Good, huh?
- I guess so, yeah. It did.

458
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:02,779
- A lovely couple, huh?
- Yeah, that's nice.

459
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:05,881
- Not bad, not bad.
- Thank you.

460
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:10,545
So, what do you do?

461
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,889
I sell shit.

462
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,255
- What, sorry?
- I sell shit!

463
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:23,932
- Fertilizer for agriculture.
- Oh, fertilizer...

464
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:27,903
- Interesting.
- In every business it's the right place...

465
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:31,038
...in the right moment. My
right place: east Europe.

466
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,811
Right moment: end of 80s,
beginning of 90s.

467
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,340
And, er...

468
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:39,178
So, business start, yeah?

469
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,643
- In 80s, I was...
- Baby? Can I have this one?

470
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,381
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

471
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:46,086
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

472
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:47,681
- Yeah.
- Love you.

473
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,454
Yeah, yeah... So,
in the beginning of 80s,

474
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:54,391
I was only CEO

475
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:58,725
in one agriculture "Kombinat",
we called it.

476
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:02,938
Hundred thousand pigs,
two million chickens.

477
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,909
And we're getting
some kind of monopoly.

478
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,846
You can call me
the King of the Shit!

479
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:12,343
- It was...
- I love him. I love him!

480
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:14,411
And when you have money,
you know,

481
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:17,777
you don't leave money to sleep,
you understand?

482
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:20,483
- Money must not sleep, you know.
- Okay.

483
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:24,454
So you put this money
from this business,

484
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:28,833
because factories
shutting down...

485
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,364
And the
desert is tiramisu.

486
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,730
Or panna cotta,
you like both of those.

487
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:42,847
- Oh... you choose.
- A-ha...

488
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,641
You have the panna cotta,
I'll have a tiramisu.

489
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:48,115
Fine.

490
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,858
Hello!

491
00:38:57,995 --> 00:38:59,423
Cheers.

492
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:09,598
I'm Clementine. And this is my husband,
Winston.

493
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,666
We're from Great Britain.

494
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,922
My name is Clementine.

495
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:27,977
<i>Nein, nein...</i>

496
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:30,157
- And this is my husband, Winston.
- Winston.

497
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,345
We're from Great Britain.

498
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,413
<i>Nein.</i>

499
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:35,740
<i>Uli, in den Wolken.</i>

500
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:39,067
Hello. This is my wife,
Therese.

501
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:42,598
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

502
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,041
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

503
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,621
<i>In den Wolken.</i>

504
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:50,831
<i>Ja.</i>

505
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,792
<i>Shall I take it away?</i>

506
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,512
<i>"In den... In den..."</i>

507
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,173
<i>In den Wolken.</i>

508
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:00,492
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

509
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,019
<i>In den Wol...?</i>

510
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:06,523
<i>- Wolken.
- Wo...</i>

511
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:08,360
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

512
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:11,693
- What does it mean?
- "Up in the clouds."

513
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,728
Oh! How beautiful.

514
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,375
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

515
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,871
Take care.

516
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,680
Nice to meet you,
my friend. I hope I work with you again.

517
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,748
It was a pleasure, Mario.

518
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,488
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

519
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,556
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

520
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,400
Look at that.

521
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,503
Sad, huh?

522
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:31,114
He's hunting.

523
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,379
- Huh?
- He's hunting!

524
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,547
Big dilemma.

525
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:40,992
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

526
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:45,919
Come on.

527
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,924
Look, look!

528
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,795
Maybe has a little chance!

529
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:19,359
Amazing...

530
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:24,035
Wow.

531
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:28,863
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

532
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:31,668
Er... could you
just do me a favor?

533
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:35,474
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

534
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:38,378
but couldn't come and...

535
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,480
...I would like to
take a picture. Please.

536
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:45,484
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

537
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:49,015
I'll stand over here.

538
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:52,195
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

539
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,799
Good?

540
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:07,243
- Thank you very much.
- A pleasure...

541
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:09,871
- Have a nice evening.
- Yeah, you, too.

542
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:17,010
Excuse me? Mister?

543
00:43:17,881 --> 00:43:21,553
Hi! Eh... Can you
please come back?

544
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:26,196
You can leave your beer,
it's okay.

545
00:43:26,198 --> 00:43:28,824
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

546
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:34,171
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

547
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:36,206
Then we can take a picture together,
the three of us.

548
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,603
Okay, nice! Nice!

549
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:40,375
Yeah!

550
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:42,442
- Now we're talking!
- Yeah!

551
00:43:45,106 --> 00:43:47,942
More boobs,
Yaya! More boobs!

552
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:49,713
Oh...

553
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:54,586
Thank you very
much! You're very generous!

554
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:58,557
I would like to do
something generous to you.

555
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:00,625
They have Rolex
watches in the reception.

556
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:03,122
We can go down there now,
and I will buy you Rolex watches!

557
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:05,630
- No, it's okay. Thank you.
- No! I would like...

558
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:07,962
It may sound strange, but I'm...

559
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:11,801
What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

560
00:44:11,803 --> 00:44:13,935
So I can...

561
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:15,772
I'm very rich.

562
00:44:15,774 --> 00:44:19,315
Yes, let's not beat around
the bush. I'm very rich.

563
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:21,218
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

564
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,144
I'm so fucking rich! I
just sold my company.

565
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:29,325
Yeah, I'm not drunk! I told you,
I'm not feeling well.

566
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:33,152
Do you have problem with that?

567
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:35,495
Can't you respect that?

568
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:37,333
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

569
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:39,961
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

570
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:43,129
Are you still there,
Paula?

571
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,136
- Thomas?
- What is it?

572
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:55,516
I just want to ask you when you're
able to hold the Captain's Dinner?

573
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:58,321
Oh, for fuck's sake...

574
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,586
- I can't do the
Captain's Dinner now!

575
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:02,358
- No, I'm asking you a question,
Thomas.

576
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,197
When are you able to put on your
uniform and be there for the guests?

577
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:12,368
Oh... Okay. Well,
what's the forecast?

578
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,832
The weather's fine,
Thomas. It's about when you can do it.

579
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,835
Any day but Thursday.

580
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:22,036
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

581
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:23,807
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

582
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:26,744
We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

583
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:30,287
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

584
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:32,211
I'll come back and talk
to you about this later.

585
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:35,654
Paula! Every day,
they eat dinner.

586
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:40,495
And they're going to eat
dinner Thursday as well. Right?

587
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:44,334
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

588
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:46,435
- Is this your boyfriends?
- Yeah.

589
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:50,604
Guys,
you take care of these girls now!

590
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:56,235
They're really,
really nice girls! Generous. Caring.

591
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:58,480
You treat them right, you know!

592
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,680
You think they want
some champagne?

593
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:04,453
Okay,
five glasses! Five glasses.

594
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:14,364
Ludmilla...

595
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:16,959
- I love you, baby!
- Yeah, yeah...

596
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,537
Dance with me!

597
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:26,034
- I'm terrible at dancing.
- What if I go?

598
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:28,938
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

599
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,039
Come on! Just a little bit.

600
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,274
- No, I'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

601
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:37,111
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

602
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:40,785
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

603
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:42,248
- I just don't.
- Why not?

604
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,428
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

605
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,057
- I feel embarrassed.
- Alright, it's okay. Whatever...

606
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:33,101
Carl?

607
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,941
Carl? Are you jealous?

608
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:42,749
Hey! Carl?

609
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:48,985
- Who's Carl?
- What?

610
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:56,124
- You're not Carl?
- No, no. I'm the pool guy.

611
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,830
Ooh...

612
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:06,839
Sorry about coming into the mansion,
I just needed to get some tools.

613
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,544
Oh?

614
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,879
Over here...

615
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:20,556
It's very inappropriate.

616
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,318
What if my, er...

617
00:48:26,926 --> 00:48:28,531
...husband comes home?

618
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:30,224
Where is your husband?

619
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:33,668
He really shouldn't be leaving
such a beautiful girl on her own.

620
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,506
Because it's very
dangerous around here.

621
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:42,368
- He's working.
- Oh...

622
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:45,614
- Always working...
- Is he?

623
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:48,308
Yeah. It's hot, huh?

624
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,619
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

625
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,556
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

626
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:55,822
Ooh!

627
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:04,501
The thing is, your husband
pays me a lot of money, you see.

628
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:09,770
So, I do have to just make
sure I'm doing my job properly.

629
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:12,101
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

630
00:49:12,103 --> 00:49:13,972
Yeah, is there any...

631
00:49:14,607 --> 00:49:17,370
...is there any down
here that need to be...

632
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:22,915
...unblocked,
or... is everything okay?

633
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:28,348
You're sure you're the
right guy for the job?

634
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,285
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

635
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:33,563
Hmm... Let me see.

636
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:07,288
Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

637
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,961
Can you turn the phone?

638
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:10,567
- No.
- No?

639
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:13,834
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

640
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:18,134
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

641
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:20,774
- Can I get you
anything to drink?

642
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:23,427
<i>More champagne, please.</i>

643
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:28,309
I don't know, I was just born
into this life. It was not my fault.

644
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:33,018
And when this happened,
I... I just felt like, "Why? Why?"

645
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,482
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

646
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:39,057
We are all equal.

647
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:41,994
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

648
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:54,170
Is there anything you wish for?

649
00:50:55,437 --> 00:50:59,979
- Sorry?
- Is there anything you... wish for?

650
00:51:01,179 --> 00:51:04,345
Well... Well, I don't know.

651
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:09,218
That's so sweet of you,
madam, but I'm perfectly fine.

652
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,355
But, but, but,
but if today was your last day alive...

653
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:19,636
- ...hmm... what would you wish for?
- I have no idea.

654
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:25,070
- Have you been for a swim today?
- No, not today.

655
00:51:25,906 --> 00:51:29,304
Why don't you go
for a swim right now?

656
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:34,618
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

657
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:38,215
That's so kind of you, madam,
but unfortunately we're not allowed

658
00:51:38,217 --> 00:51:41,119
to go for a swim during working hours,
so...

659
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:43,759
I want all the staff
to go for a swim!

660
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,894
I want you all to go for a swim!

661
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:52,163
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

662
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:56,266
Yeah, well,
today might be a little bit problematic...

663
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:57,563
Problematic?

664
00:51:57,565 --> 00:51:59,499
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

665
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:03,779
Who cares about the Captain's
Dinner? This will only take half an hour.

666
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:05,781
Come on, now.

667
00:52:05,783 --> 00:52:08,146
You work too hard, come on.

668
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:13,052
- Yeah, well, let me see what I can do.
<i>- Merci!</i>

669
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:26,559
No, no, no! Come back! Come back,
please.

670
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:30,168
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

671
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:33,072
- Sit down.
- Okay.

672
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:37,471
Let's reverse roles.

673
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:40,750
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

674
00:52:42,478 --> 00:52:46,921
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

675
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,449
Oh... well...

676
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:52,420
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

677
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:54,929
- Yeah, but...
- Come, come, I know you want to.

678
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:57,162
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

679
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:59,427
But there might be a problem for me,
if I...

680
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,365
Now I have to be the authority.

681
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:05,170
- Yeah, well, I have my clothes on...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

682
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:06,809
Shut up! Now!

683
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:12,572
I command you, enjoy the moment!

684
00:53:15,676 --> 00:53:18,117
- N-now?
- Please.

685
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:24,420
- No.
- No?

686
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:26,454
- No.
- What?

687
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:29,359
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

688
00:53:29,361 --> 00:53:31,031
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

689
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,527
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

690
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:36,662
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

691
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:38,808
I'm saying...

692
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:43,373
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

693
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,540
Don't worry. Dimitrios
will buy the yacht.

694
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,707
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

695
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:51,887
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

696
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:57,310
<i>Come on over!
A glass of champagne for...</i>

697
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,287
- This wonderful Miss...
- Alicia.

698
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:02,148
Alicia!
Mademoiselle Alicia!

699
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:04,817
<i>A glass of champagne!</i>

700
00:54:10,566 --> 00:54:13,271
Darius?
I need your help.

701
00:54:13,273 --> 00:54:17,407
I need you tell one of the guests
that the crew can't go for a swim.

702
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:18,947
Why?

703
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:21,015
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

704
00:54:21,017 --> 00:54:23,985
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

705
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:26,712
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

706
00:54:26,714 --> 00:54:29,518
He's not responding. I
can't get a hold of him, so...

707
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,717
Could you just please go
and tell them it's not possible?

708
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:34,996
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

709
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:37,262
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

710
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:40,232
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

711
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:43,400
It's not even funny. Why are you laughing,
Erik?

712
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:45,842
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

713
00:54:45,844 --> 00:54:48,570
Well,
your break is over. Go back to work.

714
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:52,211
It's not even installed yet, it will
take forever, and I don't have that time.

715
00:54:52,213 --> 00:54:55,280
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

716
00:54:55,282 --> 00:54:57,117
So please go and tell
them it's not possible...

717
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,548
I'm not going to go and
talk to some crazy Russians.

718
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,089
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

719
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,288
Same thing.

720
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,455
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

721
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:07,930
No! We're done.

722
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:11,967
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

723
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:13,792
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

724
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:17,533
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

725
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:19,765
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

726
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:23,769
Of course. I can get the First Officer.
He's not doing anything right now.

727
00:55:24,638 --> 00:55:27,147
- Could you show the guest the bridge?
- Yes, of course.

728
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:28,984
Welcome to the bridge.

729
00:55:28,986 --> 00:55:32,284
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

730
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:46,364
Thomas?

731
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:51,698
Thomas? Hello?

732
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,247
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

733
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:06,483
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

734
00:56:06,485 --> 00:56:09,684
Yesterday,
I was up on the sundeck.

735
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:12,818
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

736
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,195
But then I looked at the sails.

737
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:17,164
- The sails?
- Yes.

738
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,825
And they were... a bit dirty.

739
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:22,202
- Oh!
- Yeah.

740
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:24,039
- Oh...
- Yeah.

741
00:56:31,246 --> 00:56:32,805
Hello?

742
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:35,083
Hi.

743
00:56:38,846 --> 00:56:42,926
Yeah, but do you realize the
food down here is going to be bad?

744
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,896
Okay, bye.

745
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:49,691
Okay, guys,
listen up. You are going to swim.

746
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:52,463
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

747
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:54,893
as quick as possible, okay?

748
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:59,074
Come on! Chop,
chop! You're going to water slide.

749
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:00,768
Have fun!

750
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:05,959
<i>Friends! Friends!</i>

751
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,335
<i>Please come out!
Friends!</i>

752
00:57:08,502 --> 00:57:10,712
<i>Hey, what are you still doing here?</i>

753
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:12,840
<i>Put on your swimsuits right away.
We're going swimming.</i>

754
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:15,176
<i>- When?
- Now! Now!</i>

755
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:17,053
<i>Outside!</i>

756
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:21,515
<i>Put on your swimming trunks.
We are going to the "beach".</i>

757
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:22,976
<i>- What?
- We're going swimming.</i>

758
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:24,978
<i>Go, go!
Okay, we'll put on our trunks.</i>

759
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:26,062
<i>Okay, friend.</i>

760
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,350
Thomas?

761
00:57:51,062 --> 00:57:52,490
Thomas?

762
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,133
'Good afternoon.

763
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:00,894
'I hope that everyone
has had a great day so far,

764
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:04,700
'and that you're looking forward
to the Captain's Dinner tonight.

765
00:58:04,702 --> 00:58:09,078
'We would like to inform you that we
have a slight change in the schedule.

766
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,213
'The Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30,

767
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:15,480
'and not at 8:00,
as it says on the daily program.

768
00:58:15,482 --> 00:58:19,550
'I repeat: the Captain's
Dinner will be held at 8:30.

769
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:20,815
'Thank you.'

770
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:22,817
Why the push?

771
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:25,556
Cos the crew's
going for a... a swim.

772
00:58:26,258 --> 00:58:29,296
It's a request
from one of the Russians.

773
00:58:30,032 --> 00:58:34,664
- From the water slide.
- Oh, my God! This I gotta see.

774
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,106
Whoa,
whoa! Do you want to change first?

775
00:58:37,108 --> 00:58:40,835
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you?
- Alicia.

776
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:43,541
- Al...?
- Can you leave us for a bit, please?

777
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:45,345
Let's go inside, yeah?

778
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:47,347
I think you need to
change if you wanna go up...

779
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:49,118
Yeah, yeah...

780
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,120
- Let's go inside and talk.
- No, no...

781
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:53,914
Are you okay, man?

782
00:58:55,192 --> 00:58:56,950
- Good.
- Yeah?

783
00:58:58,195 --> 00:59:01,130
- Very good.
- We have four and a half hours left.

784
00:59:01,132 --> 00:59:03,021
Until the Captain's Dinner.

785
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:06,531
You chill in your room, have little
nap. I'll be back in a couple of hours.

786
00:59:06,533 --> 00:59:08,797
And we'll... go together.

787
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,865
Yeah?

788
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,145
Darius...

789
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,839
Look at you!

790
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:22,910
What are you all worked up
about? I'm fine! Just totally fine.

791
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:26,485
- Yeah?
- Completely, a hundred percent...

792
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:29,719
...fine.

793
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:34,020
- Mohammed! Mohammed!
- What?

794
00:59:34,022 --> 00:59:35,989
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

795
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:39,102
- What?
- Let's go!

796
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:42,765
Oh! Whoo!

797
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,999
Wonderful!

798
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:52,083
- Some champagne.
- Bravo!

799
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:56,838
<i>Santé!</i>

800
01:00:01,016 --> 01:00:04,259
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

801
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:46,301
If you just stand here,
and they will be coming to you.

802
01:00:46,303 --> 01:00:49,832
- Okay.
- Let me see you. Okay.

803
01:00:51,737 --> 01:00:54,001
- Okay!
- Thank you, Paula.

804
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:56,443
- Just one night, that's all.
- Okay.

805
01:00:57,546 --> 01:01:01,250
Darius, could you stand next
to him? Just to make sure...

806
01:01:06,686 --> 01:01:09,148
- Okay? You're ready?
- Thank you.

807
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,688
- Yep.
- Yes.

808
01:01:11,988 --> 01:01:14,626
Okay,
let's get ready to open the doors.

809
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:17,123
Open on my signal, yes?

810
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,401
And... go.

811
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,506
Good evening.

812
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:28,706
- Welcome to the Captain's Dinner.
- Thank you.

813
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:31,742
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Thank you very much.

814
01:01:31,744 --> 01:01:34,679
Good evening. Welcome
to the Captain's Dinner.

815
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:36,318
Hi... Hi!

816
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,145
Good evening.
Enjoying your cruise?

817
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,687
- Welcome.
- Hello, ma'am.

818
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:45,295
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

819
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:49,694
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

820
01:01:49,696 --> 01:01:51,696
Enjoy your dinner.

821
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:54,160
Hope the weather's
not too rough on you.

822
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:57,372
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

823
01:01:57,374 --> 01:01:58,901
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

824
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:01,068
Nice to meet
you. Enjoy your dinner.

825
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,675
- Hello, sir.
- Good evening. Jarmo Björkman...

826
01:02:03,677 --> 01:02:06,073
I have a question. I'm sorry.

827
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:10,649
- Yesterday, I was up on deck.
- Yes.

828
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:14,324
And it was so beautiful.
Everything was fantastic.

829
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:16,523
But then, I saw the sails.

830
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:19,086
The sails?

831
01:02:19,088 --> 01:02:20,791
- The sails, yes.
- Oh...

832
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:24,301
Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

833
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:28,029
Do you think it's
possible to wash them?

834
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:32,132
Well, I don't think that's possible,
ma'am, because, er...

835
01:02:32,134 --> 01:02:35,509
- ...this is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

836
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:37,907
So, we don't have any sails.

837
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:43,517
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

838
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,358
- Well... Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

839
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:53,391
<i>- Magnus!
- Yes?</i>

840
01:02:54,392 --> 01:03:01,024
<i>The ship in the catalogue
had bright white sails, didn't it?</i>

841
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:03,068
<i>- Yes.
- Right.</i>

842
01:03:04,232 --> 01:03:06,573
Yes. He says yes.

843
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,740
- It was sails.
- Magnus says yes.

844
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:09,972
Yes.

845
01:03:10,942 --> 01:03:13,272
Jesus Christ...

846
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:15,912
Well, then, in that case,

847
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:18,244
we will clean the sails.

848
01:03:18,246 --> 01:03:21,391
- Yes.
- Of course.

849
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:24,954
I'm sure we can find a
solution for you. I'm sure...

850
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:27,253
- Can I escort you to a table?
- Okay.

851
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:29,399
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

852
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:32,764
Well... Jarmo Björkman.
I'm sitting at your table.

853
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:34,964
- Oh! Good, good.
- Hello, Jarmo.

854
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:36,768
Are you also sitting
at the captain's table?

855
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:37,901
Yes, I am.

856
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:40,476
- Is it this one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

857
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:42,235
Oh, Lord...

858
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:57,085
It's not so much apps as code.

859
01:03:57,087 --> 01:04:01,320
I create code for apps.
So you can program...

860
01:04:01,322 --> 01:04:07,095
So, I sell my codes and my
skills to different tech companies.

861
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:14,135
And then,
the game makers are pitching ideas to me.

862
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,005
Sir.

863
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:21,714
So, good evening.

864
01:04:21,716 --> 01:04:24,013
For tonight's first meal,
we will be serving you

865
01:04:24,015 --> 01:04:27,181
some delicious oysters with
some black Russian caviar.

866
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:30,085
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

867
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:39,699
- Are we enjoying the food?
- Yes, very much.

868
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:50,644
So,
what business do you have together?

869
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:52,877
Oh,
it's a family business.

870
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:56,144
Producing products in
precision engineering.

871
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,312
What do you manufacture?

872
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:02,492
Well, our products have been
employed in upholding democracy

873
01:05:02,494 --> 01:05:04,757
all over the world.

874
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:12,226
What product is that?

875
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:15,867
Basically, our best-selling
product is the hand grenade.

876
01:05:17,575 --> 01:05:19,542
Sorry, the what?

877
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:21,840
The hand grenade, dear.

878
01:05:27,651 --> 01:05:30,520
For a long time,
it was the personal exploding device.

879
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:35,183
But then came those UN regulations,
and messed everything up.

880
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:38,528
A personal exploding device...

881
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:40,122
Excuse me.

882
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:44,501
...is a very complicated
word for a land mine.

883
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:46,964
Yeah...

884
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:52,431
Those regulations
trimmed... 25% off on profits.

885
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:55,269
- Yeah.
- It was hard times for us, but...

886
01:05:56,071 --> 01:05:59,911
- We pulled together, didn't we?
- Yes, we did, darling.

887
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:02,585
And we still love each other.

888
01:06:02,587 --> 01:06:04,488
- A toast!
- Oh, yeah.

889
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:08,381
Er... to love!

890
01:06:09,693 --> 01:06:11,054
- To love.
- To love.

891
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:22,868
- Sir.
- Madam.

892
01:06:27,645 --> 01:06:31,305
This is our sea urchin,
with an emulsion of sea weed.

893
01:06:31,307 --> 01:06:35,309
On top, you've got black truffle,
caviar, chili oil,

894
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:38,048
and a drizzle of
yuzu vinaigrette.

895
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,918
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

896
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:46,023
- Hmm!
- Hmm...

897
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:56,363
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes.

898
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:58,332
Madam.

899
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:20,564
Sir.

900
01:07:21,489 --> 01:07:23,324
Madam.

901
01:07:24,636 --> 01:07:27,604
- So are you feeling a bit seasick?
- Yes, a bit.

902
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,870
Yes, so I think it would
be better to eat something,

903
01:07:29,872 --> 01:07:32,675
because seasickness is
worse on an empty stomach.

904
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:56,765
Sir.

905
01:08:04,565 --> 01:08:08,567
So, now we are serving some hamburger
with french fries for the captain.

906
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:10,503
And for you,
we have something really special.

907
01:08:10,505 --> 01:08:14,849
We have grilled and smoked octopus
along with some caramelized lemon,

908
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:18,280
and on top,
beautiful garden flowers. Please enjoy.

909
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:21,955
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

910
01:08:24,762 --> 01:08:26,861
Are you okay?

911
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:36,268
Madam? Dagueneau,
French, Sauvignon blanc?

912
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:37,448
<i>Champignon...</i>

913
01:08:37,487 --> 01:08:38,781
<i>Du champagne! S'il vous plaît.</i>

914
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:40,500
Champagne.

915
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:46,308
Quick!

916
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:53,381
<i>Santé!</i>

917
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:57,958
If you feel seasick,
you should try and eat something, ma'am.

918
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,125
Oh, are you okay?

919
01:09:01,127 --> 01:09:05,129
Are you alright, sir?

920
01:09:06,132 --> 01:09:08,363
Sir?

921
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:21,949
I'm good...

922
01:09:24,822 --> 01:09:26,822
Excuse me.

923
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:29,121
- Are you okay?
- I'm afraid not...

924
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:33,289
How are you?

925
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:38,327
Oh, my God! Oh!

926
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:39,835
Please.

927
01:09:39,837 --> 01:09:42,166
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

928
01:09:42,168 --> 01:09:45,466
- Oh, my darling.
- More champagne...

929
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:48,502
Maybe you should
have some water?

930
01:09:48,504 --> 01:09:49,944
Champagne.

931
01:09:49,946 --> 01:09:52,506
Champagne? You should
not drink champagne now.

932
01:09:52,508 --> 01:09:54,409
Take some water, please.

933
01:09:57,019 --> 01:10:00,086
Okay. It's helping.
She's fine. Yeah...

934
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,028
Okay,
the restroom. Let's go, I've got you.

935
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:11,031
- More wine, sir?
- Ludmilla, don't leave me!

936
01:10:23,275 --> 01:10:25,144
You okay?

937
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,383
Darius?

938
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:39,718
- He doesn't look well.
- You okay? Feeling seasick, sir?

939
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,622
Is it your chest? Here,
chest pains.

940
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:44,999
- Grilled octopus...
- Ginger candy?

941
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:49,003
Oh,
ma'am. Thank you for tonight.

942
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:55,108
Everybody,
let's try to keep calm. Take your seats.

943
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:58,341
Er... the next course is
going to be wonderful.

944
01:10:58,343 --> 01:11:01,081
Ginger candy? It's
good if you're seasick.

945
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,248
Ginger candy? It's
good if you're seasick.

946
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:06,119
Stay calm, everybody,
everything is fine.

947
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:09,192
Damn!

948
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:14,226
Excuse us. Excuse me. Make way,
please.

949
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:16,228
Are you okay?

950
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,658
Keep moving,
everything is fine. Everything is fine.

951
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,232
I'm gonna open your shirt.

952
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,036
- Is it a stroke?
- I don't know.

953
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:23,265
Everybody, stay calm!

954
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:24,837
<i>In den Wolken.</i>

955
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:28,173
Erik! Erik! The
defibrillator right now!

956
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:29,578
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

957
01:11:31,212 --> 01:11:34,575
- Careful! Careful!
- Thank you for tonight.

958
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:36,952
Thank you for
tonight. Thank you.

959
01:11:36,954 --> 01:11:40,216
- Just clean up now.
- Take some deep breaths for me, sir.

960
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:44,314
<i>Start by removing all clothing
from the patient's chest...</i>

961
01:11:56,336 --> 01:11:58,303
Oh, oh!

962
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:02,801
- That's okay, madam.
- Hey... There, there.

963
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:05,441
I'm glad the hat came in useful.

964
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:08,885
- So sorry, darling...
- No, no. It's nothing at all.

965
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:19,093
Ha! Okay,
here we are.

966
01:12:20,327 --> 01:12:21,787
Thank you.

967
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:28,234
I have a joke. Do you know
how to tell a communist?

968
01:12:29,665 --> 01:12:32,501
It's someone who
reads Marx and Lenin.

969
01:12:32,503 --> 01:12:36,472
And do you know how
to tell an anti-communist?

970
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:38,013
Uh-huh.

971
01:12:38,015 --> 01:12:42,808
It's someone who understands
Marx and Lenin. Ha-ha!

972
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:45,844
It's Ronald Reagan. Funny guy!

973
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:50,519
"Never argue with an idiot,
they'll only bring you down to their level

974
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:53,588
"and beat you with
experience." Mark Twain.

975
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:56,031
Oh-oh... Okay.

976
01:12:56,033 --> 01:12:58,593
Ronald Reagan, he said also,

977
01:12:58,595 --> 01:13:03,434
"Socialism works only in
heaven where they don't need it,

978
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:07,504
"and in hell where
they already have it."

979
01:13:07,506 --> 01:13:10,770
- That's... that's pretty good.
- Yeah?

980
01:13:10,772 --> 01:13:13,147
Okay. Hold on...
I've got one here.

981
01:13:14,084 --> 01:13:15,841
Oh, oh, oh, no, I have one!

982
01:13:15,843 --> 01:13:20,990
"Growth for the sake of growth
is the ideology of a cancer cell."

983
01:13:20,992 --> 01:13:23,091
- Ah...
- That's Edward Abbey.

984
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:27,820
Listen: "The problem with
socialism is that you eventually

985
01:13:27,822 --> 01:13:30,889
"run out of other
people's money."

986
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:34,135
- Margaret Thatcher.
- You're going to like this one...

01:13:34,137 --> 01:13:39,206
"The last capitalist we hang will
be the one who sold us the rope."

988
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:42,769
- Karl Marx.
- Oh! Shit!

989
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:46,543
Okay! Okay, okay, okay...

990
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:54,518
- Sorry.
- Dear God!

991
01:13:57,556 --> 01:13:59,885
Okay. A classic.

Drink, my friend!

1004
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:04,489
Drink,
you're supposed to drain it.

1005
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:06,590
- Come on.
- Okay.

1006
01:15:06,592 --> 01:15:07,998
Drink!

1007

- Dimitry, stay focused! Stay focused.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1008
01:15:12,993 --> 01:15:14,927
- Drink!
- Okay.

1009
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:19,603
- Red or black?
- Black.

1010
01:15:19,605 --> 01:15:20,966
Very good.

1011
01:15:21,837 --> 01:15:24,838
- Red or black?
- Er... black.

1012
01:15:25,545 --> 01:15:27,281
Have a drink.

1013
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:33,946
Okay...

- Red.
- Take a drink!

King had been shot.

again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

the Kennedy brothers, and Malcolm X,

had their finger on the trigger.

01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:52,871
Settle down now. Stay
calm in this situation.

1185
01:29:52,873 --> 01:29:55,544
I'm calm,
I'm calm. What's the problem with you, man?

1186
01:29:55,546 --> 01:29:57,381
No one else?

1187
01:29:57,383 --> 01:29:59,153
You think I'm a pirate?

1188
01:29:59,155 --> 01:30:00,846
Are you okay?

1189
01:30:00,848 --> 01:30:04,191
Just because I'm black,
you think that I'm a pirate. That's it!

1190
01:30:04,193 --> 01:30:06,324
- Ah! Okay, okay.
- Don't go there...

1191
01:30:06,326 --> 01:30:08,821
- Don't say that I'm...
- Don't go there.

1192
01:30:08,823 --> 01:30:11,000
You can
cry on my shoulder!

1193
01:30:11,002 --> 01:30:14,971
He comes to me with his big watch and
says I'm a pirate just because I'm black!

1194
01:30:14,973 --> 01:30:16,400
What's the problem with you,
man?

1195
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:18,567
He hasn't said
anything about you being black.

1196
01:30:18,569 --> 01:30:23,407
- You're calling him a racist.
- In the eyes, I can see it in his eyes...

1197
01:30:23,409 --> 01:30:25,871
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Sir!

1198
01:30:25,873 --> 01:30:29,183
- I work in the engine room, man!
- Sir!

1199
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:31,317
- What?
- Excuse me.

1200
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:33,582
I think you should
just calm down now.

1201
01:30:33,584 --> 01:30:36,223
It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1202
01:30:36,225 --> 01:30:37,421
Just stay calm
and stay positive.

1203
01:30:37,423 --> 01:30:39,489
He works
in the engine room?

1204
01:30:39,491 --> 01:30:42,921
There's a lot of people on the
boat. We can't see each other all the time.

1205
01:30:42,923 --> 01:30:47,069
- So what's the problem?
- Please don't go there.

1206
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:48,972
I'm sorry. I just
have to get that.

1207
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,273
- Just say what you have to say.
- Stop.

1208
01:30:53,275 --> 01:30:55,044
Say it to me.

1209
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:57,408
Yes,
I know. I'll get back to you. I know.

1210
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:00,049
Sir. Sir!

1211
01:31:44,754 --> 01:31:47,162
Oh! Ah!

1212
01:31:47,164 --> 01:31:48,328
Easy, easy!

1213
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:04,509
Oh...

1214
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:07,512
- Ow! Ow!
- Shh, shh!

1215
01:32:10,055 --> 01:32:11,977
Be quiet.

1216
01:32:16,836 --> 01:32:19,296
<i>Nein... nein...</i>

1217
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:20,714
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1218
01:32:25,861 --> 01:32:28,697
No,
don't use the flares!

1219
01:32:28,699 --> 01:32:31,667
It's our last flare!
Don't use the flare!

1220
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:45,990
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...</i>

1221
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:02,132
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1222
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,181
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1223
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:14,518
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1224
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,196
<i>Nein, nein. In den Wolken!</i>

1225
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:29,618
<i>IN DEN WOLKEN!</i>

1226
01:33:54,434 --> 01:33:57,270
<i>My, oh my, oh my!</i>

1227
01:33:57,426 --> 01:34:00,295
- Hey!
- What?

1228
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:01,856
Look!

1229
01:34:01,858 --> 01:34:03,496
Oh, shit...

1230
01:34:04,795 --> 01:34:06,960
Yaya, wake up, wake up.

1231
01:34:10,801 --> 01:34:12,241
Look!

1232
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:26,815
There's water in there.

1233
01:34:26,817 --> 01:34:29,192
- There's water in there.
- Yes!

1234
01:34:30,228 --> 01:34:32,459
- Is it closed?
- It's closed. It's closed.

1235
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:35,824
- Paula, we need water!
- Be patient.

1236
01:34:35,826 --> 01:34:39,466
- Is somebody in there?
- Yeah, there's someone in there.

1237
01:34:39,468 --> 01:34:41,633
Calm down, calm down.

1238
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:43,734
- Does she have water?
- Yes.

1239
01:34:43,736 --> 01:34:48,034
Open up! Open up!

1240
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:52,446
Open
up! Open up! Open up!

1241
01:34:53,515 --> 01:34:57,253
- It's Abigail. Abigail! Come out!
- Ma'am Paula?

1242
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:59,585
- Are you okay?
- What?

1243
01:34:59,587 --> 01:35:01,488
- Open the hatch!
- Water! Water!

1244
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,885
- Okay!
- Paula, we need water...

1245
01:35:06,297 --> 01:35:09,331
- Hey, ma'am Paula!
- What do you have?

1246
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,697
We need all of these
boxes out. Okay?

1247
01:35:12,699 --> 01:35:15,667
So, everybody,
just calm down. We'll get water now.

1248
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:17,537
Yes!

1249
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:19,901
There's some chips in there
as well. So, everybody will get some.

1250
01:35:19,903 --> 01:35:21,870
- And chips?
- And chips.

1251
01:35:28,649 --> 01:35:31,254
What's she doing?

1252
01:35:31,256 --> 01:35:34,179
What are you doing? What's
taking so long? Come on.

1253
01:35:37,019 --> 01:35:40,230
Just wait a minute. Just
back up. Back up a bit.

1254
01:35:41,098 --> 01:35:43,860
And the chips, Abigail. Come on,
everything out.

1255
01:35:43,862 --> 01:35:46,533
Paula,
ask for food, yeah?

1256
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:52,197
- And the Evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1257
01:35:54,543 --> 01:35:56,840
Thank you.
And how many are you?

1258
01:35:56,842 --> 01:36:00,415
You're five? Just be
patient. Everyone will get...

1259
01:36:01,286 --> 01:36:02,780
Here you go.

1260
01:36:04,355 --> 01:36:05,816
There you go.

1261
01:36:06,852 --> 01:36:08,456
Please save it.

1262
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,403
- Are there more boxes with water?
- No, this is it.

1263
01:36:21,405 --> 01:36:23,603
- What's this?
- It's a facial spray.

1264
01:36:23,605 --> 01:36:26,375
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1265
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:30,676
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1266
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:36,616
Here you go.

1267
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:38,808
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1268
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:50,945
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1269
01:37:01,907 --> 01:37:03,412
Okay?

1270
01:37:40,451 --> 01:37:43,551
Bravo!

1271
01:37:43,553 --> 01:37:46,620
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1272
01:37:48,183 --> 01:37:49,623
Crazy.

1273
01:37:54,255 --> 01:37:58,797
- Did she catch that with her hands?
- Good job, Abigail!

1274
01:38:00,195 --> 01:38:04,197
Good job! What is
that? An octopus?

1275
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:06,475
- Octopus.
- Good!

1276
01:38:06,477 --> 01:38:09,577
- What do you think we should do now?
- Fucking impressive.

1277
01:38:09,579 --> 01:38:12,140
We
need to make a fire.

1278
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:14,582
Of course
we need to make a fire.

1279
01:38:14,584 --> 01:38:15,946
Yes...

1280
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,555
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1281
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:21,820
What?

1282
01:38:21,822 --> 01:38:25,725
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1283
01:38:28,796 --> 01:38:30,289
- No?
- No!

1284
01:38:31,128 --> 01:38:32,930
- What?
- No!

1285
01:38:33,999 --> 01:38:37,605
Then you'll make the fire after you're
done fishing, and then we should...

1286
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:40,938
- We need to clean the octopus.
- Of course we do.

1287
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:48,583
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1288
01:38:48,585 --> 01:38:52,884
- Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1289
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:54,952
Do you know how to do it?

1290
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:05,699
Uh-huh...

1291
01:39:15,777 --> 01:39:17,678
One for you.

1292
01:39:18,582 --> 01:39:20,438
One for me.

1293
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:21,979
One for you.

1294
01:39:22,685 --> 01:39:24,619
One for me.

1295
01:39:24,621 --> 01:39:26,444
One for you.

1296
01:39:26,446 --> 01:39:28,314
One for me.

1297
01:39:28,316 --> 01:39:30,119
One for you.

1298
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:31,659
One for me.

1299
01:39:32,452 --> 01:39:33,595
One for you.

1300
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:36,125
One for me.

1301
01:39:36,127 --> 01:39:39,502
One for you. One for me.

1302
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:41,933
One for you.

1303
01:39:41,935 --> 01:39:43,539
For me.

1304
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,607
For you. For me.

1305
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:48,203
For you. For me.

1306
01:39:49,646 --> 01:39:51,943
- Uh-huh!
- What?

1307
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,079
What's that?

1308
01:39:57,984 --> 01:39:59,951
That's mine.

1309
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:02,052
No,
the big pile there? What's that?

1310
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:04,482
Mine. It's mine.

1311
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:07,530
- All of this?
- Yes.

1312
01:40:08,465 --> 01:40:12,457
No. No, no,
no... Why do you get so much food?

1313
01:40:14,165 --> 01:40:15,427
Why?

1314
01:40:19,335 --> 01:40:21,269
I caught the fish.

1315
01:40:21,975 --> 01:40:24,173
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1316
01:40:24,175 --> 01:40:26,043
- And?
- I cooked.

1317
01:40:26,045 --> 01:40:30,278
I did all the work. And
everybody got something.

1318
01:40:33,184 --> 01:40:34,590
Hmm...

1319
01:40:35,351 --> 01:40:38,660
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1320
01:40:38,662 --> 01:40:40,827
What did you do?

1321
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:45,392
We... gathered all
the wood for the fire.

1322
01:40:45,394 --> 01:40:48,032
I moved the log.

1323
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:51,673
Yeah, this big log was over there,
and we moved it over here.

1324
01:40:51,675 --> 01:40:53,334
Not enough.

1325
01:40:54,502 --> 01:40:57,712
No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1326
01:40:57,714 --> 01:41:01,914
- They don't know how to do that.
- Exactly.

1327
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:07,821
And maybe that's why you should
not be so lazy and dependent on me.

1328
01:41:07,823 --> 01:41:10,593
Uh-huh!

1329
01:41:29,536 --> 01:41:33,176
Abigail... I think
you're forgetting

1330
01:41:33,178 --> 01:41:36,916
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1331
01:41:36,918 --> 01:41:38,852
Remember?

1332
01:41:38,854 --> 01:41:42,416
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1333
01:41:42,418 --> 01:41:44,418
You have to do what I say.

1334
01:41:45,487 --> 01:41:49,192
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1335
01:41:49,194 --> 01:41:52,063
- You don't know how to handle...
- What yacht?

1336
01:41:52,065 --> 01:41:54,197
Where's the yacht?

1337
01:41:54,199 --> 01:41:57,266
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1338
01:41:57,268 --> 01:42:00,907
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1339
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:03,371
I can make your
life easy and nice.

1340
01:42:03,373 --> 01:42:05,945
- When we get back?
- Yeah.

1341
01:42:05,947 --> 01:42:08,277
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1342
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:11,412
What, you think that we'll
stay here forever? What?

1343
01:42:11,414 --> 01:42:14,118
You're funny.

1344
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,583
This is not how you were trained,
Abigail. Please give...

1345
01:42:17,585 --> 01:42:19,728
Whoa!

1346
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:24,458
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

1347
01:42:26,066 --> 01:42:29,331
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1348
01:42:30,565 --> 01:42:32,037
Hey!

1349
01:42:37,242 --> 01:42:38,879
Who am I?

1350
01:42:40,278 --> 01:42:42,784
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1351
01:42:42,786 --> 01:42:46,986
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1352
01:42:46,988 --> 01:42:51,694
On the yacht,
toilet manager. Here... captain. Who am I?

1353
01:42:55,832 --> 01:42:57,931
You're the captain.

1354
01:42:59,594 --> 01:43:00,835
Yes.

1355
01:43:03,807 --> 01:43:06,500
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1356
01:43:06,502 --> 01:43:09,635
- Very good. Cutie pie?
- Captain.

1357
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,946
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1358
01:43:12,948 --> 01:43:14,849
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1359
01:43:15,676 --> 01:43:17,852
Who am I?

1360
01:43:21,682 --> 01:43:23,154
Who am I?

1361
01:43:25,191 --> 01:43:26,927
Who am I?

1362
01:43:36,268 --> 01:43:39,335
In the yacht,
cleaning lady. Here, captain.

1363
01:43:40,206 --> 01:43:41,712
Okay?

1364
01:43:55,892 --> 01:43:57,991
Have one more.

1365
01:43:57,993 --> 01:43:59,487
Thank you.

1366
01:44:00,556 --> 01:44:02,655
I would say, I agree.

1367
01:44:02,657 --> 01:44:06,560
I mean,
er... we have to work together.

1368
01:44:07,563 --> 01:44:11,070
And... create a good group.

1369
01:44:11,072 --> 01:44:12,698
Good society.

1370
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,338
Do you know the saying,

1371
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:18,704
"From each
according to his ability,

1372
01:44:18,706 --> 01:44:21,674
"to each according
to his needs"?

1373
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,790
You don't know this?

1374
01:44:27,924 --> 01:44:29,616
Ma'am Paula...

1375
01:44:32,522 --> 01:44:37,998
With respect to your
expertise in this situation...

1376
01:44:39,595 --> 01:44:43,399
...I would like to make a suggestion,
if that's okay?

1377
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,237
Sure.

1378
01:44:48,703 --> 01:44:51,782
My suggestion
is that the boys...

1379
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:58,018
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1380
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:03,650
While you, ma'am Paula,
and you sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1381
01:45:30,811 --> 01:45:32,250
Thank you.

1382
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,556
Hey,
Abigail, look this...

1383
01:45:42,493 --> 01:45:44,823
I would give
you my Patek Philippe.

1384
01:45:44,825 --> 01:45:47,331
For one night in the boat. Hey,
Abigail...

1385
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:49,939
150 thousand euros!

1386
01:45:51,007 --> 01:45:54,977
- Let us in.
- For you... original Rolex.

1387
01:46:01,842 --> 01:46:05,481
Nelson... she left the bag.

1388
01:46:06,352 --> 01:46:08,682
- What?
- She left the bag.

1389
01:46:11,852 --> 01:46:14,193
What's in it?

1390
01:46:24,799 --> 01:46:27,041
Pretzel sticks.

1391
01:46:31,707 --> 01:46:35,886
- No, we can't have it.
- I'm just gonna have a look. Alright?

1392
01:46:41,684 --> 01:46:44,883
- Nice!
- We can't. No.

1393
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,629
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1394
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:56,136
Wait, wait, wait...

1395
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:04,309
Maybe...

1396
01:47:07,248 --> 01:47:10,085
...if we just make
a little hole here...

1397
01:47:10,886 --> 01:47:16,255
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1398
01:47:16,257 --> 01:47:18,257
Okay, let me try.

1399
01:47:21,922 --> 01:47:24,263
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1400
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:38,982
That was perfect!

1401
01:47:41,381 --> 01:47:44,547
- I don't wanna eat it! I wanna save it!
- So good!

1402
01:47:46,551 --> 01:47:48,353
Put it back.

1403
01:48:05,471 --> 01:48:06,800
Hmm...

1404
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:15,479
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1405
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:16,711
Yeah!

1406
01:48:28,527 --> 01:48:30,099
Vera!

1407
01:49:34,725 --> 01:49:37,133
So, what happened here?

1408
01:49:37,135 --> 01:49:39,893
Er... we made a mistake with...

1409
01:49:41,501 --> 01:49:43,501
Why?

1410
01:49:43,503 --> 01:49:45,668
We just fell asleep.

1411
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:50,035
Now I won't have enough time to go fish,
because I have to make another fire.

1412
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:54,381
It takes a lot of work to make a fire,
you know.

1413
01:49:54,383 --> 01:49:56,218
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1414
01:50:12,664 --> 01:50:14,401
Okay.

1415
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,537
Okay. Okay,
okay. Let's get this day started.

1416
01:50:19,539 --> 01:50:21,737
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1417
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:25,247
- Okay.
- Cool.

1418
01:50:25,249 --> 01:50:28,316
Wait, wait,
wait. There's one more thing.

1419
01:50:29,978 --> 01:50:34,289
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1420
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:37,621
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1421
01:50:37,623 --> 01:50:41,164
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1422
01:50:42,299 --> 01:50:44,826
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1423
01:50:44,828 --> 01:50:46,334
No.

1424
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:50,799
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1425
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:54,309
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1426
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:56,541
I'm just making sure, because...

1427
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,286
What's this?

1428
01:51:06,323 --> 01:51:08,146
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1429
01:51:08,148 --> 01:51:09,620
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1430
01:51:09,622 --> 01:51:12,492
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1431
01:51:12,494 --> 01:51:14,428
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1432
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:21,237
- I think they need to be punished.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1433
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:26,506
This is really bad.

1434
01:51:26,508 --> 01:51:28,903
This is really, really bad.

1435
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:31,906
Oh, come on...

1436
01:51:31,908 --> 01:51:34,073
I mean,
you didn't watch the fire.

1437
01:51:34,075 --> 01:51:36,549
And then you steal a
pack of pretzel sticks?

1438
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:39,486
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1439
01:51:39,488 --> 01:51:42,555
And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1440
01:51:44,361 --> 01:51:46,559
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1441
01:51:46,561 --> 01:51:49,022
I need to say something now,
because this is becoming ridiculous.

1442
01:51:49,024 --> 01:51:53,434
- No, let me say something, Abigail.
- Did you see that?

1443
01:51:53,436 --> 01:51:55,271
What?

1444
01:51:55,273 --> 01:51:58,406
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1445
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:03,312
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though...
- Put your hands down!

1446
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,512
What?

1447
01:52:05,514 --> 01:52:08,383
Your body language is so aggressive,
Carl!

1448
01:52:08,385 --> 01:52:11,551
- What?
- I'm not getting any food for you.

1449
01:52:11,553 --> 01:52:15,180
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1450
01:52:15,182 --> 01:52:18,558
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1451
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,989
You seriously don't get
it. Put your hands down!

1452
01:52:21,991 --> 01:52:25,696
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1453
01:52:25,698 --> 01:52:29,700
You are inflicting pain on
her by defending yourself.

1454
01:52:47,556 --> 01:52:50,260
Shut the fuck up! No...

1455
01:52:52,693 --> 01:52:54,186
No!

1456
01:53:21,755 --> 01:53:24,117
Hey! Ha-ha!

1457
01:53:25,396 --> 01:53:28,331
Oh... hey.

1458
01:53:29,256 --> 01:53:32,224
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1459
01:53:32,226 --> 01:53:34,403
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1460
01:53:35,296 --> 01:53:37,900
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1461
01:53:39,641 --> 01:53:43,235
- Where did you get it?
- There, at the back of the rock.

1462
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:47,317
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1463
01:53:50,981 --> 01:53:52,487
You need help?

1464
01:53:52,489 --> 01:53:55,852
Yeah, sure,
get some Nutella.

1465
01:54:18,173 --> 01:54:20,074
Oh, thank you!

1466
01:55:39,761 --> 01:55:41,695
What?

1467
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:56,611
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1468
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:21,801
Okay,
I'm going to the lifeboat now.

1469
01:56:21,803 --> 01:56:24,969
Ma'am Paula,
can you stay here and watch the fire?

1470
01:56:24,971 --> 01:56:26,431
Sure.

1471
01:56:29,304 --> 01:56:34,175
And since Carl didn't eat anything today,
he can sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1472
01:56:36,146 --> 01:56:37,718
Okay. Yeah.

1473
01:56:42,957 --> 01:56:47,155
- Can I come?
- Abigail, can we both come or...?

1474
01:56:47,157 --> 01:56:49,532
No, just you.

1475
01:56:52,669 --> 01:56:56,461
- Fine, I'll take the pretzels!
- Eh?

1476
01:57:00,974 --> 01:57:02,875
You're making
this into an issue.

1477
01:57:02,877 --> 01:57:05,173
Are you going to take them? Yes,
take them. Good.

1478
01:57:05,175 --> 01:57:08,506
Why are you making this into an issue?

1479
01:57:08,508 --> 01:57:10,685
I'm coming! One second!

1480
01:57:16,792 --> 01:57:20,485
- What are you gonna do on the boat?
- I don't know.

1481
01:57:22,192 --> 01:57:23,962
Don't act naive, seriously!

1482
01:57:23,964 --> 01:57:26,195
I don't know why she asked me,
but I'm gonna do it, of course...

1483
01:57:26,197 --> 01:57:27,768
- Really?
- Yes.

1484
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:30,297
What do you think
she wants with you?

1485
01:57:30,299 --> 01:57:33,004
You're a young, hot guy. What do
you think she's going to do with you?

1486
01:57:34,645 --> 01:57:37,008
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1487
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:40,011
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1488
01:57:40,013 --> 01:57:42,585
Take a few, and I'll take them back,
cos I don't wanna do this.

1489
01:57:42,587 --> 01:57:44,443
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1490
01:57:44,445 --> 01:57:49,020
You need to tell me what to do! You
need to tell me how to navigate this.

1491
01:57:54,731 --> 01:57:56,159
Yaya?

1492
01:57:59,835 --> 01:58:02,494
You just have to stroke her ego.

1493
01:58:05,565 --> 01:58:09,040
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1494
01:58:09,042 --> 01:58:11,503
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1495
01:58:12,572 --> 01:58:14,012
Okay.

1496
01:58:14,014 --> 01:58:16,916
- Make sure to set up boundaries.
- Yeah.

1497
01:58:16,918 --> 01:58:20,920
- And nothing sexual, okay?
- No, I won't do anything sexual.

1498
01:58:21,515 --> 01:58:22,889
Mm-hmm...

1499
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:24,726
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1500
01:58:24,728 --> 01:58:26,926
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1501
01:58:26,928 --> 01:58:29,962
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1502
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,363
Yaya,
I think she's probably expecting something.

1503
01:58:38,104 --> 01:58:41,303
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1504
01:58:42,437 --> 01:58:44,338
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1505
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:47,276
- I don't know. She might want something.
- Definitely not a massage!

1506
01:58:47,278 --> 01:58:49,784
She just gave me a whole
fucking packet of pretzels for you...

1507
01:58:49,786 --> 01:58:52,281
I don't know what to
say... I can't do anything?

1508
01:58:52,283 --> 01:58:54,052
- No!
- Okay, but...

1509
01:58:54,054 --> 01:58:56,923
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1510
01:58:56,925 --> 01:58:59,386
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1511
01:59:01,732 --> 01:59:03,489
Okay.

1512
01:59:05,626 --> 01:59:08,132
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1513
01:59:08,134 --> 01:59:10,562
I understand! Fuck...

1514
01:59:11,299 --> 01:59:13,940
Yeah... Coming!

1515
01:59:31,762 --> 01:59:33,828
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1516
01:59:34,831 --> 01:59:37,227
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1517
01:59:38,703 --> 01:59:41,593
Yaya! Yaya, wait. Wait.

1518
01:59:48,668 --> 01:59:51,570
Hey, you!

1519
02:00:24,638 --> 02:00:26,947
- See you later.
- Okay.

1520
02:00:26,949 --> 02:00:30,478
Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

1521
02:00:35,452 --> 02:00:37,221
Disgusting.

1522
02:00:37,223 --> 02:00:39,223
What?

1523
02:00:50,841 --> 02:00:52,973
What the fuck?

1524
02:00:54,009 --> 02:00:56,042
Oh, fucking hell...

1525
02:01:13,831 --> 02:01:16,766
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

1526
02:01:27,977 --> 02:01:31,440
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

1527
02:01:32,729 --> 02:01:33,730
<i>In den Wolken.</i>

1528
02:01:34,247 --> 02:01:36,477
Oh,
you slept with somebody to get a job?

1529
02:01:36,568 --> 02:01:37,819
<i>Nein, nein, nein!</i>

1530
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:49,754
No, you didn't?

1531
02:01:49,756 --> 02:01:52,461
Really? Once?

1532
02:01:52,917 --> 02:01:54,669
<i>Once doesn't count.</i>

1533
02:01:57,797 --> 02:02:00,601
Therese... Wow!

1534
02:02:05,608 --> 02:02:07,805
Where is it?

1535
02:02:07,807 --> 02:02:11,084
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

1536
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,288
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

1537
02:02:17,290 --> 02:02:19,356
Give me the whistle now!

1538
02:02:21,965 --> 02:02:23,690
So childish!

1539
02:02:53,524 --> 02:02:55,194
Hey...

1540
02:02:55,196 --> 02:02:57,757
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

1541
02:02:57,759 --> 02:03:00,331
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

1542
02:03:04,106 --> 02:03:07,800
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

1543
02:03:12,114 --> 02:03:16,347
No. We
don't go there. What?

1544
02:03:16,349 --> 02:03:18,514
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

1545
02:03:25,127 --> 02:03:27,292
Nelson, give me that.

1546
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:31,560
Are you sure?

1547
02:03:49,349 --> 02:03:50,843
Fuck...

1548
02:03:57,555 --> 02:03:59,390
It's a female.

1549
02:04:00,459 --> 02:04:02,096
Kill it.

1550
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,709
- Whoo!
- Ya!

1551
02:04:27,387 --> 02:04:30,289
It's moving. It's moving.

1552
02:04:30,291 --> 02:04:33,061
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

1553
02:04:33,063 --> 02:04:36,262
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

1554
02:04:39,297 --> 02:04:41,498
- What's he doing?
- No, no, no.

1555
02:04:42,964 --> 02:04:44,963
Ah, again! Do it again!

1556
02:04:55,778 --> 02:04:59,054
Jarmo! Jarmo...<i> la tempe.</i>

1557
02:05:06,988 --> 02:05:08,999
Hey, you did it!

1558
02:05:19,274 --> 02:05:24,178
Hunter Jarmo! Big
hunter! Come on!

1559
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:28,809
- Give him applause! Hey!
- Jarmo! Jarmo! Jarmo...

1560
02:05:31,012 --> 02:05:35,013
- Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

1561
02:05:35,016 --> 02:05:38,357
- Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

1562
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:41,360
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Thank you very much.

1563
02:05:41,362 --> 02:05:47,300
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1564
02:05:47,302 --> 02:05:50,336
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1565
02:05:50,338 --> 02:05:53,801
- To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1566
02:05:54,474 --> 02:05:57,541
To paint a donkey!

1567
02:05:57,543 --> 02:06:00,379
Yes!

1568
02:06:03,545 --> 02:06:05,747
Let's take a
look at the expression.

1569
02:06:05,749 --> 02:06:08,420
- Who did this one?
- Me.

1570
02:06:08,422 --> 02:06:11,819
Okay, the feet are close,
close together.

1571
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:15,229
This donkey wants
to be in control.

1572
02:06:15,231 --> 02:06:18,694
But it looks almost scared.

1573
02:06:19,499 --> 02:06:21,763
You want to tell
this donkey to...

1574
02:06:22,766 --> 02:06:24,667
...to not be so scared.

1575
02:06:24,669 --> 02:06:29,705
To lose control and bound
away across the fields,

1576
02:06:29,707 --> 02:06:32,609
wildly waving its tail!

1577
02:06:33,612 --> 02:06:37,120
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1578
02:06:41,015 --> 02:06:42,289
Huh?

1579
02:06:43,754 --> 02:06:45,886
- Carl?
- Yeah.

1580
02:06:48,429 --> 02:06:50,726
What are you doing
with your hand?

1581
02:06:53,434 --> 02:06:56,501
- Which one?
- Seriously?

1582
02:07:01,035 --> 02:07:03,310
I'm just resting
it on the chair.

1583
02:07:05,446 --> 02:07:08,810
Why is your hand under
her jacket on a chair?

1584
02:07:10,451 --> 02:07:12,044
What...?

1585
02:07:12,946 --> 02:07:15,256
It was just... I don't know,
it was there,

1586
02:07:15,258 --> 02:07:18,050
resting on the
side of... the chair.

1587
02:07:41,009 --> 02:07:44,076
I'm
coming. I'm coming!

1588
02:07:45,387 --> 02:07:47,112
I'm coming...

1589
02:07:47,114 --> 02:07:49,917
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

1590
02:08:05,869 --> 02:08:07,902
Okay, you know...

1591
02:08:07,904 --> 02:08:11,609
...if you can't handle it, just tell me,
nobody's forcing you to do anything.

1592
02:08:11,611 --> 02:08:15,679
It's just all this fucking sneaking
around and hiding things from everyone.

1593
02:08:15,681 --> 02:08:18,979
It's too much. It's... it's
becoming unbearable.

1594
02:08:18,981 --> 02:08:22,818
I mean, they're obviously not
happy with what we're doing in here.

1595
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:29,660
Okay,
so... Let's just... tell them the truth.

1596
02:08:32,995 --> 02:08:38,340
You give me something,
and I give you something in return.

1597
02:08:43,445 --> 02:08:46,072
You realize what
position that puts me in?

1598
02:08:47,174 --> 02:08:48,481
No.

1599
02:08:50,177 --> 02:08:54,323
Well, just because it's more
open that you're a flesh peddler,

1600
02:08:54,325 --> 02:08:56,181
it doesn't mean they're
gonna accept the fact

1601
02:08:56,183 --> 02:08:58,887
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1602
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:01,428
Wow...

1603
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,123
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1604
02:09:04,125 --> 02:09:06,565
Do you know the amount
of work I put into this island?

1605
02:09:06,567 --> 02:09:09,733
- I go fishing every day, I make fire...
- I know, I know.

1606
02:09:09,735 --> 02:09:12,374
- I'm responsible for everybody here!
- I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1607
02:09:12,376 --> 02:09:16,509
- Shouldn't that give me an advantage?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1608
02:09:16,511 --> 02:09:20,250
- Okay!
- You deserve to do what you want, I know.

1609
02:09:28,215 --> 02:09:31,216
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1610
02:09:31,218 --> 02:09:34,087
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1611
02:09:36,927 --> 02:09:40,764
But, really, maybe we should just do that,
maybe we should just get on with it.

1612
02:09:40,766 --> 02:09:43,767
I don't know,
kiss a little bit in public and hold hands.

1613
02:09:43,769 --> 02:09:46,539
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

1614
02:09:46,541 --> 02:09:50,609
I would have a conversation with
Yaya. I would have to be an adult about it.

1615
02:09:50,611 --> 02:09:55,384
And figure it out, but... I think it
would be easier for her, probably.

1616
02:09:55,386 --> 02:09:58,111
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1617
02:09:58,113 --> 02:10:00,455
Carl, I... I don't know.

1618
02:10:08,959 --> 02:10:11,433
Do you want me to
break up with Yaya?

1619
02:10:11,435 --> 02:10:13,126
- No.
- No?

1620
02:10:15,262 --> 02:10:17,834
That's your decision, not mine.

1621
02:10:20,641 --> 02:10:24,775
I'm not asking you to do it,
I'm just seeing what you think about it.

1622
02:10:24,777 --> 02:10:28,450
I know, but that doesn't mean that you
can put me in-between the two of you.

1623
02:10:28,452 --> 02:10:29,978
Okay, okay.

1624
02:10:38,252 --> 02:10:40,824
It's kind of a perfect scenario for you,
I mean...

1625
02:10:42,323 --> 02:10:44,663
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1626
02:10:44,665 --> 02:10:46,995
no responsibilities, you know.

1627
02:10:46,997 --> 02:10:49,162
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1628
02:10:49,164 --> 02:10:52,704
Because I feel like I need to
know where this is going, Abigail.

1629
02:10:55,137 --> 02:10:57,170
Let's just have fun.

1630
02:10:57,172 --> 02:10:59,514
No, but I need to try to
deal with this situation.

1631
02:10:59,516 --> 02:11:01,615
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1632
02:11:03,849 --> 02:11:06,212
I don't wanna annoy
anyone anymore.

1633
02:11:08,525 --> 02:11:12,284
Do you remember what you
said the first night you were here?

1634
02:11:12,286 --> 02:11:14,121
What did you say?

1635
02:11:16,191 --> 02:11:19,027
"I love you, you give me fish."

1636
02:11:19,029 --> 02:11:20,699
Exactly.

1637
02:11:20,701 --> 02:11:24,032
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1638
02:11:24,034 --> 02:11:25,639
- No.
- Like you...

1639
02:11:25,641 --> 02:11:28,135
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1640
02:11:33,241 --> 02:11:36,308
So, Nelson... you're a pirate,
huh?

1641
02:11:37,718 --> 02:11:39,554
Come on, stop it.

1642
02:11:39,759 --> 02:11:41,010
<i>In den Wolken?</i>

1643
02:11:41,657 --> 02:11:44,921
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1644
02:11:44,923 --> 02:11:47,397
How much money do you make?

1645
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:50,565
Yeah, of course.

1646
02:11:50,567 --> 02:11:53,930
I don't know,
like... 3,000 euros.

1647
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,229
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1648
02:11:57,067 --> 02:11:58,836
If we succeed.

1649
02:11:59,773 --> 02:12:02,906
So, you work on commission, huh?

1650
02:12:02,908 --> 02:12:04,908
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1651
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:07,339
The client is making all money?

1652
02:12:08,141 --> 02:12:11,487
Yeah, but you can make
more if you have your own boat.

1653
02:12:13,886 --> 02:12:17,460
3,000 euros... Come on,
you're crazy.

1654
02:12:18,419 --> 02:12:20,891
My girlfriend is expensive.

1655
02:12:20,893 --> 02:12:23,631
What? You invest
in your girlfriend?

1656
02:12:23,633 --> 02:12:25,732
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1657
02:12:25,734 --> 02:12:28,393
You should do it
the other way around.

1658
02:12:28,395 --> 02:12:31,771
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1659
02:12:31,773 --> 02:12:32,969
Yeah?

1660
02:12:33,572 --> 02:12:35,906
Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1661
02:12:51,661 --> 02:12:53,562
Hey.

1662
02:12:53,564 --> 02:12:56,499
I was just wondering if I
could borrow the backpack.

1663
02:12:56,501 --> 02:12:59,226
- Abigail?
- Yeah, I know.

1664
02:12:59,228 --> 02:13:00,898
- What are you going to do,
Yaya?

1665
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:02,604
- Go for a hike
over the mountain.

1666
02:13:02,606 --> 02:13:04,837
See if I can find something.

1667
02:13:08,105 --> 02:13:11,975
- I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1668
02:13:11,977 --> 02:13:15,880
No, Yaya, it's not safe for
you to go alone. I'll go with you.

1669
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:18,719
Okay.

1670
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:27,188
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1671
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:29,322
I need some time alone with her.

1672
02:13:29,324 --> 02:13:30,896
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1673
02:13:36,904 --> 02:13:38,772
I'll take it.

1674
02:14:06,637 --> 02:14:08,901
I'm glad we're doing this together,
Yaya.

1675
02:14:10,872 --> 02:14:12,365
Me, too.

1676
02:14:13,167 --> 02:14:15,743
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

1677
02:14:15,745 --> 02:14:18,680
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1678
02:14:19,515 --> 02:14:23,343
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1679
02:14:31,056 --> 02:14:34,222
You domesticated all
the old alpha males.

1680
02:14:34,224 --> 02:14:35,730
Yeah!

1681
02:14:38,492 --> 02:14:39,932
Thank you.

1682
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,839
No, it's really impressive.

1683
02:14:53,882 --> 02:14:56,376
We should stick together, huh?

1684
02:15:22,107 --> 02:15:23,844
Oh, my God...

1685
02:15:26,783 --> 02:15:29,652
I think it should be a
little easier from here.

1686
02:16:05,568 --> 02:16:06,820
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1687
02:16:09,572 --> 02:16:11,532
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1688
02:16:28,842 --> 02:16:31,720
<i>Gucci bag, Louis Vuitton, Chanel...</i>

1689
02:16:32,928 --> 02:16:34,472
<i>Same factory.</i>

1690
02:16:50,906 --> 02:16:53,909
<i>Rolex, sunglasses, selfie stick.</i>

1691
02:16:59,330 --> 02:17:01,333
<i>In den Wolken, Uli.</i>

1692
02:17:06,949 --> 02:17:09,081
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

1693
02:17:11,118 --> 02:17:12,677
Huh?

1694
02:17:31,655 --> 02:17:32,865
<i>What you mean?</i>

1695
02:17:34,533 --> 02:17:35,616
<i>What you mean?</i>

1696
02:17:46,754 --> 02:17:47,712
<i>Nein, nein, nein...</i>

1697
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,298
<i>I got my own wife.</i>

1698
02:17:49,548 --> 02:17:51,384
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1699
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:01,100
Abigail!

1700
02:18:01,102 --> 02:18:02,595
Yeah?

1701
02:18:03,697 --> 02:18:05,697
I see something!

1702
02:18:09,275 --> 02:18:12,342
A what?

1703
02:18:14,115 --> 02:18:17,149
I can't hear you!

1704
02:18:20,286 --> 02:18:23,484
- Abigail! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

1705
02:18:24,619 --> 02:18:26,994
- Abigail!
- Yaya!

1706
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:32,625
Yaya!

1707
02:18:32,627 --> 02:18:34,166
Abigail!

1708
02:18:35,796 --> 02:18:39,336
Abigail! Abigail,
there's an elevator!

1709
02:18:41,978 --> 02:18:44,440
- It's a resort, Abigail!
- A what?

1710
02:18:44,442 --> 02:18:46,178
It's a resort!

1711
02:18:49,710 --> 02:18:53,778
Come,
look! It's a luxury resort!

1712
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:00,488
It's been there the whole time!

1713
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:03,788
It's been there the whole fucking time,
Abigail!

1714
02:19:17,738 --> 02:19:19,145
Come.

1715
02:19:22,216 --> 02:19:25,481
Come, Abigail. Come.

1716
02:19:32,963 --> 02:19:34,391
Abigail?

1717
02:19:36,625 --> 02:19:38,901
Let's enjoy this moment.

1718
02:20:13,827 --> 02:20:16,301
- It's surreal, huh?
- Yeah.

1719
02:20:30,745 --> 02:20:33,219
You must be excited to see your kids,
huh?

1720
02:20:34,749 --> 02:20:37,783
- I don't have kids.
- Ah...

1721
02:20:39,392 --> 02:20:40,885
Sorry.

1722
02:20:51,569 --> 02:20:53,074
Let's go.

1723
02:20:54,979 --> 02:20:56,638
I need to wee-wee.

1724
02:20:57,374 --> 02:20:59,509
- Yeah.
- And then we will go.

1725
02:20:59,511 --> 02:21:00,905
Okay.

1726
02:22:08,514 --> 02:22:09,974
Abigail?

1727
02:22:14,355 --> 02:22:16,685
Abigail, I can try and help you.

1728
02:22:18,689 --> 02:22:21,030
I don't know how, but...

1729
02:22:25,366 --> 02:22:29,994
Abigail... maybe you can
come and work for me?

1730
02:22:30,464 --> 02:22:32,536
You could be my assistant.

1731
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:41,215
Aargh!

1732
02:22:55,396 --> 02:22:56,692
Fuck!

1733
02:22:58,828 --> 02:23:00,135
Aargh!
