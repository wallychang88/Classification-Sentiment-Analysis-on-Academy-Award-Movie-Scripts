00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:22,473
<i>'The voice you hear
is not my speaking voice...</i>

2
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,019
<i>'but my mind's voice.</i>

3
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,405
<i>'I have not spoken
since I was six years old.</i>

4
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:37,160
<i>'No-one knows why. Not even me.</i>

5
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:52,682
<i>'My father says
it is a dark talent,</i>

6
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:56,271
<i>'and the day I take it into my head
to stop breathing will be my last.</i>

7
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:08,288
<i>'Today, he married me
to a man I've not yet met.</i>

8
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,503
<i>'Soon, my daughter and I
shall join him in his own country.</i>

9
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:18,093
<i>'My husband said
my muteness does not bother him.</i>

10
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:23,685
<i>'He writes, and hark this, God
loves dumb creatures so why not he!</i>

11
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,154
<i>'Were good he had God's patience...</i>

12
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>'for silence
affects everyone in the end.</i>

13
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:44,839
<i>'The strange thing is
I don't think myself silent.</i>

14
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,843
<i>'That is because of my piano.</i>

15
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,891
<i>'I shall miss it on the journey.'</i>

16
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,854
Take her hand, come on.

17
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,234
You're with me.

18
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,613
I've got the lady.

19
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:56,524
You go ahead.

20
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,319
Paddington Station.

21
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:02,449
Over here, my lovely!

22
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,458
All right, lads, unbutton your muftis.

23
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,794
Piss like a tom.

24
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,989
Jesus Christ,
whose bloody coffin is this?

25
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,326
Christ, it's heavy!
Hold it!

26
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,601
Fuck them. Well, just leave them behind.
It's what they fucking want.

27
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:56,650
Aye, very good. Leave them
and be lynched for the pleasure!

28
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:02,284
It's a bit rough out there. Could be they
can't get through you in this weather.

29
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,245
Do you have things for shelter?

30
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,625
She says, "Thank you."

31
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:19,056
Does your mother prefer
to come on with us to Nelson?

32
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:33,577
She says, "No." She says, she'd rather be boiled
alive by natives than get back in your tub.

33
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:39,043
You be damn fortuned I don't smack
your puppy gob, young missy!

34
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:41,547
Damn lucky!

35
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,935
We're all ready now, sir.

36
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,857
Mother, watch out!

37
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:57,654
The hens! Are they all right? Here.

38
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,797
Look, I'm a very big moth.

39
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,676
Will it catch fire?

40
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,178
I'm not gonna call him Papa.
I'm not gonna call him anything.

41
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:47,391
I'm not even going to look at him.

42
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,263
Are we stopping?

43
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,024
Shall we stop?

44
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,186
We must get on.

45
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,323
Miss McGrath? Alisdair Stewart.

46
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,579
You'll have to wake yourselves.
I've got men here to carry your things.

47
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,777
Well, I see you've got a good many boxes.

48
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,072
I'd like to know what's in each...

49
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,622
Can you hear me?

50
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,509
Well, that's good.
Yes, that's good.

51
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,473
What's in this one?

52
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:56,365
You're small.
I never thought you'd be small.

53
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,831
And this one? This is very large.

54
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:12,304
- What's in it, then, a bedstead?
- It's my mother's piano.

55
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:16,477
Baines, tell them to carry in pairs.

56
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:22,902
Take all the boxes, table
and the suitcases.

57
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,532
What do you think?

58
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,123
She looks tired.

59
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,629
She's stunted, that's one thing.

60
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,176
And the big case?

61
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,557
No, no. Just the trunks
and the boxes as I explained.

62
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:05,754
- No, it can't come now.
- It must. She wants it to come.

63
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,344
Yes, so do I. But there are too few
of us here to carry it now.

64
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,763
Too heavy!

65
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:18,522
What, you mean you don't want your
clothing or kitchenware to come?

66
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,358
Is that what you mean?

67
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:26,658
We can't leave the piano!

68
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:33,167
Let's not discuss this any further.
I'm very pleased that you arrived safely.

69
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:36,464
But we must know if they can
come back directly for it.

70
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,551
Could I apologise for the delay...

71
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,514
After they've taken the other things.

72
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:56,617
Might I suggest that you prepare
yourself for a difficult journey.

73
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:01,791
The bush will tear clothing, and
the mud is very deep in places.

74
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,638
What do they think they're doing?
We don't have time for this.

75
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,071
What's the matter?
Why are they stopping?

76
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:58,371
That's the way to the
burial grounds. It's tapu.

77
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:05,507
They want more money. They're
trying to make two days out of it.

78
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,010
No.

79
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:12,558
No, they know another track
to the side of this.

80
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:25,993
Septimus, now take that off!

81
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,038
Take that off!

82
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,084
Watch your feet! Mind your feet!

83
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:35,549
- Septimus! Please stop it!
- Stop it!

84
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,974
- Stop, please! You'll tear it!
- Oh, the tag is broken.

85
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,561
Septimus, now stop!

86
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,819
You'll tear it. Be careful.

87
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,155
Arm down.

88
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,952
If you cannot have a ceremony together...

89
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,456
...you'll have at least a photograph.

90
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:10,514
Careful. The lace is most fragile.

91
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,894
My real father was
a famous German composer.

92
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,862
They met when my mother was
an opera singer in Luxembourg.

93
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,369
Why?

94
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:30,627
I want to be in the photograph.

95
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:36,008
Going to leave the cloth here?

96
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:40,223
No, no. It is just to keep
the chair dry.

97
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,190
We must have slipped on the planks.
They have gotten very greasy.

98
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,608
Get in that chair.

99
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,903
Pull the tarpaulin off.

100
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:54,744
I am sorry it rained.
We have not light enough inside.

101
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,461
- Shall I have the umbrella on this side on t'other?
- On t'other! On t'other!

102
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,008
Can you take this, please?

103
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,136
And sitting...

104
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,645
...very still.

105
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:18,402
And where did they get married?

106
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:22,491
In an enormous forest
with fairies as bridesmaids...

107
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:25,454
...each holding a little elf's hand.

108
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:30,418
No, I tell a lie. It was in a small
country church in the mountains.

109
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,673
- Which mountains are those, dear?
- The Pyrenees.

110
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,926
I've never been there.

111
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:41,184
Mother used to sing songs in German,
and her voice echoed across the valleys.

112
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,189
- That was before the accident.
- And what happened?

113
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,322
One day, while my mother and father
were singing together in the forest...

114
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:52,742
...a great storm blew up.

115
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,620
But, so passionate was the singing...

116
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:58,499
...that they didn't notice.
They didn't stop as rain began to fall.

117
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,090
And when their voices rose for the final bars
of the duet, a great bold of lightning...

118
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:08,932
...came out of the sky and struck my
father, who lit up like a torch.

119
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,060
At the same moment my father
was struck dead...

120
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:17,318
...my mother was struck dumb.
She never spoke another word.

121
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,617
Oh, dear!

122
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:27,791
Not another word?

123
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,672
Well, from the shock. Yes.

124
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,718
It would be. Terrible.

125
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,180
Terrible.

126
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,730
Terrible, terrible.

127
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,190
Sorry.

128
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:52,285
I have to go away for some days.

129
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:59,128
Some Maori land I'm interested in
which I may buy very reasonably.

130
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,512
Well, I hope you'll spend the time
to get settled in. And perhaps...

131
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,391
...in some ways...

132
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,105
...we could start again.

133
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,983
All right?

134
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:30,506
I'm not able to read.

135
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:43,441
Please take us back to
the beach where we landed.

136
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,953
I am sorry. I can't do that.

137
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,376
I don't have the time.

138
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,924
Goodbye.

139
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:36,057
I can't take you there.

140
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,937
I can't do it.

141
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:49,953
Mumma! Mumma, watch me! Look!

142
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:06,226
Mumma! Mumma!

143
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:23,335
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

144
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:52,585
Well, you've stopped combing your hair which
is a good thing. It was looking overdone.

145
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,423
You see, these're the slits
of the heads will go through.

146
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,551
Show him, Nessie.

147
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,598
The Reverend's going to use animal blood.
No doubt it'll be very dramatic.

148
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,854
- Very dramatic.
- Tea!

149
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:14,114
Morag...

150
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:17,286
...what would you think if someone...

151
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:20,165
...were to play a kitchen table?

152
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,085
Like it were a piano.

153
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:26,882
Like it were a piano?

154
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,264
It's strange, isn't it?
I mean, it's not a piano.

155
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,809
It doesn't make any sound.

156
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,898
Biscuits!

157
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,442
No, no sound.

158
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:41,445
I knew...

159
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:46,619
...she was mute
but now I'm thinking...

160
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:51,834
...perhaps it's more than that.
I wonder if she's not brain-affected.

161
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:54,254
Shush!

162
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:58,969
- No sound at all?
- No. It was a table.

163
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:05,019
Well, she was very violent with the gown.
She tore off a chunk of lace.

164
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:10,903
I've had been here to see it. I'd have sworn you
she'd have used her teeth and wiped her feet on it.

165
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:19,790
It hasn't come to anything yet.
It's simply a concern, that's all.

166
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,167
Yes.

167
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,921
Yes, of course. A concern.

168
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:28,344
There's something
to be said for silence.

169
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,097
Indeed. Cotton?

170
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:38,483
With time, I'm sure
she'll become affectionate.

171
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:44,449
Sure, there's nothing so easy to like
as a pet. And they're quite silent.

172
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:55,424
# The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men #

173
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,969
# He marched them up and up
and marched them down again #

174
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,645
Those 80 acres across the stream,
what do you think of them?

175
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:09,527
I don't have any money.
What are you on about?

176
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:12,656
I'd like to make a swap.

177
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:16,537
- What for?
- The piano.

178
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:22,253
What, the piano on the beach?

179
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:33,143
- It's not marshy, is it?
- No.

180
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:44,743
Baines the music lover. I never would have
thought. Hidden talents, George?

181
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,381
I'd have to get lessons. It
wouldn't be much use without them.

182
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,260
Yes, I suppose you would.

183
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:05,439
Ada can play. I have it in a letter
that she plays very well.

184
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,359
She's been playing
since she was five or six.

185
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:19,334
What on?

186
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:23,881
Well, on... on your piano.
That's the swap.

187
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:26,886
What's she saying?

188
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:30,266
She says, it's her piano
and she won't have him touch it!

189
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,065
He can't read! He's ignorant!

190
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:41,489
He wants to improve himself,
and you'll be able to play it.

191
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:50,794
Teach him how to look after it!

192
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,350
You can't go on like this!

193
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:06,942
We're a family now. We all
make sacrifices, and so will you!

194
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,574
You will teach him,
and I will see to it!

195
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,594
A Broadwood!

196
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,307
A fine instrument!

197
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,602
I've not seen one here...

198
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:04,815
...nor in New South Wales
where I've tuned 200.

199
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,486
They like their pianos there.

200
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,376
Scent?

201
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,797
And salt, of course.

202
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:25,846
Mother says she can't stand to
teach piano with it out of tune.

203
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:28,308
So, I'm to do scales.

204
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:35,692
I hope you've scrubbed your hands.

205
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,657
It's in tune.

206
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,220
It's in tune.

207
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:00,477
I was teaching!

208
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,465
Mom would like to see what you can play.

209
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:24,178
I'd rather not play.

210
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,891
I want to listen, and learn that way.

211
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,478
Everyone has to practise.

212
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:34,692
I just want to listen.

213
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:01,063
Lovely.

214
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,906
Oh, but tell me again.

215
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,576
Was he your teacher?

216
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:44,916
How did you speak to him?

217
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:03,025
What happened?
Why didn't you get married?

218
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:21,175
Shall I kiss you good night?

219
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,828
Get out! You need a bath!

220
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,499
Out! Bad dog!

221
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,626
Move! Go on!

222
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,838
Bad bloody dog!

223
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,620
Ada, wait. Wait.

224
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,001
Do you know how to bargain?

225
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,798
There's a way
you could have your piano back.

226
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,761
Do you want it back?

227
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:24,849
You want it back?

228
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,776
You see...

229
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:38,159
I'd like us to make a deal.

230
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,122
There's things I'd...

231
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:45,711
...like to do while you play.

232
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,298
If you let me,
you can earn it back.

233
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:52,513
What do you think?
One visit for every key.

234
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,461
Your dress?

235
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,008
Skirt?

236
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:24,515
For every black one?

237
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:27,102
That's a lot less. Half.

238
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:33,070
All right, all right.
Then the black keys.

239
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:47,840
Poor baby!

240
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:53,389
What horrid little person
put you in the rain...

241
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:55,976
...and shoved you with a stick?

242
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,355
Hmm, baby? Huh?

243
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,403
You're all right with moi.

244
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:08,577
Scissors.

245
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:10,288
Thank you.

246
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:14,503
Nessie! Put that down
and come and put your hand out.

247
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,798
Oh, no. Use Mr. Stewart.

248
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,761
- No, no, no. Go on, Nessie.
- Nessie, please!

249
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:25,017
All right, Mary, come along.
Down here.

250
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:29,315
- Come on, girl.
- All right, then!

251
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:35,323
Down here. Put out your hand.

252
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,869
Now.

253
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,168
No, no. Put out your hand. Here.

254
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,215
Now.

255
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:53,725
Look, look! You're being attacked.

256
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,689
No, there you go.

257
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:05,908
With the blood,
it will be a very good effect!

258
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,871
Here, Flynn!

259
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:11,375
Flynn, Flynn, Flynn!

260
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,587
Flynn, Flynn! Bad boy!

261
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,923
Bad, bad boy!

262
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:20,178
Flynn, you want to be in trouble?

263
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:23,475
Flynn! Flynn!

264
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:37,453
I want to speak to my mother.

265
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,426
I don't want to be outside.
I want to watch.

266
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,184
I'll be very quiet!

267
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,655
I won't look at him!

268
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:41,294
- Be very careful.
- Careful.

269
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,971
I hardly need to give one to you,
but here you are, anyway.

270
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,641
Don't be late.

271
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:54,771
You will see that there're two times. And
since you're accompanying a performer...

272
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:57,525
...you will need to make the earlier time.

273
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:00,613
Wait!

274
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,454
How are the lessons going?

275
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:15,009
Is he getting on all right, then, is he?

276
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:21,893
She seems quietened down.
Is she more affectionate?

277
00:45:24,897 --> 00:45:28,528
Ah, well. Slowly, slowly.

278
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:36,413
Lift your skirt.

279
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:55,190
Lift it higher.

280
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,598
Higher.

281
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:24,940
Higher!

282
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:27,110
Lift it higher.

283
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:29,635
You no worry, Peini.

284
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:32,640
- I save you.
- I have a wife.

285
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,936
I save her, too!

286
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:46,200
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?

287
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:50,582
She has a life of her own,
in Hull, England.

288
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:55,213
Must be ugly... for you to run away.

289
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,092
You need another wife.

290
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:09,942
Undo your dress.

291
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:13,238
I want to see your arms.

292
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:43,907
Play.

293
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:11,278
Two keys.

294
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:08,442
"I shall listen hard at rehearsal...

295
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:12,948
...because I live too far
to come often."

296
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:15,452
Which sign is the word "rehearsal"?

297
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:23,296
I can't imagine
a fate worse than being dumb.

298
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:26,050
To be deaf.

299
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:30,389
Aye. Deaf, too? Terrible! Awful!

300
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:35,439
To tell you the whole truth, mother
says most people speak rubbish...

301
00:50:35,606 --> 00:50:38,526
...and it's not worth the listen.

302
00:50:39,444 --> 00:50:42,156
Well, that is a strong opinion.

303
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,618
Aye. It's unholy.

304
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,003
What do they say? Are they selling?

305
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,844
Offer blankets for half the land.

306
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:17,726
Twelve.

307
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,650
Offer the guns, Baines.
Offer the guns.

308
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:31,704
What do they want the land for?
They won't do anything with it?

309
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,084
They don't cultivate it,
they don't burn it back. Nothing.

310
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:39,883
I mean, how do they
even know that it's theirs?

311
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:49,188
Thought I might as well
mark it out as we agreed.

312
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:51,566
Yes, why not?

313
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:58,867
Well, Ada says
you're doing well with the piano.

314
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,788
I'd like to come and hear you play.

315
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:06,420
- What do you play?
- Nothing just yet.

316
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:08,507
No?

317
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,167
Ada, four keys.

318
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:06,255
Why five? I just want to lie.

319
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:12,304
All right, all right, five.

320
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:32,709
# Early in the month of May #

321
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,800
# The angels were sweetly singin' #

322
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:42,014
# A young man on his deathbed lay #

323
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,228
# For love of Barbara Allen #

324
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,275
We're running late!

325
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:25,242
If you haven't got your lip colour on,
can you line up behind Rose, please?

326
00:55:25,408 --> 00:55:29,247
- You all been to the lavatory?
- Yes!

327
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:35,882
I want no running on the stage!

328
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:42,265
They're bringing in extra chairs!

329
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,191
Do not touch the blood!

330
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:52,739
Look who's here?
The musical Mr. Baines!

331
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:57,620
What are you going to play for us
tonight? "Twinkle, Twinkle", George?

332
00:55:57,745 --> 00:56:00,583
How about a little tinkle-tinkle, George?

333
00:56:03,295 --> 00:56:07,718
Perhaps you would like to turn pages
for Nessi. She's playing for the children.

334
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:13,184
I'm in costume.

335
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:17,607
I'm very pleased
you've taken up the piano.

336
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:20,111
Now, where's this song?

337
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:46,022
George, excuse me.
How about "Mary Had A Little Lamb"?

338
00:56:46,147 --> 00:56:49,318
Or a polka?
Come on, Geroge, what's it to be?

339
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,656
Fools.

340
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:56,412
Come on, George. Move along.

341
00:56:57,121 --> 00:57:00,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
could you take your seats, please?

342
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,670
We're about to begin.

343
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:19,318
# Early in the month of May

344
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:23,157
# The angels were sweetly singin'

345
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:27,789
# A young man on his deathbed lay

346
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:31,794
# For love of Barbara Allen

347
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:37,094
# Out of there sprung a red rose full

348
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:41,141
# And out of it a briar

349
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:45,105
# Then they flew up
to the high church wall

350
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:49,236
# Till they could go no higher

351
00:57:50,154 --> 00:57:54,577
# And then
they came in a true love's lock

352
00:57:54,702 --> 00:58:00,167
# The roses and sweet briar #

353
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:07,053
And so the young maid came upon...

354
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:10,932
...each and all of
Bluebeard's missing wives.

355
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:15,773
Their severed heads still bleeding...

356
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:18,652
...their eyes still crying!

357
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:22,616
Slow down, Nessie. Slow down.

358
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:24,410
But hush!

359
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:26,580
Who comes?

360
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:32,964
I am home early, my sweet wife!

361
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:36,761
Where art thou?

362
00:58:36,845 --> 00:58:38,888
Oh! Husband!

363
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:42,978
- What a surprise!
- Yes, wife!

364
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,398
A surprise, indeed!

365
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:51,824
- So now you know my secret!
- No! No!

366
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:56,246
You, the youngest...

367
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,251
...and sweetest...

368
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,547
...of all my wives...

369
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:06,010
- No!
- ...must be prepared...

370
00:59:06,177 --> 00:59:08,639
...to die!

371
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,227
No! No! Wait!

372
00:59:12,561 --> 00:59:14,815
I shall not wait!

373
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,862
Bare your neck!

374
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:50,500
Chief, I'd like to introduce you.
This is Mrs Williams...

375
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:56,884
...this is Mrs Parsons, this is
Mrs Reid, this is Miss Palmer...

376
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:59,763
...and this is Miss Kerr.

377
01:00:02,809 --> 01:00:05,020
Very... very nice.

378
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,126
Do what you like.

379
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:23,254
Play what you like.

380
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:40,196
I want to lie together
without clothes on.

381
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,827
How many would that be?

382
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:55,801
Yes. Ten keys.

383
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:04,013
What the clock say, Missa Tewart?

384
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:20,505
Never behave like that.
Never nowhere.

385
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:25,887
I'm greatly shamed!
You've shamed these trunks!

386
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:48,085
I know why Mr. Baines
can't play the piano.

387
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,008
You missed some here.

388
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:59,518
She never gives him a turn.
She just plays what she pleases.

389
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:03,982
And sometimes she doesn't play at all.

390
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,028
When's the next lesson?

391
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,074
Tomorrow.

392
01:05:49,066 --> 01:05:51,069
I have given the piano back to you.

393
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:54,658
I've had enough.

394
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,377
The arrangement...

395
01:06:03,378 --> 01:06:08,052
...is making you a whore
and me wretched.

396
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,559
I want you to care for me...

397
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:15,854
...but you can't.

398
01:06:22,823 --> 01:06:24,784
It's yours. Leave.

399
01:06:26,702 --> 01:06:28,705
Go on, go.

400
01:06:45,563 --> 01:06:48,025
Stop right there!

401
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,538
This isn't yours. What are you
doing with the piano? Hmm?

402
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,542
He's given it to us.

403
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,213
Put that down. Put it down!

404
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:10,639
You're cunning, Ada.
I've seen through you.

405
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:15,480
I'm not going to lose
the land this way. Stay there!

406
01:07:24,284 --> 01:07:28,790
Hori George don't wanna see nobody.
He's sick.

407
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:33,923
You got the tupeka for Hira?

408
01:07:35,174 --> 01:07:36,968
No.

409
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,394
Baines.

410
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:47,609
Baines... Baines, look.

411
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:51,238
I don't think you should
have given up the piano.

412
01:07:52,073 --> 01:07:56,621
I'll make sure you're properly
taught. Music on sheets and so on.

413
01:07:56,746 --> 01:07:59,083
I don't want to learn.

414
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:02,879
- You don't want to learn?
- No.

415
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:08,429
But our bargain...

416
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:13,103
I can't afford the piano
if you mean me to pay.

417
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:16,607
No, no payment.
I have given it back.

418
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,531
I'm not sure I want it myself.

419
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,871
It was more to your wife that I gave it.

420
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,879
Oh, I see.

421
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:37,470
Well...
I expect she will appreciate it.

422
01:08:46,483 --> 01:08:48,527
This is all I have.

423
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:51,991
Bring that back!

424
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:09,057
Is it all right?

425
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:13,354
Why don't you play something?

426
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,447
What will I play?

427
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,621
Play a jig.

428
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:29,752
- Do I know any jigs?
- Play a song then.

429
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:09,224
Why won't she play? We get the
thing back, she just wanders off.

430
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:14,565
Keep playing.

431
01:12:15,068 --> 01:12:17,613
Wait! Wait!

432
01:12:24,956 --> 01:12:27,377
Why? Why can't I?

433
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:37,558
I shan't practise and I don't care!

434
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:40,019
Blast and damn! Bugger her!

435
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:43,399
Bloody... bloody... bugger her!

436
01:12:43,566 --> 01:12:48,073
Let her fall face down
in boiling... bloody... mud!

437
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:52,829
Let a mad dog bite her till she bleeds!

438
01:12:53,037 --> 01:12:54,248
Where is your mother?

439
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:57,836
- Where's she gone?
- TO HELL!

440
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:11,773
So, what brings you here?

441
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:17,448
Did you leave something?

442
01:13:18,324 --> 01:13:20,743
I've not found anything.

443
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,423
Does he know something?

444
01:13:41,565 --> 01:13:43,568
The piano was not harmed?

445
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:46,155
It arrived safely?

446
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:53,456
Would you like to sit?

447
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:57,212
I am going to sit.

448
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:10,898
Ada...

449
01:14:13,485 --> 01:14:15,278
Ada.

450
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:19,284
I am unhappy...

451
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:27,212
...because I... want you...

452
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,386
...because my mind has seized on you
and can think of nothing else.

453
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:36,475
This is why I suffer.

454
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,272
I...

455
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:43,109
...am sick with longing.

456
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:46,447
I don't eat. I don't sleep.

457
01:14:49,326 --> 01:14:54,417
So, if you've come
with no feeling for me...

458
01:14:54,543 --> 01:14:57,254
...then go.

459
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:06,601
Go.

460
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:09,604
Go.

461
01:15:17,241 --> 01:15:18,868
Get out.

462
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:22,749
Leave!

463
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,901
What?

464
01:19:12,613 --> 01:19:14,157
Whisper it.

465
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,316
Now you are going I am miserable.

466
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:41,654
Why is that?

467
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:46,536
Ada, I need to know what will
you do. Will you come again?

468
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:55,591
Wait...

469
01:19:55,716 --> 01:19:59,679
I don't know what you're thinking.

470
01:19:59,846 --> 01:20:03,768
Does this mean something to you?

471
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:07,900
I already miss you.

472
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:11,154
Ada...

473
01:20:11,655 --> 01:20:14,033
...do you love me?

474
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:33,978
Come tomorrow.
If you are serious, come tomorrow.

475
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:48,707
Mumma, stay still!

476
01:22:44,911 --> 01:22:47,999
MUMMA! MUMMA!

477
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:52,423
THEY'RE PLAYING YOUR PIANO!

478
01:23:17,374 --> 01:23:19,794
Here, Papa.

479
01:23:53,132 --> 01:23:56,220
You shouldn't have gone
up there, should you?

480
01:23:57,055 --> 01:24:00,310
I don't like it, and nor does Papa.

481
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:11,033
We can play cards if you like.

482
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:50,755
She's asleep. Look.

483
01:24:53,092 --> 01:24:56,347
One night she was found
on the road to London.

484
01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:01,062
Grandpa said her feet were cut very
badly. She couldn't walk for a week.

485
01:26:19,631 --> 01:26:21,717
Ada.

486
01:26:56,808 --> 01:26:59,186
Alisdair, is it because of our play?

487
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:02,441
Have the natives aggressed you?

488
01:27:02,775 --> 01:27:05,444
Well, I'll have to say.
You have done the wrong thing here.

489
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,491
You've put the latch on
the outside. You see.

490
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,538
Now when you close the door...

491
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:15,376
...it will be the Maoris
that lock you in. You see.

492
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:18,088
With the latch on that side,
you are quite trapped.

493
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:20,048
Quite trapped.

494
01:27:20,174 --> 01:27:24,931
We have just come from George Baines. They
have taken him over. No wonder he is leaving.

495
01:27:25,682 --> 01:27:28,018
He got in too deep with the natives.

496
01:27:28,185 --> 01:27:32,108
- They sit on his floors as proud as kings...
- ...but without any shred of manners!

497
01:27:33,234 --> 01:27:38,241
He's quite altered. As if they've been
trying some native witchcraft on him.

498
01:27:38,909 --> 01:27:42,038
Well, tomorrow or the day after he'll be gone.

499
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,627
So Baines is packing up?

500
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,425
Well, he's nothing to pack, but he's
leaving. And it is just as well.

501
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:54,431
Nessie has foolishly grown fond of him.

502
01:27:54,556 --> 01:27:57,018
We have had some tears.

503
01:27:57,143 --> 01:27:59,730
Stop it! Stop!

504
01:28:00,772 --> 01:28:01,732
STOP!

505
01:28:03,485 --> 01:28:05,863
I am frightened of the way back.

506
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,203
We must leave in good light.
Will we be safe?

507
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:12,748
Oh, yes. If you leave now,
I'm sure of it.

508
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:51,010
Nessie, hold this.

509
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:04,112
You know, I am thinking of the piano?

510
01:29:04,905 --> 01:29:09,661
She does not play the piano
as we do, Nessie. Up! Up!

511
01:29:14,626 --> 01:29:19,634
No. She is a strange creature.
And her playing is strange...

512
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:22,597
...like a mood that passes into you.

513
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:24,891
Up!

514
01:29:27,812 --> 01:29:32,610
Now, your playing is plain and true
and that is what I like.

515
01:29:32,736 --> 01:29:36,825
To have a sound creep
inside you is not at all pleasant.

516
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:39,995
What's that?

517
01:29:43,626 --> 01:29:45,796
It's a pigeon.

518
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:48,341
I should have waited.

519
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:48,049
I want to touch you.
Why can't I touch you?

520
01:30:50,094 --> 01:30:52,180
Don't you like me?

521
01:31:26,354 --> 01:31:31,486
Come on, Lucky! Who's gonna be
my friend? I'm coming to get you!

522
01:31:49,595 --> 01:31:52,015
We must... get on.

523
01:31:55,227 --> 01:31:57,522
I've decided to...

524
01:31:57,647 --> 01:32:00,026
...trust you to stay here.

525
01:32:00,777 --> 01:32:03,447
You won't see Baines?

526
01:32:09,372 --> 01:32:11,375
Good.

527
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:16,174
Good.

528
01:32:17,509 --> 01:32:23,016
Perhaps with time...
you might come to like me.

529
01:33:27,858 --> 01:33:31,612
Stop complaining, I said.
And be quiet.

530
01:33:31,654 --> 01:33:36,870
You just have to be naked until
I finish washing and drying your clothes.

531
01:33:38,206 --> 01:33:42,462
I don't mind if you're cold.
Be quiet!

532
01:33:54,687 --> 01:33:57,525
No, we're not supposed to visit him.

533
01:34:11,336 --> 01:34:13,171
What?

534
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:42,379
# The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men

535
01:34:42,504 --> 01:34:45,049
# He marched them up
to the top of the hill

536
01:34:45,175 --> 01:34:47,637
# And marched them down again

537
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:49,681
# And when they're up, they're up

538
01:34:49,806 --> 01:34:52,018
# And when they're down,
they're down

539
01:34:52,143 --> 01:34:58,235
# And when they're only halfway up
They're neither up nor down #

540
01:35:03,743 --> 01:35:06,246
Crooked, Mister Tewart.

541
01:35:06,747 --> 01:35:08,582
Crooked.

542
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:16,552
Mother want me to give this to Mr. Baines.

543
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:21,017
I thought maybe it was not
the proper thing to do.

544
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:24,939
- Shall I open it?
- No. Give it to me.

545
01:36:34,036 --> 01:36:36,873
Why? I trusted you!

546
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:44,258
I TRUSTED YOU! I TRUSTED YOU!
D'YOU HEAR?!

547
01:36:45,176 --> 01:36:47,972
Why do you make me hurt you?!

548
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:52,062
We could be happy.

549
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:56,151
YOU MAKE ME ANGRY! SPEAK!

550
01:37:02,827 --> 01:37:05,914
YOU LIED TO ME!

551
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:09,378
SPEAK! OR, BY GOD,
YOU WILL ANSWER FOR THIS!

552
01:37:33,286 --> 01:37:35,498
DO YOU LOVE HIM?!

553
01:37:35,623 --> 01:37:37,417
DO YOU?!

554
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:42,632
- IS IT HIM YOU LOVE?!
- SHE SAYS... NO!

555
01:37:45,971 --> 01:37:48,307
MOTHER!

556
01:37:49,476 --> 01:37:51,437
MOTHER!

557
01:38:50,186 --> 01:38:52,481
Mumma!

558
01:38:56,779 --> 01:38:58,531
You give this to Baines.

559
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:03,037
Tell him if he ever sees her again,
I'll take off another..

560
01:39:03,162 --> 01:39:06,375
...and another and another...

561
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:13,427
- Mumma!
- RUN!

562
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:34,133
What has happened?

563
01:39:35,354 --> 01:39:36,898
Hush, hush!

564
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:42,999
What is it?

565
01:39:44,919 --> 01:39:47,464
You are not to see her,
he'll chop her up!

566
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:55,267
What happened? Tell me.

567
01:39:55,393 --> 01:39:57,269
TELL ME!

568
01:40:03,466 --> 01:40:05,219
Where is she?

569
01:40:05,552 --> 01:40:09,517
Ssh! Quiet down! Quiet down!
Where is she?!

570
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:11,852
HE CHOPPED IT OFF!

571
01:40:12,145 --> 01:40:15,399
What did she tell him?
What did she tell him?

572
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:32,632
- I am going to crush his skull!
- NO! NO! NO!

573
01:40:33,467 --> 01:40:35,970
He'll chop them off!

574
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:59,545
You pushed me too hard. You cannot
send love to him. You cannot do that.

575
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:05,428
Just even... even to think
about it makes me very angry.

576
01:41:09,517 --> 01:41:12,355
I meant to love you.

577
01:41:13,732 --> 01:41:15,818
I clipped your wing, that's all.

578
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:22,535
# We will be together #

579
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:27,626
# You will see it will be better #

580
01:41:28,502 --> 01:41:32,300
Are you hot? My sweet love bird.

581
01:42:46,362 --> 01:42:48,532
Are you feeling better?

582
01:43:06,515 --> 01:43:08,560
What?

583
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:26,461
Look at you.

584
01:44:27,129 --> 01:44:29,841
It's your face.

585
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:33,971
I've had that face in my head
hating it.

586
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:37,142
But now I'm here seeing it...

587
01:44:38,645 --> 01:44:40,815
it's nothing.

588
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:47,198
You have your marks.
You look at me through your eyes.

589
01:44:48,325 --> 01:44:51,162
You're even afraid of me.

590
01:44:52,623 --> 01:44:54,667
Get up.

591
01:45:02,303 --> 01:45:04,473
Baines...

592
01:45:06,309 --> 01:45:09,063
...has Ada ever spoken to you?

593
01:45:11,066 --> 01:45:13,110
You mean in signs?

594
01:45:14,904 --> 01:45:17,115
No. Words.

595
01:45:18,242 --> 01:45:20,537
Have you ever heard words?

596
01:45:21,038 --> 01:45:23,291
No. Not words.

597
01:45:23,834 --> 01:45:26,671
You never thought you heard words?

598
01:45:31,719 --> 01:45:37,895
I heard it here. I heard her voice.
There in my head.

599
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:43,736
The lips didn't make the words.

600
01:45:43,861 --> 01:45:49,453
But, yet, the harder I
listened... the clearer I heard her.

601
01:45:49,578 --> 01:45:54,001
You punished her wrongly.
It was me... my fault.

602
01:45:57,297 --> 01:45:59,300
She said...

603
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,934
"I am afraid of my will...

604
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:11,233
...of what it might do.
It is so strange and strong."

605
01:46:11,358 --> 01:46:13,361
She said...

606
01:46:15,322 --> 01:46:18,035
"I have to go. Let me go.

607
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:23,291
Let Baines take me away.
Let him try and save me."

608
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:30,010
I wish her gone. I wish you gone.

609
01:46:34,642 --> 01:46:37,061
I want to wake up...

610
01:46:38,396 --> 01:46:40,691
...and find that this...

611
01:46:40,816 --> 01:46:43,654
...was all a dream.
That's what I want.

612
01:47:00,303 --> 01:47:02,639
It was a terrible shock.

613
01:47:03,515 --> 01:47:05,935
Oh, dear!

614
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:37,105
No. She needs it. She must have it.

615
01:49:56,884 --> 01:50:01,474
- What did she say?
- She said, "Throw the piano overboard."

616
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,978
It's quite safe. They are managing.

617
01:50:06,856 --> 01:50:11,196
She doesn't want it.
She says it's spoiled!

618
01:50:11,947 --> 01:50:15,494
I've been given the key.
I'll have it mended.

619
01:50:24,798 --> 01:50:27,970
Please, Ada. Ada!

620
01:50:29,138 --> 01:50:31,933
You'll regret it. It's your
piano, I want you to have it.

621
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:34,353
- She doesn't want it!
- Sit down!

622
01:50:38,067 --> 01:50:40,487
- Throw it over!
- Stop!

623
01:50:40,738 --> 01:50:43,325
All right, we'll throw it over.

624
01:53:02,353 --> 01:53:04,606
<i>'What a death.</i>

625
01:53:10,114 --> 01:53:12,284
<i>'What a chance.</i>

626
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,834
<i>'What a surprise!</i>

627
01:53:26,638 --> 01:53:29,558

628
01:53:40,824 --> 01:53:46,498

and many others besides.</i>

629
01:53:48,668 --> 01:53:51,339
<i>'I teach piano now in Nelson.</i>

630
01:53:54,009 --> 01:53:57,472
<i>'George has fashioned
me a metal fingertip.</i>

631
01:53:57,639 --> 01:54:01,144
<i>'I'm quite the town freak,
which satisfies.</i>

632
01:54:24,593 --> 01:54:27,139
<i>'I am learning to speak.</i>

633
01:54:27,264 --> 01:54:30,811
<i>'My sound is still so bad
I feel ashamed.</i>

634
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,234
<i>'I practise only
when I am alone and it is dark.'</i>

635
01:55:28,559 --> 01:55:33,649

636
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:41,285
<i>'...and sometimes of myself
floating above it.</i>

637
01:55:43,079 --> 01:55:49,087
<i>'Down there everything is so still

638
01:55:49,755 --> 01:55:54,178
<i>'It is a weird lullaby,
and so it is...</i>

639
01:55:54,345 --> 01:55:56,515
<i>'It is mine.'</i>

01:55:57,475 --> 01:56:01,939

642
01:56:07,238 --> 01:56:12,412
