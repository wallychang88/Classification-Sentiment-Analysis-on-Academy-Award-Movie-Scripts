1
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,379
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,215
What?

3
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,429
Any real city, you walk, you know?

4
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,432
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,644
In LA, nobody touches you.

6
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,942
We're always behind this metal and glass.

7
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,030
I think we miss that touch so much

8
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,742
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,207
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,085
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,087
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,882
Graham, I think we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,301
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,096
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,474
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,688
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,815
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,109
Why? it's not my fault! it's her fault!

20
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,903
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,071
Ma'am, you really need to wait
in your vehicle.

22
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,073
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,825
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,538
- She blake too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,583
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" light.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,378
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,298
Maybe you see over steering wheel,
you "blake" too!

28
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,507
- Ma'am!
- Crazy Mexican.

29
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,635
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

30
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,553
Officer, can you please write
in your report

31
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,472
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver.

32
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,683
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, it's Detective...

33
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,358
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,203
- Hey, Detective. Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

35
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,794
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezing.

36
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,089
Shit. I heard it might snow.

37
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,466
- Get out of here.
- That's what I heard.

38
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,094
- You got a smoke?
- No. I quit.

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,221
Yeah, me, too.

40
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,058
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

41
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,528
Hey, Bob.

42
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,281
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

43
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,795
Yo, Osama!

44
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,631
Plan a jihad on your own time.
What do you want?

45
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,847
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

46
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,348
ls that the closest
you can come to English?

47
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,392
Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.

48
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,603
- Oh, God, here we go.
- l have right like you.

49
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,813
- l have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't.

50
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,149
- Andy, get him out of here now!
- Dad, go wait in the car.

51
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,358
Now. Get out!

52
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,652
You're an ignorant man!

53
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,821
Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country

54
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,158
and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

55
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,160
- Get the fuck out of my store!
- No, you get the fuck!

56
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,411
- Now, come on.
- Get out!

57
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,121
No, don't touch me! He cheat me this man!

58
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,998
- Andy, now!
- Come on, let's go.

59
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,750
Okay.

60
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,881
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,550
And I am really hoping for the money.

62
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,475
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,560
Oh, we got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,105
We got long colts, short colts, ball heads,

65
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,732
flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,193
and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.

67
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,864
Just depends upon
how much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,370
I'll take the ones in the red box.

69
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,416
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,594
Did you see any white people in there

71
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,514
waiting an hour and 32 minutes
for a plate of spaghetti, huh?

72
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,224
And how many cups of coffee did we get?

73
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,893
You don't drink coffee,
and I didn't want any.

74
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,229
Man, that woman in there
poured cup after cup

75
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,022
to every single white person around us,

76
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,608
but did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

77
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,236
We didn't get any coffee
that you didn't want and I didn't order,

78
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,655
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

79
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,615
Did you notice that our waitress was black?

80
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,076
And black women
don't think in stereotypes?

81
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,202
You tell me something, man.

82
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,955
When was the last time you met one
who didn't think she knew everything

83
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,083
about your little, lazy ass
before you even opened your mouth, huh?

84
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,127
That waitress sized us up in two seconds.

85
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,006
We're black, and black people don't tip.
So she wasn't gonna waste her time.

86
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,301
Now, somebody like that,
nothing you can do to change their mind.

87
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,761
Yeah, well, how much did you leave?

88
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,264
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

89
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,807
What?

90
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,476
What the fuck is you laughing at, man?

91
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,438
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

92
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,815
Hardly. I'd just like to see you
get through a meal

93
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,692
without calling her
or anyone else for that matter.

94
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,527
Okay, look, no more phone calls tonight.

95
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,405
As a matter of fact,
here, you can hold the battery.

96
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,573
Okay?

97
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,286
$1 0 says she calls you in the car.

98
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,122
Wait, wait, wait.
You see what that woman just did?

99
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,124
- You see that?
- Why, she's cold.

100
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,044
She got colder
as soon as she saw us, dawg.

101
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,714
- Oh, man, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

102
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,301
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

103
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,470
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

104
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,306
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

105
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,642
and her reaction is blind fear?

106
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,436
I mean, look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

107
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,856
Huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.

108
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,860
Fact. If anybody
should be scared around here, it's us.

109
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,989
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

110
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,492
patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.

111
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,328
So you tell me. Why aren't we scared?

112
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,289
'Cause we got guns?

113
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,333
You could be right.

114
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,630
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- Give me the keys!

115
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,674
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

116
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,758
Get down!

117
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,593
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me!

118
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,304
Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.
Turn around!

119
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,683
Move. Let's go, come on.
We're good. We're fine. Just keep moving.

120
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,025
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing
off of there right now.

121
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,653
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

122
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,738
Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.

123
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,449
You had a conversation with God, huh?
What did God say?

124
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,742
"Go forth, my son,

125
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,371
"and leave big slobbery suction rings
on every dashboard you find?"

126
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,747
Why the hell do you do that?

127
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,500
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

128
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,468
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

129
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,346
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

130
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,849
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

131
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,101
Wait a minute,
this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

132
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,895
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

133
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,564
I got the Mercedes.

134
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,985
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

135
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,238
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

136
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,075
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

137
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,744
He says he kept trying to drive away.

138
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,371
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

139
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,415
Shot back in self-defense.

140
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,753
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

141
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,047
Find me a witness.

142
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,271
That is a nice gun.

143
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,650
Well, the car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

144
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,278
And that's not Cindy.

145
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,698
That is a William Lewis.

146
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,826
Found it under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

147
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,667
Looks like Detective Conklin shot himself
the wrong nigger.

148
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,516
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

149
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,934
Thank you.

150
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,154
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

151
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,031
I need to talk to you for a second.

152
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,618
You just give me a minute, all right?

153
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,579
- And find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,666
Yes, honey?

155
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,626
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

156
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,669
You want...

157
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,463
Look, why don't you just go lie down, huh?
Have you checked on James?

158
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,048
Well, of course I've checked on James.

159
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,008
I've checked on him every five minutes
since we've been home.

160
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,844
- Do not patronize me.
- I'm...

161
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,430
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

162
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,349
It's okay. Just go to bed.

163
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,686
You know what, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

164
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,604
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

165
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,357
ls okay I go home now?

166
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,192
It's fine.
Thank you very much for staying, Maria.

167
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,360
You're welcome. No problem.

168
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,611
- Good night, Miss Jean.
- Good night.

169
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,530
We'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,826
I would like the locks changed again
in the morning.

171
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,537
And you know what?
You might mention that we'd appreciate it

172
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,372
if next time
they didn't send a gang member.

173
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,707
- A gang member?
- Yes, yes.

174
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,125
- What, you mean that kid in there?
- Yes.

175
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,503
The guy in there with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

176
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,588
Those are not prison tattoos.

177
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,465
Oh, really?
And he's not gonna go sell our key

178
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,717
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

179
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,051
We've had a really tough night.

180
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,262
I think it'd be best
if you just went upstairs right now...

181
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,889
And, what? Wait for them to break in?

182
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,975
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

183
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,268
You lower your voice!

184
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,146
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

185
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,149
But if a white person
sees two black men walking towards her,

186
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,652
and she turns and walks
in the other direction, she's a racist, right?

187
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,071
Well, I got scared and I didn't say anything.

188
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,991
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

189
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,201
Now, I am telling you.

190
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,078
Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key
to one of his homies.

191
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,708
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

192
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,321
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

193
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,365
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

194
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,117
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,037
lf my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

196
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,705
Fuck!

197
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,044
Why did these guys have to be black?
I mean, why?

198
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,338
No matter how we spin this thing,

199
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,466
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

200
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,009
You know, I think you're worrying
too much.

201
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,804
You have a lot of support
in the black community.

202
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,808
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

203
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,312
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

204
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,106
Bruce?

205
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,694
The firefighter.
The one who saved the camp or something.

206
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,362
Northridge. What's his name?

207
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,822
He's Iraqi.

208
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,032
He's Iraqi?

209
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,201
Well, he looks black.

210
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,538
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

211
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,207
Saddam? His name's Saddam?

212
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,875
Well, that's real good, Bruce.

213
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,254
Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

214
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,047
Give yourself a raise, will you?

215
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,012
It's been good doing business with you.

216
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,932
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

217
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,519
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

218
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,022
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

219
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,651
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

220
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,654
He is being treated
for a urinary tract infection.

221
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,032
That is by no means an emergency.

222
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,660
Now, if you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

223
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,705
why don't you make an appointment
to come in between 1 0:00 and 4:00,

224
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,956
Monday through Friday?

225
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,125
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

226
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,085
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

227
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,880
- l wanna talk to your supervisor.
- l am my supervisor.

228
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,591
- Yeah, what is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

229
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,968
Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.

230
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,136
Oh...

231
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,445
1 005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

232
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,490
Vehicle described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

233
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,911
California plates, 4 Peter Charles Ida 31 5.

234
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,081
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

235
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,049
That's not it.

236
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,469
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

237
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,098
The driver's gotta be 40, and nobody
jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.

238
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,689
They were doing something.

239
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,109
Enthusiastic.

240
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,488
Keep your hands
where I can see them, please.

241
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,242
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

242
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,995
No problem. I'm gonna have to

243
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,998
reach inside of the glove compartment
to get the registration.

244
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,375
- ls that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

245
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,585
Okay.

246
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,341
How are you tonight, Officer?

247
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,594
Excellent.

248
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,638
Here you go.

249
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,020
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

250
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,614
Let's do it again right now.

251
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,867
Step out of the car, please, sir.

252
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,621
Wait, wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

253
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,289
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

254
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,334
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

255
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,002
No, it's okay.

256
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,837
It's fine.

257
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,136
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

258
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,723
That's good. Right there.

259
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,768
Look at me.

260
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,396
I want you to stand on your right foot.

261
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,817
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

262
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,824
I told you he doesn't drink.

263
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,369
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time
to stay in the vehicle.

264
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,871
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

265
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,122
Don't you "ma'am" me.

266
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,208
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

267
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,336
Look, Officer,
my wife has had a couple of drinks...

268
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,838
All right, both of you turn around.

269
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,756
Put your hands on top of your head
and interlock your fingers.

270
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,925
No, wait. Wait a minute.
We're only a block away from our house.

271
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,218
Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.

272
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,678
- That's not even necessary.
- Hands on your head.

273
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,762
Interlock your fingers.

274
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,722
Look, I'm a television director.

275
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,141
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

276
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,435
Get your hands off him.
He has done nothing wrong.

277
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,187
Put your hands
on top of your head, ma'am.

278
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,147
- Will you just do what he says?
- Fuck you!

279
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,941
Put your hands
on top of your head, ma'am.

280
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,193
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

281
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,405
- You motherfucking pig!
- Christine, just stop talking.

282
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,866
That's quite a mouth you have.

283
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
Of course you know that.

284
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,704
Fuck you!
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

285
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,081
You thought you saw
a white woman blowing a black man,

286
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,791
and that just
drove your little cracker ass crazy.

287
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,710
Will you just shut your fucking mouth?

288
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,254
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

289
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,423
Put your legs open.

290
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,596
Now, do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

291
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,181
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

292
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,809
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

293
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,311
He's clean.

294
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

295
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,153
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

296
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,822
while you were operating a motor vehicle.

297
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,743
That's reckless endangerment,
which, incidentally, is a felony.

298
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,371
Now we can charge your wife here

299
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,917
with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

300
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,670
Now you say you're a block from home.

301
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,924
Now, we could use our discretion

302
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,301
and let you go with a warning,

303
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,013
or we can cuff you
and put you in the back of the car.

304
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,684
What do you think we should do, sir?

305
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,361
Look, we're sorry,

306
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,700
and we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

307
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,041
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

308
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,379
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

309
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,174
Yeah.

310
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,968
All right.

311
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,012
You can go.

312
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,149
You folks drive safe now, huh?

313
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,893
Let's go, Tommy.

314
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,738
lt won't close.

315
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,115
I can do that.

316
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,034
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

317
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,661
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun.

318
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,498
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

319
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,376
Dorri, that man could've killed your mother.

320
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,796
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

321
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,007
Farhad, it won't close.

322
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,638
Dorri, you should be at work.

323
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,611
Who are you calling?

324
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,572
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

325
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,159
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

326
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,330
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

327
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,332
And you just stood there.

328
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,127
And then you apologized to him?

329
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,255
I mean, what did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

330
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,009
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard? Pathetic.

331
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,554
Yeah, well, maybe you would've
been satisfied with just being arrested.

332
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,809
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

333
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,061
than get your name in the paper.

334
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,480
You know, you finally got me figured out,

335
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,650
'cause see, that's exactly
what I was worried about, right there.

336
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,903
Oh, and it wasn't? You weren't afraid
that all your good friends at the studio

337
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,114
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize that,

338
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,324
you know what, he's actually black?

339
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,244
You need to calm down right now.

340
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,872
No, what I need is a husband
who will not just stand there

341
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,499
while I am being molested!

342
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,044
I mean, they were cops, for God's sakes!
They had guns!

343
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,965
You know what?
Maybe I should've let them arrest your ass.

344
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,636
I mean, sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

345
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,888
Fuck you, man. Like you know.

346
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,475
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

347
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,895
Yeah, well, at least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

348
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,147
Yeah, you're right, Cameron.

349
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,733
I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't
quite learned how to shuck and jive.

350
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:49,279
Let me hear it again.
"Thank you, Mr. Policeman.

351
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,865
"You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

352
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,827
"You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife."

353
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,915
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

354
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,835
You know, fuck you!

355
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,673
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

356
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,975
- How's it going?
- Okay.

357
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,270
You didn't get scared or something,
did you?

358
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,523
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

359
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:11,069
- There's no such thing as monsters.
- Oh, that's a good thing.

360
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,821
I heard a bang.

361
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,740
Like a truck bang?

362
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,659
Like a gun.

363
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,378
That's funny, because we moved out
of that bad neighborhood.

364
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,297
And there's not too many guns
around here.

365
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,842
How far can bullets go?

366
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,053
They go pretty far.

367
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,348
But they usually get stuck in something
and stop.

368
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,141
What if they don't?

369
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,521
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

370
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,693
Because we never did find it, did we?

371
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,946
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

372
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,368
And you think it was that same bullet
that you heard tonight?

373
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,791
- You think we should move again?
- l like it here.

374
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,919
Me, too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

375
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,046
Oh, hold on.

376
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,214
What?

377
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,092
So stupid! How can I forget?

378
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,802
What?

379
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,723
No, forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.

380
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,016
Tell me.

381
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,268
Okay.

382
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,398
When I was five,
this fairy came into my room one night.

383
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,482
Right.

384
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,609
See, I told you
you weren't gonna believe me.

385
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,612
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

386
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,906
Okay.

387
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,746
So this fairy comes into my room
and I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

388
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,540
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

389
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,169
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

390
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,754
She was flying?

391
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,132
Yeah, but she had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued them on, you know?

392
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,843
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

393
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,928
So she said, "I'll prove it."

394
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,306
So she reaches into her backpack,

395
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,808
and she pulls out this invisible cloak.

396
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,812
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

397
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,648
You know what "impenetrable" means?

398
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,276
lt means that nothing can go through it.

399
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,111
No bullets. Nothing.

400
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,907
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

401
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,533
So I did.

402
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:26,996
And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.

403
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,415
I mean, how weird is that?

404
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,168
Only she told me
that I was supposed to give it

405
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,879
to my daughter on her fifth birthday
and I forgot.

406
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,256
Can I touch it?

407
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,258
Sure, go ahead.

408
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,055
- l don't feel it.
- Yeah. it's pretty cool, huh?

409
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,974
lf you want I can take it off
and tie it around your shoulders.

410
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,976
She told me how to do it.

411
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,312
Unless you think it's stupid then...

412
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,315
- Don't you need it?
- No, not anymore.

413
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,152
So what do you think? You want it?

414
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,160
Okay, let's get out of here.

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,084
Okay.

416
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,808
Hold your chin up.

417
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,357
Okay. ls that too tight?

418
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
Do you feel anything at all?

419
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,613
Good. Then it's just right.

420
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,372
Do I take it off when I have a bath?

421
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,626
No, you leave it on all the time.
Until you have a daughter.

422
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,963
When she turns five, then you give it to her.

423
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,007
Okay?

424
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,220
Okay.

425
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,558
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

426
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,436
No, no. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

427
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,232
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

428
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,360
Listen to it, man. "Nigger this, nigger that."

429
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,905
You think white people go around
calling each other honkies all day, man?

430
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,615
Hey, honky, how's business?

431
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,951
Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.

432
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,954
How about this, huh? How about that?
Listen to that. You like that?

433
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,497
Man's singing about lynching niggers.

434
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,707
And you think there's a difference,
don't you? Huh?

435
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,461
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

436
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,756
You got absolutely no idea
where hip-hop music comes from, do you?

437
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,967
I'd shoot them dead first
but I done broke my trigger

438
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,970
You see, back in the '60s
we had smart, articulate black men.

439
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,138
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

440
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,141
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

441
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,643
Gonna string them up good

442
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,145
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

443
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,313
Then they'll be dead

444
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,566
And then the FBI said,
"Oh, no, we can't have that."

445
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,651
In the home of the brave
and the land of the free

446
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:47,196
"I know, let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

447
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,948
"and sooner or later, they'll all copy it,

448
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,659
"and nobody will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

449
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,994
"End of problem."

450
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,920
What the fuck was that, dawg?

451
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,060
Holy shit!

452
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,188
- What?
- Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

453
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,608
You're saying there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

454
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,026
What part don't you understand?

455
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,279
There's a Chinaman
stuck underneath the fucking truck.

456
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,365
Help me.

457
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,369
Oh, God.

458
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,414
What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

459
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,666
Man, this is so completely fucked up.

460
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh, really? No shit!

461
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,546
Okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

462
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,882
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

463
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,635
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

464
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,512
No, no we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

465
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,806
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
You know why?

466
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,934
Because he's stuck underneath
the fucking truck!

467
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,227
Now, if he could've let go,

468
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,522
he probably would've considered
that option about a half a block back.

469
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,232
Now, what you and I gotta do,

470
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,276
just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

471
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,111
You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.

472
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,573
Then you gonna be standing in the middle
of the street holding a Chinaman's arm.

473
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,367
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

474
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,663
lf we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

475
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,916
Now just grab his arm.
Why not just pull him out?

476
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,465
I don't wanna
cause any problems, Lieutenant.

477
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,050
I just want a new partner.

478
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,469
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

479
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,805
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

480
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,973
Well, he's been on the force for a long time.

481
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,352
- Seventeen years.
- And I do have to work here, sir.

482
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,522
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

483
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,525
You just don't want him to ride in your car.

484
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,444
lf you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

485
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,114
That'd be great. Write a full report.

486
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,533
Because I'm anxious to understand
how an obvious bigot

487
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,411
could've gone undetected
in this department for 1 7 years,

488
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,871
1 1 of which he was under
my personal supervision,

489
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,624
which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

490
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,044
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

491
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,798
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

492
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,633
So now you're saying
he's not a racist prick,

493
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,635
you just don't like him.

494
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,972
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

495
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,016
Well, then, I guess I should think
of a better one and get back to you.

496
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,519
So you think
I'm asking you to make one up.

497
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,314
No, sir. I just can't think of one right now.

498
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,317
You wanna know what I heard?

499
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,321
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

500
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,700
- You want me to say he has flatulence?
- Not him. You.

501
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,326
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

502
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,162
You're too embarrassed
to ride with anybody else,

503
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,830
so you're requesting a one-man car.

504
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,833
I'm not... comfortable with that, Lieutenant.

505
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,293
I wouldn't be either.

506
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,295
Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

507
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,757
Just like I'm sure you understand
how hard a black man has to work to get to,

508
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,510
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the LAPD

509
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,846
and how easily that can be taken away.

510
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,974
Now, that being said, it's your decision.

511
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:06,479
You can put your career and mine
on the line in pursuit of a just cause,

512
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,441
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

513
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,860
of a personal nature.

514
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,866
Fuck.

515
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,731
Excuse me.

516
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,275
Excuse me. Sir?

517
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,987
- You finished?
- l replaced the lock.

518
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,365
But you got a real problem with that door.

519
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,285
- You fix the lock?
- No, I replaced the lock.

520
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,456
- But you gotta fix that door.
- Just fix the lock.

521
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,625
Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

522
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,711
What you need is a new door.

523
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,214
- l need new door?
- Yeah.

524
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,217
Okay. How much?

525
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,177
I don't...

526
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,930
Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody
that sells doors.

527
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,642
You try to cheat me, right, huh?
You have a friend that fix door?

528
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,644
No, I don't have a friend that fix doors, bro.

529
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,605
Then go and fix the fucking lock,
you cheater.

530
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,816
You... You know what?

531
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,111
Why don't you just pay for the lock,
and I won't charge you for the time.

532
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,322
You don't fix the lock! I pay?
What, you think I'm stupid?

533
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,992
You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!

534
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,077
Hey, I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me names.

535
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,746
- Then fix the fucking lock!
- l replaced the lock!

536
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,001
- You gotta fix the fucking door!
- You cheat! You fucking cheater!

537
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,004
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

538
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,632
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

539
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,760
Wait! You come back here! You fix the lock!

540
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,514
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

541
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,688
No, I understand.

542
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,566
You run over a Chinaman,
stuff him in the back,

543
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,611
then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

544
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,405
Come on, man. it's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

545
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,032
Georgie, burn this thing.

546
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,452
Burn it? it's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

547
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,871
You watch the Discovery Channel?

548
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,832
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

549
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,544
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a little blue light

550
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:40,007
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

551
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,553
bathroom fixtures and special-edition
plastic Burger King tray cups.

552
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,307
Then the next thing they show
is some stupid redneck in handcuffs

553
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,061
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

554
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,856
Sometimes the redneck
is actually watching the Discovery Channel

555
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,775
when they break in to arrest him.

556
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,987
And he still can't figure out
how on earth they could've caught him!

557
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,249
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

558
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,087
- No.
- Then get the fuck out of my shop.

559
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,385
Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.

560
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,638
Without him, things could've gone
really fucking wrong tonight.

561
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,726
- Fuck! This could be a...
- Graham, don't! Don't! Don't you dare.

562
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,728
Don't.

563
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,271
Graham Waters.

564
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,276
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

565
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,278
- It's your mother?
- Yeah.

566
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,906
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

567
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,952
Look, he'll be home when he...
Just leave it alone, Mom.

568
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,455
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

569
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,625
Okay, where were we?

570
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,587
I was white, and you were about
to jerk off in the shower.

571
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,922
Oh, shit.

572
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,175
Come on.

573
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,844
I would've said you were Mexican,

574
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,471
but I don't think
it would've pissed her off as much.

575
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,475
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

576
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,477
What, you start to feel something
and panic?

577
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,021
Come on, Ria.

578
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,481
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

579
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,443
That's just where I begin to get pissed.

580
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,447
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way, huh?

581
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

582
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,912
I know if I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

583
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,415
Okay. I was raised badly.

584
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:40,044
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?

585
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,421
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.

586
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,423
How about a geography lesson?

587
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:48,343
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

588
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,138
Neither one of those is Mexico.

589
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,308
Well, then I guess the big mystery is

590
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,394
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

591
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,522
and taught them all
how to park their cars on their lawns?

592
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,344
Pop, you okay?

593
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,514
lf I could piss, I'd be okay.

594
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,851
I'm... Jesus.

595
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,937
I'm done now.

596
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,773
Give me a hand.

597
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,528
Wait a goddamn minute.

598
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,364
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

599
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,619
- All right. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. There you go.

600
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,212
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

601
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,714
- l gotta go back.
- Okay.

602
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,647
What, are you gonna stand there
and stare at me?

603
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,594
So Conklin just shot him?

604
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,429
- They know each other?
- Sir.

605
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,432
- This a grudge thing?
- Not as far as we can tell.

606
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,019
You think this is racially motivated?

607
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,439
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

608
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,108
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

609
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,362
Waters. All right, well, tell him
that he speaks to no one but me.

610
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,740
Call a press conference for 4:00 ,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

611
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,742
And would someone please find Flanagan?

612
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,663
- Oh, what up, Mo Phat?
- What's up?

613
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,166
Man robs purses from old ladies
and you all,

614
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,335
"Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?"

615
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,213
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

616
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,258
You calling him a thief? And we do what?

617
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,218
The man steals from black people.

618
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,512
Only reason black people
steal from their own

619
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,389
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

620
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,848
Oh, man, please.

621
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,435
Think about it.
Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.

622
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,021
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

623
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,524
Now, drop Mo Phat off
at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,

624
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,653
that nigger will run like a rabbit
soon as somebody say "decaf latte."

625
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,864
What the fuck did you do to my car?

626
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,500
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

627
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,586
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

628
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,883
James wanted to take this to school,
but I don't want the kids to fight over it.

629
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,429
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora.

630
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,223
You know, Maria,
just once I would like to wake up

631
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,642
and find these dishes in the cabinet.

632
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,521
- Okay?
- Si, senora. No problem.

633
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,774
I'm starting to understand now.

634
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,111
By your work, you're setting an example
for our neighborhood.

635
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,739
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

636
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,241
Well, yeah, you laugh, man.

637
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:25,412
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

638
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,583
What the hell do you think
you doing right now, man?

639
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,251
Waving down the bus.

640
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,920
Man, put your hand down, dawg!
Are you out of your mind?

641
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,048
You actually expect me to get on a bus?

642
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,383
No. I was hoping we could push your car
across town.

643
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,094
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

644
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,180
You have no idea, do you?

645
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,432
You have no idea
why they put them great big windows

646
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,975
on the sides of buses, do you?

647
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,603
- Why?
- One reason only.

648
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,398
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to riding on them.

649
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,275
How do you know that?

650
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,653
You know, you could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

651
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,655
Oh, you know,
the Kings are playing tonight.

652
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,284
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

653
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,119
I love hockey.

654
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,288
Cut! Print. Moving on.

655
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:12,376
Okay, that takes us into scene 1 2,
and we are in the bathroom.

656
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,670
Jamal, that's what I'm talking about.

657
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,005
Right on.

658
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,511
- Cam, Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred. I just wanna grab some coffee.

659
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,305
Yeah, listen,
I think we needed another take, buddy.

660
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,808
That looked pretty terrific, man.

661
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:32,187
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

662
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,980
What do you mean?

663
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,024
Have you noticed...

664
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,318
I mean, this is weird for a white guy to say,

665
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:42,030
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

666
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,243
- No, I haven't noticed that.
- Really?

667
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,788
Like in this scene, he was supposed to say,
"Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

668
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,124
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

669
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,793
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You think because of that,

670
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,171
the audience won't recognize him
as being a black man?

671
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,841
- Come on.
- ls there a problem, Cam?

672
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,761
- Excuse me?
- ls there a problem, Cam?

673
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,519
No, we don't have a problem.

674
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:16,356
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

675
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,025
Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,
not Jamal, right?

676
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:22,362
I mean, you're the expert here,
but to me, it rings false.

677
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:30,120
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

678
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,498
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

679
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,211
Jamal...

680
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,719
- Morning, Carol. Who do I have?
- Hold for a minute, please.

681
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,556
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

682
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,312
Send him in.

683
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,773
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

684
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,026
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

685
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,903
I believe we spoke last night.

686
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,448
Oh, yeah. I wanted to apologize about that.

687
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,410
I haven't been getting too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

688
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,621
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

689
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,917
This doctor he's been seeing
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

690
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,085
But he's been taking this medicine
for a month now,

691
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,420
and he just keeps getting worse.

692
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,381
- And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?
- Yeah.

693
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,801
- Between you and me, the man's an idiot.
- Really?

694
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,429
Well, no offense,
but the guy sees 1 00 patients an hour.

695
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,640
I think his nurses
are doing most of the work.

696
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,770
lf you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

697
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:40,857
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

698
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:44,110
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

699
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,864
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- Then what good is that gonna do?

700
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,326
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

701
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,870
All right. Well, you know what I can't do?

702
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,332
I can't look at you
without thinking about the five or six

703
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,960
more-qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

704
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,419
It's time for you to go.

705
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,673
Now, I'm saying this 'cause
I'm really hoping that I'm wrong about you.

706
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,633
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

707
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,802
someone who may have been given
a helping hand,

708
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,596
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

709
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,682
Carol, I need security in my office.

710
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,643
You know, you don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

711
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,938
But my father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

712
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,065
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

713
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,025
Saved enough to start his own company.

714
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,819
Twenty-three employees, all of them black.

715
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,822
Paid them equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

716
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,157
For 30 years
he worked side by side with those men,

717
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,660
sweeping and carrying garbage.

718
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,328
And then the city council decides

719
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:39,040
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

720
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,626
And overnight, my father loses everything.

721
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,671
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything.

722
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,341
Not once does he blame your people.

723
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,304
I'm not asking you to help me.

724
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,933
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

725
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,686
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

726
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,897
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you? Nothing.

727
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,942
Just a flick of your pen.

728
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,322
Your father sounds like a good man.

729
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,701
And if he'd come in here today,
I probably would've approved this request.

730
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:19,497
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

731
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,083
- Get him the hell out of my office.
- Prick.

732
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,468
Yeah, sir, I spoke to our employee,

733
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,928
and he told you you needed to replace
or repair the door.

734
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,930
He say he fix the lock.

735
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,017
- You come here, see how fixed it is!
- You're yelling again.

736
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,810
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

737
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,731
- Yes, I am.
- Mom, are you all right?

738
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:50,111
Stop washing. Insurance must take picture.
Okay?

739
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,490
- Yes.
- Look what they wrote.

740
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,202
- They think we're Arab.
- Please, you come see my store.

741
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,787
When did Persian become Arab?

742
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,915
I want... I want his name. Yes.

743
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,333
Oh, my God.

744
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,293
- l want his name!
- Dad.

745
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:06,711
- Give me his name!
- Dad.

746
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,129
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

747
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,547
Dad, did they take the gun?

748
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,050
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
- Baba.

749
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,302
- I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
- Don't hang up!

750
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,554
Don't hang up! Shit!

751
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,683
Oh, thank God.

752
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,771
Mom?

753
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,817
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

754
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,842
Did you find your brother?

755
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,012
No, Mom.

756
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,274
I was doing good.

757
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:56,321
I was... I was doing real good.

758
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,034
- l know, Mom.
- l was doing good.

759
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,207
It's okay.

760
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,262
Did you find your brother?

761
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,099
No, Mom.

762
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,646
Tell him to come home.

763
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,651
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?

764
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,195
Okay, baby?

765
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,907
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, baby.

766
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,912
Okay.

767
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,201
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

768
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:31,207
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

769
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,295
That's lunch. One hour.

770
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,409
I tried to call.

771
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,078
Sounded like you were having
a bad day, huh?

772
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,246
Yeah.

773
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,002
What?

774
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,589
I got scared, Cam.

775
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,677
You know, it's not like I haven't been
pulled over before, you know?

776
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,138
But nothing like that.

777
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,267
And, yes, I was a little drunk

778
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,103
and I was mouthing off.

779
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,147
I'm sorry.

780
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,527
But when that man
was putting his hands on me...

781
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,820
I don't wanna talk about it.

782
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,740
I couldn't believe
you'd let him do that, baby.

783
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:51,162
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

784
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,624
But I was humiliated.

785
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,918
For you.

786
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:01,881
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

787
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,468
Yeah. That's what happened.

788
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,261
Oh, baby, don't do this.

789
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,097
- No. No, you're right.
- Come on.

790
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,556
I ain't doing it.

791
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,684
You gonna walk away from me?

792
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,895
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

793
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,990
I understand.

794
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,033
Thanks.

795
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,915
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

796
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,089
Mr. Golzari,
you said that you called the locksmith?

797
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,134
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

798
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,761
They said that their man told you

799
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,557
to fix the door, and you didn't do so.

800
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,394
Are you saying it's his fault?

801
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:02,525
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

802
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:11,951
No.

803
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,871
This store is all we have.

804
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,973
I really am sorry.

805
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,123
What time you must go to work?

806
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,833
Not until tonight.

807
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,836
Go home and sleep.

808
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,842
It's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.

809
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,075
Hey.

810
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:39,122
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

811
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,706
Yeah, they told me.

812
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,837
I just wanted to say good luck
and it was good riding with you.

813
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,547
You, too.

814
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,554
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

815
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,639
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

816
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,561
Wait till you've been doing it a little longer.

817
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,981
You think you know who you are?

818
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,651
You have no idea.

819
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,242
Yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?

820
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,743
Ready , amigo.

821
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,714
Radio check, 2-1 -L-2-3.

822
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,635
21 -L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.

823
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:39,223
Likewise, 21 -L.
Is your mike open by any chance?

824
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,940
Call it in.

825
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,647
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

826
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,525
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

827
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,944
All right. Get an extinguisher,
and get that fire out.

828
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,112
Jesus.

829
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,035
Ma'am, are you hurt?

830
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:50,706
- Can you move?
- l can't breathe.

831
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,586
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

832
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,387
It's okay.

833
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,684
Okay. Okay.

834
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,312
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

835
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,361
- No.
- It's okay.

836
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,488
- Get away from me.
- It's okay.

837
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,199
Get away from me. Stay away from me.

838
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,827
- Not you!
- Fuck it.

839
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,995
- Not you!
- It's okay.

840
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:33,666
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Keep away from me!

841
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,918
Lady, I'm trying... I'm trying to help you.

842
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,088
Fuck you! Not you!

843
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,340
Somebody! Anybody else!

844
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,259
- Please, somebody!
- Stop moving!

845
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,593
Not you!

846
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,514
No! Get your filthy fucking hands off me!

847
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,932
- Stop moving.
- No!

848
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,226
Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!

849
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,776
Okay. Okay.

850
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,320
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

851
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,573
I'm not gonna touch you.

852
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:09,034
But there's nobody else here yet,
and that's gasoline there.

853
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,914
We need to get you out of here
right away. Okay?

854
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,710
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay.

855
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,631
I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

856
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,052
Yeah. Yeah.

857
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,847
Thanks.

858
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,062
ls anything broken?

859
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,982
I don't think so.

860
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,068
Okay. I think that's good.

861
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,072
- Are you gonna get me out?
- Yeah.

862
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,575
I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

863
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,411
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

864
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,503
Oh, fuck!

865
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:04,006
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

866
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,135
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

867
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,930
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

868
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,682
It's okay, it's okay.

869
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,268
It's okay. it's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

870
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,604
Everything's gonna be fine. Look at me.

871
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,148
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

872
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:23,108
Everything's gonna be fine.

873
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,295
Ryan!

874
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,622
Pull!

875
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,514
It's okay.

876
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,192
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

877
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,863
All right. Here we go. it's okay, it's okay.

878
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,616
It's all right. I got it now. I got it.

879
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,201
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?

880
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,621
It's cool, it's cool. it's okay.

881
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,292
Here we go. All right, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

882
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,242
The DA wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

883
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,494
No, he didn't.

884
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,371
lf he did his own dirty work,
none of us would have jobs.

885
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,748
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

886
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,334
- Thanks for coming in, Detective.
- He just pulled into the garage.

887
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,629
Great, great. Press conference
is in 1 0 minutes, so we'll make this short.

888
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:52,341
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has
two suspicious shootings on his record.

889
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,594
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

890
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,347
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

891
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,266
You know any reason
why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

892
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,729
Well, it's... it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

893
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,819
We found $300 ,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

894
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,446
Shit!

895
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:17,324
Go down to the garage.

896
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,618
Tell him to stay in the car
until he hears from me.

897
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,747
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

898
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,333
Well, the car's actually registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

899
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,293
We haven't been able
to get in touch with her, yet.

900
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,255
Apparently, she left town this morning.

901
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,424
So it wasn't Lewis' car.

902
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,801
He may not have even known
the money was in it.

903
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,935
Do you really think you're gonna be able
to make that fly?

904
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,399
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

905
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,152
- These names ring a bell, Detective?
- Yeah, vaguely.

906
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,822
We have attorneys
for this slain police officer

907
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:58,365
camping in our offices.

908
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,868
We have his mother
and a half a dozen men of the cloth

909
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:04,455
who swear that Lewis
was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.

910
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,332
We have two black city councilmen
and a congresswoman

911
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,002
who call on the hour, every hour,
demanding to know

912
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,254
what the District Attorney
intends to do about this.

913
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,131
And you want him
to walk into that press room

914
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:17,509
and tell them all
that the situation is complicated?

915
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,226
Give us a minute.

916
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,854
No problem.

917
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,906
Who knows about the money?

918
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,074
You gotta be kidding me.

919
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,368
There are only two people in this room.

920
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,707
Myself, my partner, Ferguson
and Internal Affairs.

921
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,542
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

922
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:57,883
Okay. Okay, I guess I don't see a problem.

923
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,136
As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money
isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

924
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,972
And even if it was,
we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.

925
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,974
Which means
the money Internal Affairs is holding

926
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,227
can't even be considered evidence.

927
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,896
What? You know, you can
do this whole dance if you want to,

928
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:12,564
but I'm willing to bet

929
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,608
when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

930
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,070
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

931
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,697
Fucking black people, huh?

932
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,659
- What did you just say?
- l mean...

933
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,787
You know, I know
all the sociological reasons

934
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,290
why per capita eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

935
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,000
Schools are a disgrace.

936
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,419
Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

937
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,338
All that stuff. All that stuff!

938
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:40,759
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

939
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,887
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

940
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,103
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth,

941
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,188
but that's the way it always plays,
doesn't it?

942
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,942
And assholes like Lewis just keep
feeding the flames. it's gotta get to you.

943
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,612
What did you say you did for the DA again?

944
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,614
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

945
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,783
Oh, please, don't do that.

946
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:07,452
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

947
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:11,623
What do you think those kids need?
To make them believe, to give them hope?

948
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,251
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

949
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,962
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

950
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,131
Why don't you cut through
the bullshit, Flanagan,

951
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,466
and just tell me what it is you want?

952
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,139
The DA's squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

953
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:30,601
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

954
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,813
It's a high-profile position, and he wants to
send the right message to the community.

955
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:38,692
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

956
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,321
Well, fuck you very much,
but thanks for thinking of me.

957
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,741
Actually, we were thinking of you.

958
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,744
Until we saw that.

959
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,456
It's your brother's file.

960
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,000
Twenty something years old
and already three felonies.

961
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,961
Three-strikes law.
Kid's going away for life for stealing a car.

962
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,588
Christ, that's a shitty law.

963
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,507
There's a warrant in there.

964
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,261
But still, hey,
he had every opportunity you had.

965
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,725
Fucking black people, huh?

966
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,023
So all...

967
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:23,278
All I need to do to make this disappear
is to frame a potentially innocent man?

968
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,281
What are you?
The fucking defender of all things white?

969
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:30,035
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

970
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,538
And you're arguing with me
that maybe we're not being fair to him?

971
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,667
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.

972
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,876
Maybe Lewis did provoke this

973
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,170
and maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

974
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,548
Or maybe, stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

975
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,634
was enough to get him killed.

976
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,721
There was no one there to see
who shot first, so there is no way to know.

977
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:52,808
Which means we could get this wrong.

978
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,730
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

979
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,275
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

980
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:07,322
You're the one closest to all this.
You need to tell us.

981
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,537
What does your gut tell you?

982
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,636
So, Graham.

983
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,763
What do I tell them?

984
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,766
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

985
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:46,028
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

986
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,322
it's pretty clear what happened last night.

987
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,908
Okay.

988
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,678
Before I get to why we're here,

989
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:15,474
I know that many of you have heard
that we had our car stolen last night.

990
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:20,228
And as you could imagine,
my wife and I are both pretty shaken up.

991
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,147
But we're okay.

992
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:25,817
And Jean and I truly appreciate
all your calls and your concern.

993
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,069
Thank you.

994
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:31,156
Now, just affer 9:00 p.m. last night,

995
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,825
Detective William Lewis,
an eight-year veteran of the force

996
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,702
and an active member
of the black community,

997
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,704
was gunned down by a fellow officer.

998
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,055
Hi, sweetie.

999
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,351
Bye, Lara.

1000
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:39,891
Get out of the car!

1001
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:42,435
Give me the keys! Get out the...
What the fuck?

1002
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,939
Whoa! What the fuck are you doing, man?

1003
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,065
Shit!

1004
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:48,733
- You wanna get killed, nigger?
- Say that again!

1005
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,068
What the fuck?

1006
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,363
- Say that again, bitch!
- You stupid motherfucker!

1007
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:56,783
- Say it again, huh! Call me a nigger again!
- Christ!

1008
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,578
- Yo, man, what the fuck? Get off of him.
- Fuck you!

1009
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,830
- Shoot him!
- Fucking blow your head off!

1010
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,248
Shoot this motherfucker, man!

1011
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,250
Look, man, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1012
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,918
Stop talking and shoot!

1013
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,587
Come on, stop! Let's go!

1014
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,505
- Shit, here comes the po-po.
- Shit.

1015
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:11,965
- Get off of me.
- Fuck off.

1016
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,718
- Jesus.
- Hey, hey. Where you going, man?

1017
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,886
Hell, no!

1018
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,929
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

1019
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,350
Get the fuck out of my car!

1020
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,768
Shit! Damn!

1021
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,729
What are you doing, man?
Get out of the car!

1022
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:26,771
Fuck you!

1023
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,482
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- You get the fuck out of the car!

1024
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:33,278
Unit 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
Westbound on...

1025
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,448
I will blow you away. Get the fuck out!

1026
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,954
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...

1027
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,497
Oh, Christ!

1028
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:52,130
- Get the fuck out of the car!
- You get the fuck out of the car!

1029
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,633
- Get out of the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

1030
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,676
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

1031
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,303
You just give me my fucking gun!

1032
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,812
Fuck!

1033
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:20,492
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1034
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:26,790
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

1035
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,500
Get out of my car.

1036
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,002
Oh, you so brave, you get out the car, man.

1037
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,925
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

1038
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,941
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

1039
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,110
Lie face down on the ground.
Spread your arms and legs.

1040
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,654
No, you lie face down on the ground
and spread your arms and legs.

1041
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,406
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

1042
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,949
Fuck you, man! What are you gonna do?

1043
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,201
- Pull the fucking trigger, then!
- On your knees now!

1044
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:04,369
You get on your knees

1045
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:06,538
and suck my motherfucking dick
while you down there.

1046
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,498
Do I look like I'm fucking joking with you?

1047
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,667
Yeah, that's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

1048
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,044
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

1049
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,089
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture for you.

1050
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,050
- l know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

1051
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,760
Fuck off. Give me some space.
I know this guy.

1052
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,387
- Get out of the way.
- You don't fucking know me.

1053
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,596
Step away.

1054
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,890
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

1055
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,728
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

1056
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,188
Do you wanna die here, huh?
ls that what you want?

1057
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,190
'Cause these guys really wanna shoot you.

1058
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,068
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

1059
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,903
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck me?

1060
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,239
I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one who's fucked here.

1061
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,033
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

1062
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,409
and onto that man's patio.

1063
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,911
- Officer Hanson, step away.
- He's a friend of mine, okay?

1064
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,581
He's a fucking friend of mine!
This man is not armed!

1065
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,292
He's not gonna shoot you, or me,
or anybody else, all right?

1066
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,878
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

1067
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,589
Lower your firearm! Lower your firearm!

1068
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,305
Are you starting
to understand the situation?

1069
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,058
What do you want from me?

1070
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,852
Unless you think your wife

1071
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,897
is gonna be better off with a husband
who has a bloody stump for a head,

1072
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,107
I want you to sit down on that curb,
put your hands on your head,

1073
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,109
and do nothing
until I speak with these officers.

1074
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,613
I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not putting
my hands on my head for nobody.

1075
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,114
Then stand right where you are

1076
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:26,117
and keep your hands in plain sight.
Can you do that, huh?

1077
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,622
Yeah, I can do that.

1078
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:31,998
Good.

1079
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,628
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

1080
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:41,466
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1081
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:43,468
I need this favor.

1082
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:47,555
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1083
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,849
I need to let him go with a warning.

1084
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:54,896
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1085
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,818
Thank you.

1086
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:04,989
You've been warned.
Do you understand me?

1087
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,367
Do you understand me?

1088
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,370
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1089
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:14,874
- Look, I'm trying to help you.
- l didn't ask for your help, did l?

1090
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,086
Go home.

1091
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,384
Yeah, that I can do.

1092
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,256
Look at me.

1093
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,551
You embarrass me.

1094
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,763
You embarrass yourself.

1095
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,266
Daddy's home!

1096
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,037
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1097
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,331
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1098
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:04,002
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1099
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,587
- You give me my money.
- Daddy.

1100
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,840
I want my fucking money!
Give me that truck.

1101
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,341
That's not my truck, bro.

1102
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,093
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1103
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,469
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

1104
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,639
You know what? Hey, I got $50 . Here, here.

1105
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,850
$50? You took everything!

1106
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,101
Mommy?

1107
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,563
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1108
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:27,483
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1109
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,070
I have it. He doesn't have
the impenetrable cloak.

1110
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,824
Lara, stay out of the street!

1111
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,686
It's okay, Daddy.

1112
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,690
- What? What?
- I'll protect you.

1113
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,260
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1114
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,099
- It's a really good cloak.
- Good.

1115
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:03,097
How's it going?

1116
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,877
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1117
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,422
Well, you know what? You are one to talk.

1118
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:39,217
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year.

1119
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,513
I'm not snapping at you. I am angry.

1120
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,058
Yes. At them! Yes!

1121
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,521
At them, the police, at Rick, at Maria,

1122
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,358
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1123
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,237
at the gardener
who keeps over-watering the lawn.

1124
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,363
l...

1125
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,407
I just thought that...

1126
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,495
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1127
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,581
and I would feel better, you know?

1128
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,168
But I was still mad. And I realized...

1129
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:19,048
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1130
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,594
I wake up like this every morning.

1131
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:28,891
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1132
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:31,352
Carol, I don't know why. And l...

1133
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,065
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1134
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,401
Bye.

1135
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,889
I really appreciate this.

1136
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,058
No problem.

1137
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,900
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1138
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,360
Hour, maybe.

1139
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:46,737
Big surprise, huh?

1140
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,782
Yeah, this ain't exactly
pick-up-a-brother territory.

1141
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,409
True.

1142
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:56,455
- So where you headed?
- Anywhere the other side of the hill.

1143
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:58,749
I'm going to El Segundo.

1144
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,292
El Segundo's cool.

1145
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,754
- You've been there?
- Fuck, no.

1146
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,263
That's some good music.

1147
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,893
No, really. I'm starting to understand it.

1148
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,106
Wrote me a country song myself
just yesterday.

1149
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,150
I'll bet you did.

1150
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,652
Whatever.

1151
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,086
So what was going on
in the Valley tonight?

1152
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,299
Iceskating.

1153
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,176
Love the iceskating, man.

1154
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:53,971
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1155
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,223
Come on.

1156
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,769
What, you think that's funny or something?

1157
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,937
I think you're having fun.

1158
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,522
Yeah. Whatever.

1159
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:16,494
- Something else funny?
- Oh, yeah.

1160
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:20,498
Yeah? What's that?

1161
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,000
People, man. People.

1162
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,087
People like me.

1163
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,673
No, no, no. I'm not laughing at you, man.

1164
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:33,969
Yeah, I can see that.
Why don't you laugh outside?

1165
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,180
Dawg, why are you getting
all bent out of shape?

1166
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,933
I'm not getting bent, man.
I'm just pulling over.

1167
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:45,189
Come on, man, keep driving.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1168
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,942
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1169
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:50,319
Why you being a fucking jerk, man?
Just drive the car.

1170
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,238
I've got a better idea. Get out now.

1171
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:54,115
Fine. You want me to show you?
I'll show you.

1172
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,575
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see them.

1173
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,868
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

1174
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,036
Put your hands where I can see them.

1175
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:02,498
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.

1176
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:39,243
Oh, God.

1177
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,780
Thank you, brother Merle, for that.

1178
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:21,410
That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,
the scene of country music here in LA.

1179
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,121
It's a cold night, and it's getting colder.

1180
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:27,374
And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo
coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,

1181
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,626
so give us a call...

1182
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,633
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezing.

1183
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,802
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1184
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:41,388
- Get out of here.
- That's what I heard.

1185
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,974
- You got a smoke?
- No. I quit.

1186
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,185
Yeah, me, too.

1187
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:49,605
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1188
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:53,984
Hey, Bob.

1189
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,659
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1190
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:28,495
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1191
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,750
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1192
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,170
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1193
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:38,630
Kim Lee.

1194
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:49,141
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1195
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,602
It's okay. I'm okay.

1196
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,564
I went crazy speeding. I drove into a car.

1197
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:57,941
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1198
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:01,487
Got into big fight with poor woman.
I called her names.

1199
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:06,617
Oh, fine. I die from worry and you laugh.

1200
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:12,456
Thank you for finding me.

1201
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:19,129
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1202
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:20,798
Go to the locker.

1203
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,637
No, next one.

1204
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,309
ln my wallet there's a check.

1205
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,061
Bring it here.

1206
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,615
Oh, I get it. When I said
get me a black Lincoln Navigator,

1207
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:49,827
you thought I said
get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.

1208
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:53,247
Fine, it's fine.
Just give me whatever for it, man.

1209
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:55,499
You should see this.

1210
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,308
I'll take the van.

1211
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,686
They're chained to the van.

1212
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,354
So I'll take them, too.

1213
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,357
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1214
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:22,818
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1215
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,987
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1216
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:28,407
- What the hell are you gonna do with them?
- Sell them. What the hell do you think?

1217
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:32,077
I'll give you $500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1218
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,265
Oh, no!

1219
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,396
No! No!

1220
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,706
This is Dorri.

1221
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:33,555
My baby. My poor baby.

1222
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,768
Mom.

1223
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:44,024
I promise you. I promise
I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.

1224
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:48,237
Oh, I already know.

1225
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:52,574
You did.

1226
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:58,080
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1227
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:02,417
We weren't much good to you anymore,
were we?

1228
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:11,009
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1229
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,469
Mom, I wanna stay with...

1230
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:15,597
I just wanna wait with my baby.

1231
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:29,861
He came home. Did you know that?

1232
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,323
My little boy.

1233
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,661
When I was sleeping,
he brought me groceries.

1234
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,831
It's the last thing he did.

1235
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,566
Baba.

1236
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:21,997
What happened?

1237
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,589
What did you do?

1238
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:33,717
Baba, what did you do?

1239
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,181
I shoot a little girl.

1240
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:40,724
What?

1241
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:43,602
No, she's okay. She's...

1242
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:47,731
She's... Here.

1243
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:49,983
The gun shoot her,

1244
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,237
but she's okay, Dorri. Nothing happened.

1245
01:39:57,909 --> 01:39:59,242
She's my farishte.

1246
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:04,039
- What are you talking about, Daddy?
- My farishte, Dorri.

1247
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:11,713
My angel.

1248
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,926
She came to protect me.

1249
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,513
To protect us.

1250
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,475
You understand?

1251
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,440
Take this. Please.

1252
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:33,235
Take it.

1253
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:39,533
Hey, hey.

1254
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,078
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1255
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,956
It's okay.

1256
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:53,630
- Okay, Daddy.
- Okay.

1257
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,281
Jean?

1258
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,491
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong?

1259
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,827
I fell down the stairs.

1260
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,289
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1261
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,208
I couldn't get through to anyone. Not...

1262
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,837
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, not...

1263
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:36,923
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1264
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:40,343
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1265
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:43,221
Carol was the only one that was home

1266
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:46,725
and she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1267
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,977
Well, that's because she's a bitch.

1268
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:51,605
She's been my friend for 1 0 years.

1269
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,775
All right, honey. Feel better.

1270
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:57,277
I'll be there soon.

1271
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,364
I love you.

1272
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,784
I love you, too.

1273
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,068
Miss Jean.

1274
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:42,239
Would you like to sit up?

1275
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,371
Here.

1276
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,206
Good.

1277
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,010
- Do you want to hear something funny?
- What, Mrs. Jean?

1278
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:08,723
You're the best friend I've got.

1279
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:25,462
Hi.

1280
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:33,553
I love you.

1281
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,353
All right.

1282
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:09,524
Everybody out, man. You're free to go.

1283
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,237
All right, come on.

1284
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:18,074
Come on, now. This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop.

1285
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,659
Come on, y'all.

1286
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:24,205
Come on.

1287
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:02,785
That's $40 .

1288
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:05,121
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1289
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,709
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1290
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:48,665
Oh, my God!
What the hell is wrong with you people?

1291
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,670
Don't talk to me,
unless you speak American!
