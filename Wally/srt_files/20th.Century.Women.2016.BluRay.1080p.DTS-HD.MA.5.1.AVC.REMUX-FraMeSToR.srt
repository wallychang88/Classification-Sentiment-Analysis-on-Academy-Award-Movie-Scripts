1
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,030
<i>That was my husband's Ford Galaxy.</i>

2
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:18,042
<i>We drove Jamie home from</i>
the hospital in that car.

3
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,923
<i>My mom was 40 when she had me.</i>

4
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,586
<i>Everyone told her she was too old</i>
to be a mother.

5
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,803
<i>I put my hand through the little window,</i>

6
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,132
<i>and he'd squeeze my finger,</i>

7
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,296
<i>and I'd tell him life was very big...</i>

8
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,850
<i>and unknown.</i>

9
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,772
<i>And she told me that there were animals</i>

10
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,771
<i>and sky and cities...</i>

11
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:43,733
<i>...music, movies.</i>

12
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,271
<i>He'd fall in love,</i>

13
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:49,745
<i>have his own children,</i>
have passions, have meaning,

14
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,200
<i>have his mom and dad.</i>

15
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,199
<i>When they got divorced,</i>

16
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,624
<i>my father moved back east</i>
and left the car with us.

17
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,578
<i>He calls on birthdays and Christmas.</i>

18
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:05,917
<i>Last time I felt close to him</i>
was on my birthday in 1974.

19
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,047
<i>He bought me mirrored sunglasses.</i>

20
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:13,052
<i>I saw the president fall down the</i>
stairs...

21
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:15,678
<i>and I threw up on the carpet.</i>

22
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:21,641
<i>Since then it's just been us.</i>

23
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,227
<i>I don't understand. What about you?</i>

24
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,332
<i>I'm staying here with him 'til the plane</i>
gets safely away.

25
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:27,106
<i>No, Richard, no.</i>
What has happened to you?

26
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:29,821
<i>- Last night we...</i>
- Last night we said a great many things.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,530
Listen, Captain,
I am having a party tonight,

28
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:38,908
it's my birthday actually,

29
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,253
and I would like you to drop by
so I can feed you.

30
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,871
It's not necessary, Mrs. Fields.

31
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,418
No, Dorothea. No, I... I insist. Please?

32
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,752
<i>That way I... I can thank you.</i>

33
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,421
It was a beautiful car.

34
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,395
Mom, it...

35
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,930
smelled like gas
and overheated all the time...

36
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,274
and it was just old.

37
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,944
What?

38
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:09,525
Well it wasn't always old.

39
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,529
It just got that way all of a sudden.

40
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:13,318
You know...

41
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:15,658
when the firemen come...

42
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,529
people don't usually
invite them over for dinner.

43
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,329
Yeah? Why not?

44
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:39,256
Why can't she just move on
and be happy with me

45
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:42,846
rather than...
lingering on him?

46
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,523
My mom just makes me feel
like I'm not good enough.

47
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,615
It's just, I'm constantly
being compared to my dad.

48
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:48,288
Oh, hey, sorry.

49
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,247
Uh, Jamie's not here right now.

50
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,363
They're not home.

51
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,439
Don't.

52
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,949
I'm taking a picture of everything
that happens to me in a day.

53
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,783
I don't like having my pictures taken.

54
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,451
I didn't happen to you.

55
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:35,918
Hello?

56
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,208
- Hey.
- Hi.

57
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,838
Hi. Here.

58
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,435
- You okay?
- You aren't gonna believe what happened.

59
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,563
What?

60
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,019
Our car burst into flames
in the parking lot.

61
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:50,234
- It wh...
- Seriously?

62
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,350
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,518
You know, we're okay.

64
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,733
- How did it happen?
- Well I don't know.

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,400
They... they said it was probably
just something electrical.

66
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,204
We walked out and it was
just sitting there... on fire.

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,360
Oh, man.

68
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,367
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

69
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,371
So... what happened?

70
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,831
They never tell you anything,
I... They won't...

71
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,207
I won't know anything for like a week.

72
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:17,635
Oh.

73
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,679
And I'm... I'm gonna be late on rent.

74
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,217
That's okay. Don't worry about that.

75
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:27,346
Thanks.

76
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,438
Oh, God.

77
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:42,863
What if you had been in the car?

78
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:46,452
I wouldn't be here.

79
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,289
You would've missed me?

80
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:54,674
Don't joke.

81
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:11,643
It was so much easier
before you got all horny.

82
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,478
It... it's not like you don't...

83
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,695
Do it?

84
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:28,575
Friends can't have sex
and still be friends.

85
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:33,372
I like us like we are, okay?

86
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,458
Okay.

87
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,711
Jamie!

88
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,421
Could you come help me
set up, please?

89
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,264
Can my mom just chill out?

90
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:50,722
She's compensating for her loneliness.

91
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,640
Dorothea, all that is really
beautiful molding there.

92
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,622
- It is.
- I want to continue that around the side.

93
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,476
Right so we're gonna
have to re-match that.

94
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,365
Now is that...
is that actually wood...

95
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,941
- That is wood.
- or is that plaster?

96
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,526
No, the plaster is underneath it.

97
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,361
The molding on the outside there is wood.

98
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:07,566
- So...
- Okay.

99
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:08,758
It's gonna take a little bit of time,
but...

100
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:09,822
Well, we've got...

101
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:11,616
Okay, no, it's good.

102
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:14,832
Actually, it was, it was built in 1905,

103
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:16,413
and the same family had it forever,

104
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,618
but they lost all their money
during the war,

105
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,214
and then there was a fire and...

106
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,336
You should've been here for that.

107
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,721
Anyway, so, it was just a mess.
They let it fall apart.

108
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,219
Then a bohemian inherited it
in the '60s,

109
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:31,297
then a bunch of free spirits moved in,
and they lost it to the bank.

110
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:32,428
It's beautiful.

111
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,468
Oh, I... I completely fell in love with it.

112
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,881
We're connected to the dirt
'cause we came from the dirt.

113
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:40,565
The dirt is made of stars and stardust,
in the same way we are,

114
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:45,437
so when you put your hands
into that dirt

115
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,816
and feel the Earth Mother...

116
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:52,828
- Uh, William?
- Mm-hmm?

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,700
It looks as though I'm gonna be
in need of a car.

118
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,407
Do you think you have something
for me out there, cheap?

119
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,042
Maybe that '49 Deluxe?

120
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,706
I think we can work something out.

121
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,765
Maybe we'll trade for rent or something.

122
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,588
- Thank you.
- Sure.

123
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,182
Okay. Got through that one.

124
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,258
All right. Just, um...

125
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,680
give me a minute and then come out.

126
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,589
<i>My mom was born in 1924.</i>

127
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>When she was my age</i>
people drove in sad cars

128
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:58,773
<i>to sad houses with old phones, no money,</i>
or food, or televisions...

129
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,731
<i>but the people were real.</i>

130
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,811
<i>When she was 16,</i>

131
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,476
<i>the war broke out</i>
and she had to leave school.

132
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,317
<i>Her dream was to be a pilot</i>
in the Air Force.

133
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,447
<i>She actually went to flight school.</i>

134
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,324
<i>But the war ended</i>
before she was done.

135
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,038
<i>She became the first woman to work</i>

136
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,330
<i>in the Continental Can Company</i>
drafting room.

137
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,082
<i>Then she met my dad...</i>

138
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,095
<i>and then I came.</i>

139
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,879
<i>Then they got divorced.</i>

140
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,763
<i>But people from her time</i>
never admit anything went wrong.

141
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:36,761
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.

142
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:40,217
He's too young to have an account
in his name only, little guy.

143
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,137
No. He... he's a person.

144
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:45,437
He's not half a person,
and he's not some cute little guy.

145
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,692
He has volition and autonomy
and privacy.

146
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,030
He needs a bank account.

147
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,186
Can you do that for us?

148
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,780
Now, Jamie, you can't just keep
skipping school and making excuses.

149
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,537
Well wait a minute, why not?
Why can't he just skip school

150
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,790
if he... if he has a legitimate
need to be away?

151
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:06,584
Well, then I need a legitimate
real note from you...

152
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:08,842
- Okay.
- with your real signature.

153
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:12,922
Wow, how did you forge
my signature so well?

154
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:15,384
That is ingenious!

155
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,010
But you should never
forge someone's signature

156
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,969
or do anything
behind someone's back.

157
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,604
<i>Please excuse Jamie</i>
from school this morning.

158
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:28,016
<i>He was doing volunteer work</i>
for the Sandinistas.

159
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,485
<i>Please excuse Jamie</i>
from school this morning.

160
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,567
<i>He was involved in</i>
a small plane accident.

161
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,989
<i>Fortunately, he was not hurt.</i>

162
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,739
You're gonna be in for
a legendary surprise.

163
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,125
It's mahogany underneath.

164
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,907
<i>She's always trying to</i>
bring a man into my life.

165
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,786
This is probably Honduran mahogany.

166
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,497
Really fine, very...

167
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,845
- This is, like, really, really boring.
- Hey, come on, watch it.

168
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,522
He's talking about, like, wood and stuff.

169
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,666
He's helping me out.
Restore the house, okay?

170
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:54,797
IBM?

171
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,819
<i>She writes down her stocks every morning.</i>

172
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,393
Two-hundred and thirteen point two.

173
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,472
GE?

174
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,641
Um, 51.62.

175
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:05,942
<i>She smokes Salems</i>
because they're healthier,

176
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,399
<i>wears Birkenstocks</i>
because she's contemporary.

177
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,726
<i>She read</i> Watership Down

178
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,606
<i>and learned how to carve rabbits</i>
out of wood.

179
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,446
<i>And she never dates a man</i>
for very long.

180
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,616
<i>Thank you, bye bye.</i>

181
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,367
Good night, Dorothea.

182
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,414
- Good night.
- Bye.

183
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,870
So, I'll see ya later.

184
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:28,815
Just don't hang out with
that Chris guy anymore, okay?

185
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,884
- Good night.
- He's a skeez and he's kinda dumb.

186
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,921
- Exactly.
- Good night, Dorothea.

187
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:35,877
- Happy Birthday.
- Bye, Julie.

188
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:39,935
Stop.

189
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,637
What?

190
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,889
Thinking that you know
everything that's going on.

191
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,436
No, I don...
I just think that, you know,

192
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,810
having your heart broken is a tremendous
way to learn about the world.

193
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:58,152
Okay.

194
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,580
Do you think you're happy?

195
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:05,793
Like...

196
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,794
as happy as you thought you'd be
when you were my age?

197
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,916
Seriously?

198
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,127
You don't ask people questions like that.

199
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,420
You're my mom.

200
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:20,716
Especially your mom.

201
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,636
Look, wondering if you're happy

202
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,892
is a great shortcut
to just being depressed.

203
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,310
Give me that.

204
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,020
What is that?

205
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:12,814
It's The Raincoats.

206
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,859
Can't things... just be pretty?

207
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:27,242
"Pretty" music is used
to hide how unfair and corrupt society is.

208
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,831
Ah.

209
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,173
Okay, so...

210
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,004
they're not very good,
and they know that, right?

211
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,090
Yeah, it's...

212
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,923
It's like they got all this,
this feeling,

213
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:44,889
and they don't have any skill,
and they don't want skill,

214
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,470
because it's really interesting

215
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:51,185
what happens when your passion
is bigger than the tools

216
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:52,978
you have to deal with it.

217
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:57,443
It creates this energy
that's... that's... that's raw.

218
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,983
Isn't it great?

219
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:20,964
<i>My son was born in 1964.</i>

220
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,589
<i>He grew up with a meaningless war...</i>

221
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:31,272
<i>with protests, with Nixon...</i>

222
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:34,692
<i>with nice cars and nice houses...</i>

223
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,900
<i>computers, drugs, boredom.</i>

224
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:47,197
<i>I know him less every day.</i>

225
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:55,036
<i>He said it was just a game.</i>

226
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,789
<i>You breathe real hard</i>
and another kid

227
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,219
<i>He said you're supposed to come to</i>
a few seconds later...

228
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,894
- Dude, can I try?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:15,392
<i>but it took Jamie almost</i>
a half an hour to wake up.

230
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:30,489
Going to get help!

231
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:50,138
- You all right?
- He's fine.

232
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,060
Can you tell me your name?

233
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Jamie Fields.

234
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:19,962
You got lucky this time.

235
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,287
Lack of oxygen to the brain
can cause brain damage,

236
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,923
comas... even death.

237
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,931
Jamie, why would you do something
so dangerous?

238
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,520
I don't know. Um...

239
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,192
I mean, everyone was doing it.

240
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,186
So you just went along with it?

241
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,280
- It looked like fun.
- That's just dumb.

242
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,162
Why would you do something
so stupid?

243
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:52,664
Just following along?

244
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,913
You... you know you almost died, right?

245
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,747
- You don't need to worry about me.
- Why didn't you think?

246
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,579
Jamie! Hey!

247
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,133
Jamie...

248
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:08,462
What... what is going on?
What, why...

249
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:12,007
What? You're not
gonna talk to me now?

250
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,927
I'm not the one who doesn't talk.

251
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,349
What? Come on.

252
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,268
You scared the hell out of me!

253
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,188
Why... why did you hurt yourself
like that?

254
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,234
Why do you smoke yourself to death?

255
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,689
Hey!

256
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:32,113
Why are you fine being sad and alone?

257
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,239
I, uh...

258
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:39,544
I... You... You c...

259
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,718
You can't talk to me like that.
We don't...

260
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,828

in figuring out how to be himself
in all this mess.

286
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,459
And I can't be there.

287
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,710
I can't be there with him.
I have to let go.

288
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,592
Is this because of the fainting thing?

289
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,336
- He's fine.
- No.

290
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,258
It's because of everything.

291
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,515
I don't understand what...
What are you asking?

292
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,814
Well, how do you be a good man?

293
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,272
What does that even mean nowadays?

294
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:31,057
He's... he's only got me.
It's just...

295
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,688
Think about it. It's not enough.

296
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,693
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

297
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:38,488
What about William?
William's a guy. That's...

298
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,283
He can talk to him about guy things.

299
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,237
Have you ever seen them
have a conversation?

300
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:45,368
They have nothing in common.
They don't connect.

301
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,795
It's just not working.
I mean, I thought about that.

302
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:48,997
He...

303
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:53,341
Well, he likes you and you.
He likes you a lot.

304
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,025
- That... that's...
- He's my friend.

305
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,338
I don't want to be his mom.

306
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,840
Yeah, no. I'm his mom.

307
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:03,219
I mean don't you need a man
to raise a man?

308
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,346
No. I don't think so.

309
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,308
I mean,

310
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:11,523
I think you're what's gonna work for him.

311
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:18,861
I mean... you know him better than anyone.

312
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,455
You know that, and...

313
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:25,202
you care about him.
You can watch out for him.

314
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:30,171
And you just share your life.
You're a talented person.

315
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,691
Show him what you're interested in.

316
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,631
You know, he would be lucky to have that.

317
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,155
Help me with what?

318
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,364
Oh, go through this part of your life.

319
00:21:56,442 --> 00:21:58,402
It's not easy. It's not easy for anybody.

320
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,451
- You asked them to help me?
- Yeah.

321
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,410
No, they... they get it.

322
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,335
So they said yes?

323
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,948
Yeah.

324
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:10,752
- Fuck.
- Hey!

325
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,634
You just feel guilty
'cause it's just me and you.

326
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,170
You don't know what I'm feeling.

327
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,338
Just tell me.

328

329
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:27,679
You never tell me what you're gonna do.
You just do it.

330
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,322
I got the keys to my stepmom's car.

331
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,448
I'm going to The Starwood.

332
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,795
Tanya and Michelle
are both gonna be there.

333
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:52,292

334
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,578
Yeah, I am.

00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,210

336
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:02,418
...kissed a girl? Are you ready?

337
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,841
Are you gonna... are you gonna
get with some chick there?

338
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:30,794
That was Jamie.

339
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,037
He is in, uh, LA.

340
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:36,882
He and some friends went to a show.

341
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:41,513
- Oh.
- Yeah. He wanted me to tell you.

342
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,010
Okay.

343
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,103
Aren't you worried or...

344
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,896
He's mad at me and this is his way
of dealing with it...

345
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:03,284
and he has every right to be mad.

346
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,993
Yeah, but if it makes him this mad,

347
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,568

Maybe...

355
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:50,531
Maybe I did the wrong thing.

356
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,703
Oh, I...

357
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,202
- With the kid, I mean.
- Yeah, I know.

358
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:59,249
I think that Jamie's energy
is very...

359
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,456
unstable.

360
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,173
Yeah. Well, you're right.

361
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:08,838
Then, though,
there's an energy crisis.

362
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:14,006
Maybe that plays into it in some way.

363
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm sorry.

364
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:21,857
You don't have very many
funny lines, do you?

365
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:26,693
Okay.

366
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,605
Jamie?

367
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,075
Jamie?

368
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:30,764
Hey.

369
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:32,759
Hey.

370
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,719
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:37,682
Can I come in?

372
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,185
Sure.

373
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,730
So I had this new idea
for... for my photography

374
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:51,486
that I was gonna take a picture
of everything that I owned

375
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,780
so it would be a self-portrait of myself
through the stuff that I have.

376
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:01,755
Can I show you?

377
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:06,038
That's a bra, birth control,

378
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:11,511
um, photography by Susan Sontag,
shoes, underwear,

379
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,800
a picture of a picture of my mom.

380
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,137
I'm gonna do a bunch of 'em.

381
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,984
It's a little bit... It's a little bit sad.

382
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,775
You know, all this stuff together.

383
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,865
I don't know why that is.

384
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:33,151
Not... I mean...

385
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,324
Do you know what I mean?

386
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,332
It's really beautiful, Abbie.

387
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:42,831
Do you want to fool around...
with me?

388
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,422
Really?

389
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,168
Yeah.

390
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,801
Yeah.

391
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,721
I do.

392
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,846
You know, I'm recovering
from cervical cancer.

393
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,730
I know.

394
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,501
Your hair smells good.

395
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:33,169
I make my own shampoo.

396
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:35,883
Of course you do.

397
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,160
Oh.

398
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,002
It's okay, Jeeves, he's back.

399
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,042
You can relax now.

400
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,430
Where were you?

401
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:26,681
I went to The Starwood.

402
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:31,436
Saw a show in LA. Had a lot of fun.

403
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,147
Are you drunk?

404
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,125
Don't.

405
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:49,662
What's wrong?

406
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,543
Tim Trammer came inside me.

407
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:01,013
I don't want to hear this shit.

408
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,723
<i>We broke</i>
into that old pool at the rec center.

409
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,596
<i>Got loaded.</i>

410
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,142
<i>Fucked around.</i>

411
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,899
<i>And me and Tim ended up</i>
in his mom's Maverick.

412
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,074
Did you just cum?

413
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,736
Yeah.

414
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,583
You said you'd pull out.

415
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,999
Yeah.

416
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:35,998
Sorry.

417
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,885
I thought we had a deal there.

418
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,933
Fuck.

419
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,722
What are you gonna do?

420
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,231
It'll be fine.

421
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,826
Your mom asked me to, like,
help raise you.

422
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,338
Yeah, I know.

423
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,512
She was raised in The Depression.

424
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,966
Everyone helped raise everyone.

425
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:28,725
You know,
the whole neighborhood raised the kids.

426
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,605
Sorry.

427
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:35,977
Can we do therapy?

428
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,364
Jesus, I don't want
to do therapy right now.

429
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,981
- Let's just role play.
- Please, no.

430
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,148
I'll be your mom, and you can tell her
what you want to tell her.

431
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,861
Just do it.

432
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,094
I don't want to talk to my mom right now.

433
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:50,158
What would you say to her?

434
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,833
Okay.

435
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,376
I don't need your help, Mom.

436
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,094
I've got it.

437
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm okay.

438
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,850
Um, I'm gonna need a story.

439
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:14,349
What?

440
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,850
A story.

441
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,102
- What do you mean?
- Like a... a story.

442
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,114
Um... where... I'm...

443
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,360
I'm just a normal woman,

444
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,618
and you're a photographer,

445
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:35,203
and so you're photographing me,
but while you're doing it...

446
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:40,837
you can't help yourself,
and you start touching me.

447
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:45,047
And you touch me...

448
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:52,723
and you say...
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

449
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,270
Really?

450
00:32:57,728 --> 00:32:59,728
I can't just be myself?

451
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:04,945
No.

452
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,964
Okay, so... Do I just, uh...
- Okay.

453
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,448
Hey, nice to meet you.
- Oh, Hi.

454
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,950
Do I just look in the camera,
or should I look... off to the side?

455
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,076
Let's start that way,
looking in the camera.

456
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,213
Okay. Should I smile?

457
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:19,462
- Do you like to smile?
- Yeah.

458
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,087
- Okay.
- Okay.

459
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,960
Uh, oh, you took it.

460
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,024
I thought you were gonna
say like, "One, two, three..."

461
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,088
- No.
- Okay.

462
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,011
- I just wait for the moment.
- Okay.

463
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,934
- I just have to fix something.
- Okay.

464
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,760
- Just right here.
- Um, oh.

465
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,434
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God. No, it's all right.

466
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,976
I don't mind. I'm just...
Never done this before.

467
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:44,441
I, um, so I'm just a little bit nervous,
but, um, I can, um,

468
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,115
wear my hair differently if you want.
- Abbie...

469
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,204
Yeah?

470
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,163
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,996
I'm really sorry.

472
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:22,024
<i>Julie and I</i>
have been friends since we were little.

473
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,648
<i>She likes to say</i>
she's self-destructive.

474
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:31,697
<i>Her mother is a therapist.</i>

475
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,279
We used to talk and I...

476
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,454
had a better sense of what was going on
with you. I worry that...

477
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,868
<i>She makes Julie attend</i>
her teen group sessions.

478
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,326
<i>How about the possibility...</i>

479
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,629
that you're choosing boys
who are inappropriate...

480
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,127
unconsciously?

481
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,591
<i>When her mother remarried, Julie changed.</i>

482
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,195
I love this shirt! Don't get me wrong...

483
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,548
<i>When her half-sister Amanda</i>

484
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:58,056
<i>was born with cerebral palsy,</i>
she changed more.

485
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,812
Wow, it looks really pretty on you.

486
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:05,017
Brings... Just... just makes
your whole face pop.

487
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,896
Like soda. Like pop.

488
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,454
<i>She started fooling around.</i>

489
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:23,458
<i>She started</i>
sneaking into my house.

490
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,135
<i>Sleeping over.</i>

491
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:28,788
Why'd you do it?

492
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,674
'Cause I'm crazy.

493
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:35,382
You wish you were crazy.

494
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,023
Scratch me.

495
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,904
We should go
up the coast somewhere.

496
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,365
Just me and you.

497
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:55,026

People say that they're falling in love,
but they're not actually falling in love.

513

It's a fake connection

- Yeah.

00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:52,565
Yeah, he got in kinda late.

522
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Okay, you wanna help me
bring this stuff in?

523
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,535

00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,295
Yeah, he's okay.

Yeah, I... I heard him come in last night.

00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,464
- Oh.
- I was... I was awake.

527
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,332
Right.

528
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:16,843
Yeah, I was just...
Couldn't sleep, so I was...

529
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,760
you know, listening for him.

530
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,445
How was the show?

531
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,732
It was good.

532
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,821
Next time you take a trip
just let me know, okay?

533
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,316
I won't make too much dinner.

534
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,376
Hey, do the stocks with me?

535
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:00,883
Here.

536
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,893
Okay. IBM?

537
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,938
IBM, 69.73.

538
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:16,478
Xerox? You okay?

539
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,399
Xerox, 53.92.

540
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:22,526
- Stop.
- Okay.

541
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,570
Fifty-three point nine two.

542
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,406
Listen.

543
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,474
Abbie has her appointment today
and I can't be here.

544
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:30,544
I have to go to work,

545
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,662
so I was hoping that maybe
you could be here

546
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:36,211
when she gets back
in case she needs some support.

547
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,591
She's going through a lot.

548
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:43,424
Okay, well, like, what if it's,
like, bad news or something?

549
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,681
Well, you can handle it.

550
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:49,556
Or if you can't,
you have to start somewhere.

551
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,639
Men always feel like
they have to fix things

552
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,637
for women
or they're not doing anything,

553
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,859
but some things just can't be fixed.

554
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,322
Just be there.

555
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,444
Somehow that's hard for all of you.

556
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,955
Mom, I'm not "all men."
Okay? I'm just me.

557
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,371
Well, yes and no.

558
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:18,582
What if I have to have full-on chemo...

559
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,633
or get a hysterectomy?

560
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,302
Do you know what that is?

561
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,890
Look, I should just
go with you, you know? I mean...

562
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:38,151
Your mom did tell me
to share my life with you.

563
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,189
Yeah, I know.

564
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:44,357
You don't...

565
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:45,904
Don't worry about her.
She's...

566
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,784
she's from The Depression.

567
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,541
Yeah.

568
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,924
It's good news, Abbie.

569
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,088
There were no malignant cells.

570
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,634
Your biopsy's benign.

571
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,473
And in the future?

572
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:17,274
There was damage to the muscle wall,
from the surgery.

573
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,766
You have an incompetent cervix.

574
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,450
Incompetent?

575
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,542
It may not be strong enough
to go full term during pregnancy.

576
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,537
As the baby grows, the cervix widens.

577
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,961
If it's weakened, it's likely
to open prematurely.

578
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,048
I'm gonna be okay.

579
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,231
He said that I probably
can't have kids.

580
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,689
<i>Was having Jamie, like...</i>

581
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:11,068
the biggest thing
that ever happened to you?

582
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,621
I guess so.

583
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:22,124
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

584
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,671
You'll get through this.

585
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,546
You will get through it.

586
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,466
You will do it.

587
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,730
You'll... This is the really hard part.
And then what happens is,

588
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:47,115
there's a hard part
and then it gets better.

589
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,570
And then it gets hard again,
but never mind.

590
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,867
I shouldn't have told you that part.

591
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,333
I should have just said it gets better
and then that's it, but...

592
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:02,162
You got birds?

593
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:03,924
Is that okay?

594
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,384
Yeah.

595
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:09,921
So did you name them?

596
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,547
Not yet.

597
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,223
They're a boy and a girl,
and...

598
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:16,512
that they're monogamous
for life, so if...

599
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
one of them dies, then the other one...

600
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,695
will die like a week later.

601
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,648
Wow.

602
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,317
Well how 'bout
Maximilian and Carlotta?

603
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:31,608
I... I...

604
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,904
You know,
they deserve something grand

605
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:37,318
if they're gonna be monogamous
their whole lives.

606
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,869
Right?

607
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:45,868
Aw.

608
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:52,425
Max and Carlotta are really good names.

609
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,265
So, um, you...

610
00:43:57,345 --> 00:44:00,515
you went to the doctor's
and you waited with her.

611
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:03,386
Yeah.

612
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,096
But I... I told you to wait here.

613
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,437
I, um,

614
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,775
I thought it'd be better to, uh, go and...

615
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:12,785
really be there.

616
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:15,148
Wow.

617
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,494
She's really upset.

618
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:24,003
That must have been a lot to deal with.

619
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,168
I'm fine.

620
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm good.

621
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,587
I... I learned a lot.

622
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,385
Abigail Porter?

623
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,683
<i>"Home pregnancy tests</i>

624
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,478
<i>that women can do safely and easily.</i>

625
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:51,364
<i>A small revolution for women</i>
seeking to take control of their lives."

626
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:13,551
What the fuck is this?

627
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:16,877
It's a pregnancy test.

628
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,512
Um,

629
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,392
Abbie's doctor said that, uh,

630
00:45:26,392 --> 00:45:28,942
she wouldn't be able to have kids.

631
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,231
Why'd she take you?

632
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,611
- Is that all of it?
- Yeah.

633
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:42,317
That's a lot.

634
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,037
- Now what?
- Um...

635
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:47,787
"Shake for ten seconds."

636
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,470
Okay, um...

637
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:07,475
Um... "Leave undisturbed for two hours."

638
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,229
Two hours?

639
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,272
That's what it says.

640
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:21,358
Okay, if it appears, then you're positive,

641
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:24,907
and if no ring appears here,
then the test is negative.

642
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,500
What do we do for two hours?

643
00:46:37,046 --> 00:46:38,336
Guys don't smoke like that.

644
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:39,838
Don't hold it like that.

645
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,894
Like... this,

646
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:44,471
between your two fingers.

647
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,931
- That?
- Yeah. That's better.

648
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:52,392
Okay now walk. Do like a...

649
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,356
a cool cigarette walk.

650
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:05,435
Guys aren't supposed to look like

651
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,831
they're thinking about
what they look like.

652
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:11,334
Watch me.

653
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:20,553
See?

654
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:24,094
Smoking's gross.

655
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,180
No, it's not.

656
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:29,064
It gives you cancer.

657
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:32,522
This is just my opinion.

658
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:35,017
I think being strong
is the most important quality.

659
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:38,694
It's not being vulnerable,
it's not being sensitive.

660
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,743
It's not even...
Honestly, it's not even being happy.

661
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,704
It's about strength

662
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,737
<i>and your durability</i>
against the other emotions.

663
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,746
No ring.

664
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:02,805
No ring.

665
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:13,354
- Hey.
- Hey.

666
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,347
Thanks for coming with me.

667
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,311
Yeah, totally.

668
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:22,028
I made you this.

669
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:24,324
- It's a mix tape.
- Yep.

670
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:28,163
<i>These were a bunch of songs that...</i>

671
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,241
<i>I think my life</i>
would have been better

672
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:35,287
<i>if they had been around</i>
when I was a teenager.

673
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:38,791
<i>So I'm hoping that</i>
if you listen to them now,

674
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,170
<i>you will be a happier</i>
and more realized person

675
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:45,845
<i>than I could ever hope to be.</i>

676
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:53,306
<i>From that night on...</i>

677
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:55,891
<i>Abbie started telling me everything.</i>

678
00:48:57,103 --> 00:49:00,113
<i>She grew up in Santa Barbara</i>
where everyone is happy,

679
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:02,476
<i>but that just made her feel crazy.</i>

680
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,070
<i>In 1973, she moved to New York City</i>
and went to art school.

681
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:11,697
<i>New York City made her feel sane.</i>

682
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:13,618
<i>It was so fucked up.</i>

683
00:49:14,537 --> 00:49:16,707
<i>She fell in love with photography.</i>

684
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,674
<i>She learned to dance when she got sad.</i>

685
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:24,917
<i>She saw</i> The Man Who Fell to Earth
<i>and dyed her hair red.</i>

686
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:27,418
<i>I figured out how to be looked at</i>

687
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,007
by men,

688
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:34,433
and how to make them excited,

689
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,889
<i>and uncomfortable.</i>

690
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,600
<i>I was so cocky,</i>

691
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:40,772
<i>and I was so angry</i>

692
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:44,074
and I was so happy.

693
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,740
<i>She fell in love with her teacher.</i>

694
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,462
<i>Then she went</i>
to Planned Parenthood.

695
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,458
Abigail Porter?

696
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:07,048
<i>Her friends couldn't</i>
deal with her having cancer,

697
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:09,051
<i>so she went home to her mom.</i>

698
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:10,223
Hey, Mom...

699
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:12,682
<i>Gail, did you ever take...</i>

700
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,972
D.E.S. when you were pregnant with Abbie?

701
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,103
Yes.

702
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:24,025
I had two miscarriages before Abbie.
The doctor told me to take it.

703
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:28,608
<i>D.E.S. was a fertility medication.</i>

704
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,534
<i>Doctors prescribed it to women.</i>

705
00:50:31,656 --> 00:50:34,276
<i>Later they found out</i>
that the daughters

706
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,737
<i>of the women who took it</i>
got cervical cancer.

707
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,207
I didn't know that
you had miscarriages.

708
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:44,925
<i>When her mom found out</i>

709
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:46,632
<i>it was because she took that drug,</i>

710
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:48,513
<i>she wouldn't talk about it.</i>

711
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:52,722
<i>And everything Abbie did made her mad.</i>

712
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:56,348
<i>So Abbie looked</i>
for another place to live.

713
00:50:58,599 --> 00:50:59,639
- Hi. Hello...
- Hi.

714
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:03,226
<i>And she started renting the room upstairs.</i>

715
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:04,726
I'm Abbie.

716
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:07,691
<i>And she got a job at the news press.</i>

717
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:08,825
...the landslide.

718
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:11,067
It shows how erosion along the bluff,

719
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:14,742
it causes instantaneous
loss of oceanfront property

720
00:51:14,824 --> 00:51:15,954
and... and construction.

721
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:18,334
Over time, it gradually...

722
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:31,973
Hi, Dorothea.

723
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,225
Hey, Charlie.

724
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:43,021
Hey... um...

725
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:46,439
You wanna go out some time?

726
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,820
Get a drink?

727
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,737
Oh, um...

728
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:55,783
Yeah.

729
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,870
What the heck, Charlie?

730
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:02,082
Sure. Okay.

731
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,156
I wasn't sure.

732
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,828
- Uh...
- What?

733
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:09,419
Some... some of the guys
thought you were a lesbian.

734
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:13,673
You know, which, look,
I don't have a problem with if you are,

735
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,685
but you're not.

736
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:18,179
Yeah, no, I am not.

737
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:24,181
Um, should we go out then?

738
00:52:26,437 --> 00:52:28,307
Okay, yeah. Sure.

739
00:52:28,397 --> 00:52:32,437
You wanna come to dinner
at my house again some time?

740
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:35,365
You could...

741
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:37,278
We could do that.

742
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,782
Shit. Julie.

743
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:29,125
<i>It's really-It's nothing.</i>

744
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,292
<i>I just end up there sometimes.</i>

745
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,340
What do you guys do?

746
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,297
I just sleep.

747
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:38,166
We talk.

748
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:46,144
Can I have one?

749
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,811
No, they're really bad for you.

750
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:51,346
You smoke all the time.

751
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:54,361
You know when I started,
they weren't bad for you.

752
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,742
They were just stylish, sort of edgy,

753
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:59,699
so it's different for me.

754
00:54:05,953 --> 00:54:07,293
Okay.

755
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,167
You're good at hiding stuff, huh?

756
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,895
My mom calls it compartmentalizing.

757
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:24,393
Apparently, I do that a lot.

758
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:30,643
Are you helping him?

759
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:35,517
- I'm trying.
- Really?

760
00:54:37,735 --> 00:54:38,785
What about you?

761
00:54:39,403 --> 00:54:41,993
Have you thought about your impact on him?

762
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,414
It's always about the mother.

763
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,410
Like...

764
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:51,369
do you think you've moved on
since his dad?

765
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,960
You know that you're
not actually a therapist?

766
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:00,966
I've had new guys, okay?

767
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,389
No one appropriate.

768
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:08,311
Appropriate?

769
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:13,686
Guys you're not
gonna risk anything with...

770
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:17,401
men you don't even really like.

771
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,991
Listen, you're 17, okay?

772
00:55:21,195 --> 00:55:23,745
Maybe you don't know
what's good about these guys

773
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:25,493
that I really like.

774
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:28,616
I'm talking about you.

775
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:32,214
You never seem into it...

776
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,170
except for with William.

777
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:38,498
But...

778
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:41,297
he's inappropriate.

779
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:47,053
Okay, Jesus. Uh, yeah.

780
00:55:50,057 --> 00:55:52,557
It's hard to find someone that I like.

781
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:56,268
I... I had my chance twice,

782
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:59,615
but that part of life
just didn't work out for me.

783
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:11,622
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
00:56:48,157 --> 00:56:49,487
Where were you?

785
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,580
I had some errands.

786
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,580
You did the whole list.

787
00:56:58,667 --> 00:56:59,787
You know all the stocks?

788
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,753
Yeah.

789
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:06,424
IBM is down, huh?

790
00:57:06,592 --> 00:57:07,932
Sorry. I'll fix it next time.

791
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:11,756
That...
Good job on that.

792
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,910
- William?
- Yes?

793
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,620
Do I seem stuck to you?

794
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:38,961
How do you mean?

795
00:57:43,045 --> 00:57:45,715
Well, I, I guess
I wouldn't know, would I?

796
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:53,811
- Abbie?
- Yes?

797
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:57,274
Let's go out tonight.

798
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,980
I want to see this modern world.

799
00:58:04,191 --> 00:58:05,441
Can I come?

800
00:58:25,546 --> 00:58:28,756
I don't know if I'm gonna find
an appropriate man here.

801
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,427
Thank you.

802
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:43,652
What?

803
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:55,948
What was that?

804
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:58,332
What does that mean?

805
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:03,294
Oh... Um... Uh...

806
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:04,999
I mean you don't kiss a woman

807
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,420
unless you know
what you mean by it.

808
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:15,257
Aren't you sleeping with Abbie?

809
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:20,604
That's not something serious.
It's...

810
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,235
Then why do it?

811
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:58,807
<i>It's 1979.</i>

812
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:00,928
<i>I'm 55 years old.</i>

813
01:00:01,308 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>This is what my son believes in.</i>

814
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,309
<i>These people...</i>

815
01:00:06,188 --> 01:00:07,978
<i>with this hair...</i>

816
01:00:08,273 --> 01:00:09,443
<i>and these clothes...</i>

817
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:13,283
<i>making these gestures,</i>
making these sounds.

818
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,070
<i>It's 1979. I'm 55 years old,</i>

819
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:19,407
<i>and in 1999,</i>

820
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:22,372
<i>I will die of cancer from the smoking.</i>

821
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:29,089
Hey. Are you going?

822
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,005
Yeah.

823
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:35,757
Do me a favor.
Just take care of Abbie.

824
01:00:39,054 --> 01:00:42,014
<i>They don't know this is the end of punk.</i>

825
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:44,022
<i>They don't know</i>
that Reagan's coming.

826
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:46,984
<i>It's impossible to imagine</i>

827
01:00:47,062 --> 01:00:50,232
<i>that kids will stop</i>
dreaming about nuclear war,

828
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:52,654
<i>and have nightmares about the weather.</i>

829
01:00:53,986 --> 01:00:57,236
<i>It's impossible to imagine HIV,</i>

830
01:00:57,906 --> 01:00:59,906
<i>what will happen</i>
with skateboard tricks,

831
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,910
<i>the internet.</i>

832
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:04,702
You have a good time?

833
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:06,964
Yeah, it was interesting.

834
01:01:09,585 --> 01:01:11,135
So Abbie has your number, right?

835
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:14,053
- Yeah.
- Maybe you'll come over for dinner.

836
01:01:14,757 --> 01:01:15,797
I'd like that.

837
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:25,431
Kid.

838
01:01:28,562 --> 01:01:29,852
It's late.

839
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:32,940
How was it?

840
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:37,155
It was... life-changing.

841
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,633
<i>Before I die, I will prepare for Y2K.</i>

842
01:01:54,338 --> 01:01:57,338
<i>I put canned food and water</i>
in the garage.

843
01:01:57,841 --> 01:02:01,301
<i>I put $16,000 dollars' worth of gold coins</i>

844
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:05,216
<i>into a safe deposit box</i>
at the Bank of Montecito.

845
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:12,155
<i>I died before the new year,</i>

846
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:16,033
<i>Dolphin shaped balloons</i>
floated over my head.

847
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:19,491
<i>They were playing Louis Armstrong</i>
on a boom box.

848
01:02:33,919 --> 01:02:35,039
Jamie?

849
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:39,511
Hey, sorry. Are you awake?

850
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,091
I just wanted to tell you...

851
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:48,140
that you have to get out of this town
if you want to have any chance

852
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:50,105
of an interesting life moving forward.

853
01:02:50,477 --> 01:02:52,227
What happened?

854
01:02:54,898 --> 01:02:56,688
Sorry. Shit.

855
01:02:57,484 --> 01:02:59,074
We don't have sex.

856
01:03:00,237 --> 01:03:01,897
I just sleep here.

857
01:03:04,283 --> 01:03:05,783
Okay.

858
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:08,451
Can I lay down?

859
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:10,791
- We were sleeping.
- Just scoot over.

860
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:13,963
It's okay. I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.

861
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:19,920
So Lynette Winters spit on me,

862
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:21,047
<i>so then I hit her.</i>

863
01:03:21,592 --> 01:03:22,762
<i>Why'd she spit on you?</i>

864
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:24,303
<i>Because I spit on her,</i>

865
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:25,905
<i>right before</i>
I was going to New York

866
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:27,889
<i>and I thought I was never</i>
gonna come back.

867
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,720
<i>It felt very liberating at the time.</i>

868
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:31,138
- Fucking bitch!
- All right.

869
01:03:31,226 --> 01:03:33,386
<i>And somehow I ended up breaking a chair.</i>

870
01:03:36,023 --> 01:03:37,733
Hey, Julian, I'm sorry.

871
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:40,191
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

872
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:43,911
<i>And then William told me</i>

873
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:45,869
<i>he didn't want</i>
to sleep with me anymore.

874
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:48,533
What are you saying?
I don't like you!

875
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:50,159
I don't like you! I don't like...

876
01:03:51,622 --> 01:03:54,122
Just, just, I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.

877
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:59,547
Um, you cannot let her sleep here

878
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:02,418
if she's not having sex with you.

879
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:05,009
It's disempowering.

880
01:04:05,886 --> 01:04:07,596
Also, you need to get out of this town

881
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:12,306
before you start working
at a sunglasses shop.

882
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:16,734
I mean, it goes for you, too.

883
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:37,004
Jamie, um, here's some books
from a feminism class I took.

884
01:04:37,084 --> 01:04:38,424
I thought it would be helpful

885
01:04:38,752 --> 01:04:40,382
for you to get a woman's perspective.

886
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:41,672
What happened to your lip?

887
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:43,338
Oh, I got in a fight.

888
01:04:43,423 --> 01:04:44,883
- You want some apples?
- What?!

889
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,257
There was a fight.
It was... it was ridiculous.

890
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:49,224
Hold on, is that
<i>Our Bodies, Ourselves?</i>

891
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:50,855
Yes, it is.

892
01:04:51,014 --> 01:04:52,454
This was a really, really good book.

893
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:58,404
There's a really good chapter
on home... childbirths.

894
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:03,531
Home birth actually stunts
the baby's growth personality.

895
01:05:03,694 --> 01:05:06,114
What is a growth personality?

896
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:07,236
It's a real term.

897
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,164
"And who knows what it means
for a newborn

898
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:14,449
to see wood walls and carpeted floor

899
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:17,118
and to smell real human smells

900
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:20,577
and to feel wool
and cotton and flannel clothes

901
01:05:20,669 --> 01:05:25,839
instead of starchy, white, deodorized"
dot, dot, dot.

902
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:27,926
To me, that meant, like,
"And what else?"

903
01:05:36,977 --> 01:05:38,437
<i>Women's sexuality,</i>

904
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,770
<i>defined by men to benefit men,</i>

905
01:05:40,856 --> 01:05:43,146
<i>has been downgraded and perverted,</i>

906
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:44,823
<i>repressed and channeled.</i>

907
01:05:45,694 --> 01:05:48,864
<i>Anatomically, all orgasms</i>
are centered in the clitoris,

908
01:05:48,947 --> 01:05:50,867
<i>whether they result</i>
from direct manual pressure

909
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:52,119
<i>applied to the clitoris,</i>

910
01:05:52,784 --> 01:05:54,294
<i>indirect pressure resulting from...</i>

911
01:05:54,369 --> 01:05:56,079
Last night, I fucked Heather so hard,

912
01:05:56,163 --> 01:05:57,543
she came like, three times.

913
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:01,456
How did you stimulate her clitoris?

914
01:06:02,461 --> 01:06:04,051
With my dick.

915
01:06:06,006 --> 01:06:09,046
Women need
direct clitoral stimulation,

916
01:06:09,134 --> 01:06:12,804
like with fingers or a vibrator
or something.

917
01:06:13,805 --> 01:06:16,145
She probably faked it.
Women fake it all the time.

918
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:19,105
Talking Heads are a bunch of fags.

919
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:23,059
Actually, there's a girl in their band,

920
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:25,898
and she's dating the drummer,
so...

921
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:30,033
Your name's Jamie, right?

922
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:33,660
Fuckin' art fag.

923
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:45,293
So what was the fight about?

924
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,550
Clitoral stimulation.

925
01:06:54,137 --> 01:06:55,967
Why do you need to fight about that?

926
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,180
I don't know. I...

927
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,980
I wanna be a good guy, okay?

928
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:05,731
I just... want to be able
to satisfy a woman.

929
01:07:13,573 --> 01:07:15,953
Kid, I'm sure you will.

930
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:32,586
Shit.

931
01:07:34,052 --> 01:07:35,722
Jamie!

932
01:07:36,429 --> 01:07:37,759
That's not cool.

933
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:42,019
Yeah. That's what Matt called me
for liking the Talking Heads.

934
01:07:43,228 --> 01:07:44,518
Uh-huh.

935
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:48,113
And what is "Black Flag?"

936
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,403
It's a hard core band,

937
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:55,325
so the people who love Black Flag
hate the Talking Heads.

938
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:57,736
What?!

939
01:07:57,826 --> 01:08:00,996
The punk scene is very divisive.

940
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:06,174
Hey! You're all so advanced, aren't you?

941
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:10,127
The next time a dude
tells you a sex story,

942
01:08:10,213 --> 01:08:13,763
you just have to agree
with everything he says

943
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:15,802
and act like it's right, even if it's not,

944
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,970
because they don't
wanna be contradicted.

945
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:21,855
They just wanna live
in their fantasy lands.

946
01:08:24,186 --> 01:08:27,186
How are you doing... with everything?

947
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:45,496
Whatever you think your life
is going to be like,

948
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:49,422
just know it's not gonna be
anything like that.

949
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:54,378
Right.

950
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:11,896
Take me to that club.

951
01:09:17,322 --> 01:09:18,412
Tonight?

952
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:22,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

953
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,198
Wow, you look amazing.
Where you going?

954
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:28,121
We're just gonna go out.
Is that okay?

955
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,081
Well yeah, of course.
And, uh, where?

956
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:32,289
Just goin' out.

957
01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:36,223
- Bye.
- Bye!

958
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,860
Put that down.

959
01:09:57,696 --> 01:10:00,316
Hey, could I get a beer?

960
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:06,163
Now say, "I... I'm into older women."

961
01:10:06,538 --> 01:10:08,368
Just say it.

962
01:10:08,957 --> 01:10:10,577
I'm into older women.

963
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:11,707
Oh...

964
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,460
How old are you?

965
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:17,173
Age is a bourgeois construct.

966
01:10:18,466 --> 01:10:20,756
Age is a bourgeois construct.

967
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:22,888
That's a good answer.

968
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:25,143
Age is a bourgeois construct.

969
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:26,562
Okay, okay. You get it.

970
01:10:26,975 --> 01:10:29,985
Um, so now
if she asks you any questions,

971
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:33,021
you just say as little as possible, okay?

972
01:10:34,024 --> 01:10:36,484
Now show me
your most inscrutable face.

973
01:10:48,288 --> 01:10:50,288
I don't really make choices, when they...

974
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,040
about...

975
01:10:52,751 --> 01:10:54,211
about women. They just...

976
01:10:55,378 --> 01:10:56,378
They come to you.

977
01:10:57,505 --> 01:11:00,425
That... that's...
You could have more than that.

978
01:11:03,428 --> 01:11:05,218
But what about you? Why...

979
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:08,771
I mean, what happened to Jamie's dad?

980
01:11:11,436 --> 01:11:14,266
Well...

981
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:19,233
He just, no... He just didn't turn out like
I thought he would.

982
01:11:21,363 --> 01:11:22,403
I guess that happens.

983
01:11:23,406 --> 01:11:25,526
There must have been
something good about him.

984
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:31,656
Um, he was left-handed.

985
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:35,502
That's it? That's it?

986
01:11:35,585 --> 01:11:37,805
Yes, and I was right-handed.

987
01:11:38,463 --> 01:11:39,513
And so in the morning,

988
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:43,513
we would look at
the stock reports together,

989
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:45,509
and...

990
01:11:47,472 --> 01:11:48,792
he could write with his left-hand

991
01:11:48,848 --> 01:11:51,518
and scratch my back
with his right.

992
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,439
And that's it?

993
01:11:58,316 --> 01:11:59,476
I loved that.

994
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,320
Do you ever meditate?

995
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,700
Uh...

996
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:11,753
I feel the air,

997
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:14,254
coolness of the air
goes through my nose.

998
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:17,788
All I'm really doing is...

999
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:20,631
bringing my attention

1000
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:24,173
back to my breath.

1001
01:12:24,342 --> 01:12:26,842
So when I take a breath in...

1002
01:12:27,804 --> 01:12:29,354
there's a feeling.

1003
01:12:30,306 --> 01:12:32,056
It's air going in.

1004
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:35,351
It's air going out.

1005
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:37,442
It's a good feeling.

1006
01:12:43,862 --> 01:12:46,072
No, it's okay. Go ahead.
I'm just gonna...

1007
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:50,407
Go ahead.

1008
01:12:51,035 --> 01:12:52,795
I'm just gonna smoke.

1009
01:12:54,122 --> 01:12:55,412
I'm listening.

1010
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,502
All right, I wanna get
on the same page.

1011
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:01,502
You are such...

1012
01:13:01,963 --> 01:13:05,263
How did you get to be
this person that you are?

1013
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:08,761
It's so... You're so unusual.

1014
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,310
<i>William's dad managed</i>

1015
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,020
<i>an auto repair shop in Cleveland.</i>

1016
01:13:15,435 --> 01:13:18,695
<i>Engines always made sense to him.</i>

1017
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:21,651
<i>He tried</i>
to put himself through college,

1018
01:13:21,733 --> 01:13:23,613
<i>but couldn't afford it.</i>

1019
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,490
<i>He met Theresa in 1963.</i>

1020
01:13:30,575 --> 01:13:33,455
<i>She was smart, brave, better off.</i>

1021
01:13:33,536 --> 01:13:34,576
<i>They were in love.</i>

1022
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:36,251
<i>They'd move to Oakland,</i>

1023
01:13:36,456 --> 01:13:38,786
<i>then to a commune in Sebastopol.</i>

1024
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:41,005
Well, I learned to be like them, you know?

1025
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:42,135
And... as it turns out,

1026
01:13:43,755 --> 01:13:45,845
it's a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

1027
01:13:45,924 --> 01:13:48,884
But it wasn't really me
I was doing it for...

1028
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:53,065
so that I wouldn't lose Theresa.

1029
01:13:54,307 --> 01:13:55,807
<i>He started talking like them,</i>

1030
01:13:55,892 --> 01:13:56,932
<i>looking like them,</i>

1031
01:13:57,435 --> 01:14:01,065
<i>but they made him feel old</i>
and uneducated and poor.

1032
01:14:01,731 --> 01:14:03,271
<i>Theresa started thinking</i>

1033
01:14:03,358 --> 01:14:05,858
<i>William was uptight and possessive</i>
and she left him.

1034
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:08,358
<i>After Theresa,</i>

1035
01:14:08,446 --> 01:14:10,446
<i>women didn't have to look</i>
one way or the other,

1036
01:14:10,532 --> 01:14:11,572
<i>or be a certain way.</i>

1037
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:17,369
<i>I think that I just...</i>

1038
01:14:18,623 --> 01:14:19,673
<i>I want to win them over</i>

1039
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:21,628
<i>so that I won't be lonely.</i>

1040
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:23,752
You live here?

1041
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,460
I do.

1042
01:14:25,588 --> 01:14:27,088
<i>But once I have them,</i>

1043
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:30,012
<i>I don't really know</i>
what to do with them.

1044
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:39,772
You wanna do something later?

1045
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:42,652
You're sweet.

1046
01:14:43,606 --> 01:14:45,146
I should go.

1047
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:49,149
<i>What he likes is making bowls.</i>

1048
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:51,361
<i>He doesn't smell like oil and grease.</i>

1049
01:14:51,447 --> 01:14:53,777
<i>His hands don't look like</i>
dumb mechanic's hands.

1050
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:56,290
<i>I was using the smaller bowls for a while.</i>

1051
01:14:56,369 --> 01:14:58,539
<i>Um, and then I was kind of feeling</i>
like I needed

1052
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,751
<i>to beat the crap</i>
out of some stuff, so...

1053
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:05,461
And when it gets a little bit drier,

1054
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:07,425
you spray everything away.

1055
01:15:08,381 --> 01:15:09,551
Wow.

1056
01:15:10,258 --> 01:15:11,298
It's beautiful.

1057
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:18,685
What?

1058
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:22,444
Did you fix it?

1059
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:23,810
Um...

1060
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:24,936
Well, maybe...

1061
01:15:25,523 --> 01:15:29,443
It's, uh, part Vol... Volkswagen now.
I had to imp... improvise.

1062
01:15:56,888 --> 01:15:59,508
And how are you gonna get to know
a person way over there?

1063
01:16:01,017 --> 01:16:03,187
What am...
What am I supposed to do?

1064
01:16:04,062 --> 01:16:06,652
Well, just make a little small talk

1065
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:09,864
and introduce yourself, ask her to dance.

1066
01:16:10,902 --> 01:16:13,112
Okay. Hello, I'm William.

1067
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:14,913
- Hello.
- Hello.

1068
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,410
- Um, I live downstairs.
- Oh, yeah.

1069
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,870
I'm the one with the cars.

1070
01:16:19,994 --> 01:16:21,504
Would you like to dance with me?

1071
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:24,958
- Yes. Sure.
- Okay.

1072
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:26,211
Put your hand out, right?

1073
01:16:27,085 --> 01:16:28,215
Put the other hand here.

1074
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:30,635
And just be there.

1075
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:33,383
She just wants a little company.

1076
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:35,804
Oh.

1077
01:16:36,803 --> 01:16:38,143
Okay.

1078
01:16:40,723 --> 01:16:42,273
That's nice.

1079
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:17,881
I... I feel like I... I understand you.

1080
01:17:19,721 --> 01:17:21,051
We should get away from here.

1081
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:23,139
Just... just me and you, you know?

1082
01:17:23,808 --> 01:17:26,598
Go up the coast, be alone somewhere.

1083
01:17:28,354 --> 01:17:30,654
Jamie, you're in love with Julie.

1084
01:17:35,778 --> 01:17:37,398
You can't let her push you around.

1085
01:17:38,364 --> 01:17:40,534
You have to tell her what you want.

1086
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:53,208
...if you, if you were to listen to it...

1087
01:17:53,296 --> 01:17:54,296
Right.

1088
01:17:54,672 --> 01:17:56,512
What does... what does that mean?

1089
01:17:56,591 --> 01:17:58,431
"Art Fag?" I mean what does...

1090
01:17:58,509 --> 01:18:03,259
If you were to think about it
from more like a sociological perspective,

1091
01:18:03,347 --> 01:18:05,597
what does that come from? "Art Fag."

1092
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:06,744
- I think we...
- What is that?

1093
01:18:06,768 --> 01:18:09,308
- Abbie understands it.
- Abbie does not understand it.

1094
01:18:09,687 --> 01:18:11,727
She's just a part of it.

1095
01:18:26,704 --> 01:18:28,624
You don't need to like it.

1096
01:18:29,207 --> 01:18:30,867
Okay, what is he saying?

1097
01:18:33,419 --> 01:18:35,499
"Head on my shoulders..."

1098
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,880
"Going berserk..."

1099
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:40,841
Right.

1100
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,050
Is that interesting?

1101
01:18:42,428 --> 01:18:43,468
I don't know.

1102
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:44,928
I don't know either.

1103
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:47,725
I think we're maybe over-thinking this.

1104
01:19:03,866 --> 01:19:05,776
Let's try the Art Fag one.

1105
01:19:08,412 --> 01:19:10,332
Here come the Art Fags.

1106
01:19:14,377 --> 01:19:15,377
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:19:33,062 --> 01:19:34,562
All right, you ready?

1108
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:38,533
That's it.

1109
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:43,783
I guess we're more the Art Fag type.

1110
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,740
Uh-huh.

1111
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:47,285
I like that.

1122
01:20:31,871 --> 01:20:33,041
<i>I gave him beer,</i>

1123
01:20:33,456 --> 01:20:38,206
<i>and then I... I taught him</i>
how to verbally seduce women,

1124
01:20:38,294 --> 01:20:42,014
<i>and we drove drunk,</i>
but I stopped that,

1125
01:20:42,381 --> 01:20:43,551
and then he kissed Trish.

1126
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:47,511
And then we walked home.

1127
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:51,177
Ah.

1128
01:20:57,271 --> 01:20:58,941
You're not mad?

1129
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:01,399
You're mad.

1130
01:21:07,907 --> 01:21:12,117
You get to see him out in the world
as a person.

1131
01:21:13,037 --> 01:21:14,827
I never will.

1132
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,670
Just...

1133
01:21:32,056 --> 01:21:33,136
There.

1134
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:07,471
<i>I can't believe Abbie gave you this book.</i>

1135
01:22:09,385 --> 01:22:10,725
<i>It's interesting.</i>

1136
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:16,637
What's it like... for girls?

1137
01:22:16,809 --> 01:22:19,729
What? Sex?

1138
01:22:22,106 --> 01:22:23,516
Orgasms.

1139
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:29,151
Do you really want to know
what it's like?

1140
01:22:32,283 --> 01:22:33,623
Yeah.

1141
01:22:35,077 --> 01:22:36,657
I don't have them.

1142
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:40,122
What?

1143
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,043
None of my friends do.

1144
01:22:45,963 --> 01:22:47,463
Then why do you do it?

1145
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,220
There's other reasons.

1146
01:22:50,593 --> 01:22:53,053
You know, like the way
that he looks at you...

1147
01:22:56,474 --> 01:22:59,274
or the way they get a little
bit desperate at some point.

1148
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:03,733
And the little sounds that they make.

1149
01:23:17,244 --> 01:23:19,204
And their bodies...

1150
01:23:21,248 --> 01:23:24,328
'cause you don't exactly know
what they're gonna look like...

1151
01:23:25,961 --> 01:23:28,461
<i>or smell or feel like...</i>

1152
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:31,934
<i>until you do it.</i>

1153
01:23:36,138 --> 01:23:39,058
<i>But, yeah...</i>
half the time I regret it.

1154
01:23:42,853 --> 01:23:44,813
Then why do you do it?

1155
01:23:47,191 --> 01:23:49,071
'Cause half the time, I don't regret it.

1156
01:24:00,788 --> 01:24:02,408
<i>"I am gregarious.</i>

1157
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:03,538
<i>Interested in others.</i>

1158
01:24:04,124 --> 01:24:05,294
<i>And I think, intelligent.</i>

1159
01:24:10,381 --> 01:24:12,471
<i>All I ask is to get to know people</i>

1160
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,550
<i>and to have them interested</i>
in knowing me.

1161
01:24:15,177 --> 01:24:16,847
<i>I doubt whether I would marry again</i>

1162
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:19,847
<i>and live that close</i>
to another individual,

1163
01:24:19,932 --> 01:24:22,272
<i>but I remain invisible.</i>

1164
01:24:23,227 --> 01:24:25,267
<i>Don't pretend for a minute</i>
as you look at me,

1165
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:28,188
<i>that I am not as alive as you are,</i>

1166
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:31,899
<i>and I do not suffer from the category</i>
to which you are forcing me.

1167
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:38,366
<i>I think, stripped down,</i>
I look more attractive

1168
01:24:38,701 --> 01:24:40,621
<i>than my ex-husband...</i>

1169
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,870
<i>...but I am sexually and socially obsolete</i>
and he is not.

1170
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:49,589
I have a capacity now for
taking people as they are,

1171
01:24:49,837 --> 01:24:50,877
which I lacked at 20.

1172
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:56,052
I reach orgasm in half the time
and I know how to please,

1173
01:24:56,135 --> 01:25:00,015
yet I do not even dare show a man
that I find him attractive.

1174
01:25:00,431 --> 01:25:03,981
If I do, he may react
as if I have insulted him.

1175
01:25:06,061 --> 01:25:09,901
I'm supposed to fulfill my small functions
and vanish."

1176
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,320
Well...

1177
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,870
What do you think of all that?

1178
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:26,212
I don't know. Maybe I'm a feminist.

1179
01:25:32,171 --> 01:25:33,171
So...

1180
01:25:38,344 --> 01:25:40,304
You think that's me.

1181
01:25:41,055 --> 01:25:42,685
No, I don't know.

1182
01:25:44,183 --> 01:25:46,683
So you think you know me better
because you read that?

1183
01:25:46,977 --> 01:25:48,477
No, no.

1184
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:54,320
Then why are you reading it to me?

1185
01:25:57,154 --> 01:26:00,284
Um, I thought it was interesting.

1186
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:08,036
Okay, well...

1187
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:13,879
I... I don't need a book
to know about myself.

1188
01:26:21,845 --> 01:26:23,265
Sorry.

1189
01:26:39,738 --> 01:26:42,198
<i>I mean, I appreciate you trying to help.</i>

1190
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:45,452
<i>I do. I just think</i>
you're taking it too far.

1191
01:26:45,703 --> 01:26:46,743
This stuff with,

1192
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:50,118
you know, the women's movement
I respect,

1193
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:52,577
but it's just, it's complicated

1194
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:54,588
and I think it's too much for him.

1195
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:57,110
What are... I don't know what
it is that you're talking about.

1196
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:59,802
- Okay. He's a 15-year-old boy.
- I know.

1197
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:02,263
You're giving him hard core
feminism, and it-it...

1198
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:04,608
But he really loves it, and it's really...

1199
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,560
- It's helping him...
- Helping him what?

1200
01:27:07,307 --> 01:27:08,618
It's helping him
become a man, th...

1201
01:27:08,642 --> 01:27:10,122
What you were talking about. It's like...

1202
01:27:10,144 --> 01:27:12,694
Learning about a female orgasm
is helping him be a man?

1203
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,436
Well, what man do you know
that cares anything about that?

1204
01:27:15,524 --> 01:27:17,234
- Look, he's...
- I mean that's a miracle.

1205
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:18,857
But he is a high school kid, okay?

1206
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:22,239
It's too much. I'm telling you.

1207
01:27:25,325 --> 01:27:27,585
I think he seems really okay with it.

1208
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:31,961
You know you don't actually know
what you're doing with him?

1209
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:38,763
Okay? So... just...

1210
01:27:41,508 --> 01:27:43,298
<i>As you know,</i>

1211
01:27:43,385 --> 01:27:47,565
<i>there is a growing</i>
disrespect for government,

1212
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:49,969
<i>for schools, the news media</i>

1213
01:27:50,142 --> 01:27:51,272
<i>and other institutions.</i>

1214
01:27:52,519 --> 01:27:56,729
<i>This is not a message</i>
of happiness or reassurance.

1215
01:27:57,316 --> 01:27:59,276
<i>But it is the truth</i>

1216
01:27:59,568 --> 01:28:01,398
<i>and it is a warning.</i>

1217
01:28:02,738 --> 01:28:04,278
It is a crisis... of confidence.

1218
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:09,335
<i>We can see this crisis</i>

1219
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:12,827
<i>in the growing doubt</i>
about the meaning of our own lives

1220
01:28:13,457 --> 01:28:15,117
<i>and in the loss of a unity of purpose</i>

1221
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,090
<i>for our nation.</i>

1222
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:20,670
<i>Too many of us now</i>

1223
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:26,589
<i>tend to worship self-indulgence</i>
and consumption.

1224
01:28:27,387 --> 01:28:28,427
<i>But we've discovered</i>

1225
01:28:29,431 --> 01:28:31,561
<i>that owning things</i>
and consuming things...

1226
01:28:34,186 --> 01:28:35,226
<i>does not satisfy</i>

1227
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:39,266
<i>our longing for meaning.</i>

1228
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:42,900
<i>We always believed...</i>

1229
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:46,776
<i>that we were part</i>
of a great movement

1230
01:28:46,865 --> 01:28:47,915
<i>of humanity itself...</i>

1231
01:28:49,326 --> 01:28:52,366
<i>involved in a search for freedom.</i>

1232
01:28:57,417 --> 01:29:00,877
<i>We are at a turning point</i>
in our history.

1233
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,470
<i>The path that leads to fragmentation</i>
and self-interest.

1234
01:29:08,804 --> 01:29:12,684
<i>Down that road lies</i>
a mistaken idea of freedom.

1235
01:29:14,643 --> 01:29:18,313
<i>It is a certain route to failure.</i>

1236
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:22,979
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

1237
01:29:25,112 --> 01:29:27,492
Wow. He is so screwed.

1238
01:29:28,365 --> 01:29:29,415
No shit.

1239
01:29:29,867 --> 01:29:31,447
It's over for him.

1240
01:29:32,661 --> 01:29:35,001
I thought that was beautiful.

1241
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:40,706
Well, why didn't you just say,
"I'm sorry, I'm done?"

1242
01:29:41,086 --> 01:29:42,126
My pride.

1243
01:29:42,504 --> 01:29:43,674
- I know.
- Yeah, it's...

1244
01:29:43,797 --> 01:29:46,417
You didn't seem like a prideful person.
You seem humble.

1245
01:29:46,508 --> 01:29:50,048
I left my pride outside today.

1246
01:29:51,138 --> 01:29:53,308
Jamie, would you please wake up Abbie?

1247
01:29:55,517 --> 01:29:58,767
- Yeah. Abbie?
- No, stop it. I'm menstruating.

1248
01:30:00,355 --> 01:30:01,405
Abbie, you know what?

1249
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,650
You're menstruating. Okay.
But do you have to say it?

1250
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:09,031
Okay? And do we really need to know
everything that's going on with you?

1251
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:11,698
What? I'm menstruating.

1252
01:30:12,326 --> 01:30:13,366
Why is that a big deal?

1253
01:30:13,577 --> 01:30:16,247
We don't need to hear about that.
Thank you.

1254
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:20,004
If you ever want to have
an adult relationship with a woman,

1255
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:22,423
like if you want to have sex
with a woman's vagina,

1256
01:30:22,628 --> 01:30:23,838
you need to be comfortable

1257
01:30:24,254 --> 01:30:27,304
with the fact
that the vagina menstruates,

1258
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,552
and just say menstruation.
It's not a big deal.

1259
01:30:29,635 --> 01:30:33,355
So start saying it now.
Menstruation.

1260
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:37,269
- Now?
- Yes. Menstruation.

1261
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:39,016
Menstruation.

1262
01:30:39,311 --> 01:30:41,271
Jamie, no, you don't have to.

1263
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,041
You're saying it like you're scared.

1264
01:30:43,065 --> 01:30:44,255
- Don't say it like you're scared.
- Abbie.

1265
01:30:44,274 --> 01:30:46,284
- Say it like it's normal.
- Menstruation.

1266
01:30:46,526 --> 01:30:48,106
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.

1267
01:30:48,195 --> 01:30:52,115
Not bad. Julian, menstruation.
You can say it. Right now.

1268
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:55,831
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, men... menstruation.

1269
01:30:56,161 --> 01:30:58,911
Just keep eye contact with me.
What... Who are you looking at?

1270
01:30:58,997 --> 01:31:01,207
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.

1271
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:03,001
Yeah, that's right. Menstruation.

1272
01:31:03,168 --> 01:31:05,998
Charlie, you're quiet. Menstruation?

1273
01:31:06,088 --> 01:31:07,298
Menstruation?

1274
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:09,671
No, not like a question. Menstruation.

1275
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:13,010
- Menstruation.
- Now everybody say it together.

1276
01:31:13,595 --> 01:31:15,225
Menstruation.

1277
01:31:15,347 --> 01:31:18,597
Like gentle, happy, but casual.
And...

1278
01:31:18,976 --> 01:31:20,016
Menstruation.

1279
01:31:20,519 --> 01:31:21,559
It's gross, Abbie.

1280
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,770
No, it's... it's not gross.
It's a very deep time creatively,

1281
01:31:25,941 --> 01:31:28,401
and it's emotionally transformative.

1282
01:31:29,111 --> 01:31:30,651
And sex during menstruation

1283
01:31:31,363 --> 01:31:33,073
can be very pleasurable for a woman.

1284
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,330
It can even, like,
relieve some of the cramps.

1285
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:39,580
Jamie, I also wanna say never
have sex with just the vagina.

1286
01:31:39,663 --> 01:31:41,303
You have to have sex
with the whole woman.

1287
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,998
That's slightly off topic
of what I'm talking about.

1288
01:31:45,043 --> 01:31:46,093
You too? You too, William?

1289
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:47,999
- I mean... Thank you.
- But that's okay.

1290
01:31:48,422 --> 01:31:50,512
The first time that I got my period,

1291
01:31:50,757 --> 01:31:51,797
I was watching

1292
01:31:52,676 --> 01:31:54,136
<i>One That Flew</i>
Over the Cuckoo's Nest

1293
01:31:54,219 --> 01:31:55,259
with some guy.

1294
01:31:55,721 --> 01:31:57,141
And, um...

1295
01:31:57,639 --> 01:31:59,519
Yeah, I just told him
that I had to leave,

1296
01:32:00,225 --> 01:32:03,605
so I went to the market
and I bought a box of tampons,

1297
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:06,307
and I read the instructions
on the box and I put one in...

1298
01:32:06,523 --> 01:32:08,213
- Julie?
- and I never told my mom about it,

1299
01:32:08,233 --> 01:32:10,533
but she never asked, so it didn't matter.

1300
01:32:11,695 --> 01:32:14,535
And I never saw the end
of the <i>Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

1301
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:20,294
Jack Nicholson got a lobotomy,
and so the big Indian guy

1302
01:32:20,537 --> 01:32:22,577
smothered him with a pillow
so that he could,

1303
01:32:22,664 --> 01:32:23,794
you know, be free and...

1304
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,521
Okay, let's talk about
something else.

1305
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,171
- Would you mind?
- When I was 14,

1306
01:32:27,252 --> 01:32:28,592
I had sex for the first time.

1307
01:32:28,754 --> 01:32:29,804
Julie!

1308
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,381
Julie, please. You... Honey...

1309
01:32:32,049 --> 01:32:34,839
I decided one night
that I was just gonna lose my virginity.

1310
01:32:35,052 --> 01:32:36,262
I didn't care who it was to.

1311
01:32:36,553 --> 01:32:39,013
- Julie, you gotta calm down.
- Stop it. Let her talk.

1312
01:32:39,264 --> 01:32:41,564
I picked this guy that
I didn't know at a party...

1313
01:32:42,309 --> 01:32:46,439
and we had fairly painful sex in his van.

1314
01:32:46,521 --> 01:32:48,061
It was just parked on the street.

1315
01:32:48,774 --> 01:32:50,444
He just used spit for lubrication.

1316
01:32:53,695 --> 01:32:55,655
I made it home on time
for curfew, though.

1317
01:32:55,822 --> 01:32:58,572
His carpet smelled
like spilled bong water.

1318
01:33:04,247 --> 01:33:05,407
Okay, um...

1319
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,540
let's call it a night. All right?

1320
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:10,708
Thanks all for coming.
Show's over, girls.

1321
01:33:12,339 --> 01:33:14,049
Thank you so much for coming.

1322
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:18,263
Jamie, we need to talk.

1323
01:33:19,012 --> 01:33:20,972
There's a lot of stuff happening, right?

1324
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,430
And I just would like to know
what's going on with you.

1325
01:33:26,353 --> 01:33:28,903
I mean, I know this has all been
a lot for us to deal with.

1326
01:33:30,649 --> 01:33:33,319
Mom, I'm dealing
with everything right now.

1327
01:33:33,902 --> 01:33:36,282
You are dealing with nothing.

1328
01:33:49,709 --> 01:33:51,839
I can't believe you told
everyone all that.

1329
01:33:52,963 --> 01:33:54,963
I can say what I want to say.

1330
01:33:57,175 --> 01:33:58,845
They're gonna think you're some...

1331
01:33:59,803 --> 01:34:01,723
They're gonna get
the wrong idea about you.

1332
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:02,855
What?

1333
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,930
That I'm a slut?

1334
01:34:07,519 --> 01:34:08,889
Is that what you think?

1335
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,403
You can't sleep here anymore...

1336
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:17,989
and just want to talk.

1337
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:23,453
Really?

1338
01:34:26,163 --> 01:34:27,583
Yeah.

1339
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:32,746
Jamie.

1340
01:34:37,966 --> 01:34:39,466
I'm sorry.

1341
01:34:43,722 --> 01:34:46,182
I am sorry, okay?

1342
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,650
Let's... let's just get out of here.

1343
01:34:55,108 --> 01:34:58,738
Let's go up the coast like...
like you said that we would.

1344
01:35:00,906 --> 01:35:01,946
Just the two of us.

1345
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,960
<i>Mom...</i>

1346
01:35:12,918 --> 01:35:14,708
<i>Julie and I took the car.</i>

1347
01:35:16,838 --> 01:35:18,588
<i>We're taking a trip up the coast...</i>

1348
01:35:19,841 --> 01:35:21,591
<i>just to get away.</i>

1349
01:35:22,552 --> 01:35:24,092
<i>You don't need to worry about us.</i>

1350
01:36:22,529 --> 01:36:24,359
Hey, do you think
that you could, um...

1351
01:36:25,657 --> 01:36:27,367
buy us some, like, wine coolers?

1352
01:36:27,993 --> 01:36:29,123
You can keep the change.

1353
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,870
Strawberry or anything berry, really.

1354
01:36:42,841 --> 01:36:43,881
Hi. What's the matter?

1355
01:36:44,259 --> 01:36:45,299
Hi.

1356
01:36:45,594 --> 01:36:47,974
You changed lanes
in the intersection back there.

1357
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,220
Seriously? That's all?

1358
01:36:51,224 --> 01:36:53,354
I need to see your license
and registration.

1359
01:36:54,352 --> 01:36:57,022
Well, what if I don't have my license?

1360
01:36:58,648 --> 01:37:00,751
Okay, well what's your name,
address and date of birth?

1361
01:37:00,775 --> 01:37:01,825
Do you have that?

1362
01:37:01,985 --> 01:37:04,155
You know,
those are very personal questions,

1363
01:37:04,529 --> 01:37:05,569
and we've just met.

1364
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:09,369
What's your name?
What's your address, right?

1365
01:37:09,451 --> 01:37:11,411
I mean, it's a little forward.

1366
01:37:38,938 --> 01:37:41,398
I, uh, I love you.

1367
01:37:49,407 --> 01:37:50,947
What's wrong?

1368
01:37:51,868 --> 01:37:52,988
Nothing.

1369
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,173
Tell me.

1370
01:38:05,048 --> 01:38:07,758
I think that I'm too close to you...

1371
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:10,678
to have sex with you.

1372
01:38:13,181 --> 01:38:15,021
I know it's confusing.

1373
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,270
I'm sorry.

1374
01:38:23,024 --> 01:38:24,364
I can...

1375
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:26,651
I can help you get over that.

1376
01:38:29,906 --> 01:38:32,026
I don't want to get over that.

1377
01:38:34,911 --> 01:38:36,041
Yes, you do.

1378
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:39,502
You're being like the other guys.

1379
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:42,251
I don't wanna just have sex with you.

1380
01:38:43,253 --> 01:38:44,383
I want you.

1381
01:38:45,088 --> 01:38:47,088
But it's your version of me.

1382
01:38:49,217 --> 01:38:50,627
It's not me.

1383
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:55,006
It would be a lot better
if you just wanted sex.

1384
01:38:56,141 --> 01:38:57,851
You are exactly like the other guys.

1385
01:38:59,018 --> 01:39:01,478
You just seem like you're all modern.

1386
01:39:14,409 --> 01:39:16,029
Jamie.

1387
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:19,080
Jamie.

1388
01:39:19,914 --> 01:39:20,964
Jamie!

1389
01:39:52,071 --> 01:39:54,991
These people have no sense of humor.

1390
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:15,761
Having a kid seems like...

1391
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:18,966
the hardest thing.

1392
01:40:20,683 --> 01:40:22,023
Yeah.

1393
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:25,481
How much you love the kid...

1394
01:40:29,943 --> 01:40:32,493
You're just pretty much screwed.

1395
01:40:44,749 --> 01:40:46,749
- Well, it's good for you.
- Hi. Uh...

1396
01:40:46,835 --> 01:40:47,965
Hey.

1397
01:40:48,878 --> 01:40:50,998
Julie just called me.
They're in San Louis Obispo.

1398
01:40:51,089 --> 01:40:52,419
She doesn't know where he is.

1399
01:40:52,674 --> 01:40:54,054
She can't find him.

1400
01:40:55,218 --> 01:40:57,048
- I... Would you drive me...
- Yes, I will.

1401
01:40:57,303 --> 01:40:58,763
- ...up there?
- Yep. Let's go.

1402
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,600
- Will you come?
- Yes.

1403
01:41:45,143 --> 01:41:46,773
I'm sorry.

1404
01:41:51,608 --> 01:41:53,188
He came back.

1405
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:55,989
He's right there.

1406
01:41:57,864 --> 01:42:00,244
Okay. Okay.

1407
01:42:04,287 --> 01:42:05,697
It's okay.

1408
01:42:28,478 --> 01:42:29,728
Well...

1409
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:32,019
Julie's a pretty complicated woman.

1410
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,781
It's a lot to take on,

1411
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:37,029
but I'm impressed in a way.

1412
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:40,318
Whatever.

1413
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,078
Aren't you gonna get Julie...

1414
01:42:52,877 --> 01:42:53,997
to come talk with me?

1415
01:42:54,587 --> 01:42:56,087
Jamie!

1416
01:42:56,255 --> 01:42:57,305
What?

1417
01:42:57,757 --> 01:42:59,337
I... I thought they'd help.

1418
01:43:00,802 --> 01:43:04,302
Well, it just seemed like you
couldn't deal with me anymore.

1419
01:43:06,557 --> 01:43:07,927
Look.

1420
01:43:08,726 --> 01:43:12,476
I wanted... I...
I...

1421
01:43:13,314 --> 01:43:14,694
Look, I...

1422
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,240
I don't want you to end up
in the same place as me.

1423
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:23,366
What does that mean?

1424
01:43:24,409 --> 01:43:26,739
Well, I wanted you to be happier.

1425
01:43:28,913 --> 01:43:32,923
And I just didn't think
I could do it by myself. I...

1426
01:43:36,379 --> 01:43:37,589
Okay.

1427
01:43:39,632 --> 01:43:41,842
I thought we were fine, though,
just me and you.

1428
01:43:48,975 --> 01:43:50,355
Yeah?

1429
01:43:52,729 --> 01:43:54,099
Yeah.

1430
01:44:27,305 --> 01:44:29,105
Okay. Come on.

1431
01:44:29,223 --> 01:44:30,603
Come on. Dance with your mom.

1432
01:45:29,826 --> 01:45:30,866
- Bye.
- Bye.

1433
01:45:31,494 --> 01:45:32,624
Bye.

1434
01:45:34,497 --> 01:45:35,537
- Be safe.
- Bye.

1435
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:37,500
Bye. Bye.

1436
01:45:47,176 --> 01:45:49,506
So maybe we don't go back yet.

1437
01:45:52,473 --> 01:45:53,523
Okay.

1438
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:05,940
Were you and Dad ever in love?

1439
01:46:06,612 --> 01:46:08,032
Sure.

1440
01:46:13,536 --> 01:46:15,116
Or, um...

1441
01:46:16,414 --> 01:46:17,464
Maybe I was just...

1442
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:21,962
I felt I was supposed to be in love.

1443
01:46:23,045 --> 01:46:25,965
Or I was...

1444
01:46:26,173 --> 01:46:28,843
I was scared I'd never be in love...

1445
01:46:30,928 --> 01:46:32,968
so I... I...

1446
01:46:34,557 --> 01:46:37,387
I just picked
the best solution at the time.

1447
01:46:48,362 --> 01:46:49,992
I wanna bleach my hair.

1448
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:53,533
Kid... really?

1449
01:46:54,452 --> 01:46:55,872
Yeah.

1450
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,800
Okay.

1451
01:47:10,968 --> 01:47:12,468
Are you lonely?

1452
01:47:13,721 --> 01:47:14,761
Well...

1453
01:47:15,556 --> 01:47:18,636
I might marry Bogart in my next life.

1454
01:47:19,101 --> 01:47:20,141
We'll see.

1455
01:47:20,353 --> 01:47:21,393
I'm thinking about it.

1456
01:47:22,605 --> 01:47:24,525
Uh, he's dead.

1457
01:47:25,775 --> 01:47:27,285
Well...

1458
01:47:27,902 --> 01:47:29,192
This is my next life, right?

1459
01:47:30,196 --> 01:47:31,606
So...

1460
01:47:32,657 --> 01:47:33,697
he may be there.

1461
01:47:33,783 --> 01:47:36,993
He may be around
and we might meet and...

1462
01:47:38,329 --> 01:47:40,829
something might happen between us.

1463
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:44,576
Okay, um...

1464
01:47:45,461 --> 01:47:47,301
you can't have it in the real world?

1465
01:47:47,922 --> 01:47:50,052
Hey. This is no time
to be rational, sweetie.

1466
01:47:50,925 --> 01:47:52,095
Can you just go with this?

1467
01:47:53,552 --> 01:47:54,592
Yeah. Keep going.

1468
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:56,601
Okay.

1469
01:47:57,515 --> 01:47:59,145
So he... he knows what I'm thinking,

1470
01:48:01,018 --> 01:48:03,018
and he makes me laugh...

1471
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,690
and he really sees me...

1472
01:48:08,025 --> 01:48:11,865
and you know that he's gonna
do what he says he's gonna do,

1473
01:48:11,946 --> 01:48:14,486
so that's easy.

1474
01:48:15,449 --> 01:48:17,279
He sounds nice.

1475
01:48:18,577 --> 01:48:19,617
Yeah.

1476
01:48:27,336 --> 01:48:28,563
<i>I thought that was just the beginning</i>

1477
01:48:28,587 --> 01:48:30,207
<i>of a new relationship with her...</i>

1478
01:48:32,216 --> 01:48:34,426
<i>where she'd really tell me stuff...</i>

1479
01:48:36,804 --> 01:48:39,564
<i>but maybe it was</i>
never really like that again.

1480
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:42,978
<i>Maybe that was it.</i>

1481
01:48:44,729 --> 01:48:46,599
<i>In March of 1999,</i>

1482
01:48:47,189 --> 01:48:49,479
<i>I'll start to feel tired and confused.</i>

1483
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:52,109
<i>When I finally go to the doctor,</i>

1484
01:48:52,361 --> 01:48:54,151
<i>he will say that the cancer</i>
in my lungs

1485
01:48:54,947 --> 01:48:58,827
<i>had already traveled</i>
to my breast and brain.

1486
01:48:59,493 --> 01:49:02,373
<i>I'll try to teach Jamie</i>
what to do with my stocks,

1487
01:49:02,455 --> 01:49:06,175
<i>but my instructions will be</i>
impossible to understand.

1488
01:49:11,964 --> 01:49:13,634
See you later.

1489
01:49:20,056 --> 01:49:23,096
<i>Abbie will take me</i>
to Planned Parenthood...

1490
01:49:23,893 --> 01:49:25,813
<i>and I will go on the pill.</i>

1491
01:49:29,815 --> 01:49:31,825
<i>I will go to NYU</i>

1492
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:33,901
<i>and lose touch with Jamie</i>
and Dorothea...

1493
01:49:35,738 --> 01:49:38,108
<i>and I will stop talking to my mom.</i>

1494
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:41,368
<i>I will fall in love with Nicholas...</i>

1495
01:49:42,578 --> 01:49:44,498
<i>and we'll move to Paris...</i>

1496
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,333
<i>and choose not to have children.</i>

1497
01:49:49,627 --> 01:49:51,957
<i>I will stay in Santa Barbara.</i>

1498
01:49:52,463 --> 01:49:54,133
<i>In just two years,</i>
I'll marry Dave.

1499
01:49:56,092 --> 01:49:57,382
<i>A month after I get married,</i>

1500
01:49:58,469 --> 01:50:00,389
<i>Carlotta will die.</i>

1501
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:06,391
<i>A week later, Max will die, too.</i>

1502
01:50:07,895 --> 01:50:09,565
<i>I will work out of my garage</i>

1503
01:50:09,647 --> 01:50:12,517
<i>and show in local galleries.</i>

1504
01:50:13,734 --> 01:50:15,074
<i>Against my doctor's advice,</i>

1505
01:50:15,569 --> 01:50:16,609
<i>I will get pregnant.</i>

1506
01:50:17,571 --> 01:50:18,611
<i>By the time I'm 34,</i>

1507
01:50:19,406 --> 01:50:20,446
<i>I'll have two boys.</i>

1508
01:50:25,287 --> 01:50:27,827
<i>I'll live with</i>
Dorothea for another year...

1509
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:34,627
<i>and then I'll open a pottery store</i>
in Sedona, Arizona.

1510
01:50:37,591 --> 01:50:39,591
<i>I'll marry Laurie, a singer-songwriter.</i>

1511
01:50:40,594 --> 01:50:42,354
<i>We'll get divorced in a year.</i>

1512
01:50:43,139 --> 01:50:44,259
<i>Then I'll meet Sandy...</i>

1513
01:50:45,558 --> 01:50:47,178
<i>and continue to do my pottery.</i>

1514
01:50:50,396 --> 01:50:52,686
<i>My mom will meet Jim in 1983.</i>

1515
01:50:54,191 --> 01:50:56,031
<i>They will stay a couple</i>
until she dies.

1516
01:50:57,611 --> 01:50:58,821
<i>On her birthday each year,</i>

1517
01:50:59,738 --> 01:51:02,658
<i>he will buy her a trip on a biplane.</i>

1518
01:51:05,286 --> 01:51:07,656
<i>Years after she's gone,</i>
I will finally get married

1519
01:51:07,746 --> 01:51:09,576
<i>and have a son.</i>

1520
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:12,585
<i>I will try to explain to him</i>

1521
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,130
<i>what his grandmother was like...</i>

1522
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:18,010
