1
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,579
The 4k digital restoration of <i>Paisan</i> was done

2
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,290
from a fine-grain nitrate source from the period

3
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,417
kept at the CSC-Cineteca Nazionale.

4
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,544
The restoration was carried out

5
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,547
by the Cineteca di Bologna
and the CSC-Cineteca Nazionale

6
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,050
at the L'Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in 2013.

7
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,571
PAISAN

8
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,882
<i>On the night of July 10, 1943,</i>

9
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,302
<i>the Allied fleet opened fire</i>

10
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,971
<i>on the southern coast of Sicily.</i>

11
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,688
<i>Twelve hours later,
the first large-scale Allied landing</i>

12
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,940
<i>on the European continent had begun.</i>

13
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>Under cover of the first shadows of night,</i>

14
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:26,373
<i>Allied patrols advance into Italian territory.</i>

15
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,141
Ricuzzo! Ricuzzo!

16
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,562
Heavens! Who are you? What do you want?

17
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,191
What do they want?

18
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,777
Maybe they're looking for their buddies.

19
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,032
Your friends left this morning. They're not here.

20
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,165
Willkommen, my friends.
They didn't land, did they?

21
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,544
- These are Americans!
- What Americans!

22
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,256
If they set foot here, they'll stay here
for good - horizontally!

23
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,054
Are you Americans?

24
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,847
Americans!

25
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,727
Americans!

26
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,413
My son was in Licata until ten days ago.

27
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,375
He was a soldier. Did you hurt him?

28
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,004
My blessed son, with these
horrible things happening -

29
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,889
Don't be afraid, ma'am. No one will hurt you.

30
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,058
But what happened here?

31
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,561
Good Lord, he speaks Italian!
Are you Italian like us?

32
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,564
Yes, my father's Sicilian, born in Gela.

33
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:41,735
Gela? I'm from Gela too. Luca!

34
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:45,489
This American's from Gela!
- Is that what he says?

35
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:50,244
- The past few days have been awful.
- They've bombed all day.

36
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,955
The Germans all left this morning.

37
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,749
We didn't leave the village.
We're holding a wake.

38
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,709
Everyone left, even the gravedigger.

39
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,337
We can't leave, we can't go anywhere else.

40
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,382
We can't even lay my daughter-in-law to rest.

41
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,473
- How many Germans left?
- The American's from Gela!

42
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,600
- What's your name?
- Tony Mascali.

43
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,768
He's not from Gela.

44
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,104
My father really is from Gela.
Then he left for America.

45
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,107
There are no Mascalis in Gela.

46
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,943
We're supposed to believe a pack of lies.

47
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,403
So much for freedom!

48
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,284
- When did the Germans leave?
- They laid mines everywhere this morning.

49
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:48,302
- How many Germans were there?
- Lots - 3,000 or more.

50
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,971
- Thirty thousand.
- Thirty million!

51
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,769
Which direction did they go?

52
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,273
Maybe toward Scopina. North for sure.

53
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,490
- Where are the mines?
- Along the coast heading north.

54
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,826
The lava canal's the only way,
but it's dangerous at night.

55
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,496
You need a guide like Carmela.

56
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,790
She's gone that way twice looking for her folks.

57
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,671
Come with me.

58
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,718
Come on.

59
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,970
Who'll give me a cigarette?

60
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,350
Carmela, these Americans want to talk to you.

61
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,019
You know the way over the lava?

62
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,563
I go that way every day with lunch for my father.

63
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,525
- Is it a path or a road?
- It's lava.

64
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,361
Can someone in your family lead us?

65
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,572
No, my father and brother
have been gone for four days.

66
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,200
I tried to leave the church twice
to look for them,

67
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,119
but the others are afraid to let me go alone.

68
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,081
I'll take you. I know the way.

69
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,708
You can't go off alone with these strangers!

70
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,002
Where are you going?

71
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,559
- You really coming with us?
- Yes.

72
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,416
- Where are you taking the girl?
- Let's go, baby.

73
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,293
Carmela, don't go!

74
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,290
Why'd you try to run off?

75
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,751
I didn't come along to look at your pretty faces.

76
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,880
I haven't seen my father and brother
in four days. I'm going to look for them.

77
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,635
Good work, Carmela.

78
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,304
Don't worry about your family.

79
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,599
If we find them, we'll bring them back with us.

80
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,311
You stay here. Joe will keep you company.

81
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,980
Look how cute he is.

82
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,442
Can I go back to the church?

83
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,403
We'll all go back together later.

84
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,218
No light!

85
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,525
What's he saying?

86
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,696
Ah! I'm Carmela.

87
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,205
<i>The ocean...</i>

88
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,709
My father and brother
went out to sea. Understand?

89
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,839
It's a good boat, and the sea is calm.

90
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,342
Maybe they didn't come back due to the war.

91
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,594
I'm going to look for them. You stay here.

92
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,439
You're all alike -
you, the Germans, the Fascists!

93
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,609
You people with guns are all the same!

94
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,576
<i>Ah, stella cadente.</i>

95
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,205
- Comma?
- What?

96
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,124
You said comme.

97
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,213
<i>Paisan...</i>

98
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,673
<i>spaghetti...</i>

99
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,216
<i>bambina...</i>

100
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,843
<i>mangiare...</i>

101
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,720
<i>fusillini...</i>

102
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,972
<i>c'est la guerre...</i>

103
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,631
<i>Ah, biondo.</i>

104
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,064
"Comme"? It's the same word in America?

105
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,464
<i>Latte.</i>

106
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,635
Uncle Luca had cows.
He sat seven bambini on a cow once.

107
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,443
Sister?

108
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,949
- Why did you shoot?
- I saw a light.

109
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:04,495
Get a grip on your nerves.
Everyone's hallucinating lately.

110
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,872
Let's go.

111
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,916
I saw it, I tell you.

112
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,760
Naumann, you see that?

113
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:23,056
The light could have come from there.
- It's possible. Let's have a look.

114
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,560
- A pirate's castle.
- What's that?

115
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,699
<i>Make sure no one comes in.
Stay here. No, don't come along.</i>

116
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>War is like children's games.</i>

117
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,579
Except that the bullets are real.

118
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,957
I could get romantic here.

119
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,251
And the Americans?

120
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,422
I was right. A real pirate's den.

121
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,427
You can turn on your flashlight now.

122
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,472
Look, there's even straw for us.

123
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,601
Come on, let's redecorate
and set up headquarters.

124
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,107
Shit, it's dark as a cave.

125
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,150
Just the place to break your neck.

126
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,196
- Wait!
- Thank God. Got past that one.

127
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,449
Watch your things and quit grumbling.

128
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,994
- And the Americans?
- They can take a flying leap.

129
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,204
It's like a glimpse of the afterlife in here.

130
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,748
Look. There's somebody over there.

131
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,876
What are you doing here?

132
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,337
- Why you leave village?
- I was scared.

133
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,006
<i>What's going on?</i>

134
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,799
- We got something here.
- Send her <i>up.</i>

135
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,051
- You scared?
- Of the Americans.

136
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,261
No be afraid.

137
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,222
- There's everything here - even people.
- <i>What did you find?</i>

138
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,350
We no hurt you. Us friends.

139
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,644
You shine light?

140
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,771
Looks like she forgot how to talk.

141
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,857
<i>Bad sign for a broad.</i>

142
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,193
<i>But what's she doing here?</i>

143
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,695
<i>This could be dangerous.</i>

144
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,072
If the light wasn't hers, someone else is here.

145
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,490
Nonsense.

146
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,202
Get a load of that pair, boys.

147
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,955
Enough for the three of us and then some.

148
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,041
Damn all this climbing.

149
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,209
Show me what you rustled up.

150
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,462
What you do here?

151
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:22,008
You no here because scared.
You meet boyfriend, right?

152
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,134
Hands off.

153
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,346
Your boyfriend very stupid not show up.

154
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,931
Me guess right?

155
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,059
I think you have dishonorable intentions.

156
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,645
I'm completely incapable of that right now,

157
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,857
what with the bad food
and all this running around.

158
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,318
You'd have rather found a barrel of wine.

159
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,404
Both. A barrel of wine and the girl on top.

160
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,115
I'd settle for water. I'm thirsty.

161
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,160
You got a complex? Wouldn't you prefer milk?

162
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,537
We thirsty. You find water?

163
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,415
Good. Very far?

164
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,750
I'll go.

165
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,878
We're in for some surprises tonight, boys.

166
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:02,757
Of course. Always the gentleman.

167
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,219
- What if she doesn't come back?
- We're too good-looking.

168
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,727
Fritz, you think they'll keep advancing?

169
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:01,441
Will we keep retreating all the way to Palermo?

170
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,277
Retreat? We don't retreat.

171
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,239
Tomorrow we'll counterattack.
They'll run like rabbits.

172
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,367
All the way to Egypt - no, all the way to hell.

173
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,975
<i>Bachelors first.</i>

174
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,977
<i>Let's roll for her.</i>

175
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,313
<i>- Three.
- Eight.</i>

176
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,564
<i>Twelve.</i>

177
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,566
<i>- Watch out!
- The little bitch!</i>

178
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,842
Let's go.

179
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:07,441
<i>The war advanced quickly through southern Italy.</i>

180
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,698
<i>On September 8th, Allied cannons
were trained on Naples.</i>

181
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,171
<i>After crushing German resistance at Salerno,</i>

182
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,050
<i>the Allies landed on the Amalfi Coast,</i>

183
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:36,929
<i>and a few weeks later, Naples was liberated.</i>

184
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,724
<i>Its port became</i>

185
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:44,020
<i>the most important logistics center
of the war in Italy.</i>

186
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:02,622
Egyptian fakir defies death! The man of steel!

187
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,628
Step up, folks! Watch him leap and spin!

188
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,672
He could break his neck, but he never does!

189
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,633
Watch his stunts!

190
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,552
Joe, gimme something.

191
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,225
- Wow!
- He's amazing!

192
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,938
- Pasquale, you leaving?
- We're not making nothin' here.

193
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,690
We gotta get this stuff out of here.

194
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,151
I'm going down to the port to pick up some dough.

195
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,321
- And leavin' us here?
- You should learn to eat fire.

196
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,073
Look at that dirty Arab!

197
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,824
Fire-eaters make a lot of dough!

198
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,953
Get your taralli here!

199
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,336
Gimme a light, will ya?

200
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,428
Hey, wanna make 50 lira?

201
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,181
- Two hundred.
- One hundred.

202
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,017
- No, 200.
- 150.

203
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,687
Okay. What do I do?

204
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,107
Stay here and look out for the police.

205
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,401
They're buying a Negro over there.

206
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,532
Look at these shoes.
I got a hundred lire off him.

207
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,909
Look at his jacket!

208
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,037
- Why don't you take his shoes?
- And you take his jacket!

209
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,335
Wait a minute! 3,000 lire!

210
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,047
I'll give you 3,000 and two packs of cigarettes.

211
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,841
Get out of here!

212
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,509
Here's 3,000.

213
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,553
I already outbid you!

214
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:44,724
- Get lost! 3,000's enough!
- It's 'cause I'm just a kid.

215
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,235
The MPs! Run for it!

216
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,654
The MPs!

217
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,641
<i>Long live Orlando!</i>

218
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,769
Go on in, Joe.

219
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,689
<i>The Roman senator, great leader of the knights!</i>

220
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,151
<i>Take up arms, Christians,</i>

221
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,236
and fight the black Saracen!

222
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,863
God calls us.

223
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,658
- We seek not riches!
- Justice and civilization!

224
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,869
Death to the Moors!

225
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,747
Hey, sit down!

226
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,263
I, fair Orlando,

227
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,141
shall fight you, the black Moor.

228
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,645
Come on, move your feet!

229
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,782
Come and get it!

230
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,477
You got it backwards. Give it to me.

231
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,432
This is a house key,

232
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,184
but the doors are wide open,
so the key's useless.

233
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,688
You sang good, but I didn't like your song.

234
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,535
What are you doing?

235
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,042
What's with you?

236
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,219
He's gone nuts!

237
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,242
An airplane!

238
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,588
What are you saying?

239
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,103
If you sleep, I'll steal your shoes.

240
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,665
Take it, you ugly mug!

241
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,494
I told you not to go to sleep!

242
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,373
- Where's your home?
- I ain't got one.

243
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,791
Joe, here are your shoes.

244
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,047
These are good soles.

245
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,783
I don't understand.

246
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,709
Where are your mama and papa?

247
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,755
My mama and papa are dead. The bombs.

248
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,468
Understand?

249
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,620
<i>A long and tragic delay at Cassino.</i>

250
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,459
<i>On February 22, 1944,</i>

251
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,003
<i>the Allies landed at Anzio.</i>

252
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,673
<i>Rome waited anxiously.</i>

253
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,928
<i>After a series of long, bloody battles,</i>

254
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,305
<i>the Germans were crushed.</i>

255
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:01,186
<i>Kesserling's troops retreat
through the streets of Rome.</i>

256
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:51,403
<i>Miraculously intact,
the city welcomed its liberators</i>

257
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,697
<i>on June 4, 1944.</i>

258
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,207
SIX MONTHS LATER

259
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,963
American cigarettes. Come on, you smokers.

260
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,966
Singles or packs.

261
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:05,644
American cigarettes, singles or packs.

262
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,440
What do you want?

263
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,027
That ugly witch has been staring all night!

264
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,488
You're not much to look at yourself!

265
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,657
What's wrong with you?

266
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,701
That hillbilly!

267
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,369
Me?

268
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:09,082
You slob! You'll starve when these guys leave.

269
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:13,545
No more little hats.
You'll be in rags, like before.

270
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,513
The cops!

271
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,245
She's a little tramp!

272
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:51,249
My papers are in order.
They're in there. Just hold on!

273
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,752
Stop her!

274
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:08,933
- Your ticket?
- Just for a minute.

275
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,602
Where are you going?

276
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,150
Did you see a blonde woman in a fur?

277
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,234
No.

278
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:24,449
- Thanks.
- It was nothing.

279
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,578
No, thanks. You keep it.

280
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,989
It's just one flight up.

281
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,088
- Ah, it's you.
- Evening. May I?

282
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,048
He's drunk.

283
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,134
Don't worry. He'll fall right asleep.

284
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,220
Let's hope he doesn't cause a ruckus.

285
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,782
Damn it! They tore my dress.

286
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,410
Your MPs are real louts.

287
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,746
Why'd you bring them along?

288
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,620
Is it cold like this in America?

289
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,248
Did you come from the front?

290
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,590
Aren't you gonna get undressed, sweetheart?

291
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,550
Your clothes.

292
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:34,472
What lovely manners! Still, you're awful sweet.

293
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,225
Warm me up a bit.

294
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,936
What's wrong?

295
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,648
You should be ashamed, a young man like you.

296
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,234
If you don't like me, you should have said so.

297
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,153
You probably stood around in bars all day.

298
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,365
Isn't it better having a real girl?

299
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,622
Yes, Rome is full of girls like me.

300
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,982
Water, please.

301
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,818
To wash up.

302
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,170
Come in.

303
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:37,095
I'm afraid all the pipes are broken.

304
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,016
Ah, finally!

305
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,770
I'm afraid it's not terribly fresh.

306
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,189
We've had no water for two weeks.

307
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:53,319
Not a glass. Lots of water to wash my face.

308
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,114
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

309
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,408
This way, please.

310
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,664
This is the only soap we have.

311
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,499
It's not very good.

312
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,297
Here's a towel.

313
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,053
Take your time.

314
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:53,087
I like Italian girls...

315
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,799
their language, their eyes,

316
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:00,970
their hair, their figures.

317
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:18,988
“When the thief saw the policeman,

318
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,949
he turned the corner and ran.”

319
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,663
I have nothing to offer you.

320
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,071
Happy?

321
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,992
We waited so long for you.

322
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,912
What took you so long getting here?

323
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,580
I don't understand.

324
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,333
Why so long to get to Rome?

325
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,255
Very hard.

326
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,429
Yes, you're here.

327
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,600
- Afraid?
- Not afraid.

328
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,104
Happy.-- very happy-

329
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,564
It hardly seems true.

330
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,069
It's been so awful.

331
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,655
So awful.

332
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,448
Not awful. Lovely.

333
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,326
It's lovely here.
Rome's lovely. Everything's lovely.

334
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,203
You're lovely.

335
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,758
Chocolate!

336
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,858
You're leaving?

337
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,006
Come back.

338
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,613
Why didn't you look for her?

339
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:12,286
Don't you remember the fountain in the square?

340
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,545
Francesca's house was red,

341
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:25,216
with a big doorway, bigger than all the others.

342
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,186
She's become just like you.

343
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,397
No, not her.

344
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,733
There are lots of good, decent girls

345
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,319
who work, who've worked all along,

346
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:49,281
who've managed to fend off hunger and poverty.

347
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,409
She's one of them.

348
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,416
It's still there.

349
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,919
But it's not in blossom like it was that day.

350
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,089
I know where Francesca's house is.

351
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,885
Piazza dei Quiriti, No. 8.

352
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,933
Go to her tomorrow.

353
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,477
You'll find her waiting for you there.

354
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,236
Tomorrow... you and Francesca...

355
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,429
Signora Amelia.

356
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,848
<i>Coming. Just a moment.</i>

357
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,608
- Leaving already?
- Yes.

358
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,652
When he wakes up tomorrow, give him this address.

359
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,489
- Please don't forget.
- Don't worry.

360
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,035
- Remind him to go there.
- Don't worry.

361
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,455
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

362
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:49,902
- Antonio, what time is it?
- 10:30.

363
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,697
- No one came looking for me?
- No, no one.

364
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,899
<i>Pursued by the Allies,</i>

365
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:33,028
<i>German troops flee through
Lazio, Umbria, and Tuscany.</i>

366
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,448
<i>Fighting flares up again for a while</i>

367
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,577
<i>in the hills around Florence.</i>

368
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,372
<i>But in early August, Eighth Army troops liberated</i>

369
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,041
<i>the city south of the Arno River.</i>

370
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:49,878
<i>North of the river, Italian partisans</i>

371
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:54,258
<i>fought German troops and Fascist snipers.</i>

372
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,311
We're injured, Doctor.

373
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:04,495
Tonino, what beautiful girls!

374
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:09,249
If I'd have known,
I'd have gotten injured earlier.

375
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,338
Miss, my eye hurts.

376
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,987
Does that hurt?

377
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,365
Let's have a look.

378
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,784
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

379
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:47,204
- You speak Italian?
- I lived in Florence a few years.

380
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,206
I was an idiot to get wounded.

381
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,376
Me and nine other men were up in the woods.

382
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,003
We were feeling great. We'd had a good rest

383
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,548
after that fighting on the Arno.

384
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:00,092
- The Arno. Where?
- In Florence.

385
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,554
We waited a good while
for the English to show up.

386
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,558
- So the English are in the city?
- Yes. Didn't you know?

387
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:08,767
Yes.

388
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,770
But since they stopped on this side of the Arno,

389
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,356
and there was nothing more we could do,

390
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,734
we went and joined them.

391
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,070
- When did you leave Florence?
- Two days ago.

392
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,532
By now they've occupied
the other side of the city.

393
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,369
No, the Germans blew up
every bridge but the Ponte Vecchio,

394
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,039
and they blew up the buildings
on both ends of that one.

395
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:34,918
- Where do you live in Florence?
- I don't. I live near Lucca,

396
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:39,423
but I joined the Arno Valley brigade
because they needed men badly.

397
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:42,926
But don't you have friends
or acquaintances in Florence?

398
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,220
Why? Do you know somebody?

399
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,098
Yes. I had lots of good friends.

400
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,771
Tell me, did you ever meet
a Guido Lombardi, a painter?

401
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,689
Everyone knows him!

402
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,817
I'd love to see him.
Would it be hard to find him?

403
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,736
Hard? Impossible!

404
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:03,572
He's our leader, but he's a phantom right now.

405
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:07,409
Everyone talks about him, but no one
knows where the famous Lupo is.

406
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,036
Lupo?

407
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,378
Boys, we're here.

408
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,220
They got you too?

409
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,181
They got him good!

410
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:33,435
Just one shot and he fell
like a sack of potatoes.

411
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:39,066
Did you get a look at these American girls?

412
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,778
Don't look so glum.
You'll see your little wife again.

413
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,030
Any word about Lupo?

414
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,533
Some say he's wounded, others say he's not.

415
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:50,327
Some say he's in town, others say he's not.

416
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,539
But he did a first-rate job in Florence.
- I'll say.

417
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,332
With my help, of course.

418
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,335
I'd organized everything to a T.

419
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:02,589
Especially before the Germans moved in.
We could operate in broad daylight.

420
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:51,471
- Any word about Lupo?
- Nothing specific.

421
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:54,016
He's fighting in Mugnone with other partisans.

422
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,893
I heard he was wounded,

423
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,438
but who can be sure what's going on over there?

424
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,780
Papa's the only one left at home.

425
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:24,087
- British trucks have arrived.
- Really?

426
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,391
Ma'am, do you recognize me?

427
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,227
I live across the street from you.

428
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,105
It's the end of the world, my boy.

429
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,691
We've sinned so badly.

430
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,319
Have you seen my wife and son?

431
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,280
Can't you see the state the poor woman's in?

432
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,866
- You're her son, right?
- What of it?

433
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,494
You must have word from across the river.

434
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,623
How could we? We have
other things to worry about.

435
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,380
Massimo!

436
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,467
What are you doing?
Why are you dressed like that?

437
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,928
I just had to come to Florence.

438
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:15,430
Surely you don't expect to find him here.

439
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,809
If he's a partisan,
he's on the other side of the Arno.

440
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,852
Help me, please.

441
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,689
How can I help you? He's not here.

442
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,316
I haven't the slightest idea where to find him.

443
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,735
<i>The first newspaper printed in Florence!</i>

444
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,737
<i>Lupo wounded in Mugnone!</i>

445
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,073
Give me a paper!

446
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,834
Look, Papa. Lupo's really been wounded.

447
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,503
Those rats! The greatest young man in the world.

448
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,797
- You knew him?
- We were friends!

449
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,425
When I was little, he did a portrait of me.

450
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,886
He was a fine painter too. Really good.

451
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,892
Keep down!

452
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,730
- Where's it coming from?
- Via de' Bardi.

453
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,774
Careful. A grenade just exploded over there.

454
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,419
Look. My house is just beyond that boulevard.

455
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,364
The National Liberation Committee
might know something,

456
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,282
but they're across the river.

457
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,076
What's the news?

458
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,082
Believe me, I'd like to cross too
and chase out those rats

459
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,959
shooting from rooftops and bell towers.

460
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,837
Shooting at whom?
Are there lots of partisans in town?

461
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:55,173
In some areas, but they're shooting out of rage.

462
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:58,260
They even shoot women going for water.

463
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,846
They killed two like that last night,

464
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:04,015
while these guys gaze at Giotto's bell towers.

465
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,184
How do you get this news?

466
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,270
By telephone.

467
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:11,565
There's a telephone cable linking us to the city.

468
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:15,443
You have to help me. Don't you have family?

469
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:19,030
I could take you there,
but they're letting no one across.

470
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:21,116
Take me where?

471
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,451
Don't make me spell it out.

472
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:27,330
Others have gotten across. You can try too.

473
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,499
But how? Where?

474
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,502
Use a little imagination. It's not hard.

475
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,297
- The Uffizi passageway?
- I know nothing.

476
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,842
You never said a word. Don't worry, and thanks.

477
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:43,013
Don't start from the Palazzo Pitti.
The passageway's collapsed there.

478
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,127
Hey, what's a guy like you doing here?

479
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,004
Gigi! I'm in luck.

480
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,383
Where'd you pop out of?

481
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:24,638
- Listen, I have to get across.
- Be my guest.

482
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:26,348
Stop kidding around.

483
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,351
I know you can cross via the Uffizi passageway.

484
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:32,437
Others have done it. I have to too.

485
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,315
No one's gotten across. That's just a tall tale.

486
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,985
The passageway's been there
for centuries. That's no tall tale.

487
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,155
Whether others got across or not, I'm going.

488
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,325
- You're not going anywhere.
- Calm down.

489
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,952
I'm free to go where I want.

490
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:50,288
But not to be a jerk and endanger the rest of us.

491
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,291
You're not the only one who knows.

492
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,919
But imagine if the Germans find out.

493
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,129
It's a miracle they haven't yet.

494
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,424
And at the end of the passageway - what then?

495
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,885
The Germans occupy the Palazzo della Signoria,

496
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,931
and Florence is in a state of emergency.
No one's allowed in the streets.

497
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,684
They'd nab you the second you got there.

498
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,894
Even authorized medical personnel

499
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,355
have trouble getting around.

500
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,441
It all depends on the Germans' mood.

501
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,443
Harriet, don't be foolish!

502
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,113
- You don't even know where it is.
- I'll find it!

503
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,448
The whole city is in German hands.

504
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,243
Try to get a Red Cross armband.

505
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,996
The partisans only control San Jacopino.

506
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,622
All right.

507
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,388
Keep down!

508
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,744
Look, that's the way we came.

509
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,000
Come on.

510
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,213
Those swine!

511
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:24,299
They've blown up all the bridges.

512
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,551
Come on, quick.

513
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,558
Look!

514
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:35,602
The Germans!

515
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,855
- Open up! Hurry!
- The window.

516
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,024
- Please open up.
<i>- Who's there?</i>

517
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:26,027
The Germans are coming! Open up!

518
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,113
Hurry!

519
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:11,823
Uncle, some people
want to cross over the rooftop.

520
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,576
Run along now. Keep your heads down.

521
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:17,370
Hear that 20-caliber machine gun?

522
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,914
They've been pounding that area for three days.

523
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,916
A big mistake, in my opinion.

524
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:25,211
Excuse me, which way to San Jacopino?

525
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:29,549
See Borgo Ognissanti there? Continue along there.

526
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,718
Are there still Germans in the streets?

527
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,386
No.

528
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:39,100
The partisans have been fighting
for that area for two days.

529
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:43,563
Maybe they'll have word of Lupo.
How long have they been fighting?

530
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:47,150
Two days. Since the night before last.

531
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,943
Listen, that's the 88!

532
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:52,614
<i>Major, your wife's worried and says to come down.</i>

533
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,532
I'm fine up here!

534
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,368
I can't budge now. And send up my helmet.

535
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,453
<i>All right.</i>

536
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:03,416
Just for the sun, not the bullets.
Those I can dodge to the inch.

537
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,836
I fought in the real war, back in 1918!

538
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,755
Renato, another map.

539
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,508
Good! Let's have a look.

540
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:13,301
They're in Galluzzo.

541
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,803
Send word of their latest position.

542
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,806
You live here? How should we proceed?

543
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,850
Try the rooftops, but be careful.

544
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,811
Lots of tiles are broken, and it's dangerous.

545
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:26,022
There's the 20-caliber again.

546
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,108
- Good-bye. Thanks, Major.
- Good luck.

547
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:59,264
These two came from the Palazzo Pitti.

548
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,849
The English have brought white flour.

549
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,935
Really? White flour?

550
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,396
Enough for all of us?

551
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:09,274
Yes, lots of sacks, and they'll bring more.

552
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,442
Why don't they keep coming?

553
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,861
Easier said than done!

554
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:17,574
The Germans blew up all the bridges.

555
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:20,868
Heavens! My aunt lives close to Santa Trinita.

556
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:24,497
Were the old buildings destroyed too?
- No, just on the Ponte Vecchio.

557
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,918
What are they waiting for?
The partisans control San Jacopino.

558
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,170
Why are the English dragging their feet?

559
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:33,965
That woman says the whole area's been liberated.

560
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,260
You can go out on the streets.
- How do we get there?

561
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:39,429
Out our courtyard to the Rucellai Gardens.

562
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,556
It's just minutes from there.

563
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,434
But the Fascists are shooting from the rooftops.

564
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:47,604
I'm not afraid of them. So long, and thanks.

565
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,064
Red Cross.

566
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,591
Careful. Don't bump it against the curb.

567
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,301
Don't worry.

568
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:08,476
Keep back. Where'd you come from?

569
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,729
Downtown. I have to get
to my family on the Mosse bridge.

570
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:15,692
I have relatives there too,
but no one can get through.

571
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:18,653
Not with the Fascists and Germans there.

572
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,322
- Have they blown up buildings?
- Keep back.

573
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,534
- Do you know?
- No, nothing.

574
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:28,079
There was lots of smoke over there this morning.

575
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,220
Stop! You can't go here!

576
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,431
Carlo, don't you recognize me? I live over there.

577
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,850
Yes, but I can't let you through!

578
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,144
- My family's there.
- It's too dangerous.

579
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:54,480
There are Fascist snipers.
You want to get killed?

580
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:58,735
- It's just over there.
- All right, come on. I'll ask the boss.

581
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:09,162
Marco, these folks want to get across.

582
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:12,081
All right. Send 'em through.

583
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,754
All right! On your toes, boys.
They're moving out.

584
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,921
Come on.

585
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,591
I know this guy.

586
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,138
Hold it there! Where are you headed?

587
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,349
- Down the street.
- Are you crazy?

588
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:33,478
My wife and child are just across the street.

589
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:35,646
Let me through, please.

590
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,775
Massimo, no! Stop!

591
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,027
<i>Get back, idiot!</i>

592
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,756
Marco!

593
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,078
Move it!

594
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,339
Filthy coward!

595
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,635
Look what you did, you swine! Move it!

596
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,017
No, I don't want to die!

597
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,312
Dear God.

598
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,231
Marco...

599
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,400
find my family

600
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:05,528
and tell them what's happened

601
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,239
so they don't worry.

602
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:12,368
Mama, I feel cold inside.

603
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:19,667
Everything's gone badly today since Lupo died.

604
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:29,343
You won't get on my back anymore now, Lupo.

605
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:44,066
<i>The “Gothic line”
is an impregnable natural barrier.</i>

606
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,574
<i>Every village there
must be wrested in bitter struggle</i>

607
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,076
<i>from a ruthless and desperate enemy.</i>

608
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:08,234
Brothers, let us thank the Lord,
who has delivered us from all danger.

609
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,972
If my wife had listened,
we'd have brought the pigs too,

610
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:40,099
and the Germans wouldn't have gotten them.

611
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:42,852
Well, take your chickens anyway.

612
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:46,939
These are mine.

613
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,870
“Very Reverend Provincial Father...

614
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:04,206
with the help of divine providence,

615
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,585
we are safe and sound.

616
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:13,507
Our monastery did not suffer much...”

617
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:29,982
- What is it?
- The Americans, in tiny little cars!

618
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,990
Come inside.

619
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:46,082
Fra' Pacifico is coming.

620
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,118
Praised be Jesus Christ.

621
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:24,328
Good evening. May he be praised forever.

622
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,664
Father Superior's waiting for you.

623
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:29,208
Run along now, boys.

624
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:53,023
Peace be with you, brothers.
May Saint Francis bless you.

625
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:02,533
We are American chaplains.

626
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:14,295
May we spend the night here?

627
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,589
Our doors are open to all.

628
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:19,842
Fra' Pacifico, prepare rooms for these gentlemen.

629
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:21,844
These are our other brothers:

630
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:24,722
the vicar, the substitute, and the organist.

631
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,682
Please come with me.

632
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,899
Please step inside.

633
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,618
Please have a seat.

634
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:47,870
A chair, Father Claudio.

635
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,839
Take their helmets.

636
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,679
I'd like to ask about my town, San Leo.

637
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,890
I'll ask them in a moment.

638
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,559
Father, if I may -

639
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,562
Very kind, but no, thank you.

640
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:32,748
Father, would you have any news about San Leo?

641
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:38,587
Is it badly damaged?

642
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:40,256
Not badly.

643
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:49,765
My deepest thanks.

644
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:54,895
I'll say a special prayer to our Holy Mother

645
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,565
for your spiritual and temporal aid -

646
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:02,194
That's fine, Fra' Raffaele. We understand.

647
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:15,207
We make this liqueur from own apples, Fathers.

648
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:25,259
Would you like to try it?

649
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,816
- Hail Mary...
- Full of grace.

650
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,860
The rooms are ready, Father.

651
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:45,279
Fathers, if you'd be so kind.

652
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:09,511
Such men, those three chaplains!

653
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,014
Father Superior, they forgot this.

654
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:14,725
Don't get excited.
They're down the other corridor.

655
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,854
- Are they spending the night?
- They'll be our guests at dinner.

656
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:22,399
Of course. We'll share all we have with them.

657
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,528
<i>- Praised be Jesus Christ.
- Forever and ever.</i>

658
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,031
<i>What are you preparing for this evening?</i>

659
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:31,033
Broccoli.

660
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:33,577
Is there enough for three honored guests

661
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:36,330
- who'll be joining us?
- No, there's very little.

662
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:38,248
We could mix in some potatoes.

663
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:40,167
There aren't many potatoes either.

664
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:46,048
I've noticed that the pear tree
is starting to bear fruit.

665
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:49,843
They won't be ripe for a month,
and they're barely edible anyway.

666
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:53,722
Do your best. I know I can count on you.

667
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,769
Divine providence will help us.
Praised be Jesus Christ.

668
01:29:58,894 --> 01:29:59,978
Forever and ever.

669
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:11,365
Go see who it is.

670
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,383
- What is it?
- An offering for the monastery.

671
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:33,303
- You saved our animals.
- May Saint Francis bless you.

672
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:36,140
Help me carry all this.

673
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,580
Come here, please.

674
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,920
Meat and vegetables - good.

675
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:10,340
Cocoa, butter, milk...

676
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,634
more meat.

677
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,387
All very good food.

678
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,474
Go now. The rest later.

679
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,493
Look what they gave me.

680
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,120
There are eggs, butter, and chocolate inside.

681
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:43,957
Eggs in cans? In here?

682
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,002
- Well, I'll be!
- Let me see the chocolate.

683
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:51,590
These Americans think of everything.

684
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,509
Give me that gadget.

685
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,720
Careful, Father Salvatore.
You'll hurt your fingers.

686
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,056
This isn't your line of work.

687
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,196
It's milk!

688
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,115
Smells good.

689
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,288
Well, I'll be!

690
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,707
Nothing would grow here before.

691
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:28,919
Now it's the most fertile part of our garden.

692
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,713
One of Fra' Raffaele's miracles.

693
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:34,633
Smells good.

694
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:39,054
Mint.

695
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:46,353
Good evening. Lovely garden!

696
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,571
He's very bad.

697
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:57,447
No, he's good.

698
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:10,085
Excuse me. I must go now.

699
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,454
Good evening.

700
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,383
Why aren't they praying?

701
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:01,053
These two are very bad.

702
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,430
He's a Protestant,

703
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,474
and he's a Jew.

704
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,734
Father Salvatore, one of the chaplains is a Jew!

705
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,655
- What is it?
- Come back here!

706
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,699
One of the chaplains is a Jew!

707
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,743
Merciful Saint Francis!

708
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:30,332
Father Claudio, one of the chaplains is a Jew!

709
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,254
One of the chaplains is a Jew!

710
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,844
Jesus...

711
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:47,099
protect us and help us.

712
01:34:57,943 --> 01:35:01,071
- What is it?
- One of the chaplains is a Jew.

713
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:04,366
Don't worry. Get up now.

714
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,120
A Jew in our monastery!

715
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:10,288
The short one's a Protestant.

716
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:15,544
The heresy of Luther,
the worst of all Protestants.

717
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,463
What is it, my sons?

718
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:23,343
One of the chaplains is a Jew,
and another's a Protestant.

719
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,388
Two lost souls, Father Superior.

720
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:31,393
No soul is lost while it still has life
and a will to be saved.

721
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,147
There are always opportunities for redemption.

722
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,191
We can do something for them, brothers.

723
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:46,908
Would you mind if I asked a question, Father?

724
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,910
Of course not.

725
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:53,165
Have you lived with the other
two priests a long time?

726
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:57,002
We've been together
for the entire Italian campaign.

727
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,422
Twenty months. No, 21.

728
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,716
Sicily, Salerno,

729
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:04,801
Rome, Florence.

730
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:08,930
They're good and dear friends.

731
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:11,266
I admire them very much.

732
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,603
Have you never tried
to lead them to the true faith?

733
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:19,191
Have you never tried?

734
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:22,944
But Father, the Protestant and the Jew

735
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:27,282
are just as convinced
that they're on the true path.

736
01:36:27,908 --> 01:36:31,453
- But we know that they err.
- Yes, we do.

737
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:33,663
Certainly.

738
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:37,584
We must try by every means possible

739
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:40,879
to save those two souls that could be lost.

740
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:44,299
I am a Catholic, Father, and a priest,

741
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:48,136
and I humbly believe I'm a good Catholic.

742
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:52,015
Forgive me. I didn't mean
to remind you of your duties.

743
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,811
I just meant that you're military chaplains.

744
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,563
Your mission exposes you

745
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:01,858
to the same risks and dangers as soldiers.

746
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,778
Have you never thought that your two companions

747
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:06,905
might perish any day?

748
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,573
Saint Paul says...

749
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:12,911
<i>"Omnes quidem resurgemus,
sed non omnes mutabimus in gloria."</i>

750
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:15,288
But for those of good faith...

751
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:19,960
<i>"in novissima tuba surget in gloria."</i>

752
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:23,505
That's true, but have you
examined their conscience?

753
01:37:23,672 --> 01:37:25,715
Are you sure they're of good faith?

754
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:28,176
Have you ever discussed these things with them?

755
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:32,514
No. I've never examined their consciences.

756
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:34,766
I've never discussed this with them.

757
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,102
I've never asked them anything,

758
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:40,355
because I've never felt I could judge them.

759
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,859
I know them too well. They're good friends.

760
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:46,945
Perhaps you...

761
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,364
here amid this peace,

762
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:54,661
this atmosphere of serene meditation,

763
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,872
consider me guilty.

764
01:37:56,997 --> 01:37:58,874
I don't feel guilty.

765
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:02,544
My conscience is clear.

766
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,877
<i>“My soul is sad unto death.”</i>

767
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:24,876
Our rule asks that we remain silent during meals.

768
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:27,462
I'm sorry I can't make an exception for you.

769
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:37,365
On this day the following brothers
passed on to a better life:

770
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,660
Father Salvatore of San Leo in <i>1722,</i>

771
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:44,289
Father Giambattista of Rimini in 1743,

772
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:48,668
and Father Teodoro of San Marino in 1744.

773
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:06,352
Please start.

774
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:09,481
We'll wait for all of you.

775
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,692
We're fasting.

776
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:15,070
Why?

777
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:19,908
Because divine providence sent to our refuge here

778
01:41:20,075 --> 01:41:23,870
two souls on which
the Gospel's light must descend.

779
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:26,456
Our human presumption leads us to hope

780
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,541
that for this humble sacrifice

781
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,503
we might receive a great reward from heaven.

782
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:44,432
Forgive <i>me...</i>

783
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:49,020
if I do not heed your rule...

784
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:55,944
but I wish to speak.

785
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:03,910
I must tell you that you've given me

786
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,496
such a great gift

787
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:11,626
that I feel I will be forever in your debt.

788
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:16,798
Here I've found that peace of mind...

789
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,134
that I'd lost

790
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,929
amid the horrors and misfortunes of war.

791
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,142
A beautiful and moving lesson

792
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:30,478
in humility, simplicity...

793
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:33,815
and pure faith.

794
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:39,821
<i>Pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.</i>

795
01:42:44,284 --> 01:42:45,994
<i>Behind the lines,</i>

796
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:50,748
<i>Italian partisans and American
OSS officers join as brothers</i>

797
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:53,668
<i>in a battle missing from war reports</i>

798
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:57,130
<i>but perhaps even fiercer and more desperate.</i>

799
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:05,263
PARTISAN

800
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,198
Partisans! Bandits!

801
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:42,759
Another partisan killed. I'll go get him.

802
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:46,512
I don't care. I'll go anyway.

803
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,435
All right, but make sure you do it right.

804
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,351
Look!

805
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:21,065
Look! Shoot!

806
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:26,988
Filthy swine!

807
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:30,653
- What happened?
- Another partisan in the Po.

808
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:50,882
Another partisan in the Po, boys.

809
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:37,405
Go get the guns.

810
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:53,004
San Marco!

811
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:57,425
Where is it? Where's the radio set?

812
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:01,489
Take the boats into the canals right away.

813
01:51:03,824 --> 01:51:05,826
Keep down.

814
01:51:29,684 --> 01:51:31,769
You and you, come with me.

815
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:38,859
That's Casal Madalena.

816
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:02,842
The guns.

817
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:06,470
We'll find something to eat there.

818
01:52:16,272 --> 01:52:17,857
Here comes Cigolani.

819
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:21,569
- Come in.
- Evening, boys. Any news?

820
01:52:21,694 --> 01:52:23,404
The Germans were here yesterday.

821
01:52:23,863 --> 01:52:26,615
Let 'em look. I'm not afraid of 'em.

822
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:28,868
You know I'm hiding some Americans?

823
01:52:28,993 --> 01:52:29,952
Yes.

824
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:33,497
I haven't lit a fire in days
so there won't be smoke.

825
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,583
They have lookouts everywhere.

826
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:38,085
They're hunting us hard out there.

827
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:41,672
Can you spare anything to eat?
- Whatever we have. A little polenta.

828
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:44,341
- We could cook up some eels.
- Fine.

829
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:47,261
There's an American outside. May I ask him in?

830
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:48,929
Yes, call him.

831
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:07,823
Let's go in and eat.

832
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:28,928
On his face.

833
01:53:30,638 --> 01:53:32,640
Keep it hidden.

834
01:53:40,523 --> 01:53:41,857
How many?

835
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:44,652
Eight, ten - however many you want.

836
01:54:08,926 --> 01:54:10,386
Here they come.

837
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:12,555
Here they are.

838
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:23,190
I got confirmation for the drop.

839
01:54:23,524 --> 01:54:24,775
Good.

840
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,623
Cigolani, the flares!

841
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,458
Light the flares, boys.

842
01:54:41,584 --> 01:54:43,669
The flares!

843
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:50,926
Put 'em out!

844
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,971
He says to put out the flares!

845
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:20,247
- You find anything?
- Not a thing.

846
01:55:20,915 --> 01:55:22,541
Look harder!

847
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:33,469
Damn it! They're firing on Casal Madalena.

848
01:55:35,804 --> 01:55:38,140
Think they figured out we were there?

849
01:55:39,725 --> 01:55:41,185
Cigolani!

850
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:43,771
Take all your men to Pancirli and wait there.

851
01:55:43,896 --> 01:55:45,731
To Pancirli, boys!

852
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:48,901
Back to the sheds, and keep your eyes open!

853
01:56:38,993 --> 01:56:42,788
Look, boys! British planes
are strafing Scardovari.

854
01:56:58,137 --> 01:56:59,722
Let's go, quick!

855
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:01,724
Come with us, quick!

856
01:58:08,499 --> 01:58:12,002
<i>- Cigolani, was it just those two?
- Yes.</i>

857
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,379
But they're English, not American.

858
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:16,381
<i>Better than nothing.</i>

859
01:58:17,091 --> 01:58:20,219
- They're all wet.
- We have to warm them up.

860
01:58:20,552 --> 01:58:22,596
Gimme your hand.

861
01:58:27,184 --> 01:58:30,020
Come on. There's one more.

862
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,567
- Did the plane sink?
- Yes.

863
01:58:35,692 --> 01:58:37,820
- Anything salvaged?
- Nothing.

864
01:58:37,945 --> 01:58:40,155
- Nothing at all?
- Not a thing.

865
01:58:53,502 --> 01:58:56,130
Go get them some oilskins.

866
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:09,393
- Did you send it?
- Yes.

867
01:59:41,049 --> 01:59:42,885
Hurry or the Germans will get us.

868
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,892
- Who's there?
- <i>Popsky.</i>

869
01:59:50,017 --> 01:59:51,977
Come out.

870
02:00:09,912 --> 02:00:12,539
Boys, the Germans are coming up the Po.

871
02:00:12,664 --> 02:00:16,919
We've got to scatter and get to the sea quickly.

872
02:00:17,044 --> 02:00:18,879
Hurry, boys.

873
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:23,217
Keep down!

874
02:01:58,312 --> 02:01:59,313
Hands up!

875
02:02:07,779 --> 02:02:08,822
Hands up!

876
02:02:33,221 --> 02:02:35,015
Good. Let's go.

877
02:03:06,046 --> 02:03:07,756
Glasses.

878
02:03:14,346 --> 02:03:15,889
A glass.

879
02:03:16,348 --> 02:03:18,058
Now get out.

880
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:36,034
Cheers.

881
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:45,520
What are they gonna do to us?

882
02:04:47,022 --> 02:04:48,732
They'll kill us.

883
02:04:49,691 --> 02:04:53,028
Why'd they kill Cigolani and not us?

884
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,033
They'll kill us too.

885
02:04:59,409 --> 02:05:02,412
<i>Poor Giulia</i>

886
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:05,499
<i>You're dead and gone now</i>

887
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:09,085
Damn it.

888
02:05:10,045 --> 02:05:13,632
My folks will never know what happened to me.

889
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,596
He pissed on me like a whore.

890
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,528
Stop, you filthy pigs!

891
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:54,506
<i>This happened in the winter of 1944.</i>

892
02:05:54,798 --> 02:05:57,884
<i>By early spring the war was over.</i>
