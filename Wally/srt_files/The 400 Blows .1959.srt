1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,845
THE 400 BLOWS

2
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,284
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY
OF ANDRE BAZIN

3
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,168
Doinel, bring me that.

4
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,090
Nice. Go stand in the corner.

5
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,808
You've got one minute left.

6
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,963
Silence!

7
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,884
Papers will be collected in 30 seconds.

8
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,644
Quiet!

9
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,162
Row leaders, get ready.

10
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,283
I'll count to three.

11
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,484
One.

12
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,404
Two.

13
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,444
Three. Collect the papers.

14
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,364
Get the others first.

15
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,930
- Give it to me.
- Just a second.

16
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,122
- What's going on?
- He won't turn it in.

17
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,487
No special treatment!

18
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,566
Brown nose.

19
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,328
Do I have everyone's paper?

20
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,249
You may go.

21
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,361
Not you, my friend!

22
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,244
Recess is a reward, not a right.

23
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,283
<i>Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unfairly punished by Sourpuss</i>

24
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,364
<i>for a pinup that fell from the sky.</i>

25
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,604
<i>It will be an eye for an eye,
a tooth fora tooth.</i>

26
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,889
Hey, champs, maybe you need
a referee over here.

27
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,688
No recess for three days.
That'll teach you.

28
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,041
Look at this!

29
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,571
<i>What's so interesting there?</i>

30
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,603
Take your seats!

31
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,446
We have a young Juvenal in our class,

32
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,849
though he doesn't know an Alexandrine
from blank verse.

33
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,727
Doinel, for tomorrow
you will conjugate -

34
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,491
Take your seat and write this down.

35
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,130
In all tenses of the indicative,
conditional and subjunctive -

36
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,045
The rest of you,
get out your notebooks.

37
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,601
"I deface the classroom walls...

38
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,924
and abuse French verse."

39
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,203
"The Hare"!

40
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,207
Doinel, go get something
to wipe that rubbish off the wall,

41
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,886
or I'll make you lick it off!

42
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,489
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

43
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,762
"In the season when the thickets

44
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,481
Glow with crimson flowers

45
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,649
When the black tip

46
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,011
Of my long ears

47
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,366
Could already be seen

48
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,366
Above

49
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,010
The still-green rye

50
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,524
From which I nibbled

51
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,371
The tender stems

52
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,922
As I frolicked about

53
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,683
One day

54
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,242
Fatigued

55
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,602
I was fast asleep

56
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,050
In my hutch

57
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,890
When little Margot surprised me there"

58
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,608
- I saw you, Simonot!
- I didn't do anything, sir.

59
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,245
It's always someone else.

60
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,609
"She loved me so

61
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,285
My beautiful little mistress

62
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,326
What kindness she showed me

63
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,406
How caring and tender

64
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,047
How she hugged me on her little lap

65
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,482
And kissed me"

66
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,249
Who's the idiot who whistled?

67
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,006
I warn you, speak up
or your neighbor will get it.

68
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,568
- You hear me, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir.

69
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,089
And cowards to boot!

70
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,969
What a class this year!

71
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,125
I've known idiots before,
but at least they were polite!

72
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,567
They kept their heads down
and didn't get caught.

73
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,884
And you - you call that clean?
You made it filthier!

74
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,770
Go to your seat and copy this down.
Your parents will pay the price.

75
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,367
Poor France will be in sorry shape
in ten years!

76
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,282
- Everyone swipes money from their parents.
- Maybe, but it isn't easy.

77
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,124
I bet even Mauricet does it.

78
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,646
Hey, Mauricet,
we want to ask you something.

79
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,089
- Where'd you get those fancy glasses?
- I bought them.

80
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,811
Did you pinch the money
from your mom or your dad?

81
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,604
Don't pretend you don't go
through their pockets.

82
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,527
You're the louse
who squealed on me today!

83
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,361
You're a louse, Mauricet!

84
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,771
Your days are numbered.

85
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,569
You'll get yours!

86
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,965
I'll never finish my homework tonight.

87
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,683
- Sourpuss is a real asshole.
- That's his job.

88
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,244
Still, I'm gonna smash his face in
before I go to the army!

89
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,041
See you.

90
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,807
<i>"I deface the classroom walls."</i>

91
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,091
- Evening, Mother.
- Evening.

92
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>- Where is the flour?</i>
- <i>What</i> flour?

93
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,043
<i>Didn't you buy what I told you to?</i>

94
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,441
<i>- Where is the list I left you?</i>
- I <i>lost it.</i>

95
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,443
No wonder you get such bad grades.

96
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,688
Go get my slippers.

97
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,963
In the bedroom, under the bed.

98
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,567
I need that flour.
Go get it right away.

99
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,644
They had to use forceps.

100
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,451
Seems it runs in the family.
Same thing happened to her mother.

101
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,770
That means nothing.
With Fanny it was over in ten minutes.

102
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,526
But if they hadn't done a caesarian
for the last one,

103
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,568
I wouldn't be talking to you now.

104
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,325
And my sister, with one every year.
Can you imagine?

105
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,444
The doctor warned her.

106
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,762
She had to have surgery.
There was blood everywhere.

107
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,407
- Always running, eh, son?
- I got bawled out 'cause of this flour.

108
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,327
You mustn't make your mother mad.
You have to handle her gently.

109
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,042
- What's that?
- A fog light.

110
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,691
I'm gonna try it out
at the race on Sunday.

111
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,049
- Look at your little flour boy here.
- That's not funny!

112
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,965
I thought it was.

113
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,891
- Where's my change?
- I need it for lunch at school.

114
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,530
Ask your father.

115
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,125
Let's have it!

116
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,408
I sense a storm coming.

117
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,403
- Dad, I need some money -
- What?

118
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,245
I just need 1,000 francs.

119
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,369
Which means you're hoping for 500,
meaning you really need 300,

120
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,082
so here's a hundred.

121
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,126
All right, 500.
But your mother should pay for that.

122
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,690
Where are the scissors?

123
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,728
<i>Where are the scissors</i>

124
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,406
Stop playing the clown.
And what are you laughing about?

125
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,445
This is no time for homework.
We're about to eat.

126
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,605
She's right. There's a time
and a place for everything.

127
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,648
Where'd you get this pen?

128
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,048
I traded for it.

129
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,805
You've been doing
a lot of trading lately.

130
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,684
What's that? Do you smell it?

131
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,485
- It's fish.
- Smells promising.

132
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,605
Ask your mother
if the dishtowel's on fire.

133
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,364
Why?

134
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,529
For a laugh.

135
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,084
You can clear the table, son.

136
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,488
Your cousin called.

137
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,763
- His wife's expecting again.
- Four kids in three years?

138
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,002
Like rabbits. Lt's disgusting.

139
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,643
Speaking of kids, what'll we do
with this one for the summer?

140
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,167
- Summer camp ain't for poodles.
- And he'd be with others his age.

141
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,330
- We don't have to decide yet.
- The sooner, the better.

142
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,126
Don't pull too hard.

143
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,171
- Nice, huh?
- "Lions Club."

144
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,847
- What's going on here?
- Hey, careful.

145
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,045
Where would you like
to drive this Sunday?

146
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,884
The club asked me to plan the route.

147
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,406
- I want to rest on Sunday.
- Where?

148
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,571
- At my girlfriend's.
- What'll the guys think?

149
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,489
Listen, I've had enough.

150
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,211
Housework all morning and -
- And the "touch" system all afternoon.

151
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,523
- What?
- Your typewriter or someone else's.

152
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,888
Antoine, time for bed now.

153
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,482
'Night, Dad. 'Night, Mother.

154
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,289
You're such an idiot sometimes.

155
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,883
<i>You've got no sense of humor.</i>

156
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,401
<i>You're wasting your time on that crap.</i>

157
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,803
Don't forget the garbage,
and turn your light out.

158
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,569
<i>I make contacts at' the races.
You 'll see-I 'll be VP one day.</i>

159
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,487
<i>You'll never be VP. They like you
puttering along where you are.</i>

160
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,044
<i>Our evening programming has ended.
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

161
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,129
Get up, quick.
We didn't hear the alarm.

162
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,761
<i>"I deface the classroom walls."</i>

163
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,688
There's no sock left
around all these holes.

164
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,445
Those have had it.
Buy some new ones.

165
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,488
All your others are dirty.

166
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,801
I gave you money to buy sheets
for the boy's bed, remember?

167
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,483
He prefers his sleeping bag.
Right, son?

168
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,291
Sure, it keeps me warm.

169
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,642
You're still here?

170
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,085
See you.

171
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,531
- No need to run.
- We're gonna be late.

172
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,809
We'll have to sneak in
and we'll get in trouble.

173
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,571
- Take it easy.
- Why?

174
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,611
Sourpuss said he wouldn't
let you back in.

175
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,922
- You think he'll do it?
- Yeah. He can't stand you.

176
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,566
- Got any money?
- Lunch money.

177
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,922
Then just follow me.

178
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,128
What are you up to?

179
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,929
Follow me.

180
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,802
- Put your bag behind the door.
- Will they be safe there?

181
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,969
I leave mine here all the time.

182
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,928
My God, it's Antoine!
I'm sure he saw me.

183
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,570
Which one is yours?

184
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,530
The dark-haired one.
What's he doing out of school?

185
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,683
- You're really gonna get it tonight!
- She wouldn't dare tell my father.

186
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,161
- Wasn't that him?
- Never saw the guy before.

187
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,721
Then you're safe.

188
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,284
I'm going back to school tomorrow,
but I'll need a note.

189
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,247
- What are you gonna do?
- I have an old one I never used.

190
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,965
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight.

191
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,408
- What about the handwriting?
- Copy your mother's.

192
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,211
That'll be hard.
She writes really funny.

193
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,209
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

194
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,971
I hope so. See you.

195
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,842
"Dear Sir,

196
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,203
Please excuse

197
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,245
my son René

198
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,485
who was sick -"

199
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,009
My son René!

200
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,004
Hi, Dad.

201
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,447
- Something burning in here again?
- It's from downstairs.

202
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,128
- Set the table for two tonight.
- Has Mother left?

203
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,569
No, she called to say
she'd be home late.

204
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,411
Her boss needs her
for year-end inventory.

205
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,647
You and I will have ourselves
a real bachelors' dinner.

206
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,171
- She said there are eggs around.
- I know where.

207
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,369
- Did you work hard today?
- Yes.

208
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,324
- What did you study?
- "The Hare."

209
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,767
Ah, "The Tortoise and the Hare."

210
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,286
No, just "The Hare."

211
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,324
- Did you do well?
- I wasn't called on.

212
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,444
You have to raise your hand
and get noticed,

213
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,761
or you'll never get in the race.

214
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,923
You have to take initiative in life.

215
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,882
By the way, have you thought
about your mother's birthday?

216
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,449
It's the 17th.
I trust you'll get her something.

217
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,087
Are you listening?

218
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,008
I know what you're thinking:

219
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,091
She's been hard on you lately.

220
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,931
But she's under a lot of pressure.

221
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,362
Put yourself in her place.

222
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,761
Keeping house and working part-time,

223
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,320
and this place as cramped as it is.

224
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,122
I'm working on finding us
a different place.

225
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,204
Women are always taken
advantage of at the office,

226
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,567
and they don't know
what to do about it.

227
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,123
But she really loves you, you know.
Shit!

228
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,491
- Where's my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it.

229
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,763
You know I won't tolerate lying!

230
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,041
It's the truth.

231
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,931
I know I put it away yesterday.

232
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,966
It wasn't me.

233
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,487
Things vanish into thin air
around here!

234
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,364
It wasn't me.

235
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,611
All right. I'll ask your mother.

236
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,607
Time for bed now.

237
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
Don't forget the garbage.

238
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,726
<i>- My boss drove me home.
- Your boss!</i>

239
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,522
<i>- I couldn't very well refuse, could I?
- I hope you get overtime for that!</i>

240
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,409
<i>I will, at the end of the month.</i>

241
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,369
<i>Those services are usually paid in cash!</i>

242
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,284
<i>Oh, knock it off!</i>

243
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,091
<i>No wonder madame needs
to rest on Sunday.</i>

244
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,211
<i>- By the way, where's my Michelin guide?
- How should I know? Ask the boy.</i>

245
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,846
<i>- He said he didn't touch it.
- He lies through his teeth.</i>

246
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,366
<i>- Like someone else I know.
- If you raised him better -</i>

247
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,681
<i>I gave him my name, damn it!
I put food on the table!</i>

248
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,090
<i>I've had enough of your criticism!</i>

249
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,687
<i>Fine! We'll send him to the Jesuits
or the army orphans.</i>

250
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,968
<i>At least I'd have some peace and quiet!</i>

251
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,530
You two better eat out
till the end of the month.

252
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,200
For that I need a clean shirt!

253
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,971
If you can't wash the shirt,
at least wash the collar!

254
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,004
You shouldn't have bought
that fog light.

255
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,560
I bought it second-hand.

256
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,208
Go ahead. Open it.

257
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,764
What if it's the gas man?

258
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,082
They give you advance notice.

259
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,525
Morning, sir. I came to see
if Antoine's better today.

260
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,281
- Better? Why?
- He missed school yesterday.

261
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,683
You hear that?

262
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,126
- Thanks, kid.
- Good-bye, sir.

263
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,208
You don't seem surprised.

264
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,283
Should I be?

265
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,807
Nothing that boy does surprises me.

266
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,124
- I've gotta come up with an excuse.
- The bigger, the better.

267
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,489
When my mom broke her leg,
I told them the whole story,

268
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,001
except that she was drunk.
I didn't need a note.

269
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,050
Well, I can't use the same story.

270
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,043
And we can't show up together.

271
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,884
Right. You go first.

272
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,009
There you are.

273
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,484
A little extra homework
and you get sick, eh?

274
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,609
And your parents fall for it.

275
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,889
Can't wait to see what excuse
you wrangled out of them this time.

276
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,291
Let me see your note.

277
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,607
- I don't have one.
- Don't have one?

278
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,287
You think that's how it works?
It's not that easy, my friend!

279
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,685
- It was... my mother...
- What about her?

280
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,729
She's dead!

281
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,690
Oh, my gosh.

282
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,370
Sorry, son. I didn't know.

283
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,923
- Was she ill?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,244
You should've told me.
You should always confide in your teachers.

285
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,725
Go on now. Get in line.

286
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,482
- What excuse did you give him?
- Leave me alone!

287
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,887
- "Better thorns in the woods than..."
- Than up your -

288
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,005
If you'd wash your ears out, you'd hear
what your classmate is whispering.

289
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,525
Than up your ass.

290
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,922
- He's just trying to confuse me.
- All right, go on.

291
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,248
Now I've lost my place.

292
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,843
"Than flowers in the manger."

293
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,651
"Than flowers in the manger.
Better to have freedom..."

294
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,842
"And constant threat..."

295
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,247
"Than slavery..."

296
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,451
"In eternal April." And you're
an eternal loafer! You get an F.

297
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,329
I knew it at home.

298
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,410
Doinel?

299
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,011
Never mind, son.

300
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,690
Simonot.

301
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,120
"The Hare,"

302
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,441
by Jean Richepin.

303
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,648
Sit down, boys.

304
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,650
<i>I suggest the punishment
should be in proportion</i> -

305
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,247
<i>He's exceeded
all proportion this time.</i>

306
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,243
<i>Only his parents can
be severe enough now.</i>

307
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,290
<i>We'll discuss this tonight!</i>

308
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,084
What are you gonna do?

309
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,245
I can't live with my parents now
after what's happened.

310
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,602
I have to disappear.

311
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,564
Oh, I've done worse than this.

312
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,843
But I'm fed up.
I have to get out on my own.

313
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,287
I'll write them a letter.

314
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,362
- Just like that?
- Yes, it's for the best.

315
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,531
- Where will you sleep tonight?
- I don't know. I don't really care.

316
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,683
I've got an idea.

317
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,567
- Meet me in an hour at Place Pigalle.
- Okay.

318
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,727
It's my uncle's old printing plant.

319
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,241
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in.

320
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,323
Think it might cave in some more?

321
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,322
No, it already hit bottom.
You'll be warm here.

322
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,920
Here's your mattress,
and this'll be your pillow.

323
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,248
Damn, it's heavy!

324
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,171
You can just walk around
until midnight.

325
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,445
Keep my briefcase for me.
Give it back to me tomorrow.

326
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,250
Sure.

327
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,365
"Dear Mother and Dad, I understand -"
Misspelled, of course.

328
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,283
"How wrong it was to lie -"

329
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,045
<i>l'll</i> bet he does.
And why kill me off instead of you'?

330
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,009
Personal preference, obviously.

331
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,124
"We can't go on living together.

332
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,806
Therefore <i>l'll</i> try my luck alone
in Paris or elsewhere.

333
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,969
L'll prove I can become a man.

334
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,249
One day <i>l'll</i> come back
and we'll discuss all that's happened.

335
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,766
Love, Antoine."

336
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,042
So you think it's normal
for him to hate me?

337
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,482
- You've been so hard on him.
- He gets on my nerves.

338
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,847
- Can you help me catch him?
- Of course, ma'am.

339
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,804
- Is that your sister?
- Never seen her before.

340
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,645
- Is the dog hers?
- I don't know.

341
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,324
- May I help?
- Certainly. The more, the better.

342
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,688
- What's his name?
- I have no idea.

343
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,163
- Beat it, kid.
- She asked me first!

344
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,249
You heard me!

345
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,329
MERRY CHRISTMAS

346
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,089
Doinel, I bet you got it last night.

347
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,051
Not at all. Everything was fine.

348
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,964
Go on now.

349
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,761
Parents spoil these kids rotten.

350
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,806
Need some help over there?

351
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,962
The last question,

352
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,202
even easier this time.

353
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,520
Tip of the tongue between your teeth,
as if you had a lisp.

354
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,608
I can't do it, sir. Not everyone
can make their tongue do that.

355
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,331
Silence!

356
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,808
Go sit down.

357
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,771
Insolent!

358
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,967
Abbou.

359
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,448
Answer this question.

360
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,009
Be seated.

361
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,444
Frochot, you're in charge till I return.

362
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,044
We don't know
what to do with him anymore.

363
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,364
My dear lady, you deserve better.

364
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,522
My poor darling! Are you all right?

365
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,331
- Where did you spend the night?
- In a printing plant.

366
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,088
I don't care if he's last in his class.
I just want him to behave.

367
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,969
Then we're agreed.

368
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,325
Maybe it's something in his glands.

369
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,846
You mustn't catch cold.

370
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,321
There! Now off to bed.

371
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,203
I'm not tired, Mother.

372
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,803
You'll be more comfortable in our bed.

373
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,082
I was your age once too, you know.
You kids always forget that.

374
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,050
I was stubborn too and didn't want
to confide in my parents.

375
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,407
I preferred writing in my diary.

376
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,885
No one's ever read it.
I'll show it to you one day.

377
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,848
Once when I was your age,
we were on vacation,

378
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,810
and I ran away
with a young farm boy.

379
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,689
Puppy love.
They caught us right away.

380
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,042
Mother made me promise
never to see him again.

381
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,129
She never told my father.

382
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,129
I cried and cried, but I obeyed her,

383
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,007
because you should always obey
your mother.

384
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,766
You and I can share
some little secrets.

385
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,730
Tell me, what did you mean
in your letter when you said:

386
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,201
"We'll discuss all that's happened"?

387
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,090
My misbehaving, and my bad grades.

388
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,162
So talk to me now.

389
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,402
I just can't concentrate.

390
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,211
I want to quit school
and earn a living.

391
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,601
That's nonsense!
Don't you understand?

392
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,604
If you knew how sorry I am
I stopped after high school!

393
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,371
And your father never even finished!

394
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,882
It's hurting his career now.

395
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,129
I know they teach you
a lot of useless stuff in school.

396
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,720
Algebra... science.

397
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,882
Nobody uses that stuff in real life.

398
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,202
But what about French?

399
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,841
One always has letters to write.

400
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,441
Here's another secret
you and I can share.

401
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,123
If your next French essay

402
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,851
is in the top five,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

403
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,440
But you mustn't tell your father.

404
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,047
<i>"The dying man pulled himself up</i>

405
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,040
<i>and gave his children
a piercing look.</i>

406
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,084
<i>The hair bristled
on the nape of his neck.</i>

407
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,322
<i>His eyes lit up.</i>

408
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,086
<i>A breath caressed his face
and made it sublime.</i>

409
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,402
<i>He raised his hand in anger</i>

410
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,131
<i>and shouted Archimedes'
famous last words:</i>

411
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,851
<i>Eureka! I have found it."</i>

412
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,927
<i>Describe a serious event you witnessed
that involved you personally.</i>

413
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,041
<i>Eureka! I have found it.</i>

414
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:01,169
<i>"My Grandfather's Death."</i>

415
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,409
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary.

416
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,084
She's well-armed, that girl,

417
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,325
and she used it to get promoted
to executive secretary.

418
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,284
She has all the necessary talents
for the position.

419
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,161
Now I'll have to watch out for her.
Pillow talk and all that.

420
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,726
I showed her how to fudge a bit
on travel expense reports.

421
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,924
She'd only stay in three-star hotels.

422
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,405
By the way, I still haven't found
my Michelin guide.

423
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,168
One of you must have it.

424
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,410
- Don't start with your Michelin guide!
- I don't like mysteries!

425
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,007
- You left something on the stove again.
- No, I didn't.

426
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,127
What's got into him?

427
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,806
This is the last straw!

428
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,362
Stop shouting and get some water!

429
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,801
I've had it, you little idiot!

430
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,846
What got into you,
lighting a candle in there?

431
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,361
It was for Balzac.

432
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,729
- What do you take me for?
- It was for my French essay.

433
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,122
Leave him alone.
He promised me something.

434
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,045
What? To collect
on our fire insurance?

435
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,165
One candle won't do the job.
Here, try this!

436
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,042
As long as you're living under this roof,
you'll do as you're told.

437
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,887
Otherwise we've no other choice
but the military academy.

438
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,841
Know what that is?
They'll keep you in line, all right.

439
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,647
Know what we'll do
to lighten things up?

440
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,360
We'll all go to the movies.

441
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,246
Terrific.
Great way to teach him a lesson.

442
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,331
- Did you write a good essay?
- Not bad.

443
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,926
Julien.

444
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,371
You have to trust us.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

445
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,763
- No more surprises!
- So are you taking us to the movies?

446
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,684
<i>- What's showing?
- Paris Belongs to Us.</i>

447
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,208
- If this is a plot...
- Unless you'd rather stay home.

448
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,001
Me? I've worked hard.
I deserve to go out.

449
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,641
But they're not fond
of arsonists at the theater.

450
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,886
I never had strawberry
ice cream before!

451
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,008
Must have been out of season.

452
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,122
She sure had... you know...
she had quite a...

453
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,408
That's all you noticed, eh?

454
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,601
A lot of class!

455
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,130
Having a good time back there?

456
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,766
I really liked the movie.

457
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,842
It wasn't funny.

458
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,924
But it had depth.

459
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,083
- What?
- It had depth.

460
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,330
The movie.

461
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,329
Here we are.

462
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,683
General Daredevil and his army!

463
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,207
You're gonna wake the whole building.

464
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,971
Look what pretty legs
your mother has.

465
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,129
Home sweet home.
A bit smoky, eh?

466
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,363
Sweetie, get the garbage.
Be a good boy.

467
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,208
See? I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it.

468
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,486
Doinel, your paper is first today

469
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,924
only because I decided to return them
in order beginning with the worst.

470
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,530
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend.

471
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,561
To those less familiar with Balzac,
what we have here is <i>A Sinister Affair</i>.

472
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:31,122
That Doinel chose to write about
his grandfather's death was his right.

473
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,883
We know he doesn't hesitate
to sacrifice his relatives, if necessary.

474
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,650
It's not true, sir. I didn't cheat.

475
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,609
Judge for yourselves.

476
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,841
"The dying man pulled himself up

477
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,890
and gave his children
a piercing look.

478
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,885
The hair bristled
on the nape of his neck.

479
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,804
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime.

480
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,760
He raised his hand in anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words:

481
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,490
Eureka! I have found it!"

482
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,164
Well, I've found it, too, Doinel.

483
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,562
- You're a miserable plagiarist!
- It's not true, sir.

484
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,723
Go to the principal's office
this instant.

485
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,644
Take this and go with him.

486
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,647
I don't want to see you
back here this term!

487
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,689
What are you doing?

488
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,606
I sit next to him.
I would have seen it if he had copied.

489
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,724
- You want to be suspended as well?
- I wouldn't mind.

490
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,649
More insolence!

491
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,603
- Get out!
- I don't want to. Lt's cold outside.

492
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,531
- Get out of here!
- This is illegal.

493
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,442
I'll show you who makes the law here!

494
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,765
Illegal, huh?

495
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,522
- Did you take him to the principal?
- No, he ran away.

496
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,162
I socked him in the jaw and took off.

497
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,730
What about you?

498
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,565
Sourpuss was furious.
I'm suspended till after Christmas.

499
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,207
Poor guy. I'm sorry.

500
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,688
I can't go home now.
That's for sure.

501
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,968
My father said he'd send me
to the academy.

502
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,243
- What academy?
- Something to do with the military.

503
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,205
You'll have a uniform.
Besides, there's a future in the army.

504
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,411
Maybe, but not for me.
If only it were the navy!

505
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,531
I've never seen the ocean.

506
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,523
I've seen the English Channel,
the Atlantic,

507
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,444
and the Mediterranean,
but not the North Sea.

508
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,605
Come on, stay at my place.
We'll manage.

509
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,288
Holy cow, a horse!

510
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,164
One of my father's souvenirs.

511
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,447
This place is huge.

512
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,289
You can sleep here.
No one will know.

513
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,130
What about your parents?

514
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,202
They never come in here.

515
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,124
My mother drinks, and my father
spends all day at the races.

516
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,811
First off, we've got to think of a way
to make some money.

517
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,008
Right, that's the first thing to do.

518
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,728
Right. Meanwhile, I'll take
an advance on my inheritance.

519
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,804
Don't make any noise.
My mother's out there somewhere.

520
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,769
Anyone there?

521
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,804
Good day, ma'am!

522
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,650
Little wretch!

523
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,125
- Have you seen your mother lately?
- Yes, when I came home from school.

524
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,087
She makes sure
she's never home when I am.

525
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,647
She must be up to something.

526
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,289
Where's the fruit?

527
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,170
Take this.

528
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,362
Heavens, 9:30!
I'll be late to the club.

529
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,243
Hurry up, or we'll miss the newsreel.

530
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,964
Boy, I'm thirsty!

531
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,769
Damn! Lt's empty-

532
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,803
Your turn. Hurry up.

533
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,928
What did you get? Twelve?

534
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,685
My old man!

535
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,685
Help me shake the blankets
to get rid of the smoke.

536
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,204
That's enough.

537
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,929
What's this?
It's a smokehouse in here!

538
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,610
It's like a gambling joint!

539
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,366
I'm taking the cost of three cigars
out of your allowance.

540
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,167
What's this?
Bucephalus is not a coat rack.

541
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,925
He's worth a million at least.
A real work of art.

542
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,284
<i>L'll</i> only get rid of him
if I'm forced to.

543
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,169
Now put the lights out
and go to sleep.

544
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,129
Good night, Dad.

545
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,681
Not bad.

546
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,490
Oh. My gosh!

547
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,046
- Let me see your Michelin guide.
- A million would really do it.

548
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,289
It's my dad's horse.
He'd kill me for sure.

549
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,886
Don't be a wimp.
We could head for the beach,

550
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,566
set up a boat business,
and get everyone off our backs.

551
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,124
- We've got to decide.
- There's one in my dad's office.

552
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,845
Then let's get it.

553
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,127
We can't sell it.
They're all numbered.

554
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,489
But we can hock it.
My mom has hocked everything we own.

555
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,489
- How much?
- Ten percent.

556
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,324
- Okay.
- A thousand in advance.

557
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,485
- No, when you've got the money.
- Trusting guys, aren't you?

558
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,206
Give us back our machine!
Where do you think you're going?

559
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,807
- I thought you were down there.
- Sure you did.

560
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,122
Anyway, it's no go.
They want to see a receipt.

561
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,850
Then give it back.

562
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,129
- Fine, but I want 500 for my trouble.
- We don't have it.

563
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,086
You must have something.
Three hundred and we're even.

564
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,926
- We're broke.
- I don't work for nothing.

565
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,482
- L'll keep it as a deposit.
- The hell you will! Lt's ours!

566
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,042
- Give it back or I'll slug you.
- Hands off!

567
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,969
It's no more yours than mine.

568
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,884
There's a cop. Let's ask him.

569
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,807
Fine, keep the damned thing,
you little shits.

570
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,406
- I'm tired of carrying this!
- I had my turn.

571
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,530
- My dad's gonna know it was me.
- It was your idea.

572
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,842
- It was yours, asshole!
- Come on!

573
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,368
- I don't care. I'm leaving it here.
- Are you nuts?

574
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,080
I've got to take it back
to the office at least.

575
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,928
But I'm gonna wear a hat in case
the night watchman sees me.

576
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,323
Come on, take it back for me.

577
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,608
No, it wasn't my idea.

578
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,526
You're a real asshole.
At least hold it while I put on my hat.

579
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,722
And wait for me outside.

580
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,770
Well, if it isn't Doinel's son.
I must be seeing things!

581
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,726
Put that down.
Boy, is your daddy gonna love this!

582
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,564
I'll show them I know my job.

583
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,641
I'm warning you, don't try anything.

584
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,491
I don't like little punks like you.

585
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,491
Mr. Doinel, forgive me
for bothering you.

586
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,164
You better come here, sir.

587
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,684
Let's say it's a surprise...
but not a pleasant one.

588
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,648
Don't touch that hat!

589
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,691
It's no party I'm taking you to
this time.

590
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,362
The games are over. Your mother
and I will finally have some peace.

591
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,848
Take a good look at your pal,

592
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,964
'cause you won't be
seeing him again for a while.

593
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,565
Maybe this'll straighten you out.
This had to end sooner or later.

594
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,963
If I had done this at your age,
my father would have killed me!

595
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,523
May we see the chief?

596
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,689
We've tried everything:
Kindness, persuasion, punishment.

597
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,649
But we never beat him, mind you.

598
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,963
- Sometimes the good old ways -
- Of course.

599
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,851
But his mother and I aren't like that.

600
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,687
- We gave him a lot of freedom.
- Too much, perhaps.

601
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,960
And with both of us working -
You know how it is.

602
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,486
Yes, I'm a father too.

603
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,047
I must admit it's not always easy.

604
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,964
If only he'd talk to us.

605
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,327
But when we talk to him,
he's a thousand miles away.

606
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,528
You think he's listening now?

607
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,082
Here's how I found him
with the typewriter.

608
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,606
Who knows what goes on
in that head of his!

609
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,886
Take this boy's statement.

610
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,441
Vagrancy and theft.

611
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,809
Come with me.

612
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,728
What have you decided?

613
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,325
We can't take him back home now.
He'll just run away again.

614
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,441
Perhaps you could place him somewhere,
like a camp in the country?

615
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,810
And put him to work,
'cause he won't study anymore.

616
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,726
We can try the Observation Center.

617
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,407
It's well organized,
and <i>he'll</i> learn a skill.

618
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,724
- It'll do him good.
- Assuming there's room, of course.

619
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,649
And you'd have to transfer
your parental rights.

620
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,801
Yes, to the juvenile justice system.

621
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,083
He'll appear in juvenile court tomorrow.

622
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,528
You or your wife must be present.

623
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,971
Did anyone see you enter the building?

624
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,803
"I hereby declare that,
having entered the premises..."

625
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,569
"...a typewriter."

626
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,281
Sign here.

627
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,768
Charles, he's all yours.

628
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,209
This way.

629
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,766
You take him from here.
I'm going home.

630
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,283
What did you do?

631
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,041
I ran away from home.

632
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,050
What about you?

633
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,570
Oh, you know...

634
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,481
<i>Here come the girls.</i>

635
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,365
I saw a police station in a movie once.
It was a lot cleaner.

636
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,962
- I saw one that was a lot dirtier.
- I've seen more cheerful ones.

637
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,281
The coach is here.

638
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,964
Put on your jacket.

639
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,487
Tie, belt and shoelaces.
Empty your pockets.

640
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,484
Sign here.

641
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,529
Sign here.

642
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,530
We could try taking him back
if we had to,

643
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,285
but he'd have to change
his ways entirely.

644
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,966
If only you could scare some sense
into him, Your Honor.

645
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,283
- That's not my role.
- We can't control him.

646
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,285
Perhaps you exercise control
too inconsistently.

647
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,649
Is it true he was left home alone
for an entire weekend?

648
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,446
My husband belongs to a racing club.

649
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,121
We might have left him home alone.

650
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,770
Besides, he hates sports.

651
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,208
He prefers to hole up in a theater
for hours, ruining his eyes.

652
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,367
What does your husband think?
It's his son, after all.

653
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,924
Well, no, he isn't.

654
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,929
He married me when the boy was small.

655
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,123
He deserves credit for that.

656
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,010
- I shouldn't have told you that.
- On the contrary.

657
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,285
I think we'd best put the boy
in an observation center.

658
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,729
Could it be near the seashore,
Your Honor?

659
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,611
It's not a vacation resort, ma'am.

660
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,009
<i>L'll</i> do my best,
depending on what's available.

661
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,443
He'll stay there a few months
while I study his case.

662
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,961
Then we'll make a decision.

663
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,166
Believe me, this change
can only do him good.

664
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,841
Good-bye, Your Honor.

665
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,205
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR DELINQUENT YOUTH

666
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,890
- Why are you in here?
- Oh, you know. What about you?

667
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,964
- I messed up.
- I stole a typewriter.

668
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,607
A typewriter?
That wasn't too smart.

669
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,771
No wonder you got caught.
They all have serial numbers.

670
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,409
See that big guy over there?
He stole tires off cars.

671
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,280
Whenever I'd cry,

672
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:04,042
my father would imitate me
on his violin, just to bug me.

673
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,927
But one day I snapped
and just knocked him out cold.

674
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,845
Good for you. If my old man
did that to me, I'd kill him.

675
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,124
<i>- Look!
- Who's that guy?</i>

676
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,488
<i>He escaped a week ago,
but they got him.</i>

677
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,208
<i>Around here, to escape is bad enough,
but to get caught is worse.</i>

678
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,526
What are you doing there?
Two lines, on the double!

679
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,930
What are you up to there?
Now march!

680
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,762
Show me your bread.

681
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,925
Good.

682
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,443
I see you started already.

683
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,927
Bring your bread and plate over here.

684
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,125
Put them down.

685
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,129
Right hand or left?

686
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,489
Left, sir.

687
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,642
<i>No talking!</i>

688
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,291
This is for you.

689
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,047
I bet they'd catch you, and I won.

690
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,008
So what? I lived it up for five days,

691
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,521
and I'm ready to try it again
first chance I get.

692
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,564
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

693
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,006
Kanayan, your turn
to see the psychologist.

694
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,043
If she drops her pen, pick it up,

695
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,846
but don't look at her legs,
or else it goes in your file.

696
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,525
What file?

697
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,849
You know, what everyone thinks of you:
The judge, the doctor,

698
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,082
even your neighbors back home.

699
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,601
I know mine by heart.

700
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,970
It says I'm unstable,
with perverted tendencies.

701
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,322
What if I talk nonsense
just to confuse them?

702
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,366
Then it's the funny farm
or boot camp.

703
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,888
<i>Why did you return the typewriter?</i>

704
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:25,688
Well, since I couldn't sell it
or anything, I got scared.

705
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,649
I don't know why I returned it.
Just 'cause.

706
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,729
<i>It seems you stole 10,000 francs
from your grandmother.</i>

707
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,327
She had invited me for her birthday.

708
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,560
I thought since she's old and doesn't
eat much, she doesn't need the money.

709
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,205
She was going to die soon.

710
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,161
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I swiped some.

711
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,049
I knew she wouldn't notice,
and she didn't.

712
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:55,762
She gave me a nice book that day.

713
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,809
But my mother,
she used to go through my pockets.

714
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,167
I left my pants on the bed that night,

715
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:08,406
and she must have found the money in
my pocket, 'cause next day it was gone.

716
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,169
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it.

717
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,847
And then she took the nice book away
my grandmother gave me.

718
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,971
One day I asked for it back,

719
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,971
and I found out she'd sold it.

720
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,086
<i>Your parents say you're always lying.</i>

721
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,003
Oh, I lie now and then, I suppose.

722
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,409
Sometimes I'd tell them the truth
and they still wouldn't believe me,

723
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,687
so I prefer to lie.

724
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,161
<i>Why don't you like your mother?</i>

725
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,164
Well, first she sent me
to live with a wet nurse.

726
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,443
Then, when they had no more money,
they sent me to my grandmother.

727
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,491
But she got old and
couldn't take care of me anymore,

728
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,327
so, when I was eight,
I went back to live with my parents.

729
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,967
I could tell Mother didn't like me.

730
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,960
She was always yelling at me
for no reason.

731
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,369
There were fights at home,

732
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,531
and I overheard

733
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:16,647
that my mother had me
before she was married.

734
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,329
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once.

735
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,571
That's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion.

736
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,041
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born.

737
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,164
<i>Have you ever slept with a girl?</i>

738
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,765
No, but some friends of mine have.

739
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,324
They told me where
the hookers hang out.

740
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,651
So I went and tried
to pick up some girls,

741
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,003
but they all yelled at me
so I got scared and I left.

742
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,481
I went back a couple times.

743
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,360
Once a man saw me and asked me
what I was doing there.

744
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,410
He was North African.
So I told him.

745
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:04,528
I guess he knew a lot of women,
and he said he knew one

746
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,088
who liked guys my age.

747
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,127
So he took me to her hotel,

748
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,125
only she wasn't there that day.

749
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,046
We waited an hour or two,
but she didn't show up, so I left.

750
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,407
René!

751
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,441
Don't look for your father.
I came alone.

752
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,409
Is it that way?

753
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,687
Your letter to your father
hurt him very much.

754
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,931
You were naive to think
he wouldn't show it to me.

755
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,651
In spite of appearances,
we're a devoted couple,

756
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,646
and it wasn't smart to remind him
of some unhappy days I went through.

757
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,485
Thanks to him, you have a name.

758
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:07,211
We were ready to take you back,

759
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,602
but the neighbors' gossip
put an end to that.

760
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,088
You must have told
everyone in the neighborhood!

761
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,242
I never said a word, Mother.

762
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,166
But I'm used to it. I've been
criticized by imbeciles all my life.

763
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,091
Anyway, that's all I had to tell you.

764
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,607
And don't go crying to your father.

765
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,526
He said to let you know he's washed
his hands of you completely.

766
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,401
All you're good for now is
reform school or a labor center.

767
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,050
You wanted to earn your living?

768
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,329
Now we'll see how you like it.

769
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,045
THE END
