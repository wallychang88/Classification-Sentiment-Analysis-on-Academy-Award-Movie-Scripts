1
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,392
Hey. Pull up at the corner.

2
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,113
Wait here.

3
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,539
How.

4
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,830
Good afternoon, sir.

5
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,776
Yes?

6
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:02,778
I'd like to see the boss. What'd you say his name is?

7
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:05,491
- I didn't say. - Cagey, huh?

8
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,033
Mr Boot is the owner and publisher.

9
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,370
Okay. Tell Mr Boot Mr Tatum would like to see him.

10
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,873
Charles Tatum from New York.

11
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,553
What about?

12
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,501
Look, fan, just ask him,

13
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:20,843
how would he like to make himself a fast $200 a week?

14
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,716
What did you say you were selling? Insurance?

15
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,480
I didn't say.

16
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:27,642
Cagey, huh?

17
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:55,289
Now, isn't that something? Who said it?

18
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,429
Well, Mr Boot said it, but I did the needlework.

19
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,752
Oh!

20
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,963
- Okay. - I wish I could coin them like that.

21
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,226
If I ever do, would you embroider it for me?

22
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,431
- Mr Tatum? - Yes, sir.

23
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:13,808
Go ahead. What is it?

24
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:16,310
Well, Mr Boot, I was passing through Albuquerque.

25
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,188
Had breakfast here. Read your paper.

26
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,898
Thought you might be interested in my reaction.

27
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,370
- You bet I am. - Well, sir, it made me throw up.

28
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,905
I don't want you to think I expected The New York Times.

29
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,908
But even for Albuquerque, this is pretty Albuquerque.

30
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,743
All right. Here's your nickel back.

31
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,704
Now, what's all this about my making $200 a week?

32
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,415
Apparently, you're not familiar with my name.

33
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,666
Can't say that I am.

34
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,835
That's because you don't get the eastern papers out here.

35
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,002
I thought maybe once in a while

36
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,712
somebody would toss one out of the Super Chief

37
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,673
and you might've seen my byline.

38
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:49,635
Charles Tatum? Worked New York, Chicago, Detroit...

39
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,894
- What about the $200? - I was coming to that.

40
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,322
Mr Boot, I'm a $250-a-week newspaperman.

41
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,604
- I can be had for $50. - Why are you so good to me?

42
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,107
I know newspapers backward, forward and sideways.

43
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,693
I can write them, edit them, print them, wrap them and sell them.

44
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:08,988
- Don't need anybody right now. - I can handle big news and little news.

45
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:12,662
And if there's no news, I'll go out and bite a dog.

46
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:17,466
- Make it $45. - What makes you so cheap?

47
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:22,585
A fair question, considering I've been top man wherever I've worked.

48
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,879
You'll be glad to know that I've been fired from 11 papers

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,590
with a total circulation of seven million,

50
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,176
for reasons with which I don't want to bore you.

51
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,224
Go ahead. Bore me.

52
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:39,894
I'm a pretty good liar. I've done a lot of lying in my time.

53
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:42,897
I've lied to men who wear belts. I've lied to men who wear suspenders.

54
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,690
But I'd never be so stupid as to lie to a man

55
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:47,401
who wears both belt and suspenders.

56
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:50,988
- How's that again? - You strike me as a cautious man.

57
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,699
A man who checks and double-checks.

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,951
So I'll tell you why I was fired.

59
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:58,496
In New York, a story of mine brought on a libel suit.

60
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:02,458
In Chicago, I started something with the publisher's wife.

61
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,710
In Detroit, I was caught drinking out of season.

62
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,553
- In Cleveland... - I get the picture.

63
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:11,300
Now, then I find myself in Albuquerque with no money.

64
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:15,188
A burnt-out bearing, bad tyres and a lousy reputation.

65
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,014
Bad tyres can be dangerous.

66
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:19,266
I've only one chance to get back where I belong.

67
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:21,811
To land a job on a small-town paper like yours

68
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:25,022
and wait and hope and pray for something big to break,

69
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,066
something I can latch on to,

70
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,528
something the wire services will gobble up and yell for more.

71
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,459
Just one good beat, a Tatum special, and they'll roll out the red carpet.

72
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,620
Because when they need you, they forgive and forget.

73
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:40,746
But until then, Mr Boot,

74
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:44,670
you'll get yourself the best newspaperman you ever had.

75
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,931
- At $40 per. When do I start? - Don't push.

76
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,133
- I hope I haven't scared you off. - Well, I don't know.

77
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:55,219
I'm not afraid of a libel suit, because I'm a lawyer myself.

78
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,304
Check and double-check every word I print.

79
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,973
Sure. Belt and suspenders.

80
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:00,558
Now, about that publisher's wife,

81
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,394
I think you should know Mrs Boot is a grandmother three times.

82
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,272
If you wanna start something with her, she'd be very flattered.

83
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,649
And as for drinking, do you drink a lot?

84
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,484
Not a lot. Just frequently.

85
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:13,821
We have a shop rule here, no liquor on the premises.

86
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,073
- How about smoking? - Of course.

87
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:19,048
And I pay $60 a week in this shop.

88
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,758
I'll take it.

89
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,916
Where's my desk?

90
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:29,887
The one by the door. You may be out of here by Saturday.

91
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,011
The sooner the better.

92
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:03,505
Thanks, Geronimo. Take these over to the engraver's.

93
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,539
What's this mess?

94
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,124
They haven't got any chopped chicken livers.

95
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,626
I brought you some chicken tacos.

96
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,002
Chicken tacos?

97
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,796
They're not gonna chop the livers any more for you.

98
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:15,636
Nobody else will buy them. And no more garlic pickles.

99
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,472
When the history of this sun-baked Siberia is written,

100
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:24,308
these shameful words will live in infamy.

101
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,772
"No chopped chicken liver."

102
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,868
"No garlic pickles."

103
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:35,532
No Lindy's. No Madison Square Garden.

104
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,542
No Yogi Berra.

105
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,242
What do you know about Yogi Berra, Miss Deverich?

106
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:43,577
- I beg your pardon? - Yogi Berra!

107
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,747
Yogi? Why, it's a sort of religion, isn't it?

108
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:50,635
You bet it is. A belief in the New York Yankees.

109
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,380
You know what's wrong with New Mexico, Mr Wendel?

110
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,428
Too much outdoors.

111
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:01,804
Give me those eight spindly trees in front of Rockefeller Center any day.

112
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:04,398
That's enough outdoors for me.

113
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:08,356
No subways smelling sweet-sour.

114
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:12,690
What do you use for noise around here?

115
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,276
No beautiful roar from eight million ants,

116
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:17,657
fighting, cursing, loving.

117
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,664
No shows. No South Pacific.

118
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:26,296
No chic little dames across a crowded bar.

119
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,248
And worst of all, Herbie,

120
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,803
no 80th floor to jump from when you feel like it.

121
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,713
Is this one of your long-playing records, Chuck?

122
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:38,094
Let's hear the other side.

123
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,470
All right. I'll play it for you.

124
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:46,599
When I came here, I thought this was gonna be a 30-day stretch, maybe 60.

125
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,517
Now it's a year.

126
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,686
It looks like a life sentence.

127
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:54,482
Where is it? Where's the loaf of bread with a file in it?

128
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:57,823
Where's that big story to get me out of here?

129
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:01,489
One year, and what's our hot news?

130
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,454
A soapbox derby.

131
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:08,213
A tornado that double-crossed us and went to Texas.

132
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:12,208
An old goof who said he was the real Jesse James,

133
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,460
until they found out he was a chicken thief from Gallup

134
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,256
by the name of Schimmelmacher.

135
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:22,596
I'm stuck here, fans. Stuck for good!

136
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,222
Unless, of course, you, Miss Deverich,

137
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:28,307
Unless, of course, you, Miss Deverich,

138
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,267
instead of writing household hints

139
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,270
about how to remove chilli stains from blue jeans,

140
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,446
get yourself involved in a trunk murder.

141
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,943
How about it, Miss Deverich?

142
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:42,332
I could do wonders with your dismembered body.

143
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,290
Oh, Mr Tatum. Really.

144
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,501
Or you, Mr Wendel.

145
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,874
If you'd only toss that cigar out of the window,

146
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:58,671
real far, all the way to Los Alamos,

147
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,304
and boom!

148
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,721
Now there would be a story.

149
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,141
I told you no liquor in the office. I thought I could trust you.

150
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:13,400
What a suspicious nature you have, Mr Boot.

151
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,399
Pretty, isn't it? I make those things

152
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,026
every night when I go home out of matches and toothpicks.

153
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,956
Calms my nerves.

154
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,576
Sorry, Tatum.

155
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,826
- Maybe you do need a change. - Do I.

156
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:32,955
And I got news for you. You're going out of town for a couple of days.

157
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:35,875
- How far and in what direction? - Los Barrios county.

158
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,586
They're having a rattlesnake hunt, and I want you to cover it.

159
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:40,629
- A rattlesnake hunt? - That's right.

160
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,716
And take Herbie along. Let's get some art.

161
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:47,428
A rattlesnake hunt. Well, isn't that ginger-peachy?

162
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,014
A real "stop the press, pull out the front page",

163
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,599
"get ready to re-plate" assignment.

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,726
Have a nice time, Chuck. See the country.

165
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,949
And don't worry, I'll put the paper to bed.

166
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:03,789
Well, it looks like we're starting our second year with a real bang.

167
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,083
Okay, fan, pack up.

168
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,833
You know, this could be a pretty good story, Chuck.

169
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,794
Don't sell it short.

170
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,962
It's quite a sight, 1,000 rattlers in the underbrush,

171
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,757
and a lot of men smoking them out, bashing in their heads.

172
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:28,229
Big deal, 1,000 rattlers in the underbrush.

173
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:34,438
Give me just 50 of them loose in Albuquerque.

174
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,686
Like that leopard in Oklahoma City.

175
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,980
The whole town in panic.

176
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,990
Deserted streets. Barricaded houses.

177
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,945
They're evacuating the children.

178
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:48,041
Every man is armed.

179
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:51,369
Fifty killers on the prowl. Fifty.

180
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:55,216
One by one, they start hunting them down.

181
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,301
They get 10, 20.

182
00:12:57,624 --> 00:13:00,882
It's building. They get 40, 45. They get 49.

183
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,424
Where's the last rattler?

184
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:08,426
In a kindergarten? In a church? In a crowded elevator? Where?

185
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:10,439
I give up. Where?

186
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,523
In my desk drawer, fan.

187
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,017
Stashed away, only nobody knows it, see?

188
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,103
The story's good for another three days.

189
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:22,148
Then when I'm good and ready, we come out with a big extra.

190
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,778
"Sun-Bulletin snags number 50."

191
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,531
Where do you get those ideas?

192
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,496
Herbie, boy, how long did you go to that school of journalism?

193
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,339
Three years.

194
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:37,005
Three years down the drain.

195
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:41,625
Me, I didn't go to any college, but I know what makes a good story.

196
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,210
Because before I ever worked on a paper,

197
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,296
I sold them on a street corner.

198
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:49,646
You know the first thing I found out? Bad news sells best.

199
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,562
Because good news is no news.

200
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:56,645
Better get some gas.

201
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:19,174
Hey! Anybody here?

202
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,509
Hey!

203
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:36,938
Service!

204
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:45,445
Anybody home?

205
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,667
Sorry to bother you, lady.

206
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,714
I'd like to buy some gas.

207
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,232
Hey, there's something screwy about this place.

208
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,245
There's just an old lady in there that's...

209
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:44,123
Now, what would the law be doing up there in that old Indian cliff dwelling?

210
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:47,376
Maybe they got a warrant for Sitting Bull for that Custer rap.

211
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:50,045
Come on, Herbie, let's go visiting. It's for free.

212
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,173
I can get the gas on the way back.

213
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,008
That is, if she's stopped praying.

214
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,051
- Who? - That old lady in there.

215
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,762
What's she praying for?

216
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:02,349
I don't know, but whatever she's praying for she's sure praying hard.

217
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,146
Maybe it ties in. Let's see.

218
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,954
Oh, I thought you were the doctor.

219
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,414
What's the matter? Somebody hurt?

220
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:28,667
We don't know yet. He's way in there, under that mountain.

221
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:31,170
- What happened? - We had a cave-in this morning.

222
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,880
Oh. That so?

223
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,007
Dumb cluck. Everybody keeps telling him,

224
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,134
"Stay out of that place. Stay out of there."

225
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:39,011
Not Leo. Stubborn like a mule.

226
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:41,847
He always keeps going back, digging for those Indian pots.

227
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:44,192
- Who's Leo? - My husband.

228
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,027
Oh.

229
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:50,658
Well, I'm sorry to hear about it. Hop in.

230
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,171
- You live around here? - Yeah.

231
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:06,872
I'm Mrs Leo Minosa.

232
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,792
We own that trading post down on the highway.

233
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:12,588
Finest store in downtown Escudero.

234
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:15,798
Is that what they call this place? Escudero?

235
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,342
Got a couple of other names for it myself.

236
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:22,138
Did the Indians really live in that place 450 years ago?

237
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,015
I wouldn't know. I haven't been around that long.

238
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,148
Only seems that long.

239
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,354
Say, if you gents stopped by to see that broken-down cliff dwelling,

240
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,815
you sure picked a swell day.

241
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,734
All right, let's have the facts. You're his father?

242
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,694
Yes. I'm his father.

243
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:40,700
- How long has he been inside? - Pretty near six hours now.

244
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,742
How far down you think he is?

245
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:46,746
Oh, about 250 or 300 foot, I should judge.

246
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:49,582
Best we could do was to get in about halfway.

247
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,461
You got to watch yourself. Swing that pick too hard in them old walls,

248
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:56,380
you start a sand slide and block up the whole place.

249
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,429
Then goodbye, Leo.

250
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,264
Is that coffee good and hot, Lorraine?

251
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,058
Sure, it's hot. The sandwiches are in the blanket. So are the cigars.

252
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,394
- How's Mama? - All right, I guess.

253
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:13,731
- How do I find my way? - Just follow our rope. We left it in there.

254
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,609
After that, holler. He'll yell back.

255
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,705
Wait a minute, you.

256
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,238
Nobody goes no place here without I say so.

257
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,325
He's cold. He's hungry. We've got to let him know we're doing something.

258
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:27,203
Look, I got my hands full already without having two of you in there.

259
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,331
- Somebody's got to go. - How about those Indians?

260
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:33,918
What do you say, chief? You ought to know your way around here pretty well.

261
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,337
They won't go in. They never do.

262
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:38,464
- Bad spirits. - Ah, go on.

263
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,762
What are you holding out for, a couple of bucks?

264
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,178
He says it's their holy mountain. The mountain of the seven vultures.

265
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,680
He says it's their holy mountain. The mountain of the seven vultures.

266
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:51,114
The mountain of the seven vultures. It's got a sound to it.

267
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,906
Get me a few shots, Herbie.

268
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,571
Looks like it's your move, copper. What's it gonna be?

269
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,657
I'm thinking. Don't rush me. I'll do something.

270
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:09,745
You could always give that poor fellow in there a ticket for parking overtime.

271
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,038
Let me have those things.

272
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,331
Who do you think you are butting in like this?

273
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:13,999
- Let me have your flashlight. - Who is he?

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,627
I'll tell you who I am. I'm the guy who's going in that cave.

275
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,546
And you're the guy that's been sounding off long enough.

276
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,755
Now give me your flashlight.

277
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:21,934
- Why, you... - Shut up.

278
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,104
Come on, Herbie.

279
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,513
Thanks, mister, and God bless you.

280
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:29,598
Tell him we'll get him out. Tell him not to worry.

281
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,766
- Sure. - Okay.

282
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,977
And tell him we'll have a big coming-out party for him

283
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:35,738
with a brass band and everything.

284
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,397
Here's the rope.

285
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,856
I hope we can get to him.

286
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,350
Yeah.

287
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,819
Watch out for those rocks.

288
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,867
The old man sure looked bad.

289
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:32,379
- Did you see his face? - Yeah.

290
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:36,540
Like the faces of those folks you see outside a coal mine

291
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,337
with maybe 84 men trapped inside.

292
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,223
One man's better than 84. Didn't they teach you that?

293
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:46,183
- Teach me what? - Human interest.

294
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:51,013
You pick up the paper, you read about 84 men or 284,

295
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:53,265
or a million men, like in the Chinese famine.

296
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:56,018
You read it, but it doesn't stay with you.

297
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,147
One man's different. You wanna know all about him. That's human interest.

298
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:04,276
Somebody all by himself, like Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic

299
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,290
or Floyd Collins.

300
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,697
Floyd Collins. Doesn't that ring a bell?

301
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,126
No, not to me, it doesn't.

302
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:13,077
You never heard of Floyd Collins?

303
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:15,287
1925. Kentucky.

304
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:17,253
The guy pinned way down in that cave.

305
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,333
One of the biggest stories that ever broke.

306
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:23,007
Front page in every paper in the country for weeks.

307
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:26,560
Say, what'd you take at that school of journalism, advertising?

308
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:29,260
Well, maybe I did hear about it.

309
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:31,679
Then maybe you heard that a reporter on a Louisville paper

310
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,851
crawled in for the story and came out with a Pulitzer Prize.

311
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:55,494
Guess we'd better not fool around with that.

312
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,460
Here. Hold this.

313
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,347
Now let me have it.

314
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:13,394
And camera.

315
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:17,525
You got a couple of bulbs?

316
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,493
You stay here.

317
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:27,026
That sand gets any worse, let me hear from you, but loud.

318
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:29,361
I don't like the looks of it, Chuck.

319
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,458
I don't either, fan.

320
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:35,122
But I like the odds.

321
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,771
Hello!

322
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:04,606
Hello!

323
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,281
Here!

324
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,706
Over here.

325
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,927
Here.

326
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:30,720
Over here.

327
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,692
Hello, Leo. How do you feel?

328
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:51,235
Not so bad any more.

329
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,571
I thought nobody would ever come.

330
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:56,367
Anything hurt? Any bones broken?

331
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,039
No, I guess not.

332
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:00,911
Can't you get your legs out from under?

333
00:24:00,912 --> 00:24:03,789
What do you think I've been trying to do?

334
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,499
They're pinned under me.

335
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,596
Maybe I can help.

336
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,802
Hey, watch it! Watch it!

337
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,634
You want those rocks to come down on my head?

338
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:17,845
I didn't know they were that shaky.

339
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:20,190
They're all pretty shaky.

340
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:23,225
It's an old place been coming apart for a long time.

341
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,478
Looks like we'll have to take them out one by one.

342
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:29,482
Don't try it by yourself. It's gonna take a lot of figuring.

343
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:32,777
The way they are now, if one goes, they'll all go, roof and everything.

344
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:35,324
I see what you mean. Well, here.

345
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:38,374
Wrap yourself in this blanket.

346
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:42,172
And get some of this hot coffee inside of you.

347
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,548
Thanks, mister.

348
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:47,291
- Cigar. - Your wife sent them.

349
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:51,337
She did? That's funny. She always beefs when I smoke a cigar.

350
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,048
- Hey, what's your name, mister? - Charlie Tatum.

351
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:57,936
Just driving by the trading post when I heard about it.

352
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:00,262
Hey, what happened to those other fellows?

353
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,139
I heard them, but they went away.

354
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,682
Why don't they do something about getting me out?

355
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:06,894
Easy, Leo. They'll get you out. But you know what you just said.

356
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:09,730
It takes figuring, maybe some special equipment.

357
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:11,398
They're not gonna leave me here overnight?

358
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,528
They'll do it as fast as they can, but they got to do it right.

359
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:19,368
Yeah, I know. Only that's a pretty heavy mountain.

360
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,664
Tell me, Leo. How'd it happen?

361
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:23,160
I...

362
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:27,540
I guess I crawled in too far this time. You've got to, to find a good one.

363
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,762
Back there, it's pretty well cleaned out.

364
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:35,094
But I found me a beauty. Worth 50 bucks any day.

365
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:39,596
Just then the whole floor caved in under me.

366
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,520
I guess maybe they didn't want me to have it.

367
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,725
They? Who are they?

368
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:50,482
The Indian dead. They're all around here.

369
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:54,316
This is a tomb, mister, with mummies 400 years old.

370
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:57,361
They used to bury them here with these jars alongside,

371
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:59,405
you know, full of corn and wampum.

372
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:02,082
That's worthwhile knowing, Leo. Go on.

373
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,084
I...

374
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,454
I guess maybe they've been watching me all the time

375
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:08,706
I've been taking things out of here and got mad.

376
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:10,671
Bad spirits, huh?

377
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:16,547
I guess you're gonna laugh at me, think I'm crazy.

378
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,467
But when you lie down here all by yourself, you get to thinking.

379
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:21,385
Do me a favour, will you?

380
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:24,894
Hold up that jar again. And look at me.

381
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:27,892
- Hey, what are you doing? - Taking your picture.

382
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:29,525
What for?

383
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,354
- Gonna put it in the paper. - What kind of paper?

384
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,482
In a newspaper in Albuquerque.

385
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:35,983
- My picture? - Certainly.

386
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:39,236
- Honest? - Everybody'll want to see how you look.

387
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:41,447
And I'm gonna write a story. They'll wanna know all about you.

388
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:42,656
They'll be pulling for you.

389
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:45,535
How do you like that? Me in a paper.

390
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,258
- Let's take another one, Leo. - Oh, let me wipe my face first.

391
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:51,964
Hold it.

392
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,085
And don't say anything about those Indian spirits.

393
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:55,795
I don't want anybody to think I'm scared.

394
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,425
Don't worry, Leo. I'm your pal.

395
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:02,343
I know. That's why I can talk to you.

396
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:04,190
Sure, you can.

397
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:07,973
You know, in the army, I was plenty scared, too.

398
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,188
Like when my outfit landed in Italy.

399
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:15,488
Only in the army, it's different. There, everybody's scared.

400
00:27:16,316 --> 00:27:19,455
Your barge is gonna land. You know you're gonna die.

401
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:23,543
And then a guy starts singing, soft-like.

402
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:29,332
Then a guy next to you starts singing. Pretty soon, you're singing, too.

403
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,666
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

404
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,502
And a brawla, brawla sooit

405
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:38,599
Hut-Sut Rawlson

406
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,217
Well, it worked, didn't it? Nothing happened to you.

407
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:46,689
Not a thing, except I got the mumps in Naples.

408
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,974
Well, you light yourself a cigar, Leo. I gotta say so long.

409
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,684
I certainly wish you could stay a while longer.

410
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:55,062
So do I. But there's a lot to do outside getting things organised.

411
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:57,858
Well, you wanna get out, don't you?

412
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,485
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

413
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:03,738
None of that. Come on, Leo.

414
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:06,657
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

415
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:08,421
And a...

416
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:10,995
I said come on now. All together.

417
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:13,789
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

418
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,709
And a brawla, brawla sooit

419
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,336
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

420
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:22,089
And a brawla sooit

421
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,633
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

422
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,803
And a brawla, brawla sooit

423
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:30,306
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

424
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:32,568
And a brawla...

425
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,983
The brawla is the boy and girl

426
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,617
The Hut...

427
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:50,618
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

428
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:53,287
And a brawla, brawla sooit

429
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:56,332
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

430
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,834
And a brawla sooit

431
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:01,045
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

432
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,631
What's the idea? Have you gone nuts?

433
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:06,634
Just a couple of pals singing. What's wrong with that?

434
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,179
I got me some pictures, fan. Guard them with your life.

435
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,192
Let's get moving.

436
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:18,604
What happened?

437
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:21,607
- Aren't you gonna tell me? - Quiet, Herbie. Quiet.

438
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,192
I'm writing the lead to the story.

439
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,786
- Well, what is the story? - Big.

440
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:30,415
As big as they come, I think. Maybe bigger than Floyd Collins.

441
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,584
- Floyd Collins plus. - Plus what?

442
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,800
Plus King Tut. You remember that one, don't you?

443
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,545
The curse of the old Egyptian pharaoh when they came to rob his tomb?

444
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:46,764
How's that for an angle? "King Tut in New Mexico."

445
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:52,473
"Curse of the old Indian chief. White man half buried by angry spirits."

446
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:57,893
"What will they do? Will they spare him? Will they crush him?"

447
00:29:57,894 --> 00:30:01,313
Give it to me straight, Chuck. How does it look? Can they get him out?

448
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:03,691
- Certainly. - Well, how soon?

449
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:05,455
I don't know.

450
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,532
Floyd Collins lasted 18 days.

451
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:11,959
I don't need 18 days.

452
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:15,037
If I just had one week of this...

453
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:18,836
- Oh, brother. - You're kidding, Chuck.

454
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,334
You don't really wish for anything like that.

455
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,336
I'm not wishing for anything.

456
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:28,390
I don't make things happen. All I do is write about them.

457
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,772
- Did you reach him? - I saw him.

458
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,648
- I talked to him. - Couldn't you bring him out? Is he alive?

459
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:46,358
You can be sure of one thing, we'll get him out.

460
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,526
Today? Tonight?

461
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,403
I'm afraid not. There's nothing we can do here tonight.

462
00:30:49,404 --> 00:30:50,571
Tomorrow?

463
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,698
As soon as we get an engineering crew on the job.

464
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:57,416
And I'm gonna get them, Mr Minosa, the best. And I'll get that doctor.

465
00:30:58,705 --> 00:30:59,955
And the sheriff, too.

466
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,957
The sheriff's tied up in Los Barrios until Monday.

467
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,127
- You better talk to me. - Tied up in Los Barrios, huh?

468
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:08,839
I'll bet he's at that rattlesnake hunt. Chances are the doctor, too.

469
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,093
How do you like that? A man could be dying here, and...

470
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:15,221
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Minosa. - I know all about that sheriff.

471
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:19,100
He stops in every week for a steak dinner and never picks up the cheque.

472
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:21,852
He'll be here. They'll all be here.

473
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:25,158
The sheriff, the doctor, the engineer.

474
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:27,900
- You got a phone at the trading post? - Yeah.

475
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:31,657
Let's get started. We got a lot of telephoning to do.

476
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,293
- The phone's inside. - Okay.

477
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,209
Fill her up, Herbie. You're going back to town.

478
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,890
All right.

479
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,638
Over there.

480
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,885
There's the doctor's number. Dr Hilton.

481
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:57,017
The sheriff's number's there, too.

482
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:01,403
Oh, that's the sheriff, huh? Gus Kretzer.

483
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,311
We'll get some action here. You'll see.

484
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:05,980
By tomorrow, this place will be jumping

485
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:09,400
if I have to call Santa Fe and get the Governor out of bed.

486
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,737
Oh, would it be too much trouble to put me up for the night?

487
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:15,489
Sixty beautiful rooms. The Escudero Ritz.

488
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,831
What'll it be, ocean view or mountain view?

489
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:23,665
Anything. A cot. A couple of chairs in here will do fine.

490
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,803
Operator? Get me Albuquerque 4923.

491
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,010
- What's the number here? - Escudero 2.

492
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,690
Escudero 2.

493
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,939
Hello?

494
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:57,875
Sun-Bulletin? This is Tatum speaking. Get me Mr Boot, and make it fast.

495
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:10,841
Mr Boot? Tatum.

496
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,507
No, nothing's wrong. Quite the contrary.

497
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:17,384
Uh-uh. I'm in a dreamy little spot called Escudero

498
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,762
about three hours down the line.

499
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:23,650
Forget the rattlesnakes. We got something nicer here.

500
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:27,903
We got birds, vultures. Seven of them.

501
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:29,939
How does this hit you?

502
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,198
"The curse of the mountain of the seven vultures."

503
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:36,153
Of course you don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm gonna tell you.

504
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:40,282
And wait till you see the pictures. I'm sending them up with Herbie...

505
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:42,829
No, I'm not drunk, Mr Boot.

506
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,996
Maybe a little excited, because unless war is declared tonight,

507
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:47,962
here's your front-page feature. Now...

508
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:05,724
How much is it, Mr Minosa?

509
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:10,739
No, sir, I wouldn't take your money, not after all you're doing for my boy.

510
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:55,045
- Hi. - Morning.

511
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,260
The construction boss show up? Or the sheriff?

512
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,940
Not yet.

513
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:08,848
From the way you were talking, I thought you'd get the Governor down here.

514
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:11,892
- The Marines, too. - It's all taken care of.

515
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:14,061
They got a construction crew together, machinery too,

516
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,605
and they're on their way from Los Barrios now, Sunday or no Sunday.

517
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:18,315
- Yap, yap. - I've talked to the doctor.

518
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:20,909
We're taking him in as soon as they clear the passage.

519
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:23,195
And the sheriff will be on the job, too.

520
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,780
Do, do, do, do, do.

521
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,122
Look, madam, when I say I deliver, I deliver.

522
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,874
Where are the old folks?

523
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:32,966
Went to early mass.

524
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,502
What's that you been playing on your typewriter all night?

525
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:41,922
From upstairs, it sounded like that Sabre Dance.

526
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:45,098
With all this trouble, I didn't think you could sleep anyhow.

527
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,936
I've had enough sleep, five years of it.

528
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:53,851
What else could you do in Escudero? Look at the family album?

529
00:36:53,852 --> 00:36:56,861
- Where'd you get it? - From Mama Minosa.

530
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:58,701
Just shows.

531
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:01,567
Yesterday, you never even heard of Leo.

532
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,361
Today, you can't know enough about him.

533
00:37:04,362 --> 00:37:06,375
Aren't you sweet?

534
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:11,660
Good-looking kid in his uniform, wasn't he?

535
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:14,457
Him and eight million other guys.

536
00:37:14,873 --> 00:37:17,875
See our wedding picture? Bet you didn't even recognise me.

537
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,885
Sure, I did. You were a brunette then.

538
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:23,888
In '45? No, in '45, I was a redhead.

539
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,050
See how skinny I was?

540
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:29,678
A hospital back in Baltimore said I had a touch of TB.

541
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,473
You'd never think it to look at me now.

542
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:35,565
You don't look like a chest case to me.

543
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:40,397
If you can spare this one, I'd like to take it along,

544
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:43,276
in case I forget what he looks like.

545
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,945
What time is it?

546
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,989
5:45. What's all this about?

547
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,659
- I'm grabbing the early bus. - Where to?

548
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,333
Out of here fast. As far as 11 bucks will take me.

549
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,873
I'm blowing this place.

550
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:01,293
- You picked a fine time. - I've left him before.

551
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:03,587
Once, I got as far as Dodge City, Kansas,

552
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:06,215
in a big, blue convertible that stopped by for gas.

553
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,845
It must have cost $4,000, easy.

554
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:13,642
But Leo caught up with me. I told him I was through.

555
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,351
I told him it was no good any more. This isn't for me.

556
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:18,854
What is?

557
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,856
I bet he took you out of some dime-a-dance joint in Baltimore.

558
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:23,739
- Nightclub. - Saloon.

559
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,707
All right. Saloon. You know what he told me?

560
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:32,378
He told me he had 160 acres in New Mexico and a big business.

561
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:36,704
Look at us, we sell eight hamburgers a week and a case of soda pop,

562
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:39,165
and once in a while, a Navajo rug maybe.

563
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,793
He married you, didn't he? Brought you out here, fed you, nursed you.

564
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:47,179
And I thanked him plenty. I've been thanking him for five years.

565
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,394
That makes us even.

566
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,233
So long, Jack.

567
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,265
Nice kid.

568
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:59,018
Got a little jump on him this time, huh?

569
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,188
Can't run after you, not lying there with those rocks on his legs.

570
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,899
Look who's talking. Much you care about Leo.

571
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,984
I'm onto you. You're working for a newspaper.

572
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:09,278
All you want is something you can print.

573
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:12,869
Honey, you like those rocks just as much as I do.

574
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,363
Say, lady.

575
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:43,771
Excuse me, we're a little mixed up here.

576
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,856
Are we on the right road to Escudero?

577
00:39:45,857 --> 00:39:47,870
This is Escudero.

578
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:51,278
- Is that the mountain? - Is he still in there?

579
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,280
That's the mountain, and he's still in there.

580
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:55,074
Anything else you wanna know?

581
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,660
No. No, just stopping by to take a look.

582
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,788
The name's Federber. We're on our way to Bottomless Lake.

583
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,665
Gonna get in a week of fishing and boating.

584
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,168
- Thought, as long as we're this close... - Glad you dropped in, folks.

585
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,503
How'd you hear about it?

586
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:10,840
- Are you one of the family? - No. Just a friend.

587
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,968
Well, haven't you seen the paper? It's full of it.

588
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:16,720
- Got one? - Sure. Picked one up in Albuquerque.

589
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,806
Come on, Nellie. Tilt.

590
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,356
Thanks.

591
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,144
We thought there'd be a lot of digging going on.

592
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,319
- Where is everybody? - Scared of those Indian spooks, huh?

593
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:30,735
When are they gonna start doing something?

594
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:34,488
Any minute now. They're on the way. Aren't they, mister?

595
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,949
I guess it's all right if we drive up there, isn't it?

596
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,164
Go ahead. Help yourself.

597
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,579
What do you say, Nellie? Just a half an hour?

598
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,999
All right. Later on, we can have a nice breakfast here.

599
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,973
That is, if it won't disturb the family.

600
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:51,088
- It's all right. You can get breakfast. - Thanks.

601
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:53,466
Wake up the kids, Nellie. They should see this.

602
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,426
This is very instructive.

603
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,771
Walter, Willie. Wake up.

604
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:14,111
Hey, you look pretty good here.

605
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:16,489
Wanna hear what I wrote about you?

606
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,616
"The grief-stricken wife with a tear-stained face,"

607
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:22,036
"trying to fight her way into the cave to be at her husband's side."

608
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:25,212
Tough. You'll just have to rewrite me.

609
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:30,169
In a pig's eye. This is the way it reads best, this is the way it's gonna be.

610
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,712
In tomorrow's paper and the next day's.

611
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:35,174
It's the way people like it. It's the way I'm gonna play it.

612
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,677
Get this.

613
00:41:36,718 --> 00:41:40,596
There's three of us buried here, Leo, me and you.

614
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,057
We all wanna get out, and we're going to.

615
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:47,269
Only I'm going back in style. You can, too, if you like.

616
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,030
Not with any 11 stinking dollars.

617
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:55,319
You saw those people. To you, they're a couple of squares, huh?

618
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,407
To me, they're just the beginning. To me, they're Mr and Mrs America.

619
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:04,537
I wasn't sure before, but now I know. They're going for it. They'll eat it up.

620
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,997
The story and the hamburgers.

621
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:10,626
You'll sell all your hamburgers, hot dogs, soda pop

622
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:12,971
and all your Navajo rugs.

623
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:17,467
There's gonna be real dough in that cash register by tonight.

624
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:32,486
When they bleached your hair, they must've bleached your brains, too.

625
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,789
Hello there, Mr Minosa. Anything new with Leo?

626
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,375
Not yet. Mr Tatum's down there now with the doctor.

627
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:34,795
Okay.

628
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:47,848
Hey! That'll be two bits.

629
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:50,601
- It's the press. - Twenty-five cents.

630
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:53,229
- Newspaper. We never pay. - Everybody pays.

631
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,823
Mrs Minosa says so. Two bits.

632
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,200
Now keep moving.

633
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,730
We'll have that air going in about 20 minutes, Doctor.

634
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:39,066
I could use a little of it myself.

635
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,787
- Thank you, Doctor. - I'll send over some aureomycin.

636
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:45,364
That's every four hours for that one, isn't it?

637
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:47,116
Yes. The caffeine if he feels weak,

638
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,201
and the Demerol if the pain gets very bad.

639
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:51,704
- Say, about every three hours. - I got it.

640
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,122
As soon as I can get close enough,

641
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,916
I'll give him a shot of tetanus-gas gangrene antitoxin.

642
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:59,545
But it's all right for the time being. In fact, any time within a week.

643
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:02,388
But we'll have him out before then?

644
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,050
Oh, sure.

645
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,642
Say, Doc?

646
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,930
He's a pretty rugged customer, isn't he?

647
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,727
Leo? They don't come any tougher.

648
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,727
He walked around with a burst appendix for three days,

649
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:17,313
because he promised his wife he'd take her to a square dance.

650
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,608
Well, as soon as you get him free, I can start to work on him.

651
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:22,359
Call me anytime, night or day.

652
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,737
- I certainly will, Doctor. So long. - Goodbye.

653
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,536
Thanks a lot.

654
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,996
It's a fine thing. Now I have to pay to see you.

655
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,915
- Howdy, fan. - Did you read the paper?

656
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,917
That I did. Broke pretty good, huh?

657
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:39,877
Boot flashed a couple hundred words over the wires,

658
00:45:39,878 --> 00:45:41,045
and they came back for more.

659
00:45:41,046 --> 00:45:43,089
- They want all we've got. - Yeah, it figures.

660
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,549
We wired all the art, too. What a break for me.

661
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,718
If this keeps up, maybe Life will go for it, or Look,

662
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,601
one of those four-page spreads.

663
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:53,557
You like it now, don't you?

664
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:57,730
Well, everybody likes a break. We didn't make it happen.

665
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:02,233
Oh, Smollett! How's it look?

666
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,402
Don't know yet. Lots of problems.

667
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:07,571
We've been figuring on doing some bulkheading and cross-bracing.

668
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:10,616
But those old walls, I don't know.

669
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:14,041
All right, boys, start bringing those jacks in.

670
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:16,705
Well, it looks like we'll be here for a while.

671
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,125
I brought you enough for a couple of days, some shirts and shorts.

672
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,336
- A couple of bottles. - Save it, fan. No booze.

673
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,800
- Not for the duration. - Hey, you!

674
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:29,218
The sheriff wants to see you down at the trading post.

675
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,388
And don't waste none of his time, because he ain't staying around long.

676
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,890
- Maybe you ain't, either. - You don't say?

677
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:38,150
You wanna know something? He don't like you.

678
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,983
And I was gonna propose to him.

679
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:55,953
He won't eat any steak.

680
00:46:55,954 --> 00:46:59,915
Maybe he'd like a little raw hamburger or some milk maybe.

681
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,462
After all, he's only a baby.

682
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,048
Try him with a lollipop, Sheriff.

683
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,896
Or how about my right arm?

684
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:15,723
He'd like that. You would, too, wouldn't you?

685
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:19,727
So you're that Tatum guy that was popping off over the phone last night.

686
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,521
Not popping off, Sheriff. Just threatening.

687
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:24,815
You play along with me, and I'll have you re-elected.

688
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:27,610
You don't, and I'll crucify you. That's all I said. Remember?

689
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:32,031
I think I'll have my boys take you to the county line and throw you out.

690
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:35,868
Throw out your campaign manager? You need plenty of help, Kretzer.

691
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,121
And maybe before I throw you out, I'll toss you in the clink for a while.

692
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,336
Wasting your time on a rattlesnake hunt.

693
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:46,045
- This is where the votes are. - What do you know about votes?

694
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:49,173
There's seven here in Escudero, 700 up there.

695
00:47:49,174 --> 00:47:52,847
We had a big barbecue, and I made a speech, a good one, too.

696
00:47:53,345 --> 00:47:54,804
Then we sat down to a little poker game,

697
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,681
and you started bothering me, right in the middle of a hand.

698
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:00,359
What'd you have, pair of deuces?

699
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:02,520
This is better.

700
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,316
Here we've got an ace in the hole.

701
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,568
- Two candy bars, please. - A couple of hamburgers, please.

702
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:11,070
How much are those Swiss-cheese sandwiches?

703
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:13,030
- I'll have the coffee. - I'll take a coffee.

704
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:16,954
Come on, Mama. I need some help. We're swamped out here.

705
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:18,870
Come on.

706
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:27,044
Now, how's this, Sheriff? By tomorrow, I'll have your name all over the paper.

707
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:29,213
"The man who rushed here at the first cry for help"

708
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:31,048
"to direct the rescue operation."

709
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,717
By Tuesday, everyone in the state will know you.

710
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:37,763
"Gus Kretzer, the tireless public servant who never spares himself."

711
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:40,349
I'll pile it on every day.

712
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,608
Six days of this and I'll make you a hero.

713
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:45,813
The election's in the bag.

714
00:48:45,814 --> 00:48:49,902
In the bag? The guys running against you will vote for you.

715
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:54,205
Okay, I'm a hero. And what do I make you?

716
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,741
Now here's the deal.

717
00:48:56,742 --> 00:48:58,868
The way things look, there's gonna be other newspapermen

718
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,293
trying to horn in on this story. A lot of them.

719
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:05,126
Maybe all the way from New York.

720
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,971
This is my story.

721
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:11,181
And I wanna keep it mine.

722
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:14,977
You're gonna help me.

723
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,554
Mr Tatum, we're moving you into our room.

724
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,222
It's a good, comfortable bed.

725
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,933
Oh, no, Mr Minosa. I don't want to put anybody out.

726
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:26,103
Mama and I will be fine. This is a great honour.

727
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:27,605
Okay. Thanks.

728
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:30,065
Oh, Herbie, unpack for me, will you? And stand by.

729
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:33,455
We're gonna take some pictures of the sheriff.

730
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:39,116
Guess I'm getting too old to crawl around in there.

731
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:41,494
- How about a cup of coffee? - Make it two.

732
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,127
Coming up.

733
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,925
- What's the latest? - Not too good.

734
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,042
There must be a pretty deep fault underneath there,

735
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:49,877
or it wouldn't have caved in.

736
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:51,003
How long will it take?

737
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,422
Of course we haven't been able to get all the way back.

738
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,549
There's a lot of shoring to do first.

739
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,636
That means getting those bulkhead timbers placed right.

740
00:49:58,637 --> 00:50:01,472
- Then there's all that cross-bracing. - How long?

741
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,933
When we get that done, we ought to be able to start operating.

742
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,018
Moving those heavy slabs and stones

743
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:09,313
so the whole shebang doesn't come crashing in on us and on him.

744
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:13,450
- How long? - Well, Gus, I can't tell you exactly.

745
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:16,792
But I don't see how we can do it under 16 hours.

746
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,082
Uh-uh.

747
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:25,246
Well, maybe I can do it in 12 hours if I send for a second crew.

748
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:26,997
Although some of the men don't want to work,

749
00:50:26,998 --> 00:50:29,972
on account of that jinx you wrote about.

750
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:36,715
Look, Mr Smollett, I'm no engineer, but the way you wanna do it,

751
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:40,187
those crumbling walls and piles of stones,

752
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:43,180
isn't that kind of dangerous for your men?

753
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:46,024
Not after we get the walls braced.

754
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:50,438
Suppose we set up a drill on top of the mountain

755
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:52,570
and go straight down.

756
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:55,155
Cut through all that rock?

757
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:58,404
Do you know how long that would take?

758
00:50:58,405 --> 00:50:59,697
You tell me.

759
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:02,078
Six, maybe seven days.

760
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:04,706
It's a great big job.

761
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,954
Have you got any drills like that?

762
00:51:06,955 --> 00:51:09,715
Yes, sir, but it's not necessary.

763
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:13,002
Once we get that back part shored up, I think...

764
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:16,172
You're thinking too much. Let Mr Tatum do the thinking.

765
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,840
But he's all wrong.

766
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,259
- I think... - You're thinking again, Sam.

767
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,638
A few years ago, you was a truck driver. Now that I'm sheriff, you're a contractor.

768
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,695
Do you want to be a truck driver again?

769
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,145
All right, Gus,

770
00:51:31,146 --> 00:51:34,732
if that's the way you want it, I'll set the drill.

771
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:39,035
But that fellow in there. Seven days.

772
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,574
I know what's in your mind, Mr Smollett, and it does you credit.

773
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:47,331
Leo's a rugged boy. The doctor told me that himself.

774
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:51,050
He'll get the best of care, so don't worry.

775
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,676
Sugar?

776
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,462
- Hey, how about some cigarettes? - Couple of hot dogs, please.

777
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:59,340
Don't you wanna be paid, lady? We had four hamburgers and four coffees.

778
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:02,136
- That's $1.20. - Can you change a $50?

779
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:14,945
- Hey, how about one here, Chuck? - Okay, fan.

780
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:21,445
Get me a few of Mr Smollett,

781
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:24,907
the man whose know-how is gonna save the life of Leo Minosa.

782
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:29,080
You'll be the biggest contractor in the business, I bet you.

783
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:33,547
And let's get that drill. See you, gentlemen. Lot of work to do.

784
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:17,044
Yes?

785
00:53:18,837 --> 00:53:21,430
Come on, come on. What is it?

786
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:25,926
I met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my life,

787
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:28,723
but you, you're 20 minutes.

788
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,101
Is that a boost or a knock? Because I haven't time to figure it out.

789
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:36,061
I've been doing my own figuring.

790
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:40,115
Took in 70 bucks so far. By tonight, it ought to be $150.

791
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:43,788
Seven times $150. That's over a grand.

792
00:53:45,906 --> 00:53:48,783
That's the first grand I ever had.

793
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,162
Thanks.

794
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:54,968
Thanks a lot.

795
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:02,266
Look, Mrs Minosa, your husband's stuck under a mountain.

796
00:54:02,464 --> 00:54:06,600
You're worried sick. That's the way the story goes.

797
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:10,306
Now get the smile off your face.

798
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:14,767
It's been a nice day, Chuck. I feel like smiling.

799
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:17,148
You heard me. Get it off.

800
00:54:20,899 --> 00:54:22,484
Make me.

801
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,458
That's more like it.

802
00:54:30,117 --> 00:54:34,495
And don't wipe those tears. That's the way you're supposed to look.

803
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:36,840
Put on your wedding ring.

804
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,847
Go on back and peddle your hamburgers.

805
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:04,775
Good morning, everybody.

806
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:07,153
This is radio station KOAT, Albuquerque.

807
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:09,739
Bob Bumpas speaking and bringing you another on-the-spot report

808
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,741
of the Leo Minosa rescue operation.

809
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,743
- Send up more casings! - Since the operation began 3 days ago,

810
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,662
the drill has cut its way 57 feet closer to Leo.

811
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:18,330
You have just heard the voice of Sam Smollett,

812
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:20,249
the man who is in charge of the drilling job.

813
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,044
This man, together with Sheriff Kretzer and a crew of volunteer rescue workers,

814
00:55:24,045 --> 00:55:27,882
is tirelessly fighting this battle against stubborn rock and fleeting time

815
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:29,759
with a human life at stake.

816
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,343
If anyone can lick this,

817
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:34,513
this curse of the mountain of the seven vultures, they can.

818
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:37,099
Ladies and gentlemen, something phenomenal is going on here,

819
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,685
right in front of this 400-year-old cliff dwelling.

820
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:41,562
A new community is springing up

821
00:55:41,563 --> 00:55:44,774
a veritable town of tents and trucks and trailers.

822
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,525
Standing here, I can pick out licence plates

823
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:49,570
from California, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma.

824
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:51,614
And more cars pouring in all the time.

825
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:54,033
And more volunteer workers from all over the state.

826
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:57,119
Top-flight newspapermen from the biggest papers in the country are here.

827
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,163
The most outstanding of these newspaper people is,

828
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:00,456
of course, Chuck Tatum,

829
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,834
the courageous reporter who first made contact with Leo last Saturday.

830
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:07,171
Later on in this broadcast, we will try to get Mr Tatum to this microphone.

831
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:10,508
In the meantime, I'm sure you'll want to hear from some of the folks

832
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:12,384
who have gathered here to hope and pray for Leo's rescue.

833
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:14,095
This gentleman right here, what is your name, sir?

834
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:15,805
Federber. Al Federber.

835
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,598
What business are you in, Mr Federber?

836
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,600
In the insurance game, in Gallup.

837
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:20,893
Feel right at home, Mr Federber.

838
00:56:20,894 --> 00:56:22,353
Speak right into the microphone, please.

839
00:56:22,354 --> 00:56:28,067
We're from Gallup. This is Mrs Federber and the boys.

840
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:29,860
It's a very wonderful thing to see a man and his family

841
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,947
come all the way from Gallup to join us here during these anxious days.

842
00:56:32,948 --> 00:56:35,616
Well, I didn't exactly what you call join.

843
00:56:35,617 --> 00:56:38,327
I heard you talking to some other people on the radio last night.

844
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,413
We were over there in our trailer having supper.

845
00:56:40,414 --> 00:56:42,873
And they said they were the first ones here.

846
00:56:42,874 --> 00:56:46,544
Oh, I hate to call anybody a liar, but that just plain isn't so.

847
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:48,003
My wife will bear me out.

848
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:51,263
Nellie, who were the first people here? Tell them.

849
00:56:51,758 --> 00:56:55,219
Why, we were. I wouldn't lie about a thing like that.

850
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,846
I'm sure you wouldn't, Mrs Federber.

851
00:56:56,847 --> 00:57:01,016
Now, Mr Federber, what is your reaction to this wonderful job being done here?

852
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,018
I think it's wonderful.

853
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,147
I run up against accidents all the time. I know what I'm talking about.

854
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:08,149
I'm in the insurance game myself.

855
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,402
You never can tell when an accident's gonna happen.

856
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:15,531
I sure hope Leo had the good sense to provide for an emergency like this.

857
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:18,284
Now, you take my outfit, the Pacific All Risk.

858
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:19,910
- We have a little policy that covers... - Thank you.

859
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:21,620
Thank you very much, Mr Federber.

860
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:23,873
I'm sorry we have to interrupt these on-the-spot interviews,

861
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:27,668
but I see it's almost time for Mr Tatum to make his first visit of the day to Leo.

862
00:57:27,669 --> 00:57:30,546
Stand by while we move our microphone.

863
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,849
We'll try to get Mr Tatum to say a few words to you when he reaches us.

864
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,438
Hold it, fan.

865
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:58,324
Look, Mrs Minosa, they're having a rosary at that little church this evening.

866
00:57:58,325 --> 00:57:59,658
I want you to be there.

867
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:03,664
I don't go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons.

868
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:06,123
You're making enough dough to buy yourself another pair.

869
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:07,333
I want you to be there

870
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:10,211
because I'm sending Herbie down to get a couple of shots, understand?

871
00:58:10,212 --> 00:58:11,679
Okay.

872
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:15,591
But only because you wrote me up so pretty in today's paper.

873
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,344
You sure can make with the words.

874
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:21,597
"A figure of fair-haired loveliness in the lengthening shadow

875
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,683
- "of the cursed mountain. Beautiful..." - Unquote.

876
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:29,188
Tomorrow this'll be yesterday's paper, and they'll wrap a fish in it.

877
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:32,909
And another thing, mister. Don't ever slap me again.

878
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:59,593
Did you buy the cigars for Leo?

879
00:58:59,594 --> 00:59:02,638
Real Havana. The best I could find in Albuquerque.

880
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,434
I got a job for you, fan. Pick up Mrs Minosa. Lorraine, I mean.

881
00:59:06,435 --> 00:59:09,061
Make sure she gets to that church this evening.

882
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:10,896
I want a picture of her with her beads.

883
00:59:10,897 --> 00:59:13,190
If she hasn't got any, get some for her.

884
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:15,985
Sure. And how about me taking a picture of a medicine man,

885
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:18,154
you know, with the fancy headdress and all the trimmings,

886
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,490
- exorcising all the evil spirits? - Now you're clicking, fan.

887
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,576
- That's got a message. - Thanks.

888
00:59:23,577 --> 00:59:24,785
When I take your copy in Albuquerque...

889
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:27,705
No more copy. Not for Boot anyhow.

890
00:59:27,706 --> 00:59:30,958
As of now, I'm not working with the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin.

891
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:33,961
- Neither are you. We quit. - Both of us?

892
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:37,214
- Hope it's all right with you. - Sure, Chuck.

893
00:59:37,215 --> 00:59:40,176
There isn't anything you could do wrong as far as I'm concerned.

894
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,385
But I don't get it.

895
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:44,096
Quit in the middle of a story right when it's snowballing like this?

896
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,307
That's exactly the time to do it, Herbie, boy.

897
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:47,516
They've been lapping it up.

898
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:51,228
Every word, every paper, from New York to Los Angeles.

899
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:54,488
So now we turn off the spigot. Just like that.

900
00:59:55,442 --> 00:59:57,485
Watch them with their tongues out.

901
00:59:57,486 --> 01:00:01,490
Stop at that tent. Let's see the gentlemen of the press.

902
01:00:01,907 --> 01:00:04,408
Look, boys, I don't care where you come from,

903
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:07,912
New York, Philadelphia, Chicago or the moon.

904
01:00:07,913 --> 01:00:09,663
Nobody goes down to see Leo.

905
01:00:09,664 --> 01:00:12,291
- What about Tatum? - It's out of bounds.

906
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:14,835
- Why? - Because it's dangerous down there.

907
01:00:14,836 --> 01:00:16,796
Because a wall could fall in on you.

908
01:00:16,797 --> 01:00:20,132
Because I'm sheriff and because I'm responsible for everybody's safety.

909
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:23,052
- What about Tatum? - Out of bounds! You heard me.

910
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:25,221
What about Tatum?

911
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,264
You're repeating yourself.

912
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:31,060
This is a pretty nice place I fixed up here for you boys.

913
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:34,730
Be a shame to cut all these wires and kick you out.

914
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,023
Don't try it, Mr Sheriff.

915
01:00:36,024 --> 01:00:39,360
We wouldn't take that kind of guff from J. Edgar Hoover, let alone from you.

916
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:42,279
We came all the way out here to do a job and we're going to do it.

917
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,491
- It's out of bounds! - Now you're repeating yourself!

918
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:47,493
How come it isn't out of bounds for Tatum?

919
01:00:47,494 --> 01:00:49,620
How come he goes in as much as he wants to?

920
01:00:49,621 --> 01:00:53,294
- What about Tatum? - That's right. What about Tatum?

921
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:58,349
Howdy, fans. Why, it's like old home week.

922
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:04,593
Glad to see you, Mac. Mr McCardle, used to work together in New York.

923
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:08,097
And if it isn't Jessop. Big-hearted Mickey Jessop.

924
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:11,016
Thanks for the 50 bucks you didn't send me.

925
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:13,361
Guess he didn't get my wire.

926
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,480
And what do you know? Josh Morgan. Where was it?

927
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:19,358
Boston? Chicago? All I know is he's got a hernia.

928
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,902
Sitting pretty, aren't you, Chuck? Got everything sewed up,

929
01:01:21,903 --> 01:01:23,070
Leo, the sheriff.

930
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,489
Try to talk to the father, the mother, the wife, and what do I get?

931
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,076
- "See Tatum! See Tatum!" - He's a friend of the family.

932
01:01:29,077 --> 01:01:31,996
Now, what's your beef, fans? You're smart cookies,

933
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:34,175
big-city newspapermen.

934
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:37,918
There's a lot of good stories lying around here all yours.

935
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,921
The weather, the crowds, the Indians.

936
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:43,931
Inside stuff, how they weave a rug.

937
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,845
Cut it out, Chuck. We're all buddies. We're all in the same boat.

938
01:01:47,846 --> 01:01:50,820
I'm in the boat. You're in the water.

939
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:55,863
Now let's see you swim, buddies.

940
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,940
Tatum, I always knew you were a louse.

941
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:04,160
Easy, Mr Morgan. You're talking to an officer of the law.

942
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:07,239
That tin badge will do you no good.

943
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,949
We've launched a protest with your publisher.

944
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,452
Launch it with the sheriff. He's my superior.

945
01:02:11,453 --> 01:02:12,703
All right, we'll take this all the way

946
01:02:12,704 --> 01:02:13,996
to Santa Fe, to the Governor.

947
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,498
- And you know what he'll do. - You bet I do.

948
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:18,793
He's a fine man, and he'll take action. He'll phone the sheriff.

949
01:02:18,794 --> 01:02:21,295
And I'll write him a letter and tell him I'm doing my duty.

950
01:02:21,296 --> 01:02:24,090
Then you talk to the Governor again, and he'll talk to the Attorney General,

951
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:26,720
and for all I know, they'll throw me out of here.

952
01:02:27,135 --> 01:02:30,137
Only by that time, buddies, Leo will be out,

953
01:02:30,138 --> 01:02:33,194
and the story is finished. Over, done!

954
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:36,185
Excuse me, gentlemen. I got a date with Leo.

955
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,282
Popcorn! Popcorn!

956
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,401
Just so you don't think I'm a complete louse,

957
01:02:43,402 --> 01:02:45,948
I do have some news for you.

958
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:48,322
Put it on a teletype.

959
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:51,200
Tell your papers Chuck Tatum is available.

960
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,286
Looks like there's gonna be three or four more days of hot copy.

961
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:57,296
Exclusive. And Tatum is sitting on it.

962
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,839
So let's hear their bids.

963
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,642
Come on, fan.

964
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:28,237
Of course, it's hard to say what we might run into.

965
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,906
You hit rock and then those layers of shale.

966
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,545
That's what we call a stratified formation. And that means...

967
01:03:35,537 --> 01:03:38,622
Wait just a second! There's Mr Tatum making his way toward the cliff dwelling.

968
01:03:38,623 --> 01:03:42,094
I'm going to try to get him on this microphone.

969
01:03:44,379 --> 01:03:46,723
Mr Tatum! Mr Tatum!

970
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:50,593
Good. He's coming over this way now.

971
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,511
Mr Tatum, could you spare us a few moments, please?

972
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:55,639
Just a word or two about Leo and the way things look to you down there.

973
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,892
Well, we're making progress, good progress,

974
01:03:57,893 --> 01:04:00,519
but every second counts in this rescue operation,

975
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,730
and I'm sure your radio audience will excuse me,

976
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:06,192
as well as Mr Smollett here if he goes back to his post at the drill.

977
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:08,778
I don't know why they have to use a drill at all.

978
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:10,821
They don't have to go from the top.

979
01:04:10,822 --> 01:04:12,656
There's a quicker way to get that man out of there.

980
01:04:12,657 --> 01:04:15,409
- What's your name, sir? - My name is Kusac.

981
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:19,705
I did a lot of mining in my day, silver mining, that is, up in Virginia City.

982
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:21,999
Now, the way I see it...

983
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,085
Yes, go ahead, Mr Kusac. We're very much interested.

984
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:27,004
Well, we had cave-ins, quite a few of them.

985
01:04:27,005 --> 01:04:29,465
One that I know of was further in than yours.

986
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,093
Were you ever in a cave-in yourself, Mr Kusac?

987
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:34,762
- No, not personally. - Well, I was.

988
01:04:34,763 --> 01:04:36,764
Course you might not call it a cave-in exactly,

989
01:04:36,765 --> 01:04:38,474
but I was stuck in an elevator once,

990
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,018
in the store I work in, between the basement and the sub-basement.

991
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:43,270
It was six hours before they could get me out,

992
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:45,064
and they had to use a blowtorch to do it.

993
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:47,907
Right from the top. Just like here.

994
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:50,236
I'm afraid I gotta be getting back to my crew.

995
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:54,198
As I was trying to say, we didn't have no big drill.

996
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:55,408
We didn't need it.

997
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:58,661
We just hauled in the timber and shored up the walls all the way back.

998
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:02,123
Now, if we did it that way in Virginia City why can't we do it that way here?

999
01:05:02,124 --> 01:05:05,042
You're not telling me anything I don't know.

1000
01:05:05,043 --> 01:05:07,128
I know all about shoring and bracing...

1001
01:05:07,129 --> 01:05:11,424
Mr Kusac, you see, this is a cliff dwelling and not a silver mine.

1002
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:16,190
Well, I think it's all the same. A man's underground and you got to get him out.

1003
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:19,975
Did you get your man out, Mr Kusac?

1004
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,156
I'm afraid we didn't. We were too late.

1005
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:28,113
Well, then, suppose we let Mr Smollett do it his way, from the top.

1006
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,403
Thank you, Mr Tatum. Thank you very much. And thank you, Mr Smollett.

1007
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:34,488
I know I speak for my entire radio audience

1008
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:36,782
when I express my great admiration for both of you.

1009
01:05:36,783 --> 01:05:39,243
Mr Tatum is now approaching the entrance to the cliff dwelling

1010
01:05:39,244 --> 01:05:41,162
to start another one of his perilous journeys

1011
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:43,914
into the underground mazes of this dread mountain.

1012
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:48,134
As he waves to the crowd, you can hear the tremendous cheer!

1013
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:08,192
Hiya, Leo. What do you say?

1014
01:06:08,356 --> 01:06:10,483
Five minutes late this morning.

1015
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:12,946
Sorry. What's the matter?

1016
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:16,125
- Did you eat anything? - I'm not hungry.

1017
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:18,417
- Take your pills? - Yeah.

1018
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:19,784
This afternoon, when the doctor comes,

1019
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:21,118
you better give yourself another injection.

1020
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,045
I don't want any injection. It's that drill.

1021
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:27,124
You gotta keep telling yourself, Leo, they're getting closer all the time.

1022
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,335
I can't stand it. It never stops.

1023
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:32,338
It's like somebody was driving crooked nails through my head.

1024
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:35,257
Listen to it! It's enough to wake up the dead, I tell you...

1025
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,558
Stop!

1026
01:06:39,304 --> 01:06:40,640
I'm sorry.

1027
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:45,572
Here. I brought you the paper.

1028
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:52,316
Thanks. Yesterday, I read there were 2,000 people outside.

1029
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:54,485
Today there's over 3,000.

1030
01:06:54,486 --> 01:06:56,612
Well, who are they? What do they want?

1031
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:59,587
- They're your friends. - They are?

1032
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:03,452
I guess everybody's got a lot of friends they don't even know about.

1033
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,788
Like those guys drilling for me.

1034
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:10,251
Or like you, Chuck. I didn't even know you were alive this time last week,

1035
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:14,340
and now you're my friend. I guess you're my best friend.

1036
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:19,769
Leo, when we get you out of here

1037
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:23,097
I'll be going to New York more than likely.

1038
01:07:23,098 --> 01:07:24,932
Then I won't be seeing you any more?

1039
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:27,609
No. I was just about to say

1040
01:07:27,936 --> 01:07:31,397
when I'm in New York, I'll bring you out to visit me for a couple of weeks

1041
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:34,193
or as long as you want. Stay right with me.

1042
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:37,069
Hey, you ever been in New York?

1043
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,581
Been in Baltimore. Never in New York.

1044
01:07:40,574 --> 01:07:44,618
We're really gonna have a great time. You'll see. We'll live it up a little.

1045
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:48,127
New York. Lorraine told me a lot about New York.

1046
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:52,251
Does she talk about me? Is she upset?

1047
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:55,178
Sure. Everybody's upset about you.

1048
01:07:55,422 --> 01:07:58,644
- Say, Chuck, what day is this? - Wednesday.

1049
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,051
Think there's a chance they can get me out by Friday?

1050
01:08:01,052 --> 01:08:02,678
Because Friday's something special.

1051
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,221
We're doing all we can.

1052
01:08:04,222 --> 01:08:08,738
Because it's gonna be five years that Lorraine and I were married.

1053
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:11,483
You know, things haven't been so good between us.

1054
01:08:12,105 --> 01:08:16,703
Maybe this'll make a difference. Maybe we can start all over again.

1055
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:20,490
Maybe I can take her along on that trip to New York.

1056
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:25,122
She's so pretty.

1057
01:08:30,832 --> 01:08:33,167
Here you are. Get yourself a red hot!

1058
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:35,679
A show-stopping monster for a dime!

1059
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,468
We can't let them come in here, Lorraine. Not the carnival!

1060
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:44,345
Quiet, Papa. I told them it was all right.

1061
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:46,263
It is not all right. I won't have them here.

1062
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:48,724
They're paying for it. Good money.

1063
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:52,353
Look at them. Selling balloons here, ice cream, hot dogs.

1064
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:54,480
Everybody's paying for it.

1065
01:08:54,481 --> 01:08:57,691
Why don't we just lock up this place and tell everybody to go home?

1066
01:08:57,692 --> 01:08:58,859
Because they won't go home.

1067
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,779
They'll just park on the other side of the highway and eat someplace else.

1068
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,572
Why shouldn't we get something out of it?

1069
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:06,367
I don't want their money. All I want is Leo.

1070
01:09:06,368 --> 01:09:09,537
Who do you think the money's for? It's for him when he gets out.

1071
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:12,081
He's always wanted to make some improvements around here,

1072
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:16,419
build some cabins for tourists, buy a new car, have a little money in the bank.

1073
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,804
It'll make things easier for him. Doesn't that make sense, Papa?

1074
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:26,019
Mr Tatum!

1075
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:31,767
- How is he? - Pretty good.

1076
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,979
Does it hurt him bad? Is he getting any sleep?

1077
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,564
Sure, he's fine.

1078
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:39,525
Well, you ought to see him smoking a cigar, reading the paper.

1079
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,068
He's making plans.

1080
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:45,030
All the doctor says is he's doing as well as can be expected.

1081
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:48,586
- What does that mean? - Means he's gonna be fine.

1082
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:52,541
Means everything's gonna be fine, doesn't it, Mr Tatum?

1083
01:10:08,722 --> 01:10:11,564
- How is he, mister? - Did you see him?

1084
01:10:12,726 --> 01:10:14,643
- Is he holding out? - Is he all right?

1085
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:17,598
- What did he have to say? - When do you think they'll get him out?

1086
01:10:39,878 --> 01:10:43,302
Go ahead. I guess you need a drink.

1087
01:10:48,637 --> 01:10:50,566
Care to join me?

1088
01:10:51,932 --> 01:10:54,934
Looks like the only other glass we have is one of these candle jiggers.

1089
01:10:54,935 --> 01:10:57,269
Sensational copy you've been sending in.

1090
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:00,189
- Glad you like it. - Had to get out an extra every day.

1091
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:02,403
Circulation jumped 8,000.

1092
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:05,486
What did you come down for? To pin a medal on me?

1093
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:09,125
You've got a medal, and I know how you got it.

1094
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,121
What else do you know?

1095
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:18,624
Heard a few things in Albuquerque about how you're handling this story.

1096
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:22,630
I didn't like it. Now that I'm here, I like it even less.

1097
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,256
Suppose you stop beating around the bush.

1098
01:11:25,257 --> 01:11:28,259
Tatum, you've been putting a halo around that Kretzer sheriff,

1099
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,396
so you could hog the whole story. That's the setup, isn't it?

1100
01:11:33,014 --> 01:11:37,726
Oh. For a minute, you had me scared. I thought I did something real bad.

1101
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:41,317
You have. Kretzer should be kicked out, not re-elected.

1102
01:11:41,523 --> 01:11:44,108
One of these days, I'll get the facts and print them.

1103
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:47,035
I think he's corrupt, rotten, no good.

1104
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:50,865
He's been good to me. So there'll be one more crooked sheriff in the world.

1105
01:11:50,866 --> 01:11:51,991
Who cares?

1106
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:55,167
I do. I don't make deals. Not my paper.

1107
01:11:55,328 --> 01:11:58,337
Even if it does sell 8,000 more a day.

1108
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:03,713
Hello. Who in Chicago?

1109
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:09,635
Tell them Mr Tatum will be ready to talk in half an hour.

1110
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:12,845
Now then, Mr Boot, I sent you a wire this morning.

1111
01:12:12,846 --> 01:12:14,638
- Apparently, you didn't get it. - No, I didn't.

1112
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,932
Because you could've saved yourself the trip.

1113
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:20,986
I've quit. I'm not working for you any more.

1114
01:12:21,897 --> 01:12:24,315
I'm sorry to hear that, Chuck.

1115
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:27,526
No, you're not. I'm not your kind of newspaperman.

1116
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:31,995
I don't belong in your office, not with that embroidered sign on the wall.

1117
01:12:32,532 --> 01:12:36,371
- It gets in my way. - Then it does bother you a little.

1118
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:38,829
Not enough to stop me. I'm on my way,

1119
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:41,457
and if it takes a deal with a crooked sheriff, that's all right with me.

1120
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,417
And if I have to fancy it up with an Indian curse

1121
01:12:43,418 --> 01:12:45,669
and a broken-hearted wife for Leo, that's all right, too!

1122
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:48,976
Not with me, it isn't. And not with a lot of others in this business.

1123
01:12:49,257 --> 01:12:51,884
Phoney, below-the-belt journalism. That's what it is.

1124
01:12:51,885 --> 01:12:55,274
Not below the belt. Right in the gut, Mr Boot.

1125
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:58,182
- Human interest. - You heard me. Phoney.

1126
01:12:58,183 --> 01:13:01,352
For all I know, there isn't even a Leo down there.

1127
01:13:01,353 --> 01:13:04,777
Yes, there is. Tatum made sure of that.

1128
01:13:08,443 --> 01:13:12,163
Look, I've waited a long time for my turn at bat.

1129
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,573
Now that they've pitched me a fat one,

1130
01:13:14,574 --> 01:13:17,915
I'm gonna smack it right out of the ballpark.

1131
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:24,257
Yes? What paper?

1132
01:13:25,419 --> 01:13:28,889
Tell Philadelphia to call back in half an hour.

1133
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,425
You know what, Chuck?

1134
01:13:32,426 --> 01:13:35,980
I had that medicine man stage a whole ceremonial.

1135
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,144
Hello, Mr Boot.

1136
01:13:39,057 --> 01:13:41,684
Come on, Herbie. Get your things together. We're going back.

1137
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:45,821
Tatum just hit a home run, and the big leagues are calling.

1138
01:13:46,773 --> 01:13:51,235
Go ahead, Herbie. Maybe Boot's right. Maybe you'd better go back with him.

1139
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:53,612
But you said I could stick with you.

1140
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:56,872
Give him good advice, Chuck. You can do it.

1141
01:13:56,992 --> 01:13:59,535
He's old enough to make up his own mind.

1142
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:02,329
Everybody in this game has to make up his own mind.

1143
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,343
I've made up mine.

1144
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:08,047
Hello. Yes?

1145
01:14:10,338 --> 01:14:14,177
Sure, I'm ready to talk to New York. Put them on.

1146
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,973
Don't be so sorry for him.

1147
01:14:20,974 --> 01:14:23,350
What makes you think the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin

1148
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,810
is all that a kid wants out of life?

1149
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:27,772
What makes you think you have all the answers?

1150
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:29,190
They're out of date.

1151
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,192
High-button shoes, belt and suspenders,

1152
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:32,777
they're not wearing them any more.

1153
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:35,488
Look at the calendar, Mr Boot. It's the 20th century,

1154
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:37,031
the second half of it!

1155
01:14:37,032 --> 01:14:41,037
You don't expect the kid to stand still. He wants to get going. Going!

1156
01:14:41,703 --> 01:14:43,466
Going where?

1157
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:54,641
Hello. Who?

1158
01:14:55,509 --> 01:15:00,605
Mr Nagel? Not lover boy himself. Well, well.

1159
01:15:01,139 --> 01:15:04,683
Tell me, Mr Nagel, did you ever repair that ceiling in your office?

1160
01:15:04,684 --> 01:15:08,562
The one you hit the day you told me my services were no longer required.

1161
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:11,482
All right, Tatum. You're a very comical guy.

1162
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:15,111
And I promise I'm gonna laugh. Hard! But not right now.

1163
01:15:15,112 --> 01:15:17,321
What about that Minosa story?

1164
01:15:17,322 --> 01:15:20,116
Yes, the weather's fine in New York.

1165
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:24,169
No, it's not raining. Yes, she's still here.

1166
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:28,590
Come on, Tatum. How much for the Minosa story? Exclusive!

1167
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,503
What? Don't you know there's a war on somewhere?

1168
01:15:32,504 --> 01:15:34,839
I'll give you $1,000.

1169
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,551
What do you think I got here, a plane crash or a set of quadruplets?

1170
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:41,145
This is a circulation builder.

1171
01:15:43,557 --> 01:15:48,570
It'll go another four days. Some beautiful copy coming.

1172
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,357
Speak up fast. There's a waiting list.

1173
01:15:53,358 --> 01:15:54,817
So you think you've got me over a barrel?

1174
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,569
All right, maybe you have!

1175
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:59,828
Give you $1,000 a day. As long as it lasts.

1176
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:03,081
Mr Nagel, you're not getting the point.

1177
01:16:04,453 --> 01:16:06,662
It's not just $1,000 a day.

1178
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:10,467
It's that desk of mine I want back when this is over.

1179
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:14,388
You heard me. The old desk, the old job.

1180
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:17,929
Here, here, lover boy, watch that ceiling.

1181
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:22,189
That's more like it.

1182
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:26,766
Now put the contract on the wires. You'll get the first story in an hour.

1183
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:29,313
Oh, one more thing.

1184
01:16:29,895 --> 01:16:34,197
See that there's some flowers on my desk with a little ribbon.

1185
01:16:34,775 --> 01:16:36,621
"Welcome Home."

1186
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:44,200
This means you, too, fan. We're rounding third.

1187
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,711
I'm right behind you, Chuck.

1188
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:18,410
We're coming, we're coming, Leo

1189
01:17:18,568 --> 01:17:22,657
So, Leo, don't despair

1190
01:17:23,156 --> 01:17:28,536
While you are in the cave-in hoping We are up above you groping

1191
01:17:28,537 --> 01:17:33,088
And we soon will make an opening, Leo

1192
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:38,718
We're closer, we're closer, Leo

1193
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:43,302
And soon you'll breathe fresh air

1194
01:17:43,802 --> 01:17:49,223
While you are in the devil's prison Keep that spark of life a-fizzing

1195
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:53,193
We'll soon have you out of prison, Leo

1196
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:58,986
Oh, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo

1197
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:04,374
Be steadfast and keep your spirits high

1198
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:09,043
We're coming, we're coming, Leo

1199
01:18:17,169 --> 01:18:19,128
I want to take this opportunity

1200
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:21,797
of thanking you people of the television audience

1201
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:25,637
for the hundreds of letters and telegrams that have been pouring in.

1202
01:18:25,761 --> 01:18:29,764
I only wish that I could reach right out there and shake you by the hand,

1203
01:18:29,765 --> 01:18:31,860
each and every one of you.

1204
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:34,101
But there's one thing that I want to make plain

1205
01:18:34,102 --> 01:18:36,979
to you good people of Los Barrios county.

1206
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,106
When election day rolls around

1207
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:43,527
I don't want what I'm doing here to influence your vote one little bit.

1208
01:18:43,528 --> 01:18:48,245
Because all I'm doing here is my duty as your sheriff.

1209
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:45,559
We're coming, we're coming, Leo

1210
01:19:46,299 --> 01:19:50,269
Leo, don't despair

1211
01:19:50,387 --> 01:19:56,016
While you are in the cave-in hoping We are up above you groping

1212
01:19:56,017 --> 01:20:00,900
And we soon will make an opening, Leo

1213
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:05,657
We're closer, we're closer, Leo

1214
01:20:06,778 --> 01:20:10,831
And soon you'll breathe fresh air

1215
01:20:10,991 --> 01:20:16,420
While you are in the devil's prison Keep that spark of life a-fizzing

1216
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:21,000
We'll soon have you out of prison, Leo

1217
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:26,014
Oh, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo

1218
01:20:26,882 --> 01:20:30,436
Be steadfast and keep your spirits high

1219
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:35,392
We're digging, we're digging, Leo

1220
01:20:36,057 --> 01:20:39,695
We've come to set you free

1221
01:20:40,145 --> 01:20:45,277
We can look you in the eye When you are free beneath the sky

1222
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:49,697
Hey, how about some more ice here?

1223
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:12,553
- Yes, Mr Tatum? - Close that door.

1224
01:21:16,389 --> 01:21:18,974
- What can the management do for you? - I'll tell you what you can do.

1225
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:21,644
You can stop playing games with those newsboys.

1226
01:21:21,645 --> 01:21:23,938
- They're nice fellows. - They're sharpies.

1227
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:25,731
They'll rope you into a game of 20 questions.

1228
01:21:25,732 --> 01:21:29,652
And 20 questions take 20 answers. And one of them may be the wrong one.

1229
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:32,780
Don't worry, Mr Tatum. They just want me to write something for them.

1230
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:36,668
- Write what? - My life with Leo, in three parts.

1231
01:21:36,827 --> 01:21:41,259
- I got them up to $750. - Tell them you can't spell.

1232
01:21:41,456 --> 01:21:43,791
I told them I'm not interested in their $750.

1233
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:47,461
And you're not interested in $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000, understand?

1234
01:21:47,462 --> 01:21:51,173
And I'm not interested in their three-part story, either.

1235
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:54,314
It's the fourth part I'm thinking about.

1236
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:58,439
After I get out of here, I'm figuring on going to New York, too.

1237
01:21:58,807 --> 01:22:03,405
Maybe I'll run into you. Maybe you'll buy me a couple of drinks.

1238
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,149
Maybe you'll even take me out for a big evening, huh?

1239
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,734
How big?

1240
01:22:10,152 --> 01:22:11,819
You won't be ashamed of me.

1241
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,746
I'm gonna buy me a new trousseau and look real swell.

1242
01:22:16,867 --> 01:22:20,670
Why don't you wash that platinum out of your hair?

1243
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:32,673
This is radio station KOAT, Albuquerque.

1244
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,258
Bob Bumpas speaking and bringing you

1245
01:22:34,259 --> 01:22:37,094
our 10:00 p.m. Special events newscast from Escudero.

1246
01:22:37,095 --> 01:22:39,805
This is the fifth night the big drill has been pounding

1247
01:22:39,806 --> 01:22:41,432
and grinding its way toward Leo.

1248
01:22:41,433 --> 01:22:44,351
The rescue workers are now only 26 feet away.

1249
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:48,272
At the rate they are going, they should reach Leo by this time tomorrow night.

1250
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:54,497
So after 129 hours of being buried alive, at last, freedom seems in sight.

1251
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:03,873
Now put it on your right side, Leo. Underneath your arm.

1252
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:08,637
A little lower. Breathe through your mouth.

1253
01:23:10,754 --> 01:23:12,967
Move it down a little.

1254
01:23:13,757 --> 01:23:16,759
Breathe. Through your mouth.

1255
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,887
- I can't. - Don't talk, please. Just breathe.

1256
01:23:19,888 --> 01:23:22,185
Now, on the other side.

1257
01:23:23,975 --> 01:23:27,478
I can't any more. Get me Father Diego.

1258
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:29,980
Shut up, Leo. Do what the doctor tells you.

1259
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:34,568
Chuck, don't, don't let me die without the priest.

1260
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:37,530
You don't need a priest. You're not going to die.

1261
01:23:37,531 --> 01:23:39,740
Tell him he's not gonna die, Doctor.

1262
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:44,870
Everybody's gonna die someday, Leo. I am. Tatum is. You are.

1263
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:47,081
But you still have a long time ahead of you.

1264
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:51,127
Only you have to help. Now, put it on the left side.

1265
01:23:51,128 --> 01:23:55,430
Way over. There. Breathe.

1266
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:01,479
They'll never let me go.

1267
01:24:02,514 --> 01:24:06,100
They're getting even with me for robbing their tomb.

1268
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:08,445
They'll never let me go.

1269
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:16,747
- Pneumonia. - How bad?

1270
01:24:17,112 --> 01:24:18,779
He told you himself.

1271
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,824
- Nobody dies of pneumonia these days. - He will.

1272
01:24:21,825 --> 01:24:25,077
You can't lie down here five days and five nights in the same position.

1273
01:24:25,078 --> 01:24:26,925
What can you do?

1274
01:24:27,164 --> 01:24:30,671
We can get him some oxygen and help him breathe.

1275
01:24:31,209 --> 01:24:33,335
How long can he hold out?

1276
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,598
Oh, 12 hours.

1277
01:24:35,756 --> 01:24:40,140
Unless we get him in a hospital tomorrow morning, he'll be dead.

1278
01:24:40,844 --> 01:24:43,686
Chuck. Chuck!

1279
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:48,356
- Yes, Leo? - Tell them to stop the drill.

1280
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,146
It's no use. They'll never make it.

1281
01:24:52,147 --> 01:24:55,820
Get those ideas out of your head. You're talking crazy.

1282
01:24:56,234 --> 01:24:58,444
You'll be out of here by tomorrow morning.

1283
01:24:58,445 --> 01:25:00,208
No, I won't.

1284
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:04,331
They'll never reach me by tomorrow morning.

1285
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:07,078
I figured it out myself.

1286
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:10,503
You'll be out of here in 12 hours. Hang on!

1287
01:25:12,209 --> 01:25:15,798
You wouldn't be lying to me now, would you, Chuck?

1288
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,059
Leo, look at me.

1289
01:25:30,477 --> 01:25:34,399
No, you wouldn't. You never have.

1290
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,459
Here.

1291
01:25:54,126 --> 01:25:57,545
How do you like that dumb snake? I feed him meat. I feed him cheese.

1292
01:25:57,546 --> 01:26:01,048
I even caught him some bugs. Won't touch a thing.

1293
01:26:01,049 --> 01:26:04,271
What do you think he goes for? Chewing gum!

1294
01:26:05,053 --> 01:26:08,109
But only with the silver wrapper on it.

1295
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,026
Look at him. He's putting on weight.

1296
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:19,150
Say, Chuck, I think we ought to get together about tomorrow night.

1297
01:26:19,151 --> 01:26:22,111
The kid will be out, so let's make a big thing of it.

1298
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:24,780
Now, the moment they bring him up, I wanna shake hands with him.

1299
01:26:24,781 --> 01:26:26,657
But I gotta be the first one.

1300
01:26:26,658 --> 01:26:29,618
Then I wanna make a speech from the top of the hill.

1301
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:33,921
I want you to write it for me. Something nice and simple.

1302
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:36,921
Hey, what's this?

1303
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:45,092
What are you sending out here? What new development?

1304
01:26:45,093 --> 01:26:46,719
What's this all about?

1305
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,096
You read it. We'll have Leo out by tomorrow morning.

1306
01:26:49,097 --> 01:26:51,390
- We're going the other way. - What other way?

1307
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:55,563
The way we could have gone in the first place, the easy way.

1308
01:26:55,937 --> 01:26:57,646
Now why should we do that?

1309
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:58,367
Now why should we do that?

1310
01:26:58,648 --> 01:27:02,452
I'll tell you why. Because the guy in there is dying.

1311
01:27:02,527 --> 01:27:04,403
That's no good for my story.

1312
01:27:04,404 --> 01:27:05,946
When you have a big human interest story,

1313
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:08,866
you've got to give it a big human interest ending.

1314
01:27:08,867 --> 01:27:10,701
When you get people steamed up like this,

1315
01:27:10,702 --> 01:27:12,995
don't ever make suckers out of them.

1316
01:27:12,996 --> 01:27:16,504
I don't want to hand them a dead man. That's why.

1317
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:20,377
- Well, who says he's gonna be dead? - I say so.

1318
01:27:20,378 --> 01:27:23,255
Well, maybe he will and maybe he won't, but I know one thing for sure.

1319
01:27:23,256 --> 01:27:26,342
If we make that switch now, we got a lot of explaining to do.

1320
01:27:26,343 --> 01:27:28,260
People are gonna wanna know a lot of things,

1321
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:30,513
especially them reporter friends of yours.

1322
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:33,599
Like, for instance, why did we have to set up that drill?

1323
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,063
Why did we waste five days?

1324
01:27:36,228 --> 01:27:39,396
First, let's get him out. Then we'll think of what to tell them.

1325
01:27:39,397 --> 01:27:42,525
Why should we stick out our necks? Why not stick to the drill?

1326
01:27:42,526 --> 01:27:44,193
We'll speed it up as much as we can,

1327
01:27:44,194 --> 01:27:46,904
and if we get him while he's still alive, well, fine.

1328
01:27:46,905 --> 01:27:50,625
If we're too late, well, we done the best we could.

1329
01:27:51,159 --> 01:27:55,675
It's a better story if we're not too late. I've sent for Smollett.

1330
01:27:55,831 --> 01:27:59,219
Smollett's my man, and he's taking my orders.

1331
01:27:59,334 --> 01:28:01,430
Wait a minute, Gus.

1332
01:28:04,256 --> 01:28:05,888
Sit down.

1333
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:16,892
Now when Smollett comes, you can give him your orders.

1334
01:28:16,893 --> 01:28:18,644
Tell him to go in through the cliff dwelling,

1335
01:28:18,645 --> 01:28:21,188
shore it up and get him out fast.

1336
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:22,857
Not through the cliff dwelling.

1337
01:28:22,858 --> 01:28:26,282
You can't get him out that way any more.

1338
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:30,197
Why?

1339
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:33,451
Because we've been pounding away with that drill too long.

1340
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:37,496
They're all shot, those walls. You can't shore them up now.

1341
01:28:37,497 --> 01:28:41,846
Put a lot of men to work in there, and they'll cave in on them.

1342
01:28:44,045 --> 01:28:46,005
Don't look at me like that.

1343
01:28:46,006 --> 01:28:48,549
I never wanted to use the drill in the first place.

1344
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:52,899
I never wanted to go in on this at all. You know that.

1345
01:29:23,126 --> 01:29:26,301
I'm sorry, Mr Nagel. He's not back yet.

1346
01:29:26,379 --> 01:29:28,547
No, I don't know where he is.

1347
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:32,760
Well, yes, Mr Nagel, I left word everyplace for him to call New York.

1348
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:35,262
Yes, I know he has a deadline.

1349
01:29:35,263 --> 01:29:37,765
Well, of course he hasn't answered the teletype, Mr Nagel.

1350
01:29:37,766 --> 01:29:40,277
He hasn't been in all night.

1351
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:43,653
Yes, I know how much you're paying him.

1352
01:29:43,814 --> 01:29:46,988
If Tatum said he's gonna send more, he'll send more.

1353
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:03,416
Chuck! Chuck!

1354
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:06,926
- Where are you, Chuck? - Here I am, Leo.

1355
01:30:09,756 --> 01:30:11,436
Over here.

1356
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:16,345
I thought you went away.

1357
01:30:16,346 --> 01:30:19,936
Put that thing back on your mouth, and take a good long drag.

1358
01:30:20,267 --> 01:30:21,767
It's morning, isn't it?

1359
01:30:21,768 --> 01:30:25,655
- Leo, you have to breathe that oxygen. - Friday morning.

1360
01:30:27,607 --> 01:30:31,078
Come on. Come on, up there.

1361
01:30:31,653 --> 01:30:35,291
Make all the noise you want. Hurry up.

1362
01:30:35,866 --> 01:30:37,629
I'm all set.

1363
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:42,963
I got one leg out already. See it?

1364
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:51,260
Cut out all that talking, Leo.

1365
01:30:52,924 --> 01:30:54,937
Five years today.

1366
01:30:55,385 --> 01:31:00,067
I hope she hasn't found the present. I want to give it to her myself.

1367
01:31:01,099 --> 01:31:03,230
I hid it in a good place.

1368
01:31:03,393 --> 01:31:07,316
In the cupboard of our room, in my old barracks bag.

1369
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:11,528
She'll never find it there. I want her to wear it.

1370
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,496
She'll look like a million.

1371
01:31:20,202 --> 01:31:23,079
Why is it so hot in here? It's so hot.

1372
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,414
'Cause you're talking too much.

1373
01:31:25,415 --> 01:31:28,756
Don't be so dumb, using up all your strength!

1374
01:31:28,919 --> 01:31:31,512
Breathe that oxygen! Breathe!

1375
01:31:34,674 --> 01:31:37,814
Don't you want to get your other leg out?

1376
01:31:38,804 --> 01:31:41,777
Yeah, sure. I have to.

1377
01:31:43,975 --> 01:31:47,649
So I can walk down the hill, walk home,

1378
01:31:49,356 --> 01:31:54,618
walk up the stairs to our room. So I can give her the present.

1379
01:31:56,405 --> 01:32:02,829
Up the stairs. Up the stairs. Up the stairs.

1380
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:05,842
Up the stairs.

1381
01:32:19,261 --> 01:32:21,439
I didn't say come in.

1382
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:26,020
Now get out, will you, Chuck? I wanted to surprise you.

1383
01:32:26,059 --> 01:32:29,317
I'm changing my type. Going light brown again.

1384
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:34,162
That's the colour it was before I started fooling around with it.

1385
01:32:36,486 --> 01:32:39,910
I'm cutting it shorter, too. What do you think?

1386
01:32:43,869 --> 01:32:47,455
Herbie's been looking for you all night. Where've you been?

1387
01:32:47,456 --> 01:32:49,219
What's that?

1388
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,335
Here.

1389
01:32:52,627 --> 01:32:54,086
What is it?

1390
01:32:54,087 --> 01:32:56,088
- A present. - For me?

1391
01:32:56,089 --> 01:32:58,931
It's your anniversary, Mrs Minosa.

1392
01:32:59,134 --> 01:33:02,225
- Oh. - Go on, open it. He wants you to have it.

1393
01:33:08,769 --> 01:33:12,608
Parisian furs. All the way from Albuquerque.

1394
01:33:15,066 --> 01:33:16,984
Gorgeous, isn't it?

1395
01:33:16,985 --> 01:33:19,695
They must have skinned a couple of hungry rats.

1396
01:33:19,696 --> 01:33:22,073
- Put it on. - Honey,

1397
01:33:22,074 --> 01:33:25,498
you wouldn't want me to wear a thing like this.

1398
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:33,709
He bought it for you, didn't he? Now put it on.

1399
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:37,296
Not me. I got enough money to buy me a real fur, a silver fox.

1400
01:33:37,297 --> 01:33:39,799
- He wants you to wear it. - I don't care what...

1401
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,266
I do.

1402
01:33:42,427 --> 01:33:44,637
- I hate it, Chuck! - Don't take it off.

1403
01:33:44,638 --> 01:33:47,813
- It's like him touching me. - You know what he said?

1404
01:33:47,974 --> 01:33:50,226
He said you'll look like a million.

1405
01:33:50,227 --> 01:33:52,353
- Let me go, Chuck. - You know what else he said?

1406
01:33:52,354 --> 01:33:54,772
He said maybe you'll love him now after what's happened to him.

1407
01:33:54,773 --> 01:33:56,857
Maybe you and he can start all over again.

1408
01:33:56,858 --> 01:33:59,276
- Let go! - You're all he talks about.

1409
01:33:59,277 --> 01:34:02,071
- You're all he thinks about. - Chuck!

1410
01:34:02,072 --> 01:34:05,827
You can buy yourself a dozen silver foxes, but you're gonna wear this.

1411
01:34:07,244 --> 01:34:10,746
Don't, Chuck! Don't! I can't breathe!

1412
01:34:10,747 --> 01:34:13,091
He can't breathe, either.

1413
01:34:35,772 --> 01:34:37,654
Now keep it on.

1414
01:37:56,973 --> 01:37:59,767
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

1415
01:37:59,768 --> 01:38:02,990
And a brawla, brawla sooit

1416
01:38:03,438 --> 01:38:06,816
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah

1417
01:38:06,817 --> 01:38:09,610
And a brawla sooit

1418
01:38:09,611 --> 01:38:11,789
Leo.

1419
01:38:12,072 --> 01:38:13,835
Father Diego?

1420
01:38:14,116 --> 01:38:16,792
- Is that you, Father? - Yes, Leo.

1421
01:38:17,452 --> 01:38:19,500
Is Chuck with you?

1422
01:38:20,455 --> 01:38:22,633
I'm right here, Leo.

1423
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:29,014
- See that she gets the present, Chuck. - She's wearing it.

1424
01:38:29,381 --> 01:38:32,805
She is? How does she like it?

1425
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:35,812
Does she look pretty in it?

1426
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:38,515
Yes, Leo.

1427
01:38:40,642 --> 01:38:42,441
Thanks, Chuck.

1428
01:38:47,107 --> 01:38:48,692
I'm ready.

1429
01:39:04,499 --> 01:39:07,377
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1430
01:39:09,796 --> 01:39:11,476
I'm sorry.

1431
01:39:42,287 --> 01:39:43,754
Amen.

1432
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,265
What's holding up those oil drums?

1433
01:40:03,266 --> 01:40:04,650
Send them up!

1434
01:40:36,133 --> 01:40:39,354
Stop the drill. Stop everything.

1435
01:40:47,519 --> 01:40:51,572
Quiet! Quiet, everybody!

1436
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:56,280
Shut off that music and listen!

1437
01:40:58,155 --> 01:41:01,413
This is Charles Tatum speaking! Listen to me!

1438
01:41:02,826 --> 01:41:05,586
Listen! Listen!

1439
01:41:13,712 --> 01:41:15,807
Leo Minosa is dead.

1440
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:22,096
He died a quarter of an hour ago with the drill just 10 feet away.

1441
01:41:30,771 --> 01:41:35,820
There's nothing we can do any more. There's nothing anybody can do.

1442
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:38,781
He's dead. Do you hear me?

1443
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:53,587
Now go on home, all of you!

1444
01:41:55,796 --> 01:41:57,891
The circus is over.

1445
01:42:04,554 --> 01:42:06,847
Operator, get me Chicago!

1446
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,857
Operator! Operator! This is a press rush.

1447
01:42:10,227 --> 01:42:14,445
Get me New York. Longacre 57598.

1448
01:44:22,984 --> 01:44:25,614
What are they doing with that?

1449
01:44:26,446 --> 01:44:29,782
They're taking it away. Orders from New York.

1450
01:44:29,783 --> 01:44:32,159
You never heard anybody as mad as Nagel.

1451
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,495
I don't get it either, Chuck. Where were you?

1452
01:44:34,496 --> 01:44:36,956
What's the idea of not protecting your own paper?

1453
01:44:36,957 --> 01:44:40,381
You had it all for yourself. You had it first.

1454
01:44:41,044 --> 01:44:44,931
- He told me to tell you you're fired. - Get me a drink.

1455
01:44:54,307 --> 01:44:57,768
So they moved your piano out, eh? What are you gonna play on now?

1456
01:44:57,769 --> 01:44:59,645
Had everything sewed up, didn't you, Tatum?

1457
01:44:59,646 --> 01:45:02,488
Everything but the payoff. What slipped up?

1458
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:04,108
Beat it.

1459
01:45:04,109 --> 01:45:06,819
Booze yourself out of another job, fan?

1460
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:10,458
The great Tatum. Better wipe his mouth.

1461
01:45:10,949 --> 01:45:12,961
Beat it. Beat it.

1462
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:15,661
You heard him. Outside, all of you.

1463
01:45:15,662 --> 01:45:17,204
Where do you go from here, Tatum?

1464
01:45:17,205 --> 01:45:21,083
Maybe the kid can get you a job on a high school paper.

1465
01:45:21,084 --> 01:45:24,628
Put in a call to New York. I wanna talk to Nagel.

1466
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:26,380
Aren't you a little late, Tatum?

1467
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:31,264
- The papers are on the street now. - Don't stand there, Herbie. Get Nagel.

1468
01:45:31,928 --> 01:45:35,097
What're you gonna flash to them? How they weave a Navajo rug?

1469
01:45:35,098 --> 01:45:37,266
That ought to be worth $1,000 a day.

1470
01:45:37,267 --> 01:45:39,810
Look, Tatum, you were good to us. We'll be good to you.

1471
01:45:39,811 --> 01:45:42,563
Here's a hot tip. We just got it from the sheriff.

1472
01:45:42,564 --> 01:45:46,071
He's gonna dig Leo out yet and give him a big send-off.

1473
01:45:46,443 --> 01:45:48,028
Get out.

1474
01:45:48,195 --> 01:45:49,320
Get out!

1475
01:45:49,321 --> 01:45:51,155
See you in New York when you pick up that Pulitzer Prize.

1476
01:45:51,156 --> 01:45:52,705
Get out!

1477
01:45:56,953 --> 01:45:59,665
Okay, hold it. Nagel.

1478
01:46:09,174 --> 01:46:11,305
Hello, Nagel? Tatum.

1479
01:46:12,886 --> 01:46:16,191
Wait a minute. Don't yell at me!

1480
01:46:17,015 --> 01:46:19,442
Sure. Sure, I let you down.

1481
01:46:20,102 --> 01:46:23,104
I know they're on the street, the other papers.

1482
01:46:23,105 --> 01:46:27,566
Sure, sure. Everybody else got the story. Only it's the wrong story.

1483
01:46:27,567 --> 01:46:29,496
Shut up, I said!

1484
01:46:30,904 --> 01:46:35,336
Leo Minosa didn't die. He was murdered.

1485
01:46:35,367 --> 01:46:37,660
Is that the best you can think of?

1486
01:46:37,661 --> 01:46:40,579
Stop it, Tatum. You're wasting your breath.

1487
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,873
Now let me tell you the story behind the story.

1488
01:46:42,874 --> 01:46:47,753
You got drunk yesterday, you were drunk all night, and you're still drunk!

1489
01:46:47,754 --> 01:46:49,505
All right, I'm crazy!

1490
01:46:49,506 --> 01:46:51,799
But it's only because I took a chance on you!

1491
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,885
And I'm giving you your money's worth, a Tatum special.

1492
01:46:54,886 --> 01:46:57,680
Something that'll make all the other papers look sick.

1493
01:46:57,681 --> 01:47:00,766
Hey, Nagel, you wouldn't be sap enough to hang up on me.

1494
01:47:00,767 --> 01:47:02,309
Not now. Listen to this.

1495
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:05,020
"Reporter keeps man buried for six days!"

1496
01:47:05,021 --> 01:47:07,273
Now get set for the rest of it.

1497
01:47:07,274 --> 01:47:10,069
Nail! Nail! Nail!

1498
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,405
New York?

1499
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:21,834
Running a big-city newspaper, that bald-headed idiot.

1500
01:47:22,539 --> 01:47:24,670
He won't believe me.

1501
01:47:25,834 --> 01:47:28,261
You believe me, don't you?

1502
01:47:30,213 --> 01:47:32,226
Yes, I do, Chuck.

1503
01:47:33,341 --> 01:47:36,135
Now let me help you. I'll take you to a doctor or a hospital.

1504
01:47:36,136 --> 01:47:38,184
Forget the doctor.

1505
01:47:39,264 --> 01:47:41,223
We've got things to do.

1506
01:47:41,224 --> 01:47:43,934
Like, for instance, re-elect a sheriff.

1507
01:47:43,935 --> 01:47:46,612
Come on, fan. We got a deadline.

1508
01:48:28,772 --> 01:48:31,863
Come on, Herbie. You're wasting my time.

1509
01:49:36,089 --> 01:49:40,177
Sit down. That's your desk.

1510
01:49:40,886 --> 01:49:42,684
Now go to work.

1511
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:55,322
What's the matter with everybody? Haven't you ever seen me before?

1512
01:49:55,817 --> 01:50:00,415
Go on! It's getting late! Your paper starts printing in an hour.

1513
01:50:02,074 --> 01:50:08,498
Mr Boot! Boot! Mr Boot!

1514
01:50:12,751 --> 01:50:14,549
Where's Boot?

1515
01:50:20,175 --> 01:50:21,855
Yes, Chuck.

1516
01:50:25,972 --> 01:50:29,895
How'd you like to make yourself $1,000 a day, Mr Boot?

1517
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,820
You can have me for nothing.

1518
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,820
You can have me for nothing.
