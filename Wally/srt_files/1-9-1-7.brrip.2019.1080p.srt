1
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake.</font>

2
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake.</font>

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Sarge.</font>

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick a man, bring your kit.</font>

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Sarge.</font>

6
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't dawdle.</font>

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sarge.</font>

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did they feed us?</font>

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just mail.</font>

10
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Myrtle's having puppies.</font>

11
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get anything?</font>

12
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

13
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm bloody starvin', aren't you?</font>

14
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought we might get
some decent grub out here.</font>

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the only reason
I decided against the priesthood.</font>

16
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you got there?</font>

17
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ham and bread.</font>

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you find that?</font>

19
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have my uses.</font>

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

21
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tastes like old shoe.</font>

22
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheer up. This time next week,
it'll be chicken dinner.</font>

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not me.</font>

24
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My leave got canceled.</font>

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say why?</font>

26
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No idea.</font>

27
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easier not to go back at all.</font>

28
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through!</font>

29
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's up. Did you hear anything?</font>

30
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

31
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has to be the push, right?</font>

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 bob says we're going up.</font>

33
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not taking that bet.</font>

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? 'Cause you know I'm right?</font>

35
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, because you haven't got 10 bob.</font>

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your own time, gentlemen.</font>

37
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is there any news, Sarge?
- News of what?</font>

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The big push.
It was supposed to happen weeks ago.</font>

39
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They told us we'd be home by Christmas.</font>

40
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, well, sorry to disrupt
your crowded schedule, Blake,</font>

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the brass hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.</font>

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More's the pity, Sarge.
I could've done with some turkey.</font>

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll make sure to relay
your displeasure to command.</font>

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's on the cards then,
Sergeant?</font>

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hun are up to something.</font>

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any idea what?</font>

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. But it's about to ruin our weekend.</font>

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, listen.</font>

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erinmore is inside, so tidy yourselves up.</font>

50
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never know, might be mentions
in dispatches for this one...</font>

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't bugger it up.</font>

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be something big
if the general's here.</font>

53
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, sir.</font>

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one of you is Blake?</font>

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a brother,
a lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?</font>

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. Joseph Blake. Is he...</font>

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive. As far as I know.</font>

59
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with your help,
I'd like to keep it that way.</font>

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sanders tells me
you're good with maps. That true?</font>

61
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good enough, sir.</font>

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are here.</font>

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 2nd Devons are advancing here.</font>

65
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long will it take you to get there?</font>

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand, sir.</font>

67
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir, that land is held by the Germans.
- Germans have gone.</font>

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get your hopes up.</font>

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It appears to be a strategic withdrawal.</font>

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They seem to have created a new line,
9 miles back here by the looks of it.</font>

71
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Mackenzie
is in command of the 2nd.</font>

72
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sent word yesterday morning
he was going after the retreating Germans.</font>

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is convinced he has them on the run,</font>

74
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that if he can break their lines now,
he will turn the tide.</font>

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is wrong.</font>

76
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Mackenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy's new line.</font>

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come around here, gentlemen.</font>

78
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 miles deep,
field fortifications, defenses,</font>

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">artillery the like of which
we've never seen before.</font>

80
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow.</font>

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have no idea
what they're in for.</font>

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we can't warn them.</font>

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a parting gift,
the enemy cut all our telephone lines.</font>

84
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your orders are to get to the 2nd
at Croisilles Wood,</font>

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one mile southeast
of the town of Ecoust.</font>

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deliver this to Colonel Mackenzie.</font>

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a direct order
to call off tomorrow morning's attack.</font>

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't,
it will be a massacre.</font>

89
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will lose two battalions,
1,600 men, your brother among them.</font>

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think
you can get there in time?</font>

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

92
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any questions?</font>

93
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, sir.
- Good.</font>

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over to you, Lieutenant.</font>

95
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Supplies, gentlemen.</font>

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Map, torches, grenades,
and a couple of little treats.</font>

97
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave immediately. Take this trench west
up on Sauchiehall Street.</font>

98
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then northwest on Paradise Alley
at the front.</font>

99
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.</font>

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give this note to Major Stevenson.</font>

101
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's holding the line
at the shortest span of no-man's-land.</font>

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll cross there.</font>

103
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be daylight, sir.
They'll see us.</font>

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no need to be concerned.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should meet no resistance.</font>

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, is... is it just us?</font>

106
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,
He travels the fastest who travels alone."</font>

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir, I would.</font>

108
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

109
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake, let's talk about this
for a minute.</font>

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake!</font>

112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just need to think about it.</font>

113
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing to think about.
It's my big brother.</font>

114
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should at least wait until it's dark.
- Erinmore said to leave immediately.</font>

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erinmore's
never seen no-man's-land.</font>

116
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won't make it 10 yards.</font>

117
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we just wait...</font>

118
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:55,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You heard him.
He said the Boche have gone.</font>

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why he gave us grenades?</font>

120
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry.</font>

121
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I'm saying is that we wait.</font>

122
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you would say that
'cause it's not your brother, is it?</font>

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone, it didn't end well.</font>

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know, Blake.
You weren't there.</font>

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. Excuse me.</font>

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

127
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going up the down trench,
you bloody idiot.</font>

128
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Orders of the general, sir.</font>

129
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
say the Boche have gone.</font>

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9 miles would take us,
what, 6 hours?</font>

131
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8 at the very most.</font>

132
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we've got time to wait
until the sun sets.</font>

133
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's enemy territory.
- Otherwise we'll be wide open.</font>

134
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got no idea what we're walking into.</font>

135
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake, if we're not clever about this,
no one will get to your brother.</font>

136
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

137
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here. This is the front line.</font>

138
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we need to find the Yorks.</font>

139
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, mate.</font>

140
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch who you're shoving.
- Get out of the way.</font>

141
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck do you think you are,
pushing wounded soldiers?</font>

142
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know. Let go of me!</font>

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arsehole knocked down our sergeant.
The man's fucking wounded!</font>

144
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'm sorry.
All right? I'm sorry!</font>

145
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.</font>

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Orders from the general.
- Just let me through.</font>

147
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way.</font>

148
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Just watch where you're going.</font>

149
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's bloody quiet.</font>

150
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it like this before Thiepval?</font>

151
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't remember.</font>

152
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember the Somme?</font>

153
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not really.
- Hey, mind us. Come on.</font>

154
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you did all right out of it.</font>

155
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least wear your ribbon.</font>

156
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't have it anymore.</font>

157
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You lost your medal?</font>

158
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heads down, boys.</font>

159
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, lads. Keep digging.</font>

160
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay low.</font>

161
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake, careful there.</font>

162
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're stepping on the dead.</font>

163
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our sergeant.</font>

164
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be better washing them out of this dugout
with a bloody hose.</font>

165
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where the Yorks are?</font>

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The next bend,
you'll be standing on top of half of them.</font>

167
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shot to hell 2 nights ago.</font>

168
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yorks?</font>

169
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Corp.</font>

170
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Major Stevenson?</font>

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was killed.
Couple of nights ago, Corporal.</font>

172
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Leslie has command.</font>

173
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where can we find him?</font>

174
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next dugout.</font>

175
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

177
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lieutenant Leslie, sir?
- What is it?</font>

178
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a message
from General Erinmore.</font>

179
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you our relief?
- No, sir.</font>

180
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then when the fucking hell are they due?</font>

181
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know, sir,
but we've got orders to cross here.</font>

182
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the German front line.</font>

183
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know, sir.</font>

184
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you'll just take the letter.</font>

185
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Settle a bet. What day is it?</font>

186
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friday.</font>

187
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friday? Well, none of us was right.</font>

188
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This idiot thought it was Tuesday.
- Sorry, sir.</font>

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they out of their fucking minds?</font>

190
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One slow night, the brass think
the Hun have just gone home?</font>

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think they're wrong, sir?</font>

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost an officer and 3 men
2 nights ago.</font>

193
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were shot to bits patching up wire.</font>

194
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We dragged two of them back here.
Needn't have bothered...</font>

195
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.</font>

196
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There are aerials of the new line...
- Shut up.</font>

197
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fought and died
over every inch of this fucking place.</font>

198
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now they suddenly give us miles.
It's a trap.</font>

199
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But chin up.
There's a medal in it, for sure.</font>

200
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.</font>

201
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the nearest way through, sir?</font>

203
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our wire's a mess,
but there is a path through of sorts.</font>

204
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rushworth, let him look.</font>

205
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Straight ahead to the left,
past the dead horses.</font>

206
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a gap directly behind them.</font>

207
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Useful because if it's dark,
you follow the stench.</font>

208
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you get to the second wire,
look out for the bowing chap.</font>

209
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a small break just beside him.</font>

210
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The German line
is 150-odd yards after that.</font>

211
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out for the craters.
They're deeper than they look.</font>

212
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you fall in, there's no getting out.</font>

213
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

214
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, Kilgour.</font>

215
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bloody waste of space.</font>

216
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any cover, sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?</font>

217
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.</font>

218
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was full of bodies, anyway.</font>

219
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your best bet is to pop over here.</font>

220
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you do get shot,
try to make it back to the wire.</font>

221
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won't come after you,
not till it's dark.</font>

222
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if by some fucking miracle
you do make it, send up a flare.</font>

223
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't have any, sir.</font>

224
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, get him one, Kilgour.
Make yourself useful.</font>

225
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

226
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through this holy unction,
may the Lord pardon you your faults</font>

227
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and whatever sins
thou has committed.</font>

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do hate losing these to the Hun.</font>

229
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, when they start shooting at you,
could you be so kind as to throw it back.</font>

230
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a good chap.</font>

231
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheerio.</font>

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

234
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Age before beauty.</font>

235
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

236
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look for cover.</font>

237
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sap trench.</font>

238
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay still.</font>

239
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're ours.</font>

240
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going.
We're halfway.</font>

241
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a gap. In the wire.</font>

242
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco.</font>

243
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. That's the front line.</font>

244
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck me.</font>

245
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They really have gone.</font>

246
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hand all right?</font>

247
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it through
an effing German.</font>

248
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Patch it up.</font>

249
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be wanking again in no time.</font>

250
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong hand.</font>

251
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not long gone.</font>

252
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No good.</font>

253
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blocked.</font>

254
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might be a way through.</font>

255
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

256
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

257
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's massive.</font>

258
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They built all this.</font>

259
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's our way through.</font>

260
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco.</font>

261
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How 'bout this?</font>

262
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bloody hell.</font>

263
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even their rats are bigger than ours.</font>

264
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think's
in the bags?</font>

265
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot be that hungry.</font>

266
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at him.
Cocky little bastard.</font>

267
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could eat this, though.</font>

268
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

269
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boche dog meat.</font>

270
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's in the other boxes?</font>

271
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's wrong?
- Trip wire.</font>

272
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

273
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

274
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goes from here to the door.</font>

275
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh! Jesus!
- Oh, no!</font>

276
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco!</font>

277
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco?</font>

278
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco!</font>

279
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco! Sco.</font>

280
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco!</font>

281
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco. Sco?</font>

282
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up. Wake up!</font>

283
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sco! Sco!</font>

284
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand up! Stand up!</font>

285
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Stand up!</font>

286
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up! Up! Up!</font>

287
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

288
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand up!</font>

289
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole thing's coming down.</font>

290
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep hold of me!</font>

291
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to keep moving.</font>

292
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

293
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see. I can't see!</font>

294
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!</font>

295
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mine shaft.</font>

296
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have to jump.</font>

297
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come on.</font>

298
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to have to jump.
Just jump.</font>

299
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't. I can't see!
- You need to trust me.</font>

300
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump!</font>

301
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let go of me! Don't let go!</font>

302
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Light! There's light.</font>

303
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, stop.</font>

304
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me stand.</font>

305
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty bastards!</font>

306
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful. They may have left other traps.</font>

307
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

308
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dust.
So much dust in my eyes.</font>

309
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

310
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have some of mine.</font>

311
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I'd shot that rat now.</font>

312
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you'd picked
some other bloody idiot.</font>

313
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Why in God's name did you choose me?</font>

314
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't know what I was picking you for.
- No, you didn't.</font>

315
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never know.
That's your problem.</font>

316
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, then go back.</font>

317
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing's stopping you. You can go
all the way bloody home if you want.</font>

318
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

319
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't.</font>

320
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know what I was picking you for.</font>

321
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought they were going to send us
back up the line or for food or something.</font>

322
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was going to be
something easy. All right?</font>

323
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought it would be this.</font>

324
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, do you want to go back?</font>

325
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just fire the fucking flare.</font>

326
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up yours, Lieutenant.</font>

327
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where we are?</font>

328
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Ecoust is directly southeast.</font>

329
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we keep that bearing...</font>

330
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we should make it.</font>

331
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, then.</font>

332
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

333
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They destroyed their own guns.</font>

334
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They destroyed their own trenches, too.</font>

335
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

336
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think they wanted us to go that way.</font>

337
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They wanted to bury us.</font>

338
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bastard rats.</font>

339
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, did you hear that story
about Wilko?</font>

340
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How he lost his ear?
- I'm not in the mood.</font>

341
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your eyes on the trees.
Top of the ridge.</font>

342
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bet he told you it was shrapnel.</font>

343
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it, then?</font>

344
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know
his girl's a hairdresser, right?</font>

345
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he was moaning about the lack of
bathing facilities when he wrote to her.</font>

346
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember
those rancid jakes at Arras?</font>

347
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

348
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:42,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, she sends him over this hair oil.</font>

349
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smells sweet. Like Golden Syrup.</font>

350
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilko loves the smell, but he doesn't
want to cart it around in his pack.</font>

351
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he slathers it all over his barnet,
goes to sleep,</font>

352
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in the middle of the night
he wakes up,</font>

353
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a rat is sitting on his shoulder,
licking the oil off his head.</font>

354
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wilko panics, and he jumps up.</font>

355
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when he does, the rat bites
clean through his fucking ear</font>

356
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and runs off with it!
- No!</font>

357
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made a hell of a fuss,
yellin', screamin'.</font>

358
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best of it was,
he'd put so much bloody oil on himself</font>

359
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he couldn't wash it off.</font>

360
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was like a magnet.</font>

361
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rats left us alone,
but they couldn't get enough of him.</font>

362
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor bastard.</font>

363
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heading back home.</font>

364
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder what they saw.</font>

365
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the ridgelines.</font>

366
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's your medal sorted, then.</font>

367
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

368
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Lance Corporal Blake showed unusual valor
rescuing a comrade from certain death."</font>

369
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blah, blah, blah.</font>

370
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You reckon?</font>

371
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

372
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that'd be nice,
since you lost yours.</font>

373
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't lose mine.</font>

374
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to it, then?</font>

375
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you care?</font>

376
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you not?</font>

377
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swapped it with a French captain.</font>

378
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Swapped it?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

379
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

380
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bottle of wine.</font>

381
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do that for?</font>

382
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thirsty.</font>

383
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a waste.</font>

384
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have
taken it home with you.</font>

385
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have given it
to your family.</font>

386
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men have died for that.</font>

387
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I got a medal,
I'd take it back home.</font>

388
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why didn't you just take it home?
- Look, it's just a bit of bloody tin.</font>

389
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't make you special.</font>

390
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't make any difference
to anyone.</font>

391
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it does.</font>

392
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's not just a bit of tin.</font>

393
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got a ribbon on it.</font>

394
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hated going home.</font>

395
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hated it.</font>

396
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I knew I couldn't stay...</font>

397
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I knew I had to leave
and they might never see m...</font>

398
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

399
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They chopped them all down.</font>

400
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cherries.</font>

401
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lamberts.</font>

402
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They might be dukes.</font>

403
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard to tell when they aren't in fruit.</font>

404
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the difference?</font>

405
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, people think there's one type.</font>

406
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there's lots of them.</font>

407
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cuthberts, Queen Annes, Montmorencys.
Sweet ones, sour ones.</font>

408
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why on earth
would you know this?</font>

409
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mum's got an orchard back home.</font>

410
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a few trees.</font>

411
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time of year,
it looks like it's been snowing.</font>

412
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blossom everywhere.</font>

413
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then in May,
we have to pick them.</font>

414
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and Joe.</font>

415
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Takes the whole day.</font>

416
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, these ones all goners?</font>

417
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. They'll grow again
when the stones rot.</font>

418
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll end up with more trees
than before.</font>

419
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks abandoned.</font>

420
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hope so.</font>

421
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to make sure.</font>

422
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take front,
you take back.</font>

423
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything?</font>

424
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

425
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you find any food?</font>

426
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

427
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like this place.</font>

428
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Map says get over that ridge
and it's a straight shot to Écoust.</font>

429
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

430
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that our friends again?</font>

431
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like it.</font>

432
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dogfight.</font>

433
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's winning?</font>

434
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Us, I think.</font>

435
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 on 1.</font>

436
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got him.</font>

437
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should put him out of his misery.
- No. Get him some water. He needs water.</font>

438
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right. It's all right.</font>

439
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steady. Stay still.</font>

440
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop!</font>

441
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no!</font>

442
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bastard!</font>

443
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bloody bastard.</font>

444
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, no.</font>

445
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, no!</font>

446
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus. Jesus, no!</font>

447
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to stop the bleeding.</font>

448
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop it! Stop it!</font>

449
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
It's going to be all right.</font>

450
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to stand up.</font>

451
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, yes. Yes.
- Right?</font>

452
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't, I can't. Ow!</font>

453
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We have to get to an aid post.
- I can't.</font>

454
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll carry you. It isn't very far.
- Just bring a doctor here.</font>

455
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't. We have to go together.</font>

456
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get up.</font>

457
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get up.</font>

458
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop!
- Come on.</font>

459
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop!</font>

460
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put me down!
Put me down, you bastard, please!</font>

461
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put me down!</font>

462
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

463
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to try to keep moving.</font>

464
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just sit.</font>

465
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.</font>

466
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to find the 2nd, remember?</font>

467
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother. We have to go now.</font>

468
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.</font>

469
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You can't stay here.</font>

470
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to move. All right?</font>

471
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to move. Now, come on.</font>

472
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

473
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. That's it.</font>

474
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on. Come on.</font>

475
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother.
We have to find your brother.</font>

476
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll recognize him.</font>

477
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks like me.</font>

478
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he's a bit older.</font>

479
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they?</font>

480
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we being shelled?</font>

481
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're embers. The barn is on fire.</font>

482
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been hit.</font>

483
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it?</font>

484
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were stabbed.</font>

485
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I dying?</font>

486
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

487
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I think you are.</font>

488
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This?
- Inside.</font>

489
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you write to my mum for me?</font>

490
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

491
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her I wasn't scared.</font>

492
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else?</font>

493
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love them.</font>

494
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish that...</font>

495
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish that...</font>

496
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me.</font>

497
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you know the way.</font>

498
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the way.</font>

499
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to head southeast
until I hit Ecoust.</font>

500
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pass through the town</font>

501
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and out to the east
all the way to Croisilles Wood.</font>

502
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be dark by then.</font>

503
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That won't bother me.</font>

504
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find the 2nd.</font>

505
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll give them the message,</font>

506
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I'll find your brother.</font>

507
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like you, a little older.</font>

508
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, mate?</font>

509
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, it's all right. It's okay.</font>

510
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Help him.</font>

511
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

512
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to him?</font>

513
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it the plane?
We saw the smoke.</font>

514
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

515
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go and fetch his things.</font>

516
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir.
- Sir.</font>

517
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A friend?</font>

518
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

519
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.</font>

520
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.</font>

521
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where are they stationed?</font>

522
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just beyond Ecoust.</font>

523
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>

524
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me, Corporal.
That's an order.</font>

525
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're passing through Ecoust.
We can take you some of the way.</font>

526
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

527
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, Sergeant.</font>

528
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put more men at the base.</font>

529
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the trunk!
It'll be heavier there.</font>

530
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might be a tight squeeze.</font>

531
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not
going to be able to just lift it.</font>

532
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pivot the front end to the left.</font>

533
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, they don't
make things easy, do they?</font>

534
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They could at least have retreated
with a bit of grace. Bastards.</font>

535
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

536
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not one of mine.
- No, sir.</font>

537
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has an urgent message
to deliver to the 2nd Devons, sir.</font>

538
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you get past it?</font>

539
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, sir.
- Oh, for God's sake.</font>

540
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just move it!</font>

541
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's room in the casuals' truck, sir.</font>

542
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, all right.</font>

543
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, now.
You can get through there sideways.</font>

544
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get here, sir?</font>

545
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crossed no-man's-land
just outside Bapaume.</font>

546
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took us the whole night.</font>

547
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bumped into a couple of Hun stragglers
on the way</font>

548
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who made a nuisance of themselves.</font>

549
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You going up to the new line?
- Attempting to.</font>

550
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Newfoundlands have pushed forwards
and requested reinforcements.</font>

551
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about your friend.</font>

552
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I tell you something
that you probably already know?</font>

553
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't do to dwell on it.</font>

554
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>

555
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hop on.</font>

556
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make some space there.</font>

557
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. In you get!</font>

558
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Here we go again, boys.</font>

559
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome aboard the night bus
to fuck knows where.</font>

560
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a dead dog?</font>

561
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got a fag?
- Yeah. There you go.</font>

562
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Butler, oi. Carry on with that story.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

563
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, so, when we get off the train,</font>

564
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beaufoy comes up to us
and he's having a right go.</font>

565
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Lance Corporal, whatever one does,
one never lets standards slip."</font>

566
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Scott comes out the latrine.</font>

567
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wipes his hand
on the back of Beaufoy's jacket.</font>

568
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit all down his back.</font>

569
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Was that meant to be Captain Beaufoy?
- Piss off, you. You can't do any better.</font>

570
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Men, your rifle stocks
are an embarrassment</font>

571
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the entire expeditionary force!"</font>

572
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nah.
- No.</font>

573
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're both bloody awful.</font>

574
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know.
You barely even speak the bloody language.</font>

575
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a better grasp of it
than you, Cooke.</font>

576
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Jondalar. Give it a go.</font>

577
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's hear it, Jonny.
- Let's hear it. Go on.</font>

578
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Rossi!
Never in my 200 years as a soldier</font>

579
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have I seen such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit!"</font>

580
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shite. That is total shit.</font>

581
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Could've taken my teeth out with that.
- You could do with a new set.</font>

582
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got somewhere
you need to be?</font>

583
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Arsehole needs driving lessons.</font>

584
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He should reverse.
- Yeah.</font>

585
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try it in reverse.</font>

586
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reverse!</font>

587
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Stop. Stop!</font>

588
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone needs to get out.</font>

589
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All out!</font>

590
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- All right, all right.</font>

591
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your bloody hair on.</font>

592
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

593
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3!</font>

594
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.</font>

595
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we haven't got the time.
We all need to push.</font>

596
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on!</font>

597
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,553

598
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! I have to go now. Please.</font>

599
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come on, lads.
Come on.</font>

600
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, boys.</font>

601
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3.</font>

602
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, boys!
One last push, yeah?</font>

603
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3!</font>

604
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in. Get back in. Go.</font>

605
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

606
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, driver, how about you try to keep it
on the bloody road for a change?</font>

607
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, piss off!</font>

608
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where are you going?</font>

609
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to get to the 2nd Devons,
just past Ecoust.</font>

610
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

611
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're attacking at dawn.</font>

612
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have orders to stop them.</font>

613
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come?</font>

614
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're walking into a trap.
- How many?</font>

615
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">16 hundred.</font>

616
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

617
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did they send you
on your own?</font>

618
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They didn't.</font>

619
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were two of us.</font>

620
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now it's down to you.</font>

621
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

622
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never make it.</font>

623
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I will.</font>

624
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

625
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at it.</font>

626
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking look at it.</font>

627
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 years fightin' over this.</font>

628
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should've just
let the bastards keep it.</font>

629
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I mean, who machine-guns cows?
- Huns with extra bullets.</font>

630
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bastards.</font>

631
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clever.</font>

632
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know if they don't shoot the cow...</font>

633
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will eat it.</font>

634
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still bastards.</font>

635
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's not even
our bloody country.</font>

636
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How long gone do you reckon they are?
- Why?</font>

637
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Worried we'll catch up with them?
- Yeah.</font>

638
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Be a bloody miracle at this rate.</font>

639
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, they're probably
right round the next corner.</font>

640
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piss off. No, they're not.</font>

641
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't they just
bloody well give up? Eh?</font>

642
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't they wanna go home?
- They hate their wives and mothers.</font>

643
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Germany must be a shithole.</font>

644
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're retreatin'.</font>

645
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're miles back.</font>

646
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got 'em on the ropes, at least.</font>

647
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We don't.</font>

648
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, bollocks.
What's up now?</font>

649
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not another bloody tree.
- The bridge is down.</font>

650
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. That's a shame.</font>

651
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like I'll be getting out here.</font>

652
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

653
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep some of that luck
for yourself, pal.</font>

654
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Think you'll be needing it.
- Good luck, mate.</font>

655
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, guv.
Don't balls it up.</font>

656
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you get there.</font>

657
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

658
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The next bridge is 6 miles.
We'll have to divert.</font>

659
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't, sir. I don't have the time.</font>

660
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

661
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best of luck.</font>

662
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

663
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Corporal?</font>

664
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you do manage
to get to Colonel Mackenzie...</font>

665
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make sure there are witnesses.</font>

666
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They are direct orders, sir.
- I know.</font>

667
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But some men just want the fight.</font>

668
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

669
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Driver! Move off!</font>

670
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anglais.</i></font>

671
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,718

677
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just me.</font>

678
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only me.</font>

01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to be somewhere.</font>

680
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to find a wood to the southeast.</font>

681
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, trees.</font>

682
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,115

683
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Croisilles?</font>

684
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me by!</font>

01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me through!</font>

777
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, follow your platoon commander.</font>

778
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,793

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your signal flags
or fire the signal flares</font>

781
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,480

of the Hun line.</font>

782

Now listen and listen well.</font>

01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the first mark,
A Company will advance.</font>

784

<font face="Comic Sans MS">B Company will then move
to the front line.</font>

has called off the attack.</font>

788

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Balls, man. We're about to go over.
We've got them on the run!</font>

789
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't.
Please don't send your men over.</font>

790
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way!</font>

791
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are direct orders from army command!
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?</font>

792
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ, man!
Go and see the captain!</font>

793
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I want us up there quickly,
you understand?</font>

794
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!</font>

795
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NCOs collect flares and signal flags.
Keep to your stations.</font>

796
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi. Oi!</font>

797

01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,957

on the first whistle blast!</font>

799
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man next to you falls, keep moving.</font>

800
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your orders are to break the lines.</font>

801
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is the captain?
- He's over there.</font>

802
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir! Sir!</font>

803
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, I have a message.</font>

804

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This attack is called off.</font>

805
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to stop.
You have to stop.</font>

806
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Colonel Mackenzie?</font>

807
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Mackenzie?</font>

808
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back! Hold fast!</font>

809
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,072

810
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

811
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Colonel Mackenzie?</font>

812
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's further up the line.</font>

813
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How far?</font>

814
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:20,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">300 yards.
He's in a cut-and-cover.</font>

815
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to wait
until the first wave goes over.</font>

816
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I can't.</font>

817
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:36,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7 platoon,
30 seconds!</font>

818
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't possibly make it that way, man!
Are you bloody insane?</font>

819
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?</font>

820
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, no, no!</font>

821
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready!</font>

822
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Colonel Mackenzie!
- He's in there.</font>

823
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 minutes!</font>

824
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:12,960

828
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- I have to stop this attack!</font>

829
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel, we've seen flares.</font>

830
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men on the left flank
have made it to the German line.</font>

831
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Colonel! Colonel!
- Hold him! Hold him!</font>

832
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me.
Listen to me. I have a letter.</font>

833
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to see Colonel Mackenzie.</font>

834
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no bloody way
you're gettin' in there!</font>

835
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant, send the next wave!</font>

836
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

837
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second wave,
prepare yourselves!</font>

838
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Colonel Mackenzie!
- Concentrate everything there.</font>

839
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This attack is not to go ahead!</font>

840
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have been ordered to stop!
You have to stop!</font>

841
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell are you?</font>

842
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lance Corporal Schofield, sir, 8th.</font>

843
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have orders from General Erinmore
to call off this attack.</font>

844
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too late, Lance Corporal.</font>

845
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, these orders are from army command.
You have to read them.</font>

846
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shall we hold back the second wave, sir?
- No, Major. Hesitate now and we lose.</font>

847
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Victory's only 500 yards away.
- Sir!</font>

848
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, read the letter.</font>

849
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have heard it all before.</font>

850
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna wait until dusk or for fog.</font>

851
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not calling back my men only
to send them out there again tomorrow,</font>

852
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not when we've got the bastards
on the run.</font>

853
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is their last stand.
- The Germans planned this, sir.</font>

854
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been planning it for months.
They want you to attack.</font>

855
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Read the letter.</font>

856
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Major?
- Yes, sir?</font>

857
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand them down.</font>

858
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Call up the orderlies.</font>

859
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tend the wounded.</font>

860
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold the line
in case they counter.</font>

861
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir!</font>

862
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down! Stand down!</font>

863
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down!</font>

864
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Stand down!</font>

865
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hoped today
might be a good day.</font>

866
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope is a dangerous thing.</font>

867
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it for now, and then next week
command will send a different message.</font>

868
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Attack at dawn."</font>

869
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is only one way this war ends.</font>

870
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last man standing.</font>

871
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have someone see to your wounds.</font>

872
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, fuck off, Lance Corporal.</font>

873
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bearers! Stretcher bearers!</font>

874
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bearers! Stretcher bearers!</font>

875
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, lad.</font>

876
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

877
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, sir?</font>

878
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake?</font>

879
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were two of us.</font>

880
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was sent here with his brother.</font>

881
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

882
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:23,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake,
he would have gone over with his men.</font>

883
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was in the first wave.</font>

884
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could I find him, sir?</font>

885
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can try the casualty clearing station
behind the line.</font>

886
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:34,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise...</font>

887
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:39,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

888
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major Hepburn, sir!</font>

889
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep movin'.
Keep movin', keep movin'.</font>

890
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant, I have to find Lieutenant Blake.
Do you know where he is?</font>

891
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

892
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear the way.</font>

893
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?
- No idea.</font>

894
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move along, Corporal.</font>

895
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can walk, move to the triage area.</font>

896
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

897
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Blake!</font>

898
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, he's out.</font>

899
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the bloody way!</font>

900
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blake?</font>

901
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has anyone seen Lieutenant Blake?</font>

902
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's hemorrhaging.
Go quickly. He needs a surgeon.</font>

903
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amputation. Straight to surgery.</font>

904
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My leg!</font>

905
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need some help here! Quickly!</font>

906
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need something now!</font>

907
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through!</font>

908
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come on, boys.</font>

909
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's taken one in the leg.
He's lost a lot of blood.</font>

910
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

911
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:03,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lieutenant Blake?
- Yes?</font>

912
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you need medical assistance?</font>

913
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir. I'm from the 8th.</font>

914
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing here?</font>

915
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was sent here to deliver a message.
- The 8th?</font>

916
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must know my brother.</font>

917
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was sent here with him.
- Tom's here? Where is he?</font>

918
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was very quick.</font>

919
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

920
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

921
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schofield, sir.</font>

922
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, what?</font>

923
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Schofield, sir.</font>

924
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">William Schofield.</font>

925
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will.</font>

926
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:18,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you need some food.
Get yourself to the mess tent.</font>

927
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I may...</font>

928
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to write to your mother.</font>

929
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.</font>

930
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

931
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was...</font>

932
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a good man.</font>

933
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always telling funny stories.</font>

934
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He saved my life.</font>

935
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am glad you were with him.</font>

936
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Will.</font>
