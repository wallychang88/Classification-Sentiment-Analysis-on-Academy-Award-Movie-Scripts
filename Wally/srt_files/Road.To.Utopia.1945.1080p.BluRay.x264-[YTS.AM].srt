1
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,402
For those of you who don't go to
the movies, let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,900
My name is Robert Benchley.

3
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,781
Well, no matter.

4
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,327
For one reason or another, the motion
picture which you are about to see...

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,699
is not very clear in spots.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,374
As a matter of fact, it was made to demonstrate
how not to make a motion picture...

7
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,419
and at the same time
win an Academy Award.

8
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,669
Now, someone in what is known...
as the front office...

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,262
has thought that
an occasional word from me...

10
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:01,932
might help to clarify the plot and
other vague portions of the film.

11
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,805
Personally, I doubt it.

12
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,728
Shall we go?

13
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,566
- It's 8:00, Pa.
- Huh?

14
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,656
Bedtime.
Put down that paper.

15
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,114
In a minute, Ma.
In a minute.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,787
Land sakes, Pa.

17
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,908
Sittin' there night after night, pouring
your eyes out over that old stock market.

18
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,035
Think by now
you'd be tired of it.

19
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,584
Well, 'tain't easy, Ma, to
change the habits of a lifetime.

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,756
Lot of nonsense, all that buyin'
and sellin', bulls and bears.

21
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,721
Can't see how
a body can figure it out.

22
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,464
Right now it's
kind of bearish, Ma.

23
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,434
It's... kind of bearish.

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,598
Come along, Pa.
It's 8:00.

25
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,269
I'm not a child. I know
when it's time to go to bed.

26
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,356
Pa!

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,942
It's time. Come on, Pa. Come on.

28
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,278
Aw! But, Ma, Doc says I
can stay up till half past.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,945
I know. But by the time we get your
ears washed and your teeth put away...

30
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:26,071
Yeah.
All right, I guess.

31
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,413
Here we go.

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,284
Ma, look and see if
everything got up with me.

I hope not.

00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,630

Oh, no, it couldn't be.
But it is.

Just think, 35 years, Duke.
It just doesn't seem possible.

54
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,440
Sal, let me look at you.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

55
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,560
And, Chester, you're a sight.

56
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,526
Yes... Hmm?

57
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,522
Don't forget, a man is

Whoo-hoo... Oh!

59
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,201
Take 'em away. Doctor says
I can't have 'em anymore.

60
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,366
You've got very little
to complain about, old man.

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,581
You won the girl,
got the gold mine, all this.

62
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,247
Things have surely stacked up
well for you, haven't they?

00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,254
Hmm... Who's doin' your
stackin' lately, Duke? Chester!

64
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,714
Girls, the Hootons and I
have a few things to discuss.

65
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,382
If you'll run along, Uncle will
meet you later at the club.

66
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,096
Nice goin', Uncle.

67
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,558
Nice family tree, and the
limbs ain't bad either.

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,144
Duke, tell us all about Alaska.

69
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,232
We left you for dead. How in
the world did you ever get away?

70
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,648
Rather a long story.
I wouldn'twant to bore you.

71
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,737
Hasn't ever stopped you before.

72
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,073
Go on, Duke. Tell us. You
remember when it all started.

73
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,033
Chester and I were
playing San Francisco.

74
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,993
It was the turn of the century.
Ah, yes.

75
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,580
There was gold in the Klondike,
and San Francisco was wide open.

76
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,916
A million suckers just
waitin' to be clipped.

77
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,036
There was excitement
and adventure.

78
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,628
There was romance.
Huh.

79
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:44,342
Ah, yes. And one night,
you remember, there was murder.

80
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,808
Now this is a device
known as "the flashback."

81
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,767
Okay, George.

82
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,779
Gold.
Millions!

83
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:19,123
What happened? Sperry, McGurk.
The window.

84
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,876

85
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,921

86
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,170

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,012
The police will get them.

88
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,635
Never.
They're too smart.

89
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,478
But, Mr. Lattimer...

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,597

94
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,824
Where do I arrange my passage?
No time, lady. Get it on board.

95
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,621
- Take it away, Joe.
- Right, Cap.

96
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,668
You better hurry, lady. We're shovin' off.
Hurry. Thank you.

171
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,049
close the box... regretfully...

172
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,385
Incant a few magic words
there over...

173
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,754
and gamble upon the generosity
of the spirits.

174
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,552
Matoom-bomba, matoom-bomba.

175
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:11,225
Ester-chay, we'll et-gay our
undle-bay tonight-a matoom-bomba.

176
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,644
What have we here?
A crisp 10-dollar bill.

177
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,815
Indeed, the spirits
are generous tonight.

178
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,028
Why am I monopolizing
this lucrative phenomenon?

179
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,945
Who among you, dear friends, would
like to try for $10, $20, $30?

180
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,239
Any small amount?
I'll try for a dollar.

181
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,659
A dollar. An assignment for
one of the smaller spirits.

182
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:33,126
However, a buck is a buck, and the
spirits are always in there trying.

183
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,371
Matoom-bomba,
matoom a-double-bomba.

184
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,004
A crisp, new five-dollar bill.

185
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,797
Five for one.

186
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,172
Here you are, dear sir.
Now who among you shall be next?

187
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,593
Ten dollars!
Ten dollars.

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,744
I'll try for 15.
We are building.

189
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,476
However, it's a big box, and there's
room in there for both of you.

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,063
The spirits will have to take dead
aim this time. Atchit-way, Ester-chay.

191
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,525
Matoom-bomba. Some
sharin' on the half shell.

192
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,397
Hiya, George.
Well, welcome home, Abe.

193
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,367
Oop, whoop. Well, it looks like the
spirit got away with this one, folks.

194
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,363
But that's the spirit for you.
Sometimes he puts, sometimes he takes.

195
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,662
Come along now. Who's next? Just
bring a buck in a truck here, folks.

196
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,533
You can't lose.
Ten dollars.

197
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,376
A venturesome lassie.
I'll see you later.

198
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,836
Twenty-five!
Twenty dollars here.

199
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,798
Call out, folks.
Don't get shut out.

200
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,423
Wait a minute.
Let's try in here.

201
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,516
- There they are!
- Out the back way.

202
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,264
Here now. Just a...
Just a moment, please.

203
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,141
Hey, what's the... What is this?

204
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,736
Here. Here. They don't seem
to think we're on the level.

205
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,571
Some people are so suspicious.

206
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,566
Run 'em outta town!

207
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:51,617
Ghost-O. I didn't think there was one more way
to get the cops after us, but you found it.

208
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,409
Fifty for Duke, 50 for Chester.

209
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,657
Ten for Duke, 10 for Chester.

210
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,659
Some life. Always one
jump ahead of the sheriff.

211
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,629
Five for Duke, five for Chester.
♪ And there... ♪

212
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,294
That boat sails for New York in 20 minutes.
Let it sail.

213
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,633
Look, mastermind,
the tour is over.

214
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,752
We've been posse-baitin'
every town from coast to coast.

215
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,097
And we just ran out of towns. From
now on, it's oceans and we take boats.

216
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,764
How do you like this? A Confederate
10-spot. How can people be so crooked?

217
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,388
We're taking the boat to New York.
Not that boat, son.

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,980
Why not?
♪ Going the wrong way ♪

219
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,476
Going the wrong way? Yes. It's going south.
It should be going north.

220
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,524
Going north? Yes. They
got that yellow stuff,

221
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,897
that happy dust,
that ever-lovin' powder.

222
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,649
Gold?
That's right.

223
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,445
Alaska.
Yes.

224
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,240
Oh, no, you don't. Alaska? In case
you ain't heard, it's cold up there.

225
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,956
It's so cold, if you shake hands with somebody,
they just take it and throw it away.

226
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,951
It's utopia. Everybody's getting
some of that gold on 'em.

227
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,953
I got all the gold I want
right here in my teeth.

228
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,797
I'm taking my dough back to
Brooklyn and opening a Turkish bath.

229
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,291
With tables for ladies.
Now wait. Wait a minute.

230
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,009
Where are you going with all that cabbage?
I'm gonna pickle it.

231
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,968
It's mine. Mine.
Yours?

232
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,008
All of it?
Whatever happened to 50-50?

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,972
Look, Svengali, you've been
hypnotizing me for years,

234
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,638
leading me around by the nose,
chiseling me right and left.

235
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,104
Me chiseling you? You chiseling me.
I got a record of every chizz.

236
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,565
This is fantastic. It's right
here in black and white.

237
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,854
Niagara Falls. $300 for hospital bills.
Great promotion.

238
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,271
All you had to do was find some yokel
and send him over the falls in a barrel.

239
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,819
It was a great stunt. Great stunt.
I almost broke my neck.

240
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,364
Pittsburgh, Chicago.
And how about Kansas City?

241
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,451
You picked my pocket
of 75 bucks...

242
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,164
so you could take Mabel Bronschweiger
out riding on a horse and buggy.

243
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,873
Ah, Mabel Bronschweiger.
Ah, yes.

244
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,538
Lady blacksmith. She was your girl.
My girl.

245
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,333
What a right hand. Yeah. I sat in
the hotel lobby for four hours...

246
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,455
while you took her
for a ride in the woods.

247
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,832
What do you care, as long as
she was out in the fresh air?

248
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,459
Anyhow, didn't I front
for you in Oklahoma?

249
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,835
Hilda, the oilman's daughter?
Sent you in there.

250
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,338
Was she born, or did they have to
drill for her? You shouldn't say that.

251
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,510
Maude, Sophie, Hortense. You're
packing a lot of groceries...

252
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,009
$1,200 worth right there,
but I'll settle for this.

253
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,262
You wanna go to Alaska and be a
blubber-ball for a bunch of trained seals?

254
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,185
Go ahead. I'm headin' home.
I'll see ya.

255
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,025
Okay, Chester. I...
I can't stand in your way.

256
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,021
If that's the way you feel about it,
why, I guess that's the way you feel.

257
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,522
That's the way I feel about it.
Okay.

258
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,698
And don't start tellin' my fortune.
It won't do you any good.

259
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,246
Hmm. What do you think of this?
A black nine on a red jack.

260
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,037
You use those cards to trick me
in every crooked deal we ever had.

261
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,411
But no more, see? I'm too smart.
Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop.

262
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,709
You're wastin'
your time, Duke Johnson.

263
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,459
I'm goin' right back where I...

264
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,175
What is it?

265
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,841
What's it say? It's nothing really.
Nothing.

266
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,839
Yeah, you can say that again.
I know those cards.

267
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,216
Why, this is amazing.
They're as phony as you are.

268
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,969
It's a lucky thing I'm
smart enough... Ay-yi-yi-yi.

269
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,767
What is it? What do you see?
Forget it.

270
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,857
You're not interested. It's a
partnership, ain't it? What do you see?

271
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,226
Chester, it's us.
We're back in New York.

272
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,569
New York? Yes, and we're rich.
We're fantastically rich.

273
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,065
The toast of the town. We're driving down
Fifth Avenue in a gold-plated carriage.

274
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,909
Fifth Avenue? We're sittin'
there smoking dollar cigars,

275
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,949
and we're throwing $50 bills
at the round haircuts.

276
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,413
Yeah. Fifth Avenue? We just
turned down 42nd Street.

277
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,124
Wait till I get back in the carriage.
Where you been?

278
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,619
You don't think I want that crowd
to get all the dough, do ya?

279
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,747
Let 'em have it. We're loaded.
We got billions.

280
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,215
Oh, that's fine. Where'd we get it?
Utopia.

281
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,881
Utopia? Oh, that's wonderful.
Yes.

282
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,675
Alaska, huh? Pretty smart.
Gave me a fast shuffle, huh?

283
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,550
You're laying an egg. You'd better face it.
The cards say Alaska.

284
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,348
No wonder.
It's a cold deck.

285
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:09,102
This seems to be a scene they put in
after I saw the picture in the studio.

286
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,321
Obviously a lot of extras...
I don't know.

287
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,318
Read all about it!
Van Hoyden murderers still at large.

288
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,537
Extra! Paper!
Read all about it.

289
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,451
Extra! Paper!

290
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,664
Police anticipate
an early arrest.

291
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,411
Van Hoyden's murderers still at large.
Extra! Read all about it here.

292
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,458
Hey, boy. See what happened
to Happy Hooligan today.

293
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:34,756
Careful. Now don't get hurt. You'll
snap off a thumb or something.

294
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,762
Keep it.
Well, Chester,

295
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,303
looks like the end
of the line for you and I.

296
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,143
There goes Chester, and
there goes little old Duke.

297
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,979
Say, that's pretty heavy carfare.
How're you gonna make it?

298
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,020
I'll get along somehow.
Don't worry about me, huh?

299
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,561
Well, Duke, I...
I guess this is it.

300
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,484
Ches, I never thought
we'd end this way.

301
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,731
Yeah, it's
so different this time.

302
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,824
I'm holdin' the dough,
and you're holdin' the bag.

303
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,568
Gee, I never thought
I'd have the biggest end.

304
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,993
Oh, you've always had
much the biggest end.

305
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,615
Where do you keep your butter?
Hmm?

306
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,867
It was great while it lasted, wasn't it?
What a combo.

307
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,494
Barrel of fun. Lot of laughs.
Oh, a lot of snickers.

308
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,839
Chester, we had a couple of
things that money couldn't buy.

309
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,299
Yeah, and I usually
got the ugly one.

310
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,794
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings at all.

311
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,841
So long.
So long.

312
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,674
Well, see ya.

313
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,847
Oh, Chester.

314
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,641
Huh?

315
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,355
I can't let you go like this,

316
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,477
not without letting you know
that whatever happens,

317
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,149
you can always count on me.

318
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,192
Oh, that's fine, Duke.
Just fine.

319
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,737
I want you to feel, Chester,
that whatever I have is yours.

320
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:44,034
Somehow I feel that
whatever you have is mine.

321
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,866
Duke, that little speech
touched me.

322
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:48,742
We're pals.

323
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,666
If we want something,
we don't have to ask for it.

324
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,382
We know it's there,
and we take it.

325
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,377
Well, this is it, son.

326
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,379
Let me have
one last look at you.

327
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,598
Duke... Oh, no, don't speak.
Don't say it.

328
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,060
Go quickly, and don't look back.

329
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,979
Pardon me.

330
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,982
All ashore who's going ashore!
So long, Duke!

331
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,109
Good-bye, Chester.
No hard feelings?

332
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,075
Nah. I forgive you for everything...
Hilda, Mabel, the whole works,

333
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,792
even for trying to pick
my pocket just now.

334
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:37,876
Why, you dirty rogue!
Wait a minute there. You...

335
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,799
Emergency!
Look out!

336
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,594
I gotta catch a boat!
Look out!

337
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,933
Back.

338
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,519
Where are you?
Come back, you.

339
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,105
Look out.
Get down.

340
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,894
Out of my way! Out of my way!
Out of my...

341
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,362
Whoops. Out of your way.
Ah, there you are.

342
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,732
Spread out, boys. You're liable
to get blood all over ya.

343
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,984
Why, Chester. What ever
seems to be the trouble?

344
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,611
"Trouble," he says. "Don't look
back," he says. Why, I oughta...

345
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,456
Now, Chester, don't fight this thing.
It's too big for you.

346
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,418
Like it says in the cards, you're
on your way to Alaska. Huh?

347
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,708
Alaska? I'm goin' to New York!
Hey, wait! Whoa!

348
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,302
Stop the boat! Hey! Wait!
Hey! Here! Hey!

349
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,420
What...

350
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,014
What's goin' on here? Alaska. Alaska.
We're goin' to Alaska.

351
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,349
He's gone, this boy. The gold
and everything. Too much for him.

352
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,139
A pitiful case, really. Don't
listen to that cheap phony.

353
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,604
There's nothing wrong with me. I'm
perfectly sane. Perfectly sane?

354
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,472
Would a sane man go to
Alaska in a Palm Beach suit?

355
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,271
I'm goin' to Brooklyn to open a
Turkish bath... You see what I mean?

356
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,021
No! Take him to my cabin. We're pals.
I've handled him before.

357
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,818
You phony. Wait a minute! Don't do this!
I don't want to go to Alaska.

358
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,739
It's cold there! Polar bears,
icicles, Popsicles, Eskimo Pies!

359
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,204
Wait a minute! Take your hands off me.
Look, I'm sane. Look!

360
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,161
Two and two is four. Four and four
is eight. Eight and eight is...

361
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,500
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
Eight and eight is...

362
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,166
Okay, take me below. He's gone. He's gone.
We've lost this boy.

363
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,757
You wouldn't do this
if I was in shape.

364
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,719
You need any help, just call us.
Stand by with a light mallet.

365
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,587
Me on a boat to Alaska.
Maybe I am crazy.

366
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,840
Now, Chester... Don't give me any talk.
Just give me my money.

367
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,308
Don't you think it would be better
if you let me hold the money?

368
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,348
Give me that cabbage
before I part your derby.

369
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,813
If that's the way you feel about
it... That's the way I feel about it.

370
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,148
Is it all here?
Count it.

371
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,254
Better be. We gotta be careful.
This is a strange boat.

372
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,362
There's a lot of crooks around.
Yeah. You won't be lonesome.

373
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,074
Now you know way down underneath I'm
honest. Yeah, but on top you're a rat.

374
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,693
Figure it out. That money will
be a lot safer in my pocket.

375
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,197
Are you kiddin'? We're not
putting the money in your pocket.

376
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,699
We're not putting
the money in my pocket.

377
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,170
We're puttin' it where
it belongs... in the safe.

378
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,414
See?

379
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,382
Man overboard!
Oh, no!

380
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,502
Hey!
Wait!

381
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,561
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.

382
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,725
It's only money.
Has no personality.

383
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,724
No, not at all.

384
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,109
You and those cards.

385
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,953
I can't understand it. It
must've been a pinochle deck.

386
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,369
Come on. Keep scrubbin'!
Make it shine!

387
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,241
Are you kiddin'?
My fingernails are all gone.

388
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,039
For the last hour I've been
using up the white meat.

389
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,412
Yeah? You'll keep on till you
work yourway back to Frisco.

390
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:25,383
Not me! I've had enough! Me too! Who
do you think you're pushin' around?

391
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,753
We're not cattle, you know.

392
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,721
Moo!
Moo!

393
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:34,263
Moo! Moo!

394
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,607
Thanks.

395
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,022
Baked ham around here.
Silly place to get a hotfoot.

396
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,273
Yeah.

397
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,276
Come on. Help yourself. This
is no sailboat, you know.

398
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,404
I'm doing my share. Your share? You
look like an agent standing there.

399
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,280
That fire's important, isn't it?
Yes, it is.

400
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,907
Makes the boat go, doesn't it?
That's right.

401
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,125
Supposing it goes out?
Supposing it does?

402
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,041
I'm ready.
Oh, well, that's...

403
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,581
Pardon me.

404
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,625
Thanks. What do
you do around here?

405
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,876
Nothing.
You in this picture?

406
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,301
No. Taking a shortcut
to Stage 10.

407
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,745
Very fine, Tony.
Very fine.

408
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,864
All right, folks.
Now who's next?

409
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,242
Let's go, dad. You're on. Not me. I'm
not following monkeys this season.

410
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,495
It's all right. They'll think it's an
encore. Besides, 10 bucks is 10 bucks.

411
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,918
Come along. Don't be bashful.
Who's next?

412
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,338
Here's your boy!
Stay in there, Punch.

413
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,963
Say, can I borrow that stomach, Steinway?
Take good care of him.

414
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,385

It's got asthma now.

Now for the winner. Line
right up here, folks, please.

436
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,493
He's wasting time.
Naturally.

437
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,289
Silly boy.

438
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,101
Next time, I bring Sinatra.

439
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,827
Pardon me. Could you tell me where
I could find a Mr. Ace Larson?

440
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,706
At his place, I reckon.
The Golden Rail.

441
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,582
Thank you.

442
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,507
So I came up here as fast
as I could, Mr. Larson.

443
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:46,478
If you'll only help me, I'll be
glad to pay you any... Pay me?

444
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,690
Why, you seem to forget, my dear,
your father was my best friend.

445
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,185
Thank you. Who did you
say stole that map?

446
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,903
I didn't say,
but they were seen.

447
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,239
Two men named Sperry and McGurk.

448
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,950
Sperry and McGurk, huh?

449
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,240
You know them?
By reputation only.

450
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,536
Two of the blackest cutthroats
that ever dirtied up the Klondike.

451
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,034
- Maybe the police...
- That won't be necessary.

452
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,459
Go down to the dock. I want to
know the minute those two hit town.

453
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,336
I can't begin
to thank you, Mr. Larson.

454
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,551
Oh, forget it.

455
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,005
What do you do?
I beg your pardon?

456
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,599
For your living.
How do you get by?

457
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,637
Oh. I sing a little.

458
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,605
I like that.

459
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,525
From now on, you'll work for me.

460
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:39,190
Don't you worry your pretty little head
about it. Just leave everything to me.

461
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,030
You've been terribly sweet.

462
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:45,324
The dirty dog. He just wants to get
Dorothy into one of those scanty costumes.

463
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,037
Not a bad idea either, huh?

464
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,375
I'm working for Mr. Larson. Could
you tell me where... Upstairs.

465
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,244
Thank you.

466
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:02,842
Who's the fancy baggage? A little
lady who's lost a gold mine.

467
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,714
What are you,
the lost-and-found department?

468
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,059
Yeah. I'm gonna help her get it back too.
I'm a nice guy.

469
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:12,021
Aren't you stepping a little out
of character? Oh, I don't know.

470
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,391
The mine's worth about
three million dollars.

471
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,358
And what do we get out of it?

472
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,025
Oh, about...
three million dollars.

473
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,773
Oh.

474
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,784
It doesn't leave
the little lady much, does it?

475
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,745
That's what I like
about you, Kate.

476
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,456
You're so good at arithmetic.

477
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,326
It's a beautiful thing.

478
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,876
The boat docks in Skagway in an hour.
But are we getting off?

479
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,418
Oh, no. We're cooked.
Don't look at me.

480
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,463
I didn't even want to get on this boat.
I was Shangri-la'd.

481
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,677
"Shanghaied," old man.

482
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,218
Well, one of
them towns in Egypt.

483
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,180
Hey, what do you got there?

484
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,649
Nothin'. Just an old piece
of paper, that's all.

485
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,315
What are you puttin' it in your
pocket for then? I save old paper.

486
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,315
You know, like some people save old string?
I think folding is more fun than twisting.

487
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:07,160
Come on. What is it? It's nothing.
Just a map of an old gold mine.

488
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:07,993
Oh, an old gold... What?

489
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,615
Just a little one, good for a couple
of inlays maybe. Come on. Let's see it.

490
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,619
I'm an old map man.
This is my type of work.

491
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,506
Chester, you realize what this is?
Sure, it's a map.

492
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,377
But what a map. It's the Van Hoyden
gold mine. You read the papers.

493
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,629
The fella they bumped off in San Francisco.
You think so?

494
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,347
The guys that have this room
must be the killers. Dirty rats.

495
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,468
We got the map though. It's ours.
How do you figure?

496
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,747
The law of the Yukon:
Possession.

497
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,683
How about the murderers? We'll
turn 'em over to the cops.

498
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,307
They'll string 'em up like the rats they are.
- That's too good for 'em.

499
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,435
They should be boiled in oil.
I told you we'd have a gold mine.

500
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,107
I saw it in the cards.
Those beautiful cards.

501
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,653
Riding down Fifth Avenue. Throwing
$50 bills at the round haircuts.

502
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,118
We'll be living like kings.
Living like kings, huh?

503
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,987
Sure. We...

504
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:51,905
I abdicate.

505
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,032
Nice little mine
you got here, fellas.

506
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,376
Yeah. Wear it in good health, boys.
Well, nice to meet you.

507
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,495
Gotta run along now.
Come on, Chester.

508
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,840
We got a little dust of our own to take
care of. Start cleaning up right here.

509
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,755
That blood.
There's no blood there.

510
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,385
There's gonna be.
No noise, you fool.

511
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,051
No noise. You wanna wake
up the whole neighborhood?

512
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,174
This is much better.

513
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,057
Yeah? Well,
I ain't afraid to die.

514
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,764
I just hate being killed.
That's all.

515
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,775
Wait a minute, fellas. Think it over.
Yeah, for a couple of years.

516
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,439
You wouldn'twant to dirty a nice knife
over a stale couple of million bucks, hmm?

517
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,408
What are we gonna do now?
Remember Schenectady?

518
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,571
Schenectady?

519
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,742
Okay, fellas, we're ready. Yeah.
We ain't askin' for no mercy.

520
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:36,583
Can we have a few minutes
to say our prayers?

521
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,793
Okay.
Be quick about it.

522
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,718
O'Toole.
O'Toole.

523
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,587
Daley. Daley. Daley.

524
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,588
Crawford.
Crawford.

525
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,761
No trace of those stowaways, sir.
I ain'tworried.

526
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,261
If they're gettin' off, they've
gotta come through here.

527
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,263
Flannery.
Flannery.

528
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,731
Peters.
Peters.

529
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,454
Anderson.
Anderson.

530
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,627
Lombardi.
Lombardi.

531
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,795
Sperry.
And McGurk.

532
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,386
- Sperry and McGurk.
- Sperry and McGurk!

533
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:37,017
Yeah, Sperry and McGurk. What about
it, partner? Yeah, what about it?

534
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,058
Nothing. Nothing, boys. Only,
just don't make any trouble.

535
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,274
Things are different since you boys
were here. It's nice and peaceful.

536
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,144
Well, don'tworry. We're
law-abiding citizens now.

537
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:50,398
And anybody says we ain't,
we'll plug 'em, see?

538
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,495
Collins.
Collins.

539
00:31:56,498 --> 00:32:00,208
Hey. What do you know? Sperry
and McGurk just hit town.

540
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,329
Sperry and McGurk? Yeah,
and they're headed this way.

541
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,797
Here they come now!

542
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,685
Come on.
Come on!

543
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,733
Hey, what goes
with the local peasantry?

544
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,273
One look at us, and they
run right out of the joint.

545
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,896
I feel like I'm back
in vaudeville.

546
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:34,992
I don't know what Sperry and McGurk
did to this burg, but they're dynamite.

547
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,236
We own this town.

548
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,327
I'll sell cheap.
I don't like it.

549
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,450
If those hoodlums ever get off that boat, we'll
be smiling from ear to ear with our throats.

550
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,372
Forget it.
The town's ours.

551
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,917
Food, liquor, supplies, anything we want.
All we gotta do is act tough.

552
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,460
Tough? Remember now, you're
Sperry and I'm McGurk.

553
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,712
You got it?
Got it.

554
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,891
Made it. Not quite.
It's a leaner.

555
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,476
Huh? What'd I tell ya?

556
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,062
We got the royal suite here,
dinner, liquor,

557
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,851
sled loaded
with a month's supplies.

558
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,101
Oh, ho! So far,
it hasn't cost us a dime.

559
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,228
Come on. Clamber out of that beaver.
It's not smart.

560
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,900
How will they know we're Sperry and McGurk?
We'll tell 'em.

561
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,947
If those two butchers ever get off that
boat, we'll wind up hamburger, blood rare.

562
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,984
I don't like it.
You don't like it?

563
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,578
I don't like it. You don't know
a good thing when you see it.

564
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,245
This town's a whole big jackpot for us.
I don't like it.

565
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,369
Skagway Sal wants
to see you boys.

566
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,793
I'm beginning to like it. Get out of here.
Get out of here!

567
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,382
We got business.
Who'd you say?

568
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,092
Skagway Sal.

569
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,178
Well, come on in.
That's our business.

570
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:40,300
Uh, where does, uh... hang out, hmm?
Golden Rail.

571
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,925
Look-a here, skunky.

572
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:45,977
Anybody in this town ever see Sperry
and McGurk with their beards off?

573
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,597
Not that I know of.

574
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,943
- Spread the news around.
- They're gonna see it tonight.

575
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,778
Okay.

576
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,788
Skagway Sal... let's go.
Now they're furnishing dates.

577
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,158
This is a great town, boy.
We're beginning to operate.

578
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,750
You heard what the man said.
Sal's waitin'.

579
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,836
What's the rush? There's only one dame.
That's the rush.

580
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,376
Plenty of time, Chester. You better
clamber out of that mattress...

581
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,796
before somebody asks you
for a cough drop.

582
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,294
You better let me hold the map.
What for?

583
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,170
You know how you act
when you get around the women.

584
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,969
The only thing I do when I get around
the women is get around the women.

585
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,309
See what I mean? Give me the map.
Half of it's mine.

586
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,928
Half of it's yours.
Here you are.

587
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,148
What're you doing? Putting mine
in my hat, in a safe place.

588
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,483
You'd better do the same thing.
In a safe place?

589
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,398
Sure. What do you
think of my underwear?

590
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,239
Not much, but put it
there anyway.

591
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,033
Hey, throw that candy away.
I got a sweet tooth.

592
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,665
You got a soft brain too. We're supposed to
be killers. We're supposed to look tough.

593
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:51,333
The almonds are tough. Lose it.
Throw it away. Stash it.

594
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,673
Here, fuzzy.
Dessert? Come on.

595
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,841
When you get to an elbow,
it's mine.

596
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,429
Are you crazy, feedin' a lose pooch?
We'll never get rid of him.

597
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,173
He's a cute character. Let's
take him along. Take him along?

598
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,392
Look at the size of him. He's as big
as a horse. Probably eats like a horse.

599
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,808
That runs into a lot of money.
You oughta know.

600
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,275
Come on. Now remember, we're
supposed to be Sperry and McGurk.

601
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,644
Tough, huh?
Very tough.

602
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,520
Scat, sad sack.
Go on. Scat.

603
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,024
Beat it before he
throws a saddle on you.

604
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,889
There they are!

605
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,566
How tough could
these guys have been?

606
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,580
Okay, everybody, go ahead
and enjoy yourselves.

607
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,245
Yeah, we ain't in
a killin' mood tonight.

608
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,253
Just a woundin' mood.

609
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:20,092
Let's get in action here. Sperry
and McGurk are springin' tonight.

610
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,927
Champagne for the crowd.

611
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,766
That's enough.
We're the crowd.

612
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:39,858
Now, at this point, the plot is much more
interesting from your point of view than mine.

613
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,580
Mighty fine. Drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink.

614
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,788
This is the life, eh, pappy?
This is awful.

615
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,381
What's the matter? I
ain't got room for her.

616
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,501
I wish I had another leg,
but I'm sorry.

617
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,672
Say, what happens
when Sal shows up?

618
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,844
She'll have to sign an application blank.
We may get to her later.

619
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,968

00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,121
You saw her makin' with those
eyes, giving me that "come hither."

649
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,417
Givin' you that "come hither"?
Yes.

650
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,255
Where you goin'?
Hither.

651
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,626
You're not "nither." She was
giving me the same business.

652
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,379
Wait a minute, Ches. This
gal's been around a little.

653
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,925
Takes a lad like me to handle her.
Like you?

654
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,515
Experience is the best teacher.
Experience is the best teacher?

655
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,306
Naturally, and I'm a PhD.
That's "Pinheaded Dope."

656
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,970
Let me tell you
something, Einstein...

657
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,438
Here comes the waiter
with the check.

658
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,933
Which one of you two
fellas is Sperry? Him.

659
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,410
Experience is
the best teacher, huh?

660
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,406
Don'twait up for me.
I may have to stay after school.

661
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,747
That poor little lamb.

662
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,838
All right, girls, everybody back!
Everybody!

663
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,958
Work fast.
As soon as we get the map,

664
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,459
Ace is headin' for
his place up at Dawson.

665
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,678
Are you sure they're the right men?
They don't look like killers to me.

666
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:55,925
Look. We're going to a lot of trouble
on this. Don't make it no tougher.

667
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,144
I appreciate that.
Only I...

668
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,978
You wanna get your mine, don't you?
Then leave it to Ace.

669
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,646
He told you to get that map,

670
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,066
and he ain't particular
how you get it.

671
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,068
Come in.

672
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,824
Well, here I am.
Start burning the incense.

673
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,871
Come in.

674
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:29,338
Well, here we are.
Yes, here we are.

675
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,622
Well?

676
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,136
Care to shoot a game of pool?
I'm glad I waited, Sperry.

677
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,010
Everything they said
about you is true. Is it?

678
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,229
I can only love a killer, and you've
got killer written all over you.

679
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,019
I can't hide it, huh? Those
shifty eyes, that weak chin.

680
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,861
Camouflage. Tell me, how many
men have you killed this week?

681
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,526
Just 40 or 50. I've been
in a pretty good mood.

682
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,526
But let's not talk shop. It seems
to me we've met somewhere before.

683
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,324
I don't think so.
Perhaps in your dreams.

684
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,539
You wouldn't be seen
in those kind of places.

685
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,578
Some women can love
any type of man, but not me.

686
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,875
I've got to have a beast of a man.
Do you hear me? A beast.

687
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,125
Is a wolf considered a beast?

688
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,217
My, what a fiery nature.

689
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,213
Let's throw another log on it.

690
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,431
As far as I'm concerned,
this picture's over right now.

691
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,972
Oh, Sperry! Never leave me, Sal.
You'll suffer.

692
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,224
Not for anything in the world.

693
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:30,820
Not even if they offered me
a... a gold mine.

694
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,396
Gold mine?

695
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:37,368
Money doesn't matter to me.
I don't care how poor you are.

696
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,158
You mean that, don't you?

697
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,248
You've got nothin'
to worry about.

698
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,584
Shh!
I'm loaded.

699
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,832
Loaded? Gold mine with nuggets.

700
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,459
Sperry!
Don't be facetious.

701
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,258
Keep politics out of this. I got the
biggest gold mine in Alaska, that's all.

702
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,008
It's ours, Sal. Yours and mine.
What about your partner?

703
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,601
Who, Porky? Just a stooge.
Carry him around for laughs.

704
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,563
Once we get that map off of him,
we're rollin'. Oh, he's got the map.

705
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,273
Don't worry. I'll get
it when he's asleep.

706
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:12,236
Where does he keep it? Sorry, we
don't tell anyone. We're no fools.

707
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,106
Not even me?
Not even you.

708
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,483
I hope it's in a safe place.
In a safe place?

709
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,200
Who'd ever think
of looking in his hat?

710
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,116
We're not amateurs, you know.
I can see that.

711
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,240
Darling, it's getting late.
You'd better run along.

712
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,585
What's the rush? I've got another
show to do. I'll see you later.

713
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,296
But I just got here.
I said later.

714
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,087
Midnight?
My apartment?

715
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,257
Supper?
I'm not hungry.

716
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,229
I'll go work up an appetite.

717
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,992
Come in.

718
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,948
You can take the lantern
out of the window, Sal gal.

719
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,667
The mighty McGurk is home. Sit down.
Make yourself cozy.

720
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,504
I don't mind if I do.

721
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,341
Well, this is more like it.

722
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,962
Yes. Seems like they
sent you the wrong boy, hmm?

723
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,963
I can't understand it.
I asked for McGurk.

724
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,305
Well, you must've
spelled itwith a "J."

725
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:27,224
I wasn't worried none though. I knew
you'd come to your senses sooner or later.

726
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,064
They all do. It's not
hard to understand.

727
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,103
Where are you goin', gal?
Cigarette.

728
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,569
You've already got one. Oh.
Oh, I have, haven't I?

729
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,983
I guess I'm a little mixed up.
See what you do to me?

730
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,110
You can't help yourself, babe.
You just joined the club.

731
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,704
Must have quite a membership.
Coast to coast.

732
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,119
We can always squeeze in
a new member.

733
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,539
You're quite a panic
with the ladies, aren't you?

734
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:54,630
Man, I'm murder when I make my move.
Murder.

735
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,046
Tell me,

736
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,043
how do you do it?

737
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:04,094
It's the usual routine... flowers,
Sunday dinner at home with the folks.

738
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,684
Make a little character. Take
her for a ride in the park.

739
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:11,146
Sing her a little song,
and then, uh, uh,

740
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,606
sing a little song.

741
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,144
It's the song that does it, huh?

742
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,940
You know, it sort of
limbers 'em up a little.

743
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,778
That song may be
just what we need here.

744
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,991
Baby, you and me don't need no scales.
Come on.

745
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,953
You're not going anywhere.

746
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:32,418
There's the piano, McGurk. Let's

Later? Midnight, my apartment?

765
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,144
What for?
I'm here now!

766
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:20,359
A cozy little supper?
I'm not "hongry."

767
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,734
I'll go work up an appetite.

768
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,199
Hey, wait a minute. Hope just
said that line, didn't he?

769
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:32,617
Well, why should he
get all the laughs?

770
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,303
Here it is. Nice work, Miss Van Hoyden.
You know what to do.

771
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,093
Keep 'em here in town.
Give me 48 hours.

772
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,716
I'll stake out the claim,
bring you back the papers.

773
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,593
Mr. Larson,
I don't know how to thank you.

774
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,311
Forget it, honey. We're only
too happy to take care of you.

775
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,773
You be careful. You've got
a couple of bad boys there.

776
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,769
Don't worry. I'll handle
Mr. Sperry and Mr. McGurk.

777
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,897
All right, mush!

778
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,951
So you finally got yourself a date, huh?
Ah, you said it.

779
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,365
What'd you do? Pick
up a lonely walrus?

780
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,284
Now, you know I don't
cut into your territory.

781
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,875
You're not kiddin'. You know that
school of experience? I enrolled.

782
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:22,918
You did? Tonight I take my first exam...
in cooking.

783
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,629
Never pass.
Why not?

784
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:27,501
I have a date with teacher. That's fine.
I like... What do you mean a date?

785
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,095
Midnight, supper, her
apartment... I shall be there.

786
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,806
Doing what? Waiting on tables?
That supper's for little Chester.

787
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,184
Oh-ho. Listen, fatter-than-me,
you're overmatching yourself.

788
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:40,807
She made the date with me. Why would she
make a date with two guys at the same time?

789
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,601
Why not?

790
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:48,280
How about that? This-This youth
here says you made a date with him.

791
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,944
Did you or didn't you?
Yes, I did.

792
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,942
You're darn right.
I thought you invited me.

793
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,318
Yeah, what are you doin'?
Sellin' tickets?

794
00:47:53,329 --> 00:48:00,452
I like both of you so much. And Sperry
and McGurk always work together as a team.

795
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,293
Not on everything, we don't.

796
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,791
Come on, boys. Let's go
downstairs and talk this over.

797
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,299
Who was it that said, "Two's
company, three's a crowd"?

798
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,546
Wasn't he silly? Yes. Yes.

799
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,017
I see no reason why a girl can't go out
and have a good time with two fellas.

800
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,976
Course not, as long as
one's her grandfather.

801
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,517
Why, Mr. Sperry, you
don't look that old.

802
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,657
So long, Sal.
Nice knowin' you.

803
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,071
Where you going?
North to cool off.

804
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,785
Dawson City. Have to
see about a gold mine.

805
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,246
Don't you have to have a map?
I got my half.

806
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,080
I got mine.
Half?

807
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,119
So long. I'll see you
when we get back.

808
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:44,291
Sled's outside. Let's get our
coats and blow. Lead on, dad.

809
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:49,375
Where are they?
2... 218.

810
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,386
Boy, what a blizzard! We should've
put on some warm clothes.

811
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:05,516
Hope there's no bear hunters around.
Mine's still alive.

812
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,434
Where do you step on the starter?
No starter?

813
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,358
Must be last year's model. What are
we thinkin' of? It's a dog sled!

814
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,698
We'll pull it ourselves. Not me! In
a blizzard? Through all this snow?

815
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:17,570
Are you mad?
We're not dogs, you know.

816
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,294
But I tell you, I've got to get a sled.
No dogs till tomorrow.

817
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,886
Will you have any by daybreak?

818
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,473
Don't fail me.
I've got to get away.

819
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,566
Here we are, off on another road.
Oh, and what a road.

820
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,904
Case those trees, that snow,
that scenery and that sky.

821
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,524
And get a load
of that bread and butter.

822
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,281
Bread and butter?
That's a mountain.

823
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:05,667
May be a mountain to you, but it's bread
and butter to me. Well, keep it shady.

824
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,253
I'm in a hurry. Think you
can handle it by yourself?

825
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:14,297
Handle it? I was raised up here.

Well, well. Chester and Duke.
Whoa!

862
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,373
Got your Christmas presents
right here.

863
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,593
Oh, on your way, fatso. Think we're
gonna fall for that kid stuff?

00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,589

in Santa Claus?

Santa Claus?

Children? Infants?
Babies?

867
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,636
Very well.

868
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:35,393
I'll just give 'em
to somebody else.

869
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:40,067
You'll be sorry!

00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,616
Da-da, da-da.

Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone!

872
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:05,886
Half a map! I let a couple of
two-bit hoodlums cross me up.

873
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,848
I didn't give 'em
that much credit.

874
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,638
Maybe our nightingale
is holding out.

875
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:10,806
LeBec was there.
That's all she got.

876
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:15,399
I'll go back and get the
other half... No, you don't!

877
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,352
I'm not going to tangle with
the Mounties unless I have to.

878
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,945
Van Hoyden got half the map.
Let her get the other.

879
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,235
Suppose I go down
and help her out?

880
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,904
Yeah! I like that.

881
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,153
I don't! I'm running this show.
You'll both go.

882
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:32,954
We'll give Kate a chance. If that
doesn't work, then you can take over.

883
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:40,590
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

884
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,794
Come on. Let's go down
and get them.

885
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,718
You know what Ace said.
We try Kate's way first.

886
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:51,184
Look. McKenzie's cabin's over there.
You understand.

887
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,393
Give me till tomorrow morning.

888
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:56,481
All right. We'll be waiting
up here in the hills.

889
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,987
And I was gonna
open a Turkish bath.

890
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,106
You had to feed that monster.

891
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,655
And you had to bring me to
Alaska to freeze to death.

892
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,993
You should quit grousin'.

893
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:13,286
You should've worn earmuffs. What for?
My ears fell off an hour ago.

894
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,999
We find that mine,
you'll be a rich man.

895
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,336
My hands are frozen. My feet are frozen.
Everything's frozen!

896
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,170
You'll be sittin'
on top of the world.

897
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:23,133
I told you.
Everything's frozen.

898
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,135
I'm cold.
My nose is like an icicle.

899
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,805
Icicle? That's a glacier! Yea...

900
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,677
Hey, look!

901
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,223
A pedestrian!
Huh!

902
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,518
Say, it's a dame! A dame?
You kidding?

903
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,362
What would a dame be doing up here?
It could be Sonja Henie.

904
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,448
Let me see her. Oh, no. Nothing doing.
I found her.

905
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,159
Kick around
and find one for yourself.

906
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,374
Say, she ain't bad.
Is she alive?

907
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,040
Come on. Don't make no difference.
She's still mine.

908
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,414
She's alive.
Pick her up. She's frozen.

909
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,883
I'd hate to be around
when she thaws out.

910
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,173
Goldilocks, let's get
out of this frappé.

911
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,513
Let me help. Okay,
but don't enjoy it.

912
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,975
No fuel shortage for us.
I got my little stove.

913
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,219
Oh! Look who's here.

914
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,096
Hey, what are you doing here?

915
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,348
We had a little date, remember?

916
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,852
- Nobody stands up Skagway Sal.
- You've got me wrong, baby.

917
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:28,072
Who'd want to?
Looks like I've got my little stove now.

918
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,818
Oh, cabin.
Over there.

919
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,694
We better get her to the cabin fast.
Yeah.

920
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,742
Buster, put your stove on the
sled, and we'll run along.

921
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,409
What are you gonna do?

922
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,035
We'd better start... warming
things up, shall we say?

923
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,581
Huh?

924
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,420
That's how it stands.

925
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,880
Either we get that map
off Sperry,

926
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,876
or those butchers'll
be down in the morning.

927
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,254
That's liable to be a bit messy.

928
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:55,930
Murder? I believe
that's the word for it.

929
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,732
Whoop! Whoop!

930
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,066
This is jolly, jolly.

931
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,733
Snug-warm cabins,
congenial companions.

932
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:11,699
Yes, sir! Doing
grand, grand, grand.

933
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,868
I'd consider Sal showing up
quite a coincidence...

934
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,828
if I didn't know
how crazy she was about me.

935
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,073
About you?
Can't keep her eyes off me.

936
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,949
How come she's always
looking at me?

937
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,122
She wants to see
what a bargain she's getting.

938
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,667
I didn't notice her getting
the welcome mat out for you.

939
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:29,293
You don't have to. I'm already
in the kitchen with my shoes off.

940
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,467
Ooh-hoo!

941
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,963
Yes, sir, this is great.

942
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:38,184
I think my worm has B.O.
It couldn't be you.

943
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,854
Well, we'll get another.

944
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,647
Of course, I will admit there's
something phony about that dame.

945
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,646
I don't know what it is, but she just
don't seem to belong here in Alaska.

946
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,320
Belong? Are you kidding? That shows
how much you know about women.

947
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:57,947
Look at her. Could you see
that girl anywhere but Alaska?

948
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,383
No, I guess not.

949
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,175
There.
You see what I mean?

950
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,890
You don't know any more about
women than you do about fishing.

951
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,260
No? You see what the
score is, don't you?

952
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,889
Duke, 13. Chester, nothing.
You're skunked, ol' boy.

953
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:24,810
Yeah, you're using loaded bait.

954
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,025
Besides, when it comes to fishing,
you can't tell how good a guy is...

955
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,896
until you know what he's fishing for.
Hi, boys.

956
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,364
Here's my filet.
Warm it, honey, right here.

957
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:37,828
McGurk, if you don't mind, I'd
like to be alone with Sperry.

958
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,661
Run over to Peoria
and get me a ham sandwich?

959
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,201
Blow and check with me
in about three years.

960
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,792
We may need you as a bridesmaid.
Wait... Wait a minute.

961
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,538
Number 14 just checked in.

962
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,038
Well, if you're a good boy,

963
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,211
I'll save you a few of the heads.
Yeah.

964
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,005
Pick one out for yourself.

965
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,049
That guy burns me up,
him and his 14 fish.

966
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,718
You'd think there
was no romance left.

967
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,263
Think all a fella had to do was sit
around and catch one little fish.

968
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:01,850
One crummy fish.

969
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,721
Let's go for a walk in the woods.
Oh, just a minute.

970
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,815
I got more nibbles
than I can handle.

971
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,272
Hey, bud, where's your partner?

972
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,646
He just stepped into... Huh?

973
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,741
Just tell him 15 was here.

974
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,237
- Come on!
- Okay.

975
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,490
Come on!

976
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:43,177
Oh, come on, folks.
Quit following us, will you?

977
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,603
You know, it's funny, us
going for each other this way.

978
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:56,401
But then I guess it just had to be.
We couldn't help it.

979
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,274
We were just thrown together
by fate.

980
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,154
No, no. You weren't thrown together.
That took planning.

981
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,281
Oh, what a project!

982
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,782
Come on.
Let's sit down.

983
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,752
The minute I heard you sing, it
hit me right in the old ticker.

984
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,121
It was going
pitter-patter, pitter-patter.

985
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,498
Then suddenly it started goin'
patter-pitter, patter-pitter.

986
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,716
How's it going now? I can't
tell pitter from patter.

1005

Don't get anxious.
We'll get around to it.

1006
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,400
Didn't anyone ever tell you
there'd be moments like this?

1007
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,613
My school teacher did, just
before we were expelled together.

1008
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,528
Sperry, how long must we wait?
Huh?

1009
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,697
McGurk's map. Suppose
he runs off with it?

1010
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,240
He can't.
I've got the other half.

1011
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,284
I worry so. I hope
it's in a safe place.

1012
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,157
Don'tworry.
We're not amateurs, you know.

1013
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,582
Sperry, where's the map? There's
only one map I want to talk about.

1014
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,877
Yours. That skin, those lips.
Where is it?

1015
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:21,752
Those eyes... They're
beautiful, and they match.

1016
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,923
Are you going to tell
me or aren't you?

1017
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,263
Let's get back to pitter-patter.

1018
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,929
Come on.
Dinner's ready.

1019
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,596
- Who can eat?
- Dinner.

1020
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,272
Whoa!
Look at those tracks.

1021
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,147
We must be on the right trail.
Come on.

1022
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,693
Mush!
Ha!

1023
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:48,324
I never thought a woman'd get me to
washing dishes, drying 'em and liking it.

1024
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,038
But I'm washing 'em,
and I'm drying 'em,

1025
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,749
and I'm liking it.

1026
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,252
Uh, we'll need some water
for tomorrow's coffee.

1027
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:02,296
Do you mind? I might
as well get used to it.

1028
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,475
I think I'll get
a little fresh air.

1029
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,356
Why'd you get rid
of chowder-head?

1030
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:26,449
The map. He wants to steal your
half tonight and run away with me.

1031
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,159
Who are you kidding?
What map?

1032
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,199
He told you where I had it, huh?

1033
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:34,916
Fine pal. That's friendship for you.
Loyalty, decency.

1034
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:38,411
A man has to sink pretty low when
he'll sell out his best friend.

1035
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,005
You wouldn't say where his map is,
would you? You're darn right I wouldn't.

1036
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:46,878
It can stay in his undershirt until it
rots! It shouldn't take long either.

1037
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:50,677
I trusted him.

1038
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,349
When do we leave?
What?

1039
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,809
Can we get it tonight?

1040
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:57,021
Look, honey, you've been blowing
hot and cold all through this deal.

1041
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,733
How come all of a sudden I'm your boy?
I'm particular...

1042
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:05,397
what type man I share
a gold mine with.

1043
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,528
That the type?
It'll do.

1044
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,528
It's just some of
my lighter stuff.

1045
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,283
Darling, promise me something. Go
back to Frisco and give yourself up.

1046
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,501
What? We'll fight it together.
Get the best lawyers.

1047
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,747
Maybe they won't hang you.
Honey, I got a little T.L. for you.

1048
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,668
I'm not McGurk.

1049
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:27,840
It was all an act. We found the map on
the boat. My name's Johnson, Duke Johnson.

1050
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:31,010
I knew it. I knew I
couldn't love a murderer.

1051
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:36,057
It's that other one, Sperry, he's the
killer. Oh, a despicable character.

1052
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,054
Those weak eyes,
that shifty chin.

1053
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,147
Of course.
Definite criminal type.

1054
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,314
Don't you worry. We'll take
care of him and his map.

1055
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,027
But it isn't his map.
It's mine.

1056
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,239
It was my father's, and now it's mine.
Yours and mine.

1057
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,982
I mean the mine, understand?

1058
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,780
I think the trip was
a little too much for you.

1059
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,370
Don't you worry about a thing. I'll get
the map tomorrow, and we'll beat it.

1060
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,205
There's no time.
They'll kill you.

1061
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,074
Larson, those butchers...
They're up in the hills.

1062
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,042
- Get some shut-eye.
- It'll fix you up.

1063
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:06,007
I think this gal is cracking up. Put
her to bed and see she gets some rest.

1064
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,592
I'll go case the killer.

1065
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,970
But, Duke!

1066
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,305
Hey, what's going on?

1067
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,597
He's not McGurk, and I'm not
going through with it. Not now.

1068
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,344
I'm in love with him.
You little fool!

1069
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,721
You know those thugs
are in the hills.

1070
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,269
If you love him, you've
got to go through with it.

1071
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,517
But he's not McGurk.
They can't kill him.

1072
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,611
The only way you can save him
is to get up to Ace Larson.

1073
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:31,608
You'll never get out of here
without that map.

1074
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,157
Well?
What do you say?

1075
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:39,707
We'll get it tonight
when they're asleep.

Quiet. Don't say a word.
I'll do all the talking.

1091

Honey, you're puffing. You
didn't have to run over here.

1092

Aw, things are gonna be
different after we're married.

1093
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,645
I'm gonna do things for you.
Big things.

1094
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:53,768
I'm gonna buy you real furs. You won't
have to wear this cheap imitation.

1095
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:57,943
I'm gonna buy you a home of your own.
No more sleeping on cold floors.

1096
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,566
Gesundheit, dear.

1097
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:05,493
And the jewels I'm gonna buy you...
emerald bracelets down to there.

1098
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,160
And diamond rings
for your fingers too.

1099
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:11,206
They'll go so well with
those long nails of yours.

1100
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:19,677
Honey, you've been
working too hard!

1101
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,132
- Sperry, are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

1102
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:30,184
- Who's that with you?
- Who do you think? It's you.

1103
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,978
It's... It's a bear.

1104
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,447
Now, keep calm.
Just keep calm.

1105
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,783
Help!

1106
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,827
Who's your girlfriend, junior?
It's a bear. Do something!

1107
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,538
Who'd you bring home? Who do
you think I am, Daniel Boone?

1108
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,158
Looks like we've got another mouth to feed.
Looks like I'm on the menu.

1109
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:54,162
Get my arm out of here.
She likes affection maybe.

1110
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,414
Keep it up or we'll
both be bear bait. Yeah.

1111
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,882
Pour it on, Sam.
Make her know it.

1112
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,717
We'll be so happy together.

1113
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,555
I can see us now romping around
Yellowstone Park together.

1114
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,095
We'll go
and live with your folks.

1115
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,434
All right, with my folks.
We'll rent a little cave.

1116
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,429
We'll raise a family...
A boy for you, a bear for me.

1117
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:16,059
Help! We're cooked. Here's
the house detective.

1118
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,418
A fine thing!
A fish, they let talk.

1119
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,761
Me, they won't give
one stinking line.

1120
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,771
Whoa! Whoa!

1121
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,108
I hope he'll understand.
Quit worrying about it.

1122
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:02,446
Come on, LeBec. Let's go.
Mush!

1123
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,546
Come on, kids! Cut it out. Yeah.

1124
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:27,718
Fix our breakfast, doll face.
We'll see you later.

1125
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,808
Come on.
Come on, girls.

1126
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,057
Hi, fellas.

1127
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,476
I'll give you three seconds.
Where's that map?

1128
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,190
The map?
Oh. Oh, the map.

1129
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,069
Yeah, the map. Well, don't worry.
We got it.

1130
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:46,907
Yeah, we got it. It's
in his cap and in my...

1131
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,363
Let me see that cap!

1132
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,923
Okay, this is it.

1133
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,794
Wait a minute, fellas. We'll
get the map for you. Sure.

1134
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,670
Where is it?
Well, it's in...

1135
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:13,893
- It's in the bear's mouth.
- Get it and be quick.

1136
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:25,111
Smart guys, us.
We're a couple of pigeons.

1137
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,027
Yeah, a dame hits us twice
with those big moose eyes...

1138
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,321
and right away, we start
giving away gold mines.

1139
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,820
If we get that map back,
I'm brushing dames off forever.

1140
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,699
Oh, they're poison. They run their fingers
through your hair, play with your ear,

1141
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,372
roll you, clip you, then
they throw you in the gutter.

1142
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,212
You know what's worse?
Than that? What?

1143
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,080
I love it.

1144
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,505
Next time, we shoot first.
And ask questions afterwards.

1145
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:48,969
Those guys are green.
They won't get far.

1146
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:55,389
But they took our dogs. Those ain't the
only dogs in Alaska! We'll find some.

1147
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,899
A couple of prospectors.
Yeah.

1148
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,689
Reach!

1149
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,449
Mush!

1150
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,953
They got a good start.
We'll catch 'em.

1151
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,167
Did you ever stop to think
of one of those dog teams?

1152
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:31,091
The lead dog is the only dog that
ever gets a change of scenery.

1153
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,963
Care for another pillow?

1154
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,761
No, I'm fairly comfortable. Yes.

1155
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,260
Mind the bumps like a good fellow, eh?
Uh-huh.

1156
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,388
Whoa!

1157
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,641
There they are.

1158
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:48,646
Who's that?
Moose hunting.

1159
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:54,948
Mush, mush! Mush. I'm
dying, and you want to eat.

1160
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,287
Go ahead.
Come on, boy!

1161
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,500
Boy! Freewheeling. Why didn't
I think of this before?

1162
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,164
Exciting, isn't it?

1163
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,459
If Hope and Crosby are
caught, they'll be killed.

1164
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,629
They won't be able to tell
any more of those jokes.

1165
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:13,345
Come on.
Mush, mush!

1166
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,183
Whoa! What is this?
Alcatraz?

1167
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:22,805
Let's hit for the rocks. It's our
only chance. Hey, they'll find us.

1168
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,228
It's either us or them.
My money's on them.

1169
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,816
I'll take this rope.
We may need it.

1170
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,778
Don't do anything
till you hear from me.

1171
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:59,593
Nice place to throw the Grand Canyon.
All this ice and no ginger ale.

1172
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:03,391
Stay up.
You'll get a draw.

1173
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:06,515
You all right?

1174
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,189
We gotta get out somewhere,
either up or down.

1175
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:14,861
It ain't down. Let's go
right down the middle. Okay.

1176
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,116
Oh-oh, dead end.

1177
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,702
Our luck. A one-way mountain. What'll
we do now? We'll use the rope.

1178
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:24,075
There must be some reason for it.
It might catch on a tree, huh?

1179
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,498
They gotta be here somewhere.

1180
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:29,997
Here goes. One in a million.
Throw a nail up too.

1181
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,093
Oh, hey!
Help!

1182
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:39,682
We made it! Made it?
Boy, one in a million.

1183
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,013
One in a million!
It's solid. Let's go.

1184
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,436
Whoop!

1185
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,192
Hold on!

1186
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,563
Oh, boy.

1187
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,657
Say, you got a match?
Yeah.

1188
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,947
What's the matter?
You crazy or something?

1189
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:03,743
Match. Rub your head
against the rocks.

1190
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,162
All out.
Top floor.

1191
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,629
Going down.

1192
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,919
I'm slipping.
Untie your boot.

1193
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:18,011
You touch that boot, and
I'll cut your hand off!

1194
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,427
Boy, that'll hold 'em.

1195
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,925
We could've been killed!

1196
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,020
Hey, am I dead? I can't tell.
You always look that way.

1197
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,394
Come on!

1198
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,571
Shh!

1199
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,914
- Shh.
- Shh!

1200
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:52,834
Shh! One little sound
starts a whole avalanche.

1201
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,963
I should have worn my derby. Shh.
You want them to hear us?

1202
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,337
- Hiccup the other way.
- That's the only way I know how.

1203
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,304
Hold it.
Suppress it somehow.

1204
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,971
Frighten me. I can't.
I haven't got a mirror.

1205
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,720
Well, sing something.
Huh?

1206
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,725
It's cracking up. One little
sound starts an avalanche.

1207
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,852
Don'tworry.
I'm okay now.

1208
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:18,321
Concentrate. Count to 20. I can't.
I've got my mittens on.

1209
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:23,194
- Count!
- Five, 10, 15...

1210
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,449
What now? I think
one more will do it.

1211
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:32,123
Let's see you come up
with something now.

1212
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,998
Ready, aim, fire. I can't.
I'm out of gas.

1213
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,170
Think of something, somebody.
Who?

1214
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,043
W.C. Fields.

1215
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,185
Now for Dawson City
and those dames.

1216
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,181
Dames! We'll be lucky
if we get to Dawson City.

1217
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,730
Just a minute. I'm the navigator.
What? Again?

1218
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,022
Mush!

1219
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,415
You see, they're not Sperry and McGurk.
It's all a mistake.

1220
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,205
Mistakes happen,
but that can be remedied.

1221
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:16,125
I'll send a couple boys
back to the cabin,

1222
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,794
and they can explain things
to Sperry and McGurk.

1223
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,216
But I told you, they're not Sperry
and McGurk. Well, whoever they are.

1224
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:25,134
You wait here.

1225
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,433
I don't want any slipup.

1226
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,176
How do we spot 'em?
You can't miss.

1227
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:34,022
Kate tells me wherever they go,
they travel with a big shaggy dog.

1228
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,732
Drink up.
Keep your eyes open.

1229
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,068
They may be on their way
up here now.

1230
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,400
Mush, mush!
Hey!

1231
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:48,370
Whoa, you dogs. Okay, gas up, kids.
Very tiring trip.

1232
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:51,456
That speed bother you? I should've
had you at the other end of the sled.

1233
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,495
Come on, curly. Where you
going with that fleabag?

1234
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,415
We got trouble enough. Stake her out there.
Don't want her?

1235
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,335
Put her over here.
Wait for us, fuzz.

1236
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,630
If you see anything in slacks,
bark twice, and I'll join you.

1237
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:06,137
Don't forget, be fair.

1238
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:16,606
We act tough, see? Mosey over to
the bar and ask a few questions.

1239
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,441
Why, sure.

1240
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,046
Couple of strangers in town.

1241
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:43,258
Hello, boys. You new in town?
Yeah.

1242
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,468
Join me in a drink?
Don't mind if we do.

1243
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,589
What'll you have? Oh,
a couple fingers of rotgut.

1244
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,889
What's yours? I'll take a lemonade...
in a dirty glass!

1245
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,636
What's all the celebration?

1246
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,559
A posse. There's going to be
a little hanging.

1247
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,104
Little hanging, huh? Well,
what do you know? Hanging, huh?

1248
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,602
Well, that's noose to me.

1249
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:06,983
That's noose... I made a joke.
Every...

1250
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,907
We're killing 'em here.
Or vice versa.

1251
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,200
Hangin', huh?
Sounds gay.

1252
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,449
Yeah, sure does.
Happy hunting, partner.

1253
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,245
Who are you stringing up?

1254
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:21,372
Couple of fellas who call
themselves Sperry and McGurk.

1255
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,465
You don't happen
to know them, do you?

1256
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:28,178
No, no. I know Sperry when I see McGurk.
I mean, I know McGurk when...

1257
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,092
Never heard of 'em.

1258
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,135
Why don't you join us?

1259
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:35,511
We'd love to, but it's getting late.
Got a little ironing to do.

1260
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,387
Hey, you!

1261
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,974
It's going to be
a lovely hanging, boys,

1262
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:43,728
and I have an idea
you ought to be there.

1263
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,404
Look, stranger, how you
gonna hang these fellows?

1264
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,990
You don't seem to know 'em.
How 'bout that?

1265
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,529
We'll know 'em when we see 'em.

1266
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,701
They always travel
with a big shaggy dog.

1267
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,700
Well, I... I... Ay-yi-yi-yi.
I... Ay-yi-yi-yi.

1268
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,578
A big shaggy dog, huh? Yeah!

1269
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,753
The minute we see that dog,
we're gonna string them up.

1270
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,005
The minute you see the dog...
You're gonna string them up, eh?

1271
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:16,056
Sounds like a cinch. Yes. All you
gotta do is find a big shaggy dog.

1272
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:21,602
Alaska's full of them big shaggy
fellas... A dime a dozen around here.

1273
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,987
All you have to do is
find a big shaggy dog?

1274
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,071
What's the matter with him?

1275
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,658
His foot's gone to sleep.
Stomp on it a bit.

1276
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,999
He thinks he's a dog. His mother
was frightened by a Pekingese.

1277
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:45,293
That's all right, Rover. Gimme
your paw, Rove. Gimme your paw.

1278
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,416
That's a good dog.
Okay, I'm over it.

1279
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,918
You don't think you're a dog?
I'm not a dog.

1280
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:50,759
You feel all right?
Sure.

1281
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,254
You sure? Feel how
cold my nose is.

1282
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:56,008
Oh, what a hot horn! This is a sick
dog, sick boy. Gotta get him home.

1283
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,726
He doesn't look sick.
Let me hear that bark.

1284
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,098
Quite a big echo in here.
Come on, Fido.

1285
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,815
Oh, he's gone again.

1286
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,856
He's gone.

1287
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:14,326
Downhill here. The whole place slants.
Whoa, boy.

1288
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,955
Woof!

1289
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:25,287
A little congested. We'll
use the family entrance.

1290
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,505
It's been fun!

1291
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,370
Let's get 'em!
Come on, boys!

1292
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,667
Hey! Sal.

1293
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:08,997
Why, the little crook.

1294
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,624
That's the story, Mr. LeBec.
Kate can tell you.

1295
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,878
The only reason I went through
with it was to save their lives.

1296
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,754
You see, I'm in love
with one of them.

1297
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,509
I'd die before I'd let
anything happen to him.

1298
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,886
Very noble of you.

1299
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,889
Imagine a girl
loving a guy that much.

1300
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,809
Yeah.
I'm notworth it.

1301
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:33,029
I'm a regular Casablanca.
Casanova.

1302
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,189
When did they change that?

1303
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,032
I'm sure Mr. Larson
will understand.

1304
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,197
They're here. Get the map.
Put it in the safe.

1305
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:43,369
What about her? Tie her up.
I'll take care of her later.

1306
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:47,668
Why the dirty...

1307
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:51,415
I told you they wouldn't
let you say that.

1308
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,761
We gotta save her. Wait.
We'll get that map first. She told me. It's hers.

1309
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,884
Suppose they knock her off?
They'll be busy looking for us.

1310
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:06,013
We'll get the map and the girl.
What a parlay. Now you're talking.

1311
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,355
Let's move.

1312
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,735
Come on, push, push!

1313
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:14,195
Hey, get out.
Go chase a tree.

1314
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,064
Get rid of him.
Throw something.

1315
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:19,784
A stick or something. Get me some brandy.
A stick, yeah.

1316
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:23,075
Stick! Go!
Went that way.

1317
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,296
What do you hear?
Shh!

1318
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,837
Who taught you that racket?
My old man.

1319
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,756
Oh, following in your
father's fingerprints, huh?

1320
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,507
Oh, he was great.
Need a little light here.

1321
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:45,807
I'll light the lantern. No, you crazy?
They'll see us.

1322
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,230
There's a box of candles.

1323
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:53,605
It's a funny-looking candle.
Why has it got such a big wick?

1324
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:57,105
Has to. The nights up here
are six months long. Oh.

1325
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,402
And me with insomnia.

1326
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:02,993
There's something wrong with this thing.
Blow on it a little.

1327
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,783
Bring it down here.
Let me see.

1328
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,454
Duke, I'm kinda glad
you talked me into this deal.

1329
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,021
You said itwas utopia,
and you were right.

1330
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:15,632
It's been a lot of work, and I've beefed
a lot but I'll never blow up again.

1331
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:16,875
Come to papa.

1332
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,798
There you are, you pleasant
little parchment. That's great!

1333
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:24,095
It's only sensational. Sensational?
It's dynamite!

1334
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:28,011
It's dynamite!
Take it. It's dynamite.

1335
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,514
Dynamite? Well, finders keepers!
No, I couldn't stand the noise.

1336
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,769
Wait for me. Throw it out the window.
Out the window!

1337
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:51,250
Back away, will you? Don't
crowd, you dog, you. Take five.

1338
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:54,837
You had to bring that dog! This is no
time to go shooting off your mouth.

1339
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:01,007
He's going to do it for us. Oh,
what a fur coat he's going to make.

1340
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,598
Locked? Let's spread out
before the joint does.

1341
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,890
They must be here. Get out there and
find them. Don't come back without them.

1342
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,058
Maybe we can sneak through.
Sneak through?

1343
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:16,522
That's a slaughterhouse.
You wanna hang upside down?

1344
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:20,567
What size hook do you want?

1345
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,613
Look!

1346
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,699
Dynamite, see?
The real thing, see?

1347
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,875
I'll give you three to get
out of here. One, two...

1348
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:45,505
Nice going. Douse it! Get it out!
Get it out! Ooh, got a hot knuckle.

1349
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:49,179
Attaboy. Thought they
could scare me, huh?

1350
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:52,054
You got plenty of heart, buster.
It's just close in here.

1351
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,397
What round was it? Let's
find Sal and get out.

1352
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:58,689
In here!
Right rudder.

1353
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,903
Don't worry, baby.
We're here now.

1354
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,522
Thought we were
a couple schoolboys.

1355
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,569
We showed 'em. We're not amateurs.
No, sir!

1356
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:07,114
Get you outta here in no time.

1357
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,825
We'll get you outta here.
Don'tworry.

1358
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,244
I smell something burning.

1359
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,412
The dynamite.
Put that out!

1360
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,911
Ooh! It's me!
Here!

1361
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,253
Come on.

1362
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,797
Out of the way. Move. It's
dynamite going off in there!

1363
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:25,670
Where's that map?
Okay, you win.

1364
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:28,845
Start talking. It's in there in the desk.
Third drawer from the right.

1365
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,342
Want us to get it? No more
of your tricks, wise guy.

1366
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,891
This time,
we'll get it ourselves.

1367
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,483
We'll hear from them later. They'll
be men about town. Let's go.

1368
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,155
Well, that's it.

1369
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:54,666
The map, the mine, the three
million dollars. Not quite.

1370
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,285
- Mush!
- Come on!

1371
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,394
Look!
No hands!

1372
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,895
Watch out, no teeth.
Please. My sponsor.

1373
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,086
This way, come on!
Wait. That's north.

1374
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,210
There isn't any north. I suppose
it went south for the winter.

1375
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,177
You're near the North Pole.
What about it?

1376
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,889
There's no north, south, east or west.
You're crazy!

1377
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:56,933
East is east and west is west and never the
twain shall meet. And remember, I said it.

1378
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,895
There's no direction
at the north pole.

1379
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,185
An eight-year-old child
knows that.

1380
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,902
Next time come up here with an
eight-year-old child. You'll do.

1381
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:06,692
- Say, are you getting shorter?
- Me? How 'bout you?

1382
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:10,317
Oh, I thought it was
getting a little drafty.

1383
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:21,669
Look out. They're coming behind you.
Come on, jump!

1384
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:28,172
I can't make it.
Look. Here's the map.

1385
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,591
I'll hold 'em off
as long as I can.

1386
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:36,389
Take care of Sal. She's yours now.
So long, Sal.

1387
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:39,637
So long, Duke.
Boy, what a pal.

1388
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,981
Anything I can do for you?
Any last requests?

1389
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,895
When you get home,
look up my mother.

1390
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:48,488
- Anything else?
- Uh, give her my watch.

1391
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,527
Anything else?

1392
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,868
Tell her to give you a hotfoot.

1393
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,585
What happened, Duke? How did you get away?
Well, simple enough.

1394
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:10,380
There were only 15 of them.
I picked them up one by one,

1395
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:14,597
knocked them out and tossed 'em
in the chasm. Oh, naturally.

1396
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,591
Well, Sal, how have you
been all these years?

1397
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,639
How's he been treating you?
No complaints, Duke.

1398
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:25,608
Chester has been a devoted
husband and a fine father.

1399
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,647
Father?
You have children?

1400
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:31,864
One, a boy.
Would you like to see him?

1401
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,028
Junior?

1402
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,373
Did you call me, Mom?

1403
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,788
We adopted him.
