Hiya, Howard.

33
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,366
Allie! Sheez.

34
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,372
How are you?
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,618
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I just thought I'd drop in on you.

36
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,624
God, that's so funny
because, you know...

37
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,419
I was just thinking about you the
other day. I saw your show on TV.

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,717
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, what I had to do

39
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,965
to get to these clowns
to turn off the ball game.

40
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:17,386
This is Alfred Miller. He's my friend.
He's a big TV writer.

41
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,218
This is Margo, the big waitress.

42
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,970
How are you?
Pleased to meet you.

43
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,522
Listen, I thought maybe
before the dinner rush,

44
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,802
we could take a walk, play a
little chess or something.

45
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,774
Sure. Marg?
Can you take over the register?

46
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,983
Sure, Howard.

47
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,864
I mean, unless you're too busy.
For you? Are you kidding?

48
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,539
It's good to see you.
Yeah, you too.

49
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,788
Hey, Howard.
Yeah?

50
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,748
What's the price on the
Kid Gavilan-Basilio fight?

51
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,677
It's eight-to-five, Gavilan.
I'll take Basilio, five times.

52
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,380
Okay, you got it.

53
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,051
You never change.

54
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,771
It's your move.

55
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,486
Howard, I can't work anymore.

56
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,031
Yeah? What, like writer's block?

57
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,113
No.
Well, what?

58
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,904
You're not sick, are you?
I'm blacklisted.

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,910
Yeah, all right,
but you feel okay?

60
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,368
I feel terrible.
But you're healthy?

61
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,330
I mean, besides your ulcer?
Howard, they won't buy my scripts.

62
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,374
I'm on a blacklist. Do you
know what that means?

63
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,175
It's a list of names.

64
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,471
The studios have them,
the networks, the ad agencies.

65
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,802
You're on the list, you're
marked. You don't work.

66
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,475
So, what difference does
it make if I'm healthy?

67
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,262
Well, you know,
it makes a difference.

68
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,519
So, what are you blacklisted for?

69
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,068
I'm a communist sympathizer.

70
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,816
Well, you always were.

71
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,616
Well, it's not so popular anymore.

72
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,412
Hey, how many times
have I told you?

73
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,908
Take care of number one.

74
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,955
So, all right, who can you sue?

75
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,036
Nobody.

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,874
Nobody admits there's a blacklist.
I mean, they just say,

77
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,552
"Your script's not good enough."
"You're not right for the assignment."

78
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,388
You know, that kind of thing.
Hey, I know some people.

79
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,058
They're not exactly
"people," but for $50,

80
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,936
they'll break a few legs, and
you're not bothered anymore.

81
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,851
That's not what I need.
What, you need money?

82
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,267
I happen to know a stock, believe
it or not, which is low right now,

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,472
but it's going through the roof.
I need another name.

84
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,321
Yeah, I can see that.

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,574
Um... Rappaport.

86
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,247
Al... Alfred Rappa...
Arnold Rappaport.

87
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,917
Pseudonyms don't work. They know
we're all changing our names.

88
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,164
I need a real person, Howard.

89
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,338
Oh...

90
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,337
Of course.

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,879
Someone, uh, they can
believe and I can trust.

92
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,883
Naturally.

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,465
Now, listen... I wouldn't
ask you to do this...

94
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,596
Who would you ask?
I'd be insulted.

95
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,312
Well, nobody would know
about it, just you and me.

96
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,388
When do we start? Well,
just wait a minute.

97
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,767
You'd better find out
what you're getting into.

98
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,693
You want to put my name
on your scripts.

99
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,896
It's not that simple.
I write the scripts.

100
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,435
I send them in under your name.
They buy the scripts, right?

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,908
It's perfect.

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,576
Then they're going to want
to meet the writer.

103
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,043
So?

104
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,121
So you're going to have to go
in there, really be the writer.

105
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,793
So I'll be the writer. What's the big
deal? I can do it, and I want to do it.

106
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,833
I'm your friend. You're in trouble.
What's a friend for?

107
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,465
Well, these days, you can get
in trouble being friends.

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,042
Life is risk.

109
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,923
I'm going to pay you
for this, Howard.

110
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,055
What do you mean, "pay"? What
is that, a friend takes money?

111
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,599
10% from each script,
and no arguments.

112
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,141
You can use the money.
You're always in hock,

113
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,314
and I'd be paying that much
to an agent anyway.

114
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,142
Ten percent?
Off the top.

115
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,745
Well, how much
do you get for a script?

116
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,650
Um, $750, $1000.
It depends on the show.

117
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,324
Go home and write.
Your troubles are over.

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,403
What are you pulling here? Huh? You
owe me for three winners already.

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,994
What am I? Some kind of charity?
Don't get excited. Your money's coming.

120
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,747
You book bets, you lose,
you pay off.

121
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,079
What? You don't trust me?
You know...

122
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,334
Hey, don't get me mad
on you, you hear, Howard?

123
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,959
We've been doing business a long
time, so don't get me mad on you.

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>I don't understand you.</i>
What do you do with your salary?

125
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,435
Flush it down the toilet?
No, I had a tip on a stock.

126
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,685
It looked good, so I plunged.
To who do you come to stocks?

127
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,396
Why don't you ask me?
I'm familiar with the market.

128
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,024
Ask me before you flush your
salary down the toilet.

129
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,776
All right, next time, I'll ask you.

130
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,566
Howard, Howard... what's
it going to be with you?

131
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,447
Mama and Papa would turn
in their graves.

132
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,664
I haven't found myself yet, you know,
but it's all going to change, Myer.

133
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,875
You were always the smart one.
Did I get the lessons?

134
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,710
You could've gone to college.
Instead, you're a bum.

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,038
How much this time?

136
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,123
Uh... $600.

137
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,877
You said on the phone 400.
Yeah, I know.

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,222
Four gets me even, then I'm blank.
I'm keeping strict accounts.

139
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,676
You said four, you get four.
Enough is enough.

140
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,138
I'm at the end of my rope, Howard.
I got a business.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,808
You know what it costs now
to feed one lousy mink?

142
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,212
You know what a cutter gets today?

143
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,236
Yeah, thanks, thanks for...
If you were realizing your potential,

144
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,691
I'd say, "Fine, that's an investment."
I'm working on it, Myer.

145
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,740
At that cockamamie job you got? You call
that a job? With a head like yours?

146
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,370
I think you're going to be surprised.
I'm serious. The well is running dry.

147
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,622
Sink or swim.

148
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,169
<i>$500.</i>

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. This is... That's right.

161
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,328

162
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,830

163
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,880
Yeah, you liked it?

164
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,505
Sure. No, I can meet...
When... afternoons are fine.

165
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:30,305
You know, I use the evenings to
write because there's less noise.

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,759
Okay, great. Tuesday's perfect.

167
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,062
Right. Ciao.

168
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,483
<i>Yes, Old Gold,</i>

169
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,778
<i>the cigarette with
nearly 200 years</i>

170
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,979
<i>of tobacco know-how.</i>

171
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,154
Uh, Florence Barrett?

172
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,779
The one with the hair.

173
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,779
I won't tell him, Phil. You're the
producer. Do your own dirty work.

174
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,206
All Hecky has to do
is go talk to the man.

175
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,478
Why should he? Who is this creep anyway?
Just because he worked for the FBI?

176
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,412
Where does he come off
clearing anyone?

177
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,915
Where does anyone come off?
It's for Hecky's own good.

178
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,591
What's good about it?
I'm against the whole rotten...

179
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,589
I'm against it too.
Then do something.

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,628
I don't run the network.

181
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,342
Can I help you?

182
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,842
I'm Howard Prince.
Who?

183
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,470
You're Howard Prince? Hello.
I'm Florence Barrett.

184
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,897
I'm so glad you could come. Phil,
this is Howard Prince, the writer.

185
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,655
Phil Sussman, our producer.
How do you do?

186
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,277
Sorry, I didn't connect
the name. Howard Prince.

187
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,359
That's a hell of a script you wrote.
Where've you been hiding?

188
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,950
We looked you up: no credits, no nothing,
out of the blue, just like that.

189
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,245
Well, I just took up writing
a short while ago.

190
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,913
Well, that's one hell of a script.

191
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,158
You got more?
Are you kidding?

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,499
Howard Prince, I'd like you to meet Steve
Parks, who plays the lead in the show.

193
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,122
It's a marvelous script.
Thank you very much.

194
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,294
And Hecky Brown...
Who plays with himself.

195
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,635
who plays the narrator.
Howie! Howie Prince!

196
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,922
They let you out, finally.
Darling, darling...

197
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,845
Darling, I've waited for you.
I was faithful to you.

198
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,889
It's been so long.
You know each other?

199
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,188
Never saw this man
before in my life.

200
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,937
Seriously, Mr. Prince,
a first-class script.

201
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,734
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

202
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,777
We don't have too
much time, Mr. Prince.

203
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,730
That's why I asked you
to come right away.

204
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,798
We wanted to meet you...
Your script's a little long, Howard.

205
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,781
Four-and-a-half minutes.
I'd like to suggest

206
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,788
cutting the kitchen scene. I don't
know how you feel about that...

207
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,241
I think it's a mistake.
To me, the awkward scene

208
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,211
is the one in the police station.
Don't you think?

209
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,669
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.

210
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,547
You know, it depends
on your definition of awkward.

211
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,004
Well, the police station at
least has some violence.

212
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,882
I'm not saying eliminate it. I
just think it can be trimmed.

213
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,844
What do you think, Mr. Prince?

214
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,893
What?

215
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,895
Yeah.

216
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,601
"Yeah," what?

217
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,315
You know, I think that, um...
I think that what...

218
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,451
There's a lot of facets here, you know,
and it's... I don't want to just answer

219
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,278
right off the top of my head,
you know,

220
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,364
because I don't think that would be
fair to you or fair to the show.

221
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,914
Howard, I know it's not fun to cut your
script, but television is television.

222
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,588
You decide and you cut.
I'm not the kind of producer

223
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,378
who disembowels a writer's script.
I believe in the written word.

224
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,135
Absolutely.
I need it tomorrow morning.

225
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,463
But you be happy with it.

226
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,151
I really liked your script a lot.
Oh, yeah? Thank you very much.

227
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,070
Most of the stuff I read...

228
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,821
I mean, yours had substance.

229
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,651
It was about people.

230
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,076
Well, I feel if you're going
to write about human beings,

231
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:47,369
that, uh, you may as
well make them people.

232
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,500
Freedom Information Service.

233
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,128
Who's calling? One moment, please.

234
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,635
<i>Mr. Hampton from the network.</i>

235
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,091
Hennessy.

236
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,427
Yes, Tom.

237
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,012
Yes, of course.

238
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,065
Uh, first name: Howard.

239
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,440
<i>You got an address on him?</i>

240
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,863
<i>Social Security number?</i>

241
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,191
<i>I'll check him right out.</i>

242
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,869
No, it's no trouble at all, Tom.
That's what you're paying me for.

243
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,081
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he's right here right now.

244
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,659
I'm sure we'll work something out.

245
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,542
I'll get back to you as soon
as I know anything about Prince.

246
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,464
You too, Tom.

247
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,882
Carry on.

248
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,465
Sorry, Mr. Brown.

249
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,798
Hecky. Everybody calls me Hecky.

250
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,805
I'm a household name.

251
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,725
I can't guarantee you
anything, you understand,

252
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,104
but if you tell me the truth,
I might be able to help.

253
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,808
I'll tell you the truth.
I'll do anything.

254
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,941
The question is, Mr. Brown,
what have you done?

255
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,398
Nothing. I'm an actor.

256
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,324
Nothing?

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,701
Six years ago, I marched
in the May Day parade.

258
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,037
I bought a subscription
for the <i>Daily Worker,</i>

259
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,170
but I never read it, not one word. Right
from the mailbox to the garbage can.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,839
I was only trying to get laid. This girl,
this communist girl, she had a big ass...

261
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,253
I am not interested in
your sex life, Mr. Brown.

262
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,937
Hecky. I was just telling you
that girl was the reason.

263
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,518
Was she also the reason you signed
a petition for Loyalist Spain?

264
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,607
Did I do that?
And Russian war relief?

265
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:41,032
We were on the same side,
weren't we?

266
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,951
That girl with the big ass,
she was the reason. Honestly.

267
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,657
Would you say, then,
that you were duped?

268
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,869
Tell me what it means
and I'll say it.

269
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,875
You want it in writing?
Tell me what to write.

270
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,547
It has to come from you, Mr. Brown.

271
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,965
Hecky.

272
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,135
From your heart.
It has no value otherwise.

273
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,089
It'll come. Don't worry.

274
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,426
I'm an actor.
What do I know about politics?

275
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,431
My whole life has been acting.

276
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,479
People from all over the
country write me letters.

277
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,775
Write me a letter, Mr. Brown,
in your own words.

278
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,895
How you were duped, how
you feel about it now.

279
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,151
I'm against it 100%.

280
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,528
Whoever else you remember
was in that parade.

281
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,861
Who asked you to sign
those petitions.

282
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,914
It was such a long time ago.
Try to remember.

283
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,458
Sincerity is the key, Mr. Brown.

284
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,166
Anyone can make a mistake.
The man who repents sincerely...

285
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,168
I repent sincerely.

286
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,124
Write me the letter, Mr. Brown.

287
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,757
I'll see what I can do.

288
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,304
And I didn't even get laid.

289
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,027
<i>Now, stand by, everybody.
We have 30 seconds to air.</i>

290
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,610
Can I see opening shots, please?
Camera one.

291
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,945
Fine. Two's good.

292
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,865
Three, frame up, please.
Tilt up.

293
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,037
That's it. It looks good.
Watch your boom.

294
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,565
All right, stand by
to dim the lights...

295
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:24,252
And, uh, okay...
Dim them down.

296
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,380
Looks nice.
Ten...

297
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,179
nine... eight... seven...

298
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,724
six... five... four...

299
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,307
three... two... one.

300
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,233
And fade up on three.

301
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,652
This is my station, Grand Central,

302
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,401
where a million stories
start and finish.

303
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,108
And Hecky the Hackie
knows them all.

304
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,536
Tonight, have I got
a story for you.

305
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,658
<i>Remember last week you laughed a lot?
Well, tonight, you may cry a little.</i>

306
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,084
<i>See for yourself on Grand Central.</i>

307
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,880
<i>Me?
I'll go make up with my cab.</i>

308
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,207
<i>See you later.</i>

309
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,713
<i>♪ A-doo doo, dee dee dee... ♪</i>

310
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,342
<i>Joey.</i>

311
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,019
<i>Joey?</i>

312
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,017
<i>Pop...</i>

313
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>Pa, it's only $4000.</i>

314
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,651
<i>Why, it's almost nothing.</i>

315
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,276
<i>I can pay you back
in a couple of years.</i>

316
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,234
Looks nice.

317
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:34,665
And ready to go in.
Right in... Tight close-up.

318
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,117
Stand by to go to black.

319
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,373
30 seconds to credit.

320
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,999
Studio 12.

321
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,126
Yes.

322
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,959
Thank you. I thought so too.
It was terrific. Thank you.

323
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,260
Who was it?

324
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,259
Studio 12.

325
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,681
God.

326
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,392
Hello.
Well, thank you.

327
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,721
Yes, thank you very much.

328
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,602
Um, yes, I'll tell everybody.

329
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,729
Well, I think we got a winner.

330
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,856
Studio 12.

331
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,277
Hey, Howard Prince!

332
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,741
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!

333
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,973
I usually don't drink wine at lunch.
It makes me sleepy.

334
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,555
Yeah? So why don't you
just take a nap after?

335
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,855
I have to work.

336
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,771
Well, then, you know, I think...
I think we should go out

337
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,027
on a Sunday night.
I think it'd be better.

338
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,319
But you don't like Sunday,
so what about Saturday?

339
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,651
What about Friday? Regular night?

340
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,578
Howard, I really ought to
tell you. I'm involved.

341
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,248
I don't understand.
What is that, are you married?

342
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,456
No, but involved.
So what?

343
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,583
I mean, you telling me
that you're one of those

344
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,211
"one guy at a time" people?

345
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,666
Yeah? Okay.

346
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,594
Here's what I say to you...
we go out, don't bring him along.

347
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,092
Right?

348
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,933
Okay, so what does he do?
What, is he a writer?

349
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,141
What, a musician? What?
Stockbroker.

350
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,557
A stockbroker?
Well, that's interesting.

351
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,438
You know...
He's very nice.

352
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,151
Yeah, I was not knocking it, you know,
because you do what you can do.

353
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,076
You know, I... I got to ask you.
Did you see my new script?

354
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,495
Marvelous.

355
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,791
It's even better than the last one.
Well, you should see the next one.

356
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:46,876
It's very exciting for me to
watch a new talent emerging.

357
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,091
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure, feel free.

358
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,262
Why did you start writing so late?

359
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,718
Well... Because,
in order to write...

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,059
Excuse me. You got to get
experience, and you got to live,

361
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:09,110
and life is experience... So I had
to, you know, get that experience.

362
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,404
Well, here in the city?
You do come from here, don't you?

363
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,815
Yeah, I come from here, but
I bummed around a lot.

364
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,869
I was a boxer and a seaman, and all
that stuff you got to be to write.

365
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,451
What, you don't believe me?
Well, should I?

366
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,455
No, but I did bum around a lot.
What about you?

367
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,787
Not a lot.

368
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,749
No, I didn't mean it that way,
you know.

369
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,547
Where are you from?
Connecticut.

370
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,470
That's... That's very ritzy.

371
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,886
It's very proper, anyway...
I was very well-bred.

372
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,511
We're the kind of family where the
biggest sin was to raise your voice.

373
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:48,774
Oh, yeah? In my family, the
biggest sin was to buy retail.

374
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,480
Well, do you guys laugh a lot?
Who?

375
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,988
You know, you and the stockbroker.

376
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,319
Yes.

377
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,745
Thank you.

378
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,458
The character of the girl
in your script...

379
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,633
You write about women so well,
with such understanding.

380
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,594
Hey, uh...

381
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,676
This is all a la carte.

382
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,453
So, what about tomorrow night?

383
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,672
I'd have to tell him.

384
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,816
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

385
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,945
Come on. So you go out with me
once, and then you'll know better.

386
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:40,943
What? What are you laughing at?
You're so unexpected.

387
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,154
Well, I didn't expect you, either.

388
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,160
<i>You call yourself a writer?</i>

389
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,264
Modern American writing started
with Huckleberry Finn, dummy.

390
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,501
It did?

391
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,295
Hemingway said that.
How about Hemingway?

392
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,253
You're low on the moderns... Faulkner,
Sherwood Anderson, Fitzgerald.

393
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,298
All right, give me... give me
two Hemingways and a Faulkner.

394
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,381
Faulkner. Hemingway, Heming...
There we are.

395
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,641
The Russians...
<i>Brothers Karamazov</i>

396
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,186
No more Dostoyevsky?

397
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,854
What else you got?

398
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,647
<i>Diary of a Writer.</i>

399
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,725
Oh, yeah?
I can use that.

400
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,311
Remember, Howard, you
got to pay for these.

401
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,317
No credit.
Don't worry.

402
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,115
Listen, Danny,
I got hit very hard last week.

403
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,069
Long shots come in like relatives.

404
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,326
Well... Well, soon.

405
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,874
Soon is soon.
Tomorrow, the day after.

406
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,327
Wha... Danny,
what are you mad about?

407
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,334
It's a promise. Trust me.

408
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,255
Come on, Myer.
Jesus, I'm still an unknown.

409
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,677
What am I talking about? Five thousand,
probably. You're making as much as I am.

410
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,976
That's how much you know.
Where's taxes and agents?

411
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,892
I got to buy books and paper...
Money goes through you like Epsom salts.

412
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,973
You're a sick individual.

413
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,356
I'll pay you back.
I just sold another script.

414
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,937
Don't play me for a sucker, Howard.

415
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,818
<i>A man earns and he still borrows?</i>

416
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,776
<i>First you pay back what you owe.</i>

417
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,235
My dad's in the study.

418
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,704
You want a drink?
Me? No, thanks.

419
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,712
You look tired.
Yeah, this was a tough one.

420
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,510
Shit, they're all tough.

421
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,303
But it turned out good, I think.

422
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,390
Yeah? You really work hard, don't you?
It's a terrible thing, that blacklist.

423
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,057
You know, you having to work like this.
I always work like this.

424
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,353
To work.

425
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:37,188
I was thinking, there must be a lot
of writers who are blacklisted.

426
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,404
So how do they get along?
Why?

427
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,278
I don't know.
You know, it must be hard.

428
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,281
Yeah, it's hard.

429
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,160
You know, it's funny.
I got them so snowed.

430
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,367
I mean, two writers
wouldn't be any harder than one.

431
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,292
Oh, yeah? You think not?

432
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,372
What do you have to know?
It's a cinch.

433
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,206
Why not three?

434
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,291
Yeah, even three.

435
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,002
10% each.

436
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,217
Well, I don't know.
I could do three for 25%.

437
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,719
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel cheated.

438
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,517
All right, make it 10% each.

439
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,186
Oh. What's the matter?
You don't think that's fair?

440
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,017
Oh, no, I think it's a bargain.

441
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,069
Hey, I got the time.
You know writers who need help.

442
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,655
I'm willing to help.
Oh, cut the crap, Howard.

443
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,738
Why? I'm running around every
place. I got to take taxis.

444
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,337
You know, I got to
keep up appearances.

445
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,538
You want the money.
Come on, I'm offering a deal.

446
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,239
What, are you
some kind of romantic?

447
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,667
You know, that's the trouble with leftos.
You got a thing about money.

448
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,041
You want the deal?
I want it, but I know you.

449
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,710
You're going to take off and
fly right up your own ass.

450
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,712
I'm willing to help.
Take advantage.

451
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,045
All I can say, Howard, is thanks.
Yeah, it's no trouble.

452
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,381
I'm a Communist, Howard. I want you
to know that right off the bat.

453
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,467
The Committee asked me,
I took the Fifth.

454
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,552
It's none of their business,
but I'm telling you.

455
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,807
It's none of my business.

456
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,230
Well, I think you should know
who you're fronting for.

457
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,899
I don't have to know.

458
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,772
They're trying to sell
the Cold War, Howard.

459
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,563
They're using the blacklist
against anyone who won't buy.

460
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,823
Herb, he doesn't need a lecture.
I'll send you some pamphlets.

461
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,369
I'll break your arm. Leave him alone.
He knows who he's mixed up with.

462
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,037
Who's mixed up?

463
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,033
What Herb means is we're not blacklisted
because we're kind to dumb animals

464
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,037
or because somebody lied
about us or made a mistake.

465
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,126
I know, you're out of work.
That's all I have to know.

466
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,925
What about taxes? That's
going to be a problem.

467
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,095
You need a deductible?
Take my advice... natural gas.

468
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,760
Yeah? I heard cattle.
Cattle is also good.

469
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,474
Filet of sole. Vegetable cutlet.

470
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,521
Mushroom omelet.
Protose steak.

471
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,189
Eat in good health.

472
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:45,400
All right, the network pays him,
he pays us, less the 10%, right?

473
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,273
Then we just pay all
the taxes that we owe.

474
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,653
Nothing illegal. No tricks. Everybody
declares exactly what he earned.

475
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,197
What's he paying us for? He's
got to put something down.

476
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,123
We're his collaborators.

477
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,786
If anyone reads the returns,
connects him with us...

478
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,962
Can't we protect him better?

479
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,465
The IRS isn't going to care as
long as the right tax is paid.

480
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:09,128
The FBI will, and they've
been looking at tax returns.

481
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:13,098
Only in political cases.
He's not political.

482
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,220
You guys kill me.

483
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,891
They're beating your brains out,
and you're worried about taxes?

484
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,143
We're worried about you.

485
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,021
Don't worry about me, okay?

486
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,445
<i>Just write the script.
I'll take care of my end.</i>

487
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,107
Five pounds, sweetheart.
Have a nice day.

488
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,061
Cash?

489
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,112
Three hundred?

490
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,907
Howard, have an orange.

491
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,001
Thanks, Uncle Howard.
Thank you, Uncle Howard.

492
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,253
Thank you, Howard.

493
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,136
But I'm Harry Stone, the actor.

494
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,213
The other Harry Stone, the
director, he's the one you want.

495
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,265
I'm blacklisted because
they think I'm him.

496
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,558
I understand.
I never joined anything.

497
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,183
A terrible mistake has been made.
I sympathize.

498
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,814
Unfortunately, I can only help people
willing to make a clean breast

499
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,271
of what they've done.
But I haven't done anything.

500
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,102
That's why I can't help you.

501
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,158
<i>Mr. Hampton from the network.</i>

502
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,703
Thank you. Yes, Torn?

503
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,247
Yes, I've got a report
on Howard Prince.

504
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,542
No, no proof he's a
member of the Party.

505
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,961
Of course, no proof that he isn't.

506
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:28,166
I suggest I keep investigating.

507
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,841
Well, no, I don't have to.

508
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,215
I can send you a bill right
now and forget about it.

509
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,889
You're the one who has to
answer to the American people.

510
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,554
Exactly. That's all I'm saying.

511
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,389
You can't be too careful
these days.

512
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,976
No, I don't suppose anyone can
object if you keep using him.

513
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,527
Nothing to object to...

514
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,193
<i>So far.</i> Thank you.

515
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,908
You can use him.
Thank God.

516
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,204
He's the best writer I've got.
Hell, he's the only writer I've got.

517
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,907
I don't know how he does it.

518
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,585
What about Hecky Brown?
He wrote the letter.

519
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,206
It wasn't good enough.
It's not my decision, Phil.

520
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,209
They tell me, I tell you.
What do I tell Hecky?

521
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,260
You decided he's not
right for the part.

522
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,556
You've changed the character.

523
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,930
You've fired actors before.
Tell him what you told them.

524
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,788
He'll know it's not true.

525
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,894
Can he prove it?

526
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,445
I should get back to the office.
Well, why? What's the rush?

527
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,326
You're having a script conference.
That takes time.

528
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,033
Then we ought to talk
about the script.

529
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,373
Oh, later. Come on.

530
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,257
Hey, what's the matter?

531
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:57,053
You're the only writer I know who
never wants to talk about his work.

532
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,591
I'm superstitious.
No, you're not.

533
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,641
Yeah, I am.

534
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,728
The way I see it, you're
either a writer or a talker.

535
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:09,934
You're genuinely modest.
I admire that.

536
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,281
What... What...
Do you like sports?

537
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,992
I'm embarrassing you.
No. Do you... I'm serious.

538
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,489
What do you think of sports?

539
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,036
I like swimming.
No, swimming's not a sport.

540
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,334
Swimming's what you do
so you shouldn't drown,

541
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,083
you know, and sport is
what you play with a ball.

542
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:34,295
I used to play basketball, in school.
You played basketball?

543
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,342
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?

544
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,005
You'd be interested maybe in
playing one-on-one sometime?

545
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,055
Or, you know, if you ever
want to lay a bet, I'm...

546
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,432
Jesus, forget that.

547
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,986
Hey, you know, I'm...

548
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:58,323
You know, I'm...
I'm not just a writer.

549
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,574
I mean, I...
I want you to, uh...

550
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:06,372
I want you to know...
I know.

551
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,327
You know?

552
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,209
How I feel about you.

553
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,461
That's what you know?

554
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,794
I don't have to know anything more.

555
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,503
It's first-class.

556
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,052
You know, I've never seen
an account like yours.

557
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,604
Up and down, up and down.

558
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,727
One week a big deposit, the next week...
If you don't mind my asking,

559
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:17,853
what does a man like you do?
Uh, futures.

560
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,062
Oh.

561
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,882
Mr. Delaney?

562
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,808
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We'd like to talk to you.

563
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,185
I've got nothing to say to you.

564
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,107
We thought you might
be ready to cooperate.

565
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,902
Nobody has to know.

566
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,865
See you again, Mr. Delaney.

567
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,958
Keep walking.

568
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,168
You're here!

569
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,454
He's here!
We've been trying all over.

570
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,500
Thank God.

571
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,052
What's the matter?
I said I'd bring it to you today.

572
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,262
Forget that one.
What do you mean, forget it?

573
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,286
I said, forget it. You've
got to rewrite the old one.

574
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,767
What old one?

575
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,962
The one with the flashbacks
to the concentration camp.

576
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,638
You said that was great.
It's beautiful.

577
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,314
Well, Florence said she cried.

578
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,233
The scenes in the
gas chamber, I cried.

579
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,636
So then what, then?
The sponsor won't approve it.

580
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,529
You found him.
First, they said yes. Now they say no.

581
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,610
Right when we're in the middle
of dress rehearsal.

582
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,658
You want to know why?
They're a gas company.

583
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,338
They decided the show
makes gas look bad.

584
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,201
I think we'll make it a firing squad.
They killed Jews that way too.

585
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,541
Leave it to Howard. He's the writer.
What is the excitement?

586
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,660
They want changes, you know,
make it a firing squad.

587
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,337
You've got to write new scenes.
I'll go home and write them.

588
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,135
You don't have time.
I'll take a cab.

589
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,596
No, you don't realize. Time is
of the essence. Look at us.

590
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,425
We're stuck here! They're waiting
upstairs for the rewrite...

591
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,262
the network, the sponsor. They
don't approve, there is no show!

592
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,473
They can't wait till tonight?
They want it now.

593
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,024
I'm supposed to keep
you here till it's done.

594
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,110
No, I can't write except in my room.
We got a good office for you.

595
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,109
I guarantee you will not be disturbed.
No, no, no. I don't get inspired.

596
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,690
It doesn't have to be
inspired, only changed.

597
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,150
There really isn't
that much writing, Howard.

598
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,319
We have to be careful not
to lose the emotion.

599
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,905
Don't bother him with details.
He's got a lot of work to do.

600
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,865
Come on in.

601
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,541
Now, clear your mind and write.

602
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,543
Quiet, children. Quiet.

603
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:58,392
Boys and girls, we have a very special
visitor to our assembly today.

604
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,353
Not long ago, he sat
in the same seats

605
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:06,441
you're sitting in now. But
because he worked hard,

606
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,144
and studied hard,

607
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,824
he is now a famous
television writer.

608
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,755
Hecky, um...

609
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,050
I don't know how to say
this, but I'm worried.

610
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:36,054
I'm not the only one. Upstairs too.
Worried about what?

611
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,387
Here, Sussman, take a pickle.
No, no.

612
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,972
The show is a smash.
Yeah, well so far.

613
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,517
So far, so good.
I got to look ahead, Hecky.

614
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,733
Your quality, I don't know,
the character's not working.

615
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,186
I made up the character.
You loved it.

616
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,446
First impression was tremendous.
Don't get me wrong.

617
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,525
You think so too?
It's not her decision.

618
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,860
What decision?

619
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,404
I think you're wonderful,
Hecky, so does everyone else.

620
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,957
No one denies your talent.
It's...

621
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,286
Your personality is too dominant.

622
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,667
You belong out front,
like Berle, in one.

623
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,967
In a dramatic series, you're
throwing the whole show off balance.

624
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,178
Who says?
A talent like yours needs room.

625
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:22,016
You know what you need, Hecky? You need a
show of your own, where you can dominate.

626
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,014
As a matter of fact,
I got a few ideas.

627
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,231
We'll make some time, get
together, and kick them around.

628
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,775
Is it the letter?
Absolutely not.

629
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,491
I wrote what that snake
asked me to write!

630
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,148
Wouldn't I tell you?
The problem is artistic.

631
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:41,069
Female of the species.

632
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,541
<i>No, I think you have to
safely say that Grand Central</i>

633
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,045
<i>is one of the few television shows
where the writer is really the star.</i>

634
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,377
<i>Yeah, but there's, you know, there
is a lot of other people too.</i>

635
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,592
<i>You know, I mean wonderful people.
I certainly understand</i>

636
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,554
<i>the importance of actors and
then, of course, directors.</i>

637
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:03,008
<i>Did you write in high school?
Did I write in high school?</i>

638
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,434
<i>Yeah, you had to.</i>

639
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,480
<i>It was Brooklyn. Is that correct?
It was formerly Brooklyn.</i>

640
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,604
Oh, Hecky!

641
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,151
<i>You know, I went around and I...</i>

642
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,821
<i>But the television form
is so different.</i>

643
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,487
<i>Oh, you know it.
Yeah.</i>

644
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:24,412
<i>And you're so terrific at it.
Well, you know, I didn't say it.</i>

645
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,616
I wrote what you asked.
I was duped.

646
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,289
I didn't know what I was doing.
I'll never do it again.

647
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,711
What more can I say?
That's up to you.

648
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,707
I have to work. I can't
get work, Mr. Hennessy.

649
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,633
The doors are closed in my face.

650
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:42,631
My own agent, 30 years, he won't
even answer my telephone calls.

651
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,884
I appreciate your situation.
I do, Mr. Brown.

652
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,186
I've helped people
in your situation.

653
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:52,979
Then help me, please.
Tell me.

654
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,730
I'll turn myself inside out.

655
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,446
I'll do everything you tell me to do.
You make that difficult to believe.

656
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,657
What else can I do?
I'll do it, believe me.

657
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,656
You don't know
what I'm going through.

658
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,114
I'd like to believe you, but I have the
feeling you're not being entirely frank.

659
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,746
Give me a "for instance."
You'll see. I promise.

660
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:15,664
You marched in a May Day parade.
Only because of that girl with the big ass.

661
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,254
Whose name you say you can't remember.
Oh, what was her name?

662
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,345
Tessie? Bessie? I wasn't
interested in her name.

663
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,093
I was interested in her body.

664
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,808
Other people marched in that
parade, other actors, directors.

665
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,886
You don't remember their names
either?

666
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,019
I'm terrible with names.
They remember you.

667
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,022
I'm a well-known personality.

668
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,817
You talked with these people?
Some of them.

669
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,609
Some were kind enough to write letters.
Then you know who they are.

670
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,613
So it's not so important that I
remember. You know already.

671
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,037
Your sincerity is important,
your desire to cooperate fully.

672
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,414
I told you what I did!

673
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,923
I apologized!

674
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,509
I come to you on my hands
and knees, Mr. Hennessy.

675
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,301
Please. All I want to do is work.
That's all I care about.

676
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,467
I have a wife...
Two growing boys.

677
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,059
Children.
Look.

678
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,309
Here.

679
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,357
Here.

680
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,815
Plus a wife from before. If
the alimony doesn't come...

681
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:24,274
I sold my car last week for peanuts.
A brand-new model.

682
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:28,990
All the money I made, I ask
myself, where did it go so fast?

683
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,664
I can't pay the rent, Mr. Hennessy.

684
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,960
Nothing can go out
if it doesn't come in.

685
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,548
Do you know Howard Prince?
I was on the show.

686
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,500
A big talent.
Big.

687
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,633
Do you know him personally?
Only from the show.

688
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,216
Once in a while, a bite
to eat afterwards.

689
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,721
Do you think you could
get to know him better?

690
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,688
I'm not good at that sort of thing.
Honestly.

691
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:00,731
Actors, inside, you'd be
surprised, are very shy.

692
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,196
He knows you already.
You're very likable.

693
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,775
I'm sure he feels sympathy for you.

694
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,869
What could I find out?
Who his friends are.

695
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:14,662
What he does in his spare time. Where
he stands on the issues of the day.

696
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,711
Can't you ask him that yourself?

697
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,547
If he were a part of the Communist
conspiracy, could we believe what he said?

698
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,679
And if he isn't?

699
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:32,555
We'd like you to help us find out.

700
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,228
You want me to spy
on Howard Prince?

701
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,558
We are in a war, Mr. Brown,

702
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,768
against a ruthless and tricky enemy

703
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,566
who will stop at nothing to
destroy our way of life.

704
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:50,155
To be a spy on the side
of freedom is an honor.

705
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,239
And if I spy on Howard Prince,
I can work?

706
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:59,244
I don't do the hiring, Mr. Brown.
I only advise about Americanism.

707
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:04,253
But in my opinion, as the sign of a
true patriot, it would certainly help.

708
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,074
I quit.

709
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,999
Quit, quit, finished.
Resigned... Quit.

710
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,203
Let Sussman do his own dirty work.
I won't be part of it.

711
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:46,549
No more, not anymore. Finished watching
people destroyed, crucified like Hecky.

712
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,796
I'm going to fight it.

713
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,345
I don't understand. What
are you talking about?

714
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,640
Howard, this is beautiful.
You quit your job?

715
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,342
I feel so relieved.
You have no idea.

716
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,565
I've been such a hypocrite to take
their money and keep my mouth shut.

717
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,648
I still don't understand.
You quit your job?

718
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,353
They count on our silence, you know.
People keeping quiet, afraid to speak up.

719
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:10,110
Do you know what I'm going to do?
Publish a newspaper.

720
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,692
Well, anyway, a pamphlet...
<i>Facts About Blacklists.</i>

721
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,445
Do you like the title? I've
been on the phone all morning.

722
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,159
People are dying to talk, as
long as I don't use their names.

723
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,248
Oh, Howard, we'll shake them up. I'll do
the legwork and you'll do the writing.

724
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,255
Hey, not so fast. Jesus.

725
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,850
Florence,
you're making a big mistake.

726
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,669
I believe in personal responsibility,
Howard. If you believe, act.

727
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,927
Oh, but I don't under... You're
throwing away a whole career.

728
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,681
You... You... You could...
You're a terrific script editor.

729
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,022
You could be a producer. You'd be the
first woman producer of a dramatic series.

730
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,690
If I keep my mouth shut.

731
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,359
So? That's not such
a terrible idea sometimes.

732
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,271
But that's what they're counting on.
Florence, do me a favor.

733
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,402
Please, sit down. Sit down.
Relax, will you?

734
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,490
You're going off the deep end. Jesus,
let me give you some champagne.

735
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:00,201
I'm serious, Howard.
What do you mean you're serious?

736
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:04,043
You come bursting in here, you're
ready to start a revolution.

737
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,956
For God's sake, Florence,
what are you trying to do?

738
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,175
I want us to fight them,
not get bought off.

739
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,970
I'm not mad at anybody.
We live in the world, Howard.

740
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,175
No, you live in the
world, I live right here.

741
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,094
Hey, come on, what are
you trying to do to me?

742
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,314
You know how long it took me to get here?
I like it here. I like what I'm doing.

743
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,400
For the first time in my life,
I got everything that I want.

744
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,649
I'm not trying to take
it away from you.

745
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,901
No, but that's
what's going to happen.

746
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,196
Howard, I'm only talking
about a simple commitment.

747
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:40,534
I didn't ask you to marry me.
Oh, Jesus, you know,

748
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:45,076
we got such a terrific relationship
going. So why do you want to spoil it?

749
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,583
A relationship isn't only sex, you know.
There are more important aspects.

750
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,419
I know there are. Like what?

751
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,421
Human rights.
What about my rights? I'm human.

752
00:45:56,504 --> 00:46:01,551
What happened to my rights all of
a sudden? I live here, it's clean...

753
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,763
Come on, what are you
putting me on the spot for?

754
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,894
You really want success, don't you?

755
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,818
So, what should I want, a disease?

756
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,278
Yes, I want success.
What's wrong with that?

757
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,697
More than anything else?

758
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,947
Florence, you're looking to get
me killed here. I'm a writer.

759
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,821
I'm not looking for any kind of trouble.
I don't want to make waves.

760
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,623
A writer looks for trouble.
No. Wrong.

761
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,246
A lunatic looks for trouble.

762
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,461
Florence, you're crazy. You're behaving
crazy. You're out of your mind.

763
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:33,165
You've already said that. There's really
no need in your repeating yourself.

764
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,635
I want you to go in to Sussman tomorrow,
and tell him that you made a mistake.

765
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,134
I should tell him?

766
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,303
Exactly. You should go in and tell him
that you're sorry and you should...

767
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,635
But I'm not sorry.

768
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:47,684
Florence, I don't think you know
exactly what's good for you.

769
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,313
But I do know when
I've made a mistake,

770
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:56,985
and I made this kind of a mistake before,
confusing the artist with the man.

771
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,364
I just want you to know
I still admire the artist.

772
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:04,405
You're going?
Yes.

773
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,628
I have a this club date in the mountains.
I thought maybe you could drive me.

774
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,502
Sure, you couldn't have
called me at a better time.

775
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:17,047
You know, when you work as hard as I
do, you've got to make time to relax.

776
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,346
Otherwise it's all work
and no play.

777
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,349
I guess you have a lot of friends.
Me? The usual.

778
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,228
I like to pick up a phone,
get out, have a little fun,

779
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:30,223
but the important thing is that you've
got to get right back to basics.

780
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,229
What do you like to do
in your spare time?

781
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,353
The usual.
The usual?

782
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:40,862
I used to love the usual,
but my ship has sailed.

783
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,864
Watch your step around this place.

784
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,870
The broads up here, take a look
at them, and you say to yourself,

785
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,249
"Where's this been all my life?" They
come at you from all directions.

786
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:53,705
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Later on, you find out you're the fish.

787
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,333
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
Don't make any promises.

788
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,084
These broads come up
here with their lawyers.

789
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,050
Yeah? You play these places much?
Until I got in TV.

790
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,382
Do you know what I used
to get for one night?

791
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,433
What?
Three grand.

792
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:10,104
That should come in handy now.
Do you know what I'm getting tonight?

793
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,601
<i>What?</i>
500.

794
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,934
Five...
That doesn't seem fair.

795
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,065
And where is it written
it should be fair?

796
00:48:17,944 --> 00:48:21,758
Come on, Howie, you must have some
friends in the same position.

797
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,747
<i>Hecky!</i> It's a pleasure.

798
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,042
How long? A year? Two years?

799
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,495
It's a pleasure having you back.

800
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,089
Likewise. I'd like you to meet my friend,
Howard Prince, the great and famous writer.

801
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,584
Pleasure, Howard.
Any friend of Hecky's.

802
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,127
Come on, we'll go inside,
have a little drink.

803
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,671
I never drink before a show.
We'll have a little talk.

804
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,924
How's everything?

805
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,888
Oh, it's Hecky Brown!

806
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,615
Would you please park my
car for me? Thank you.

807
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,207
You staying long?
Just the weekend. You too?

808
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:23,010
What do you do?
I'm a... a writer.

809
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,759
A writer.

810
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,431
You'll have a drink, Howard?
Sure.

811
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,811
Here we go.

812
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:40,027
To a giant of the
entertainment world.

813
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,817
Business looks good, Sam.
Full up.

814
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,526
Loss leaders. We give discounts
so the rooms won't stay empty.

815
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,449
To tell you the truth, we're
not even holding our own.

816
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,327
The upkeep, which comes
to what I want to mention.

817
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,831
The $500. I already accepted, Sam.

818
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,588
I don't need your song and dance.
250.

819
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:05,048
You promised five.
I was hoping five.

820
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,342
I figured I'd steal a little from
the band, from the dance team,

821
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,509
make it up that way, but
you know the unions.

822
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:15,680
They could shut me down.
You knew this when you said five.

823
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,515
I was still hoping.

824
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,188
Last year I played this
joint for how much?

825
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:24,567
All right, today is not like last
year, but I'm still Hecky Brown.

826
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:30,160
Don't you forget that. You
can't get Hecky Brown for 250.

827
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,579
Maybe 300...

828
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,703
Out of my own pocket.

829
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,035
I piss on your 300!

830
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,711
Who else is offering that much?

831
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,882
Don't be foolish. Face facts.

832
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,051
There's a cloud over your head.

833
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,049
If it was up to me personally,
I'd pay you the moon,

834
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,425
but business is business. Now,
you drove all the way up here.

835
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:57,180
You want to go home empty?
Take the 250.

836
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:04,354
You said 300.
I'll see what I can do.

837
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,407
<i>♪ I need to be funny ♪</i>

838
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,735

<i>♪ Anything for a laugh ♪</i>

846
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:51,776
You were great.
You were really great.

847
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:24,917
Let's stop this pretense. Room 904.

848
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,147
Isn't he fantastic?

849
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,658
I could watch him every night.
He's so hilarious.

850
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:37,120
You a guest here?
Yeah.

851
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:44,849
What do you do?
I'm a dentist.

852
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,790
Professionally?

853
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,838
I'm Sandy.

854
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:58,346
Herman. Herman Miller.
You have your own practice?

855
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,588
Yes, I do, but I got to get another guy
in with me, because it's getting too big.

856
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,767
Are you, by any chance, attached?

857
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,398
Only to my work.

858
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,191
Hecky, Hecky, what can I say.
I'm a well-known gynecologist.

859
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,408
Words fail me. One of
the great performances.

860
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,403
You can tell your children,
your grandchildren,

861
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:22,203
you saw one of the all-time
greats without peer.

862
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,540
Beautiful.
250.

863
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,121
I did what I could.

864
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,875
But you said 300.
Maybe next month.

865
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,714
Out of your own pocket.
By popular demand.

866
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,717
What comes out of your pocket?
Tell me.

867
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,931
Hecky, will you stop?
Hecky, stop.

868
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,889
Tell me what's inside here.
Hecky, don't tickle me.

869
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,845
Hecky, will you stop being so...

870
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,018
Appreciation? Sympathy?
Hecky, Hecky...

871
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,563
What comes out of your pockets?

872
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,736
You know what comes out
of your pockets?

873
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,404
Blood! Blood comes
out of your pocket!

874
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,570
Get him out of here! Blood!

875
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,407
Get this crazy...
I want to kill you, you son of a...

876
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,575
I want to...
Get him out!

877
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,877
Get him out of here!
Out! Out!

878
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,122
Get him out! Get him out!
I want to...

879
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,419
I want to...
Get him out of here!

880
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,755
You fat pig.
You'll never work again!

881
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,259
I'm Hecky Brown!
I'm Hecky Brown!

882
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,386
You'll crawl in the gutter,
you red bastard!

883
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,935
You commie son of a bitch!

884
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,608
Come on.
Give me that.

885
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:33,319
Hey. Here's what I want you to do.

886
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,114
I want you to sleep
on the sofa tonight,

887
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,451
because you'll find it's
extremely comfortable.

888
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,861
It's brand-new.
You're going to like this.

889
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,330
See? Just stay here...

890
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,375
And, uh, open the window...

891
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,623
Let me make you some coffee, okay?

892
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,634
It's all Brownstein's fault.

893
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,804
I wouldn't be in this trouble
if it wasn't for Brownstein.

894
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,473
Yeah, who?
Brownstein.

895
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,519
Hershel Brownstein.
Who's Hershel Brownstein?

896
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:10,649
You can't make a deal with him.
That's the trouble.

897
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,567
He won't listen to reason.

898
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,323
Is that your real name?
Hershel Brownstein?

899
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:22,824
Brownstein!
Lay off, you hear me?

900
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,998
Lay off or I'll kill you!

901
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:31,662
Jesus, you know, people
change their names. It's no crime.

902
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,338
What do you know?

903
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,507
Who the hell are you?
A newcomer.

904
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,169
Why don't you sit down?
Why don't you shut up?

905
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,171
You think you're so special?
Talent is no protection.

906
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,342
You do as they say or else. I'm
going to make you some coffee.

907
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,472
This is a very nice
apartment. Very nice.

908
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,016
Thank you.
You have nice things.

909
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:53,351
Bookcases, hi-ﬁ...
And nice furniture.

910
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,026
You like this apartment, I bet.

911
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,821
You worked hard for it.
You deserve it.

912
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,365
You'd like to keep
this apartment, right?

913
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,901
You know what we should do?
We should call your wife,

914
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:06,075
because you should tell her, at
least, where you are tonight.

915
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,824
Where'd you go last week?
Nowhere.

916
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,160
Nowhere is somewhere.
From the heart, please.

917
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,711
No credit unless
it's from the heart.

918
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,913
Here and there, you know.
Like, around and about.

919
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,503
What do you want me to say?
Where'd you go last year?

920
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,794
Year before, who'd you see? Where did
you march? What did you sign?

921
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,879
Nothing.

922
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,215
That girl you go with,
on the show, what's her name?

923
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,390
Florence.

924
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,680
A troublemaker.
I heard her talking.

925
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,678
Subversive. She's a red.
No.

926
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,396
You like that girl?
Yes, I like her.

927
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,810
What's her name?
I told you.

928
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,604
Her full name.
Florence Barrett.

929
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,105
You know she's a red?

930
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,528
Stop it, Hecky.
I don't like this game.

931
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,413
Actually, I think you could say
that modern American fiction

932
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,616
began with Huckleberry Finn.

933
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,497
But what about Melville?

934
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,287
Especially today,
the sense of evil.

935
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,169
Oh, yeah. How could you
leave out Melville?

936
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,881
You must be so excited, the show
going from a half-hour to an hour.

937
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,839
I was expecting it.
With those ratings?

938
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,015
After all, they're
no fools up there.

939
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,513
Do you think you can get
the same quality in an hour?

940
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,890
Well, it is a problem,
no doubt about it.

941
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,348
It's like going from
a short story to a novel,

942
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,433
but one thing I've learned
in this business,

943
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,735
if you've got the talent,
you got the quality.

944
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,820
Ah.

945
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,111
Phil. Howard.

946
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,864
I want you to meet Hubert Jackson.

947
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,205
Jackson Supermarkets, you
know, out on the island.

948
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,039
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Thank you.

949
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,476
Hubert's a great fan of your show.

950
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,539
Never miss it.
Thanks again.

951
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,205
But he's a little concerned about some
of the actors that you've been using.

952
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,882
We go for the best, Mr. Jackson.

953
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,210
Well, in my opinion, some of them
are pretty pink, Mr. Sussman.

954
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,887
That's just the makeup.

955
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,553
I told Hubert that we are
as concerned as he is.

956
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,726
Not that they are,
of course. The actors.

957
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,104
We take every precaution.
The slightest hint.

958
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,062
I know my customers. If they
think a company is sponsoring reds,

959
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,564
they just don't buy their product.

960
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,442
How do they know?
I tell them.

961
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,239
Put a sign right up
over the product.

962
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:32,740
Yes, I thought you might send Hubert a
list of the actors you plan to use.

963
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,455
Let him look them over,
give you any ideas he has.

964
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,577
Absolutely.

965
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,414
You'll get full cooperation
from us, Hubert.

966
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:43,915
Nothing to worry about.
Thanks, boys.

967
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,759
How many stores that guy got?
Three, maybe four.

968
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,717
He's got three stores, he tells
a whole network who to hire?

969
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:54,220
Who wants trouble?

970
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,154
Nice to see you again, Mr. Prince.

971
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,287
Here's your check, Herb.
Thanks.

972
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,843
Here you go, Bill.
And yours didn't come yet, Allie.

973
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:22,619
What?

974
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,793
Because you were late with the script,
remember? You got to watch that.

975
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:29,296
Oh, by the way...
Here's your script back.

976
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:32,637
It needs a rewrite, I'm afraid.
What didn't Sussman like?

977
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,635
Well, I didn't show it to him.

978
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,808
What do you mean,
you didn't show it to him?

979
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,430
It wasn't ready.

980
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,809
Come on, Allie. You know. I can't
hand in anything, you know.

981
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,357
My name's going on that script.
I got a reputation.

982
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,649
Howard.

983
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,778
I'll try to write up to
your standards, Howard.

984
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,652
You know, it's possible
that maybe going to an hour

985
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,824
is a little too much
pressure for you guys,

986
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,986
because I've been noticing the stuff
lately, and it's thin, fellows.

987
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,532
You know what I mean? The key
word, I think, is "substance."

988
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:03,335
I've been reading what you...
the Eugene O'Neill plays,

989
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,792
and I would like, if possible,
something more along those lines.

990
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,258
But more laughs.
Exactly, you know, but gutsy.

991
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,174
Incidentally, I think... I think
I made a deal for a new series.

992
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,507
Well, we've got our hands
full here, Howard.

993
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:21,019
So you put on a couple more writers.
I mean, I need a pilot script.

994
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:25,352
How about Eugene O'Neill?
He's dead, Herb.

995
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,399
What's the subject?

996
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,694
It's a woman reporter, which,
I think, is a great idea.

997
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,488
You know, and I got the perfect
actress to play the part.

998
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:35,224
Her and a Howard Prince script.
We'll look around for somebody.

999
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,536
Right, but good, Bill, good,
because blacklisted is not enough.

1000
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:42,874
Scrambled eggs, loose.
White fish.

1001
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:46,774
Let's see... Eggplant steak.

1002
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,955
Eat in good health.

1003
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,379
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill him.

1004
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,710
You little rat.

1005
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,339
Hey, hey, Al, take it easy, please.

1006
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:25,871
Look, this is ridiculous, because I've
been calling you now for three weeks,

1007
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,545
and you don't answer me. Nothing, you
know, and I mean, what's the big deal?

1008
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,958
We had a little argument.
We don't think alike, Howard.

1009
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,009
We don't believe in
the same things.

1010
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,971
Jesus. What, do you think I like
the blacklist? I hate the blacklist.

1011
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:42,767
But you... Did I send
money for your pamphlet?

1012
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,094
Giving money is easy.

1013
01:02:45,177 --> 01:02:49,312
Oh, yeah, what's easy for you is not
always easy for everybody else.

1014
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:53,153
You know, you see trouble, and
right away you run to get a gun.

1015
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,982
Or a pamphlet, you know...
I'm just looking all the time

1016
01:02:57,065 --> 01:03:00,448
not to get killed, that's all.
So is that such a big difference?

1017
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,949
We have to break up over that?

1018
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,453
Yeah, maybe we do.

1019
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,917
So, what do you say?
You want to stay broken up?

1020
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:12,489
Howard...

1021
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:16,672
You think I want to make
you lose everything.

1022
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:21,920
You think I'm intolerant and demanding,
and maybe I am, but that's me.

1023
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,723
Well, then...
Then I need more time,

1024
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,398
because I've never met
anybody like you, you know?

1025
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,356
Hey, I tried to get us tickets to
the Paul Robeson concert, you know,

1026
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:39,642
but it happened to come on the same
night as the basketball game, so...

1027
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:46,349
We'll go to a basketball game, right?
I have tickets for the concert.

1028
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,494
All right, so here's what...

1029
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,667
I'll give up the tickets
to the basketball game,

1030
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,587
and you give up the tickets to the
concert, and we'll go to dinner.

1031
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,089
Right?

1032
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,851
Florence, I miss you.
I miss you too.

1033
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,647
So we'll have a date.

1034
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,687
<i>A subpoena?</i>

1035
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,364
For me?

1036
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,692
To appear before the House
Un-American Committee.

1037
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,200
Well, what do you mean? When?
How do you know?

1038
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,707
They found out upstairs. It hasn't
been issued yet, but any minute now.

1039
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,036
But I'm not a communist.

1040
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:36,915
So you go and tell them that.
I tell you. Isn't that enough?

1041
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,375
Howard, you've got to go.

1042
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:42,921
I don't like it any more than you do,
but if you don't do it, you don't work.

1043
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:48,056
Why don't they all just go away
and let us do the show?

1044
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,057
Who needs this?

1045
01:04:51,536 --> 01:04:53,034
You know, Phil...

1046
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,561
I didn't believe Florence
when she told me that about you.

1047
01:04:59,244 --> 01:05:00,614
That crazy broad.

1048
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,866
You know, because I know it was
very tough for you to fire Hecky...

1049
01:05:07,685 --> 01:05:09,114
I had a migraine for a week.

1050
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:13,084
Phil, it just takes one guy
to say no to them. Just one.

1051
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,750
What can I do, Howie?
You can be that guy.

1052
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:21,584
No, I'm serious. If just
one person says no...

1053
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,259
You know, especially a guy like you.
You're respected, you got a big name...

1054
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,598
Tell them no.
Who the hell are they?

1055
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,052
Come on, Phil, take a stand.

1056
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,684
The real you.

1057
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,862
Get me Hampton.

1058
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,615
Hello, Tom? Phil.

1059
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,786
There is no reason Howard Prince
has to go to that committee.

1060
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,283
That's right. It's our network.

1061
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,456
Who the hell are they, telling
us what to do, giving us orders?

1062
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:55,664
No, no, no. You listen to me.
He doesn't have to go.

1063
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,505
What are we, sheep? We make a stand, Tom.
We tell them to lay off his back.

1064
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,796
We tell them to stop threatening.
Piss off, or they're in trouble.

1065
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:06,463
We fight, Torn. We show them there
are some people they can't scare.

1066
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,466
We tell them flat out,
"Howard Prince doesn't go."

1067
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,805
Right.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1068
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,102
<i>Right.</i>

1069
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,939
Okay.

1070
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,816
You got to go.

1071
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,489
<i>Howard, you've got nothing to worry
about.</i> Nothing to worry about at all.

1072
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,364
You see, we've dealt
with the committee before,

1073
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,992
and they're, well, they're
really very understanding.

1074
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,870
They understand our problems
and we understand theirs.

1075
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,668
Yeah? And what about my problems?

1076
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,164
You're cooperating.
That's all they care about.

1077
01:06:41,246 --> 01:06:44,584
Now, this friend of
yours, Alfred Miller?

1078
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,715
We went to school together.

1079
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:49,843
And you had no idea
that he was a communist?

1080
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,554
He was only 12.
You have no idea now?

1081
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,349
We never talk about politics.
Good.

1082
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,557
Let's see, now. The two men,
Delaney and Phelps?

1083
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,893
They're friends of Allie's.
All right.

1084
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,067
And the girl, Florence Barrett?
That's just sex.

1085
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:08,567
Is that why you gave money to
her pro-communist publication?

1086
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,745
You know, we were going out, and
she wanted to start a magazine,

1087
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,830
so how was I supposed to know what kind?
That's hardly credible, Mr. Prince.

1088
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:21,371
Uh, Mr. Hennessy... You and your
staff have done a splendid job.

1089
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:26,881
The network appreciates your efforts, but
Mr. Prince is being entirely cooperative.

1090
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,472
I think that I can handle the legal end.
Thank you very much for coming.

1091
01:07:39,613 --> 01:07:41,457
Good luck, Mr. Prince.

1092
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,068
Howard, don't mind him.

1093
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,985
He's only doing his job.
I still don't see why we can't fix it.

1094
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,572
You know, I mean, like pay somebody off,
because how much... how much could it cost?

1095
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:58,791
Because they're just congressman.
It won't be necessary.

1096
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:03,459
You see, they've agreed to an executive
session. No reporters, no publicity.

1097
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:07,754
As a matter of fact, you won't
even have to go to Washington.

1098
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,155
They'll send a subcommittee here.

1099
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:13,257
<i>Now, what we'll do is write you a
strong anti-communist statement</i>

1100
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:17,094
<i>to go along with your testimony. You
will be out of there in no time at all.</i>

1101
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,812
<i>Take my word for it.
Howard...</i>

1102
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:24,609
<i>Howard, all they want
is a friendly witness.</i>

1103
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:28,814
<i>Okay.
So I'll be a friendly witness.</i>

1104
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:32,617
Hi, Howard.
Is he here?

1105
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,496
Hey, very nice.
You got to lay off health foods.

1106
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,950
Jesus, when are they going to operate,
get rid of that ulcer already?

1107
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,286
Then how am I going
to know when I'm mad?

1108
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,121
Nobody knows how
to relax anymore, right?

1109
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,798
You got to kind of roll
with the punches.

1110
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,385
What about the subpoena?
Nothing.

1111
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,921
Don't worry about a thing.
Did they write a statement for you?

1112
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:56,633
Yeah. I'd let you read it, only
you'd start bleeding again.

1113
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,469
Don't worry about it, really. You just...
You know, take care of yourself.

1114
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,354
Worry about who's going to write
the scripts while you're in here.

1115
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,149
We've got a very good writer.
You won't be ashamed.

1116
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,818
Blacklisted? Impeccably.

1117
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,405
Named by his own brother-in-law.
Visiting hours are over.

1118
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,946
Nurse, I'm Dr. Prince.

1119
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:17,158
This is a consultation, you know.
These are my associates.

1120
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,783
Uh-huh.

1121
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,202
Howard, why do you think
they want you to testify?

1122
01:09:26,444 --> 01:09:30,337
I'm a feather in their cap.
I'm a big writer. Howard Prince.

1123
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,416
Why do you think they want you to name
names? They've already got our names.

1124
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:37,007
Why do they need you to tell them again?
So it makes them look good. So what?

1125
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:41,519
Howard, they don't care about names. They
care about getting people to give names.

1126
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,852
They want to show there's nothing
they can't get people to do.

1127
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:48,356
Fellows, if I don't cooperate,
you don't work. Nobody works.

1128
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,191
Is that what you want?
Maybe we're laying too much on him.

1129
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,692
Why should he take the rap?

1130
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,524
Because I want him to
know what he's doing.

1131
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,030
I'm helping.
You're helping them.

1132
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:01,372
No, I'm using them.
I'm... I'm smarter than they are.

1133
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,576
Howard, the time
for this bullshit is over.

1134
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,099
Who does it hurt if I'm friendly?
Where is the personal crime?

1135
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:10,207
I tell them that you're my
friend from public school.

1136
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,716
They... They already got your name.
You said that yourself.

1137
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:16,383
He's right. They can't
do anything more to us.

1138
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:20,011
Why can't he just cooperate?
Tell them the truth?

1139
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,388
He won't have to.
The network's made a deal.

1140
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,266
He says the committee's
great, they leave him alone.

1141
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,018
Yes, and everybody
gets what he wants.

1142
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:30,902
That's what this is about, right? Stop
worrying. You know, they want publicity.

1143
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,780
They want Howard Prince as an example
to scare people. To shut them up.

1144
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,859
I think he should take the Fifth.
They'll blacklist him, he takes the Fifth.

1145
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,464
What's the Fifth?
The Fifth Amendment.

1146
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:43,077
Your right not to incriminate yourself.
Why do I have to take anything?

1147
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,123
It's all fixed.

1148
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,450
They might ask you questions
you don't want to answer.

1149
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,832
But if you already answered
one, like did you know Alfred,

1150
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,588
you don't have that right anymore.
Then, if you don't answer,

1151
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,252
they can cite you for contempt.
Yeah, but I'm going to answer.

1152
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,387
Schmuck.
Maybe he should.

1153
01:10:58,463 --> 01:10:59,589
What can he tell them?

1154
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,262
I don't trust the committee or
the network. Take the Fifth.

1155
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,102
I don't want to take the Fifth.
You can't cooperate!

1156
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:08,431
Don't be a loser all your life.
You quit looking for an out!

1157
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:14,236
Look, do not aggravate yourself.
You want that milk now?

1158
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,112
Oh... Howard.

1159
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,578
You did a big favor for all of us.
I don't have to tell you that.

1160
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,447
Who's asking?
You saved our ass.

1161
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,991
Don't you think I know that?
You did what a friend does.

1162
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,961
Exactly. If I cooperate,
your ass is saved again.

1163
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,963
You can't be on their side.
So, all right, fine. What do I do?

1164
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,979
I tell the committee to shove it? So
then, you don't work, nobody works.

1165
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,510
You let me worry about that.

1166
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,964
Yeah, and what about me? What... What
do I do? Go back to the cash register?

1167
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,845
I can't believe this guy.
You're laying here,

1168
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,807
you can't use your name, you're bleeding,
and you're telling me what to do?

1169
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:51,186
Al, can we ask him to do
what he doesn't believe in?

1170
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,359
Protect yourself. Take the Fifth.

1171
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,482
You know, you're always
looking for a middle

1172
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,982
you can dance around in. Well, I'm telling
you, this time there isn't any middle,

1173
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:02,569
and you can't lay any of it off on us.
Whatever you do, you're doing for yourself.

1174
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,327
Open up in the name of the law!

1175
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,828
Get out your guns, men.

1176
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:12,912
Nobody move. This is a raid.
Everybody, everybody out.

1177
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,041
We understand you have a girl
in your room. If not, why not?

1178
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:19,002
Do you have a little tootsie for me?
Have we met before?

1179
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,507
You know you scared me?

1180
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,344
I was in the neighborhood and
suddenly everything went black.

1181
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,851
Am I disturbing you?
Are you kidding?

1182
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:32,728
If you really want to know, I came to
apologize for that terrible night.

1183
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,685
I wasn't myself.
You had every right.

1184
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,691
Two rights don't make a wrong.

1185
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:42,229
I gave you a hard time and I'm sorry.
Silly. Have a drink.

1186
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,862
Before the sun is over
the yardarm? Never.

1187
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,788
A wee touch of scotch.

1188
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:53,703
How's it going?
Not bad. Club dates.

1189
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:59,046
Out of town, but not bad.
Scranton, Allentown, Altoona.

1190
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,048
You didn't know I was a
big hit in Pennsylvania,

1191
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:06,458
but my wife found a job, the kids
eat, we all have our health.

1192
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,635
To a prince of a Prince.

1193
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,310
You know, I never learned
how to sip a drink.

1194
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:21,773
When I was very little,
every evening before supper,

1195
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,410
my father would pour a shot glass
full of whiskey, mumble a prayer...

1196
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,037
And down it went. I thought
that was the way you drank.

1197
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:38,752
How are things going with you?
Fine.

1198
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,549
I hear terrific.

1199
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,964
It's nice when nice happens
to somebody nice.

1200
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,470
It doesn't happen too often.

1201
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:52,098
Are you sure I'm not being a nuisance?
Of course not.

1202
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,432
Did you know Johnny Parker,
the actor?

1203
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,767
Mm-mm.
No.

1204
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:03,322
Blacklisted.
He couldn't get arrested.

1205
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,276
Wife, three kids, you can imagine.

1206
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,783
He drove a cab for a while.
Finally gave that up.

1207
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,995
He came from someplace out west.
Oklahoma, Texas, some place like that.

1208
01:14:14,675 --> 01:14:19,793
He owned a little farm that his father left
him. Miserable. He showed me the pictures.

1209
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,795
You'd go crazy in a
place like that.

1210
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,802
But he could grow his own
food, so he went back.

1211
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:28,302
We had a party for him.
Everybody cried.

1212
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:32,685
Six months later, right in the
middle of that miserable property,

1213
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,184
they struck oil!
You're kidding.

1214
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:38,482
Honest to God. Oil!

1215
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:42,319
He's a millionaire.
So you see...

1216
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:45,490
<i>♪ Every little cloud
has got a silver lining ♪</i>

1217
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,157
Come on, let me
make you another drink.

1218
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:52,355
No, no, no, not really. I came,
I apologized. It's time to go.

1219
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,728
Well, you know, what we should do
is we should have dinner sometime.

1220
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,998
I'd like that very much.
Yeah?

1221
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,838
Well, what about tonight?
Tonight? No, no, I'm busy.

1222
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,166
So, all right, so what I should...
I'll call you.

1223
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,378
Don't call us, we'll call you.

1224
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,681
If I had a buck for every
time they said that to me

1225
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,560
when I first started... Of
course, I don't have to tell you

1226
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,729
later on, the shoe was
on the other foot.

1227
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:21,021
Well, I really will call.
I know you will. I was making a joke.

1228
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,987
You don't mind I came without phoning?
Come on, are you kidding?

1229
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:29,192
Well, some people mind.
You're a good man.

1230
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,324
You know what I think I'll do?
I'll call you tomorrow.

1231
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,121
Take care of yourself.

1232
01:15:35,196 --> 01:15:37,996
The water is full of sharks.

1233
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,859
Thank you, sir.

1234
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:33,269
Where have you been? I was
so worried about you.

1235
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:37,107
I called and there was no answer.
You know, I was just walking around.

1236
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,066
Are you all right?

1237
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,455
You know, I've been thinking
about a lot of stuff.

1238
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,953
Well, I saved you your dinner.

1239
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,288
I kept it warm for you.

1240
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,624
Do you want a drink?

1241
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,755
Yeah, but just a drink.

1242
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,811
I saw you at the funeral today.
You did?

1243
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,692
I didn't see you.

1244
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,112
Well, I couldn't handle it.

1245
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:25,780
I couldn't handle it either.

1246
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:36,336
You're lucky you're a writer...

1247
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,338
and not an actor.

1248
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:42,964
At least with a writer, if he gets
blacklisted, he can always still write.

1249
01:20:43,847 --> 01:20:48,230
An actor, what's he going to
do if he can't show his face?

1250
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,514
Florence...

1251
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:58,024
How would you feel if I was...
if I was not a writer?

1252
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,865
Howard, I know you. Whatever
else you might have to do

1253
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,865
to survive,
you'll find time to write.

1254
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:09,323
Well, but suppose
I said that, uh...

1255
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:13,202
that I was not a writer.
I know you as a writer.

1256
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,543
I love you.
Well...

1257
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:20,422
I'm not a writer.
Don't be a defeatist.

1258
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:25,051
Other guys wrote those scripts, not me.
I put my name on them.

1259
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:31,266
They were blacklisted. I was helping
them out. It's my name and their scripts.

1260
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:34,224
That's a very bizarre statement.

1261
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,901
I'm not a writer, Florence.
I'm a front.

1262
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,445
I front for blacklisted writers.

1263
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:43,050
You're not a writer?

1264
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:47,244
No. I... I... I couldn't
write a grocery list.

1265
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,913
You never wrote
any of those scripts?

1266
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:54,994
Nothing. Not one. I'm... I...
I'm practically illiterate.

1267
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,497
You never wrote anything?
Hey... Jesus.

1268
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,459
Don't get shell-shocked.
I'm not confessing to a murder.

1269
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:05,300
Look at you.
Look, you're all white.

1270
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,930
Let me get you a drink.
I don't want a drink.

1271
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,513
You know, you should put your
head between your legs, I think.

1272
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,512
You let me think that you were...
Well, why not?

1273
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,606
What did you want me to do?
For God's sake, I was like a spy.

1274
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,275
Did you want to?

1275
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,108
Did I want to? Of course I wanted to.
You think I liked lying to you?

1276
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:26,075
Come on, Florence, you know
that lying is not in my nature.

1277
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,777
I don't believe this is happening.

1278
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,662
I have to testify. Try and
keep your mind on that.

1279
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:34,955
But it's like you're a complete stranger.
So we got off on the wrong foot.

1280
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,544
The wrong foot?
I was sworn to secrecy.

1281
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,417
For God's sake,
we're on the same side.

1282
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,211
Didn't you trust me?
I wasn't allowed.

1283
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,541
Well, did you think I'd
lose interest in you?

1284
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,965
You were never interested in me.
You were in love with a writer.

1285
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,671
Interested in you?
I don't even know you.

1286
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:51,224
You know, I shouldn't have said anything
because now you're totally hysterical.

1287
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,970
Nobody is hysterical. When
were you going to mention it?

1288
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,187
When we were 90?
I mentioned it tonight.

1289
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:57,856
Because you're in trouble.

1290
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,851
Yes, I'm in trouble, for a very good
reason. Who was I spying for, Hitler?

1291
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,511
I was helping blacklisted writers.
Think about that for a minute.

1292
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,984
You lied to me.

1293
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:09,117
What are you really, a druggist?
You want to know what I was?

1294
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:13,156
I ran a cash register.
You were a cashier?

1295
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,117
That's exactly what I mean.
See?

1296
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,495
Unless it's a writer or an artist, you
know, catch you in bed with a cashier...

1297
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:20,921
That's not fair.

1298
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,464
You wouldn't have
looked twice at me.

1299
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,339
It is not what someone does,
it is who he is.

1300
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:30,514
And you don't even know who I am.
Did you ever give me the chance?

1301
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,341
I'm giving you right now.

1302
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:34,969
All right.

1303
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,475
Who are you?

1304
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,568
What?

1305
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:47,690
I still don't know who you are.
I only know who you're not.

1306
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,859
Who is Howard Prince?
Hey, Florence, I got to tell you,

1307
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,362
you know, it's not easy
being in love with you.

1308
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,373
You know why? Because what
you're looking for all the time

1309
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,960
is, like, a knight on a horse or
something, which is not Howard Prince.

1310
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,212
You know who Howard Prince is?
I'll tell you.

1311
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,877
Howard Prince is his own man.
What does that mean?

1312
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:07,547
Well, I think you're going
to find out when I come back

1313
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,216
from the committee tomorrow.
What am I going to find?

1314
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,052
You said it was all fixed.
Well, I've been thinking about it.

1315
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,724
You know, everybody's
telling me what to do.

1316
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,723
But, you know,
I don't see why I have to.

1317
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,630
What are you going to do?
Well, I'll work something out.

1318
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,931
Are you going to tell them
that you're not a writer?

1319
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,463
I'm going to tell them exactly
what I want to tell them.

1320
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,191
Howard, that committee
is dangerous.

1321
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,396
They're out for blood.
You can't fool around.

1322
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,981
Take my word for it. All those people,
Allie and Sussman and everything,

1323
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:33,660
they're wrong, because I
can beat that committee,

1324
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,409
and I can beat them my own way.
How?

1325
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:39,203
Hey, what's the difference?
I'm telling you,

1326
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,001
I'm not going to wind up
back at that cash register.

1327
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,418
Take my word for it. And I'm not going to
do anything that makes you ashamed of me.

1328
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,592
Trust me. Can you trust me?

1329
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,921
<i>And we would like
to thank this committee</i>

1330
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:56,596
for allowing Mr. Prince to
appear and voice his approval

1331
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:59,936
of the great work that you're
doing for our country.

1332
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:04,643
Communist subversion
is a real and present danger,

1333
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,777
and you can rest assured that
it will never be tolerated

1334
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:13,609
on the network that both Mr. Prince
and I have the honor to represent.

1335
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,444
Thank you.

1336
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,617
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.

1337
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,619
This committee is here to help keep America
just as pure as we possibly can make it.

1338
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,625
Well, I can't think
of anything more important.

1339
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:29,295
Well, I would like to commend this
committee on the job that they're doing.

1340
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,794
Thank you.
Thank you.

1341
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,129
Counsel...

1342
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,134
Just a few questions, Mr. Prince.

1343
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,465
We know you're a busy man.

1344
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,927
Mr. Prince, do you happen
to know an Alfred Miller?

1345
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,971
Who?

1346
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,308
Alfred Miller.

1347
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:46,992
Why?

1348
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,281
If you'd just tell the committee...

1349
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:57,156
So I can't know why?

1350
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:00,159
Mr. Prince,
you don't have to worry.

1351
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,284
Anyone that comes here and tells the
truth has got nothing to worry about.

1352
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,174
Which Alfred Miller?

1353
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:11,966
Do you know Alfred Miller,
the writer?

1354
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:18,845
Uh, when you say "know," uh... you know,
can you ever really know a person?

1355
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:22,519
I think, you know... I grew up with
an Alfred Miller, but do I know him?

1356
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:26,857
Would you say, do I know him? Can you
know... In a biblical sense, know him?

1357
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,184
Am I right?

1358
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,859
Would that be the same
Alfred Miller

1359
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,690
you met with several times
in Hammer's Dairy Restaurant?

1360
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:37,075
Who says I did?
Is it or is it not true?

1361
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,570
No, I asked you first.
Is it true?

1362
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,530
I don't understand. Is anybody
accusing me of anything?

1363
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,407
If you would answer the question...
Which question?

1364
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,910
You asked one question. I answered
that question, and then...

1365
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:50,714
Do you know Alfred Miller?
You already asked that question.

1366
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,542
Howard, what are you doing?
What do you mean?

1367
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,593
I'm handling it. Don't worry.
You're under oath.

1368
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,887
If you don't answer, they
can hold you for contempt.

1369
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,595
Well, I am answering. I'm just
not replying, that's all.

1370
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,096
Oh, don't split hairs.

1371
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,018
But they can only get me
if I don't answer.

1372
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,350
If I answer without
replying, I got them.

1373
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,727
But you're getting them mad.

1374
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,558
So what? What can
they do, throw me out?

1375
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,234
Do you know Alfred Miller?

1376
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:15,572
Hey, are you guys aware of
the fact that every week,

1377
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,070
busloads of communists are
coming in over the border?

1378
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,573
I mean, is anybody doing
anything about that?

1379
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,038
We are not concerned at this
time with anything other

1380
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:26,412
than the communist conspiracy
in the entertainment world.

1381
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:29,377
But how come? Why aren't we
doing something about it?

1382
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,654
I mean, why isn't everybody armed? You
know, everybody should learn to use a gun.

1383
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,588
I think it's a big mistake that
anyone who goes to military school...

1384
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,260
You send them there
when they're bad.

1385
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:40,430
Mr. Prince, this committee
is just as concerned

1386
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,803
about the threat of
communism as you are.

1387
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:47,059
Since your memory is unclear
about Alfred Miller,

1388
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,265
do you know any of
these other people?

1389
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,099
William Phelps...

1390
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,810
Herbert Delaney...

1391
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,359
Florence Barrett...

1392
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,612
Hershel Brownstein,

1393
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,240
also known as Hecky Brown?

1394
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,953
He's dead.

1395
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,252
Did you know him?

1396
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,800
Mr. Prince...

1397
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:20,306
Now, you came here to
cooperate today, did you not?

1398
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,304
Will you excuse us a moment,
Mr. Prince?

1399
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,727
John.

1400
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,147
I thought we had an arrangement.

1401
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:37,149
With the network. I think
he's doing this by himself.

1402
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,780
Why don't we hit him with contempt?
He's not giving us grounds.

1403
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,701
We can't let him get away with this.
He hasn't even taken an amendment.

1404
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:45,370
There's got to be something
you can nail him on.

1405
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:47,322
Okay.

1406
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:55,379
Mr. Prince, let me ask
you another question.

1407
01:28:55,655 --> 01:28:59,477
Do you know a Patrick Callahan?

1408
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,379
Who?

1409
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:05,841
Bartender at the Friendly Tavern,

1410
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:08,602
where, I believe, you once
worked as a night cashier.

1411
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,520
I did?

1412
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,690
Do you know Daniel LaGattuta?

1413
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,021
Doesn't he sell fruit?

1414
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:23,450
You placed bets for Mr. Callahan
and Mr. LaGattuta, did you not?

1415
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,536
In... In a... In a
strictly friendly way.

1416
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:37,373
I remind you that placing
bets is a crime.

1417
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:41,380
Howard, is this true?
You were a bookmaker?

1418
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:45,722
Not professionally.
Oh, my God.

1419
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:50,011
Uh, Mr. Chairman, may I have
a word with you, please?

1420
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:06,401
They're willing to make a deal.
Give them names, right?

1421
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:10,660
They're being very reasonable. You
don't have to give them more than one.

1422
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,416
Yeah, which one?
Well, it's up to you.

1423
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,417
Look, they've got you over a barrel.
You can go to jail. What's one name?

1424
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,876
If it bothers you,
give them Hecky Brown.

1425
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,924
Hecky?

1426
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:29,049
He's dead anyway.
What difference does it make?

1427
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,305
A token is all they want. Something
to show your cooperation, that's all.

1428
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:38,934
Is the witness ready to proceed?
Yes, ready, Mr. Chairman.

1429
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:43,864
Mr. Prince, I ask you,
for the record,

1430
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,909
<i>did you know Hershel Brownstein?</i>

1431
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:54,283
<i>Howard, you'll go to jail.</i>
Also known as Hecky Brown?

1432
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:55,333
<i>Be practical.</i>

1433
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,960
<i>Did you know this man as
either Brown or Brownstein?</i>

1434
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,460
Either name will do, Mr. Prince.
Tell them.

1435
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,792
Brown or Brownstein?
Just the name.

1436
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:08,380
Are you refusing to answer?
Will you talk?

1437
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,393
Fellows...

1438
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:19,642
I don't recognize the
right of this committee

1439
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:24,400
to ask me these kind of questions.

1440
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:29,485

all go fuck yourselves.
